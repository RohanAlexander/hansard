Surely the honourable member is not ashamed of his publicly announced opinions on Canberra. that the honourable member aud a majority of the members of the Committee are opposed to Canberra. the view they take; but this House by an overwhelming majority takes a different view, and has decided that Canberra must be established as the Pederal Capital. This is not a party question, and I appeal to honourable members on both sides, constituting a majority in this House, to see that their opinion is not flouted by the acceptance of this report from a Committee that loses no opportunity to block the progress of Canberra nud prevent its development. ceptance of the motion will strike a death blow at the establishment of the Capital at Canberra.

Honourable members from New South Wales would bave difficulty in explaining their action to their constituents. I intend to vote against the motion that the report be printed, so that the Committee may be given an opportunity to reconsider the whole matter, and to bring in a report on lines consistent with the proper development of the Federal Capital Territory. I accept the challenge of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) to say what is in the Committee's report. has probably told him before this what the report contains. honourable member for Dalley is no prophet when be talks of the Committee haying turned down the Yass-Canberra railway project. They have turned it down, and that without much apparent reason. to speak, now that the report has been presented to the House. regret that the Public ""Works Committee, by a majority decision, has decided not to provide for that needed connection with the Capital of the Commonwealth. port? are not allowed; if they were I would have submitted one. The Committee were asked to inquire into the question of a railway connection between Yass and Canberra. After a good deal of investigation, a majority of members decided that the existing railway would suffice, a bridge across the Mtolonglo, and with a station beyond the civic centre. would go a very short distance beyond the civic centre, and would be a dead-end railway. Whilst that would not inconvenience persons travelling from New South Wales or Queensland to the Capital, those who would come from Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would be put to considerable inconvenience. It is indeed regrettable that a Committee charged with the responsibility of giving the Capital a proper railway system should have failed so lamentably. The very members of the Committee who have refused, on the score of economy, to do something that would establish the Capital on right lines for further development, are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in the erection of houses and buildings. Notwithstanding the opposition of the majority of members of the Public Works Committee, this railway line will be built. But their action will delay matters, as it will take a certain time to refer the question to them again. The Committee's action will probably prevent the completion of the line coincidently Avith the transfer of Parliament to Canberra. Honourable members and their constituents, as well as others who may have business dealings at the Federal Capital, will probably suffer considerable inconvenience because of the short-sighted policy of the Committee in reporting against this railway. Downs-Attorney-General) [3.18] I am I thought so. sorry that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has taken this action, as it places the House in an unI very much fortunate position. The Public Works Committee, in this case, has followed the usual procedure. A matter has been referred to them for investigation, and, after making inquiries, they have presented their report to Parliament. The next step in the procedure is laid down .in the Act which constituted the Committee. The honourable member has asked members of this House to come to a decision on a report which tbey cannot see until it has been printed and circulated. At all times I have advocated the establishment of the Seat of Government at Canberra at as early a date as possible, and have urged that it should be made easily accessible from all parts of AusThe railway tralia. The honourable member has taken an unfortunate step. The printing of the report will not commit members to the acceptance of one word in it. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM The honourable member would force other members to give a vote on which a wrong construction might be placed.

The statement of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) in regard to the contents of this report may be true, but as the report is not yet available to honourable members, they have not had an opportunity of learning its contents. I claim to be as enthusiastic an advocate of Canberra as is the honourable member for Dalley or any honourable member associated with h i m , but I think the what the report contains before ex pressing an opinion upon it . the report is printed and distributed honourable members cannot familiarize themselves document which I saw handed up by the Clerk appears to be in print. If that is so, all we have to do is to formally pass the motion that it be printed, and allow the report to be circulated as quickly as possible, so that honourable members may master its contents and judge whether they should accept or reject its recommendations. The Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) seemed to suggest that the honourable member for Dalley is not doing his duty as a representative of the people, but the honourable member has been in formed of the contents of this report. it is not necessary for the honourable member for Dalley to tell us that there are members of the Public Works Committee who would move heaven and earth to prevent Parliament meeting at Canberra. Sir ELLIOT not bound to accept the conclusions of the Committee. seems very anxious to do some whitewashing. I advise him to assist in preventing the printing and circulation of a report which is hostile to the intention of this House. Unfortunately the House has got into a lax way of doing its business; members should give more attention fcu> procedure. Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON I rise to a point o? order. The honourable member is entitled to say that the Government is conducting the business of the Housei n a The printing of the loose way, but he is not in order in reflecting upon the House by saying that itb conduct of the business is lax. orable member is sound. It is an i m memorial rule that members shall not reflect upon the statutes of the House or upon the House itself, and I ask the honourable member for East Sydney to observe that rule. there are obstacles in the way of a member who wishes to speak the truth . Once this report is printed and circulated, it House is entitled to know will be very difficult to have its recomr mendations reversed. to accept the report, bu t only to order it to be printed. printed it cannot be withdrawn, and it will be difficult to reverse its recommendations. A hostile Committee ' can seriously nrejudice a project, and in this matter the anti-Canberra members of the Committee have carried their opposition to extremes. The nature and contents of this report having been brought under notice, I hope the House will adopt some method for annulling its recommendations, and will again refer the matter to a Committee composed of gentlemen who are not hostile to the Federal Capital project, and will find justly upon the evidence submitted. I am opposed to the printing of this reI am not a detective, but port because the opinion of the minority is not stated. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Swan( Mr : Gregory) has said, this is a one-sided report, and when it is printed, the damage will have been done because it will tee. The fact that the opinion of the minority is ignored will not be understood. I believe that at the next general election three, if not four, of the present members of the Committee, the majority of whom are opposed to Canberra, will not be re-elected to this Parliament; therefore any delay in dealing with this report will be favorable to the desire of the people that the Federal Capital shall be established and occupied as soon as possible. Time was when the minority of any Committee could 'table its report in opposition to the views of the majority, and I have yet to learn that",14,Committee S Report

48,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.29],"the House of Commons upon the practice of which, the procedure of this House is modelled, no longer allows a minority report to be submitted. will not come before us again u n t i l the Government decides to proceed with the construction of the railway. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) has clearly shown that it would be a farce to construct only that portion recommended by the Committee, because, it would not enable honourable members to get readily to the Capital. Canberra was chosen as the Capital site as the result of the most extensive political leg-pulling that I have witnessed during my 35 years' parliamentary experience. I was opposed to that site and wanted to have the Capital established at Dalgety, which possesses an unlimited water supply for power and other purposes. However, by the vote of tbe representatives of the people of Australia, that site was chosen, and the Public Works Committee w ill not be doing its duty if it does not recommend the building of a railway which will be ofuse to those who have to visit the Capital. build the railway. recommend its construction. friend surely does not think that I am such a silly fool as to suggest that the Committee can build a railway. Why, then does he interject in that, absurd way ? He has shown us the quality of his work on this Committee-if his constituents are satisfied with that, let him rest content. I shall certainly oppose the motion on the principle that the minority should be given an opportunity to express its opinion. appears to me a most extraordinary thing that honourable members should commit themselves by their speeches before they have had an opportunity to consider the report. I say advisedly that the time is coming when honourable members will be rather chary of accepting appointment to a Committee of this description if their recommendations to the House are to be challenged in this manner. The statements that have been made in regard to this matter are the most disreputable that I have heard in any Parliament. I do not know whether the honourable memfor Dalley( Mr Mahony) is a paranoic, or what sort of imagination he has. This is not the first time that he has made suggestions about me absolutely without any justification. The honourable, member has This matter sat with me on this Committee. Can he point to a single occasion when I did nob t r y to do my duty ? Did he not, on . the other hand, in Perth, say how pleased he was with my efforts to see that every opinion represented on the Committee was treated justly and fairly? The motion is, "" That the report be printed."" We know what the ordinary procedure, is. I had no desire, as the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) knows, to be on this Committee.

I have a copy of the report, and I can assure the House that the ultimate decision of the Committee was arrived at unanimously. If the report is printed it will be distributed among members, and in accordance with the provisions of the Statute dealing with the matter, the Minister for Works( Mr. Stewart) will subsequently ask the House to give effect to the report. having read the report, honourable members are satisfied that so much bias haa actuated the members of the Committee that they have made a recommendation contrary to the evidence, but in accordance with their private wishes, another Committee should be appointed. If the House were to approve of the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Dalley, and the honourable member for Darling, I would not have any association with the Committee for .another hour. This sort of thing is most reprehensible, and the aspersions cast on us have no justification, and are not fair. Presumably the honourable member for Dalley considers that if he continues to throw mud some of it is bound to stick. We on this side do not play that game. mittee proves the truth of what I say. All we want is to have it printed so that in the ordinary course the Minister can bring it before Parliament, when it will be for Parliament to decide what action shall be taken. The honourable member for Dalley ought to know that no work exceeding in cost £25,000 can be carried out without first being submitted to the Public Works Committee. If he is not satisfied with the way in which the Committee does its work, he can move that the Committee does not possess the confidence of the House. It might then be possible to obtain the services of a Committee which would adopt a proposal favorable to the views of the honourable member for Darling, and the honourable member for Dalley.

I desire to take this opportunity of informing honourable members of the entire success which has attended the efforts of the Commonwealth and State authorities, in co-operation; and of announcing that the disease has been completely stamped out and quarantine restrictions lifted. the outbreak of rinderpest, towards the end of last year, a proclamation was issued under the Quarantine Act prohibiting the removal of any animal, carcass, fodder or fittings fro m the State of Western Australia to any part of the Commonwealth unless the consent of the Minister was obtained. The aotion taken to prevent the spread of the disease included the quarantining of the district within 30 miles of the infected area, and the clearing of a belt 5 miles wide on the border of this area by driving all stock inwards. All movement of stock within the area was prohibited. Every animal within 2 miles of any in fected farm was seen and reported on by a special patrol under the supervision of a veterinary inspector, and reports were made on every sick animal outside the quarantined area by a vigilance committee and by the police. A mobile inspection staff was maintained for rapid diagnosis in connection with such reports. All animals, except horses, within 1 mile of the infected premises were slaughtered, and the carcasses were buried. precautions, together with the prohibition of the removal of any animal, carcass, fodder or fittings from the State or to any other part of the State were strictly maintained. From the 29th January a steady reduction of the quarantined area took place each fortnight, and on the 20th March all quarantine restrictions-bot h within Western Australia and in relation to traffic and goods leaving Western Austialia-were removed. No developments have occurred since that date, and the Commonwealth can therefore be considered as having been entirely free from rinderpest since the 18th December, 1923. I am sure that this announcement w ill give great satisfaction to honourable members. USE OF WHITE LEAD. from the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), an intimation ""„hat he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public business, namely, "" The failure of the Commonwealth Government to take steps to deal with the serious menace to public health caused On by the unrestricted and unregulated use of white lead in industy in Australia, and other matters relating thereto."" Vive honourable members having risen in their placesQuestion proposed. no apology for moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this most important question, as a motion for the adjournment is the only means afforded a private member of directing public attention tb an important matter. In my opinion, anything that affects national health or industrial hygiene overshadows in importance any other matter that may from time to time be submitted to this House. All the members of the Labour party take up that attitude. This Parliament has discussed recently several questions affecting national health contained in the reports of Sir Neville Howse. The Commonwealth Government is directly concerned with the effect of white lead on public health, and must accept its f u l l These share of responsibility for neglecting to protect it . Honourable members may ask in what way the Commonwealth Government is concerned. The subject was discussed at the International Labour Conference held at Genevai n 1921, at which Australia had her f u l l representation allowable under Article 380 of the Treaty of Versailles. Two Government delegates, an employers' delegate, and a workers' delegate participated in those proceedings on behalf of Australia. The discussion wbich then took place about the effect upon health of using white lead was of supreme importance. It occupied several days, and was, at times, of",18,Agents At Austral Ia House

The Conference ultimately agreed on a d r a ft convention, but not before several divisions had taken place. lize that, with one exception, the whole of the workers' delegates from every country represented at that Conference favoured the absolute prohibition of the use of white lead in industry. sentient, was the Australian workers' delegate, Mr T. B . Merry, who, I feel competent to say, did not truly represent the organized workers of Australia. The Conference compromised by agreeing that the use of white lead inpainting should be restricted, and that regulations should be framed to' control its use. This was adopted unanimously in the for m of a draft convention, and the Australian representatives unanimously voted for it . The Treaty of Versailles, under the terms of which . these International Labour Conferences are held, provides that such conventions shall be ratified, or at least considered, by the Parliaments of the countries represented at the conferences. The convention to which I am directing attention is a somewhat lengthy document. It provides foT the prohibition of the use of white lead and sulphate of lead in internal painting.

The draft convention is as follows:Article 1. Bach member of the International Labour Organization ratifying the present Convention undertakes to prohibit, with the exceptions provided for in Article 2, the use of white lead and sulphate of lead and of all products containing these pigments, in the internal painting of buildings, except where the use of white lead or sulphate of lead or products containing these pigments is considered necessary for railway stations or industrial establishments by the competent authority after consultation with the employers' and workers' organizations concerned. It shall nevertheless be permissible to use white pigments containing a maximum of 2 per cent, of lead expressed in terms of metallic lead. Mr Coleman. Article 2. The provisions of Article1 shall not apply to artistic painting or fine lining. The Governments shall define the limits of It is important for us to .reasueh forms of painting, and shall regulate the use of white lead, sulphate of lead, and all products containing these pigments, for these purposes in conformity with the provisions of Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the present Convention. The disArticle 3. The employment of males under eighteen years of age and of all females shall be prohibited in any painting work of an industrial character involving the use of white lead or sulphate of lead or other products containingthese pigments. The competent authorities shall have power, after consulting the employers' and workers' organizations concerned, to permit the employment of painters' apprentices in the work prohibited by the preceding paragraph, with a view to their education in their trade. Article 4. The prohibitions prescribed in Articles 1' and 3 shall come into force six years from thedate of the closure of the Third Session of the International Labour Conference. Article 5.

Article 7. Statistics with regard to lead poisoning among working painters shall be obtained :(a) As to morbidity-by notification and certification of all cases of lead poisoning. (b) As to mortality-by a method approved by the official statistical authority in each country. Article 8. The formal ratifications of this Convention under the conditions set forth in Part XIII . of the Treaty of Versailles and of the corresponding Parts of the other Treaties of Peace, shall be communicated to the Secretary General of the League of Nations for registration. Article 9. This Convention shall come into force at the date on which the ratifications of two members of the International Labour Organization have been registered by the Secretary-General. It shall be binding only upon those members whose ratifications have been registered with the Secretariat. Thereafter, the Convention shall come into force for any member at the date on which its ratification has been registered with the Secretariat. Article 10. As soon as the ratifications of two members of the International Labour Organization have been registered with the Secretariat, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations shall so notify all tbe members of the International Labour Organization. He shall likewise notify them of the registration of ratifications which may be communicated subsequently by other members of the Organization. Article 11. Each member which ratines this Convention agrees to bring the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and'7, into operation not later than 1st January, 1924, and to take such action as may be necessary to make these provisions effective. Article 12.

I have to-day dealt with the White Lead Convention because it is a matter which directly affects the well-being of Australian workers, and is a very live question in industry in this country at the present time. might very well be accused of cynical disregard of the health of operatives in the painting industry. I admit that we -the Labour party-d o not necessarily claim to be bound by International Labour Conferences any more than we will consent to be bound by Imperial and Economic Conferences, but we do maintain that Parliament should be given an opportunity to deliberate upon these matters, and to determine whether tbe proposals of the Conference are in the best interests of Australia. I contrast their inaction in this matter with the attitude of the Government in regard to trade matters and the work of the Imperial and Economic Conferences. They view the decisions of those Conferences as of supreme importance, and have, maintained, perhaps indirectly, that we are morally bound to adopt a l l that has been done at those Conferences. when it comes to a matter affecting the working class of Australia, a proposal of real live interest, dealing with the use of an article which is responsible for a large amount of sickness and mortality amongst painting operatives, its consideration is thrust aside. even give us an opportunity to express an opinion about it . This report and various other reports of our delegates to International Labour Conferences have been tabled in an obscure manner, and Parliament has never been given an opportunity to discuss them. On the other hand, time has been wasted in this Housei n the discussion of nebulous matters dealt w i th by the League of Nations, which lead us nowhere. trade rivalry, and Of course it may be said that owing strife. The failure of to the limitations of the Federal Constitution the present Government and its .predecessor were powerless to give effect to the Geneva Convention. In that case the Federal Government should have made its position in the matter perfectly clear long ago. That has not been done. Not only this I have made very exhaustive inquiries into the white lead question. From the perusal of HansardI have found that in South Australia Sir Henry Barwell, whilst Premier of the State, was asked' by a Labour member of the South Australian Parliament whether the Federal Government had advised him of the The Government Geneva Convention on the subject. H is answer was that it had not. A similar denial was made in Western Australia, and also in Queensland. This is a matter of live interest to the people who are represented in this and other Parliaments of Australia. Although the Federal Government may have no constitutional authority to legislate in regard to matters affecting health, and particularly in reference to the use of white lead, it is morally responsible to the International Labour Conference to see that its conventions are carried into effect by the various State Governments. If the State Governments will not take the necessary action it is for the Federal Government to in for m the International Labour Conference to that effect. Sof a r as I can gather, neither the present Federal Government nor its predecessor approached But the State Governments on these matters, and I shall be interested to hear, when the Minister replies, whether that assertion is correct or not. It is of no use for the Government to say that the use of white lead is not a menace to health. The mere fact of the Australian delegates voting for this International Convention proves conclusively that it is. I admit that in the report of Mr Bobinson, one of the Government delegates, it is implied that the effects of lead poisoning are exT h a t is my point. aggerated, and that the workers of the world are being fooled by the zinc in terests. Zinc oxide is supposed to be a substitute for white lead in paint, but opinions differ as to whether it is an",19,Formal Motio N Of Adjournment
84,Mr Scullin,The Government do not,22,Formal Motio N Of Adjournment
85,Mr Coleman,"effective substitute. Yet tbe fact remains that our delegates voted for the White Lead treated as a scrap of paper, and has never been discussed or deliberated upon. is a matter of very great importance to Australian industrialists. opinion throughout the world recognizes that plumbism or lead poisoning is a very serious menace to health. that the white lead industry in Australia is a very important one, but, after all, the health of the workers is on a much higher plane than the sordid question of commercial gain from the development of an industry, if that industry is likely to result in ill health to the persons engaged in it. That is the principle upon which we stand, and if the manufacture of white lead is recognized as a menace to health, it should be swept out of existence in this country. I am not saying now that it is a sufficient menace to health to j u s t if y prohibition at present, but I asking that the Government shall take steps to ensure that the health of painters shall be safeguarded by the adoption of this Convention, or by bringing about some regulation of the industry. Operative Painters Union of Australia asked me to bring this matter before Parliament, and I propose to quote from their letter to show that this is a live question, and is not something which I have.brought forward in a captious and insincere manner. The secretary to the Operative Painters Union writes to meThe restriction of the use of white lead in painting is of vital importance to my members, ns hundreds of them are suffering to-day from the evil effects of lead, and we as a union have found it necessary to incur considerable expense in the inquiry conducted by the New South Wales Board of Trade on this matter,. and also in the distribution of literature warning our members of the attendant dangers and the need for the utmost oare and hygiene in the course of their work. Our union would be glad if you would take the earliest opportunity of ventilating the subject on the floor of Parliament, as we consider the continued and unrestricted use of this deadly commodity a matter of national importance, nnd one which is responsible for great mortality. its use should be safeguarded? vention provides for its use under restrictive conditions, and proposes the prohibition of dry rubbing down, which is a menace to the lives of operative Convention, which has been painters mainly through inhalation. The Government have afforded us no opportunity to consider the convenThe use of white lead tion, w i th the result that Australia is lagging behind the rest of the world Medical in this matter. Practically every other country in the world has legislated in regard to the use of white lead. I I recognize am given to understand that India, Japan, South Africa, Brazil, Bulgaria, Spain, Switzerland, France, Germany, and even Tunis, a country occupied by coloured people, have adopted the Geneva Convention in regard to white lead, or legislated to restrict its use. In England, legislation has existed for many years past restricting the use of white lead in the painting industry, and steps have been taken to give f u l l effect to the Geneva Convention. I cabled the present Prime Minister( Mr Ramsay am Macdonald) on this subject some weeks ago, and have received the following replyYour telegram lead paint protection against The poisoning. Bill to carry out provisions of Convention has been introduced into Parliament, but not yet passed into law. Ramsay Macdonald. From that telegram it is evident that the Imperial Parliament, which generally lags behind us on questions of industrial hygiene, has taken steps to honour an international agreement by adopting the Geneva Convention. Australia lags behind the rest of the world in this matter. Articles 409 to 412 of the Versailles Treaty make provision for the International Labour Office to take cognizance of public or private complaints, either from a member State or an organization of employers or workmen. That complaint can be that another State is failing to give effect to its 'treaties and conventions. It certainly would be ludicrous if Japan, China, or Tunis were to lodge the complaint with the League of Nations or the International Labour Office that Australia is not treating her international obligations seriously, and is lagging behind them in this matter. NotD o they consider that only is the use of white lead involved; it is also a question whether or not the League of Nations is to be effective. I believe that at the League of Nations Conference treaties in connection",22,Formal Motio N Of Adjournment

That iproves that the Western AustraUan Government had not been acquainted by the Federal Government with the decisions of the Geneva Conference.

Geneva Convention-aske d the Board of Trade to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into this matter. In their report the Board of Trade saidVital statistics show that for every nineteen miners who die from lead poisoning in a series of years there are 22 painters who die from the same cause. They also show that whatever the degree of exposure in the case of the painter, the joint effects of exposure and toxity of the carbonate of lead dust make his position distinctly more sinister than that of the miner. This was the final conclusion of the BoardRegulation of the use of white lead in the painting industry is immediately necessary, both in the interest of painters and the community. The Board does not recommend either prohibition or restriction, but regulations may imply one or the other should further, study of the painters' circumstances prove it ultimately to be expedient or necessary. Two things must follow upon the adoption of a scheme of regulations: the prevalence of the disease must be progressively reduced in such a way as to give promise of its complete prevention, and meanwhile the damage caused must be measured, and all the victims of the disease, -without exception, must be adequately compensated. If regulations fail to produce either of these results they must give place to prohibition. In his speech, Our delegates to the Geneva Conference went there armed with that report, and, although they opposed the prohibition of the use of white lead, they ultimately agreed to the regulation. from the report of the Board of Trade the honourable member omitted to mention that the Board said, "" The case for prohibition, the Board agrees, is not made out."" page 736, of the Board of Trade's report is a table showing the excess of deaths from certain diseases among painters over the percentage among those in other callings: Cause ol Deaths'as'.ProporHon offall Deaths.

89,Mr Coleman,"E x h i b it No. 16,In the light of, those figures, we must conclude that thisis a serious matter. In spite of its seriousness and the recommendation of the New South Wales Board of Trade, nothing has been done to regulate the use of white lead in New South Wales. The Labour Government was removed from office before it could carry into effect the Board of Trade'srecommendations. There is another phase of this question to which I desire to draw attention: the opinions of medical experts such as D r . W. Gelman Thompson, and Drs. Kober and Hason, the authors of the work', Diseases of Occupation and Vocational Hygiene. There is also the evidence of Sir Thomas Oliver who represented the Australian Government at the -..Geneva Convention. I have already stated that many nations have taken steps to regulate the use of white lead. In England, the painters-bot h employers and journeymen -hav e agreed to the basis of the B ill now before the House of ' Commons to adopt the recommendations of the Geneva Conference. The Painters' Unioni n New South Wales consider this matter to be of such importance that they have issued a special pamphlet to the operatives engaged in the industry there, in which they point out the dangers arising from the use of white lead. They urge operatives to take the precaution of changing their clothes, washing carefully, and keeping their food and drink away from contact with white lead. vernment to honour its international obligation to the League of Nations, and Oflice, by giving this Parliament an opportunity to consider these questions as they arise, and also to refer them to the State Governments. vernments of the various States should fai l to introduce the necessary legislation we shall know where the responsibility lies. Like Mahomet's coffin, the matter is suspended between Heaven and earth. I object strongly to Australia spending thousands of pounds in being represented ab conferences if not one moment's consideration is to be given to the recommendations of those Conferences. I regret that I have had to condense my remarks on this important subject owing to the limitation imposed by the Standing Orders, and I also regret that more time is not available for its discussion by the many members desiring to speak, but I hope that the Minister will recognize..the importance of this question, and will give to this House a well-considered answer to the questions I have raised, so that not only the painters, but the people..qf Australia, as well as the League of Nations and the International Labour Office, may know exactly where Australia stands in regard to this matter, and that action will follow Downs-Attorney-General) [4.2 5 ] If o one can complain of the action of the honourable member in bringing this matter forward, nor of the manner in which he has presented his case to the Housg. He is correct in saying that the subject matter of the complaint is indeed ah important one. But, as I shall presently show, the question is a complicated one. This subject was set down for discussion at the Third International Labour Conference. Prior to that Conference the Commonwealth fulfilled its obligation 'respecting this matter, by getting into touch with all the States, and gathering all the information possible to be placed before that Conference. Dr. Cumpston, of the -Health Department, was -specially asked, to make a careful and complete-investigation so far as was possible.' In his report, he said,' --'< In my opinion, it must be concluded -that the evidence which is available is altogether insufficient to justify such a sweeping -change I ask the Goas is advocated by the International .Labour Conference. That is to say, prohibition. . Honprto the International Labour able members are aware that /large centres of population, such as BrokenH ill and Port Pirie, are largely, dependent on the lead industry, .and that AusI f the .Gotralia supplies a large proportion 'of 'the white lead used throughout the world. They are, therefore, conscious of the im portance of the industry to Australia, A t present, we know nothing.. and the serious effect prohibition would have. Dr. Cumpston. continuesThe evidence available, at least in Australia, certainly does not justify the total prohibition of white lead in painting. It may justify' certain measures of regulation in the"" nse of white lead, which, in my opinion, is very likely to be indicated by the evidence when the latter is fully marshalled; but it would only be possible to give a reasonable pronouncement on this aspect after careful and complete investigation of the whole evidence .which can be obtained. This would probably take from six to twelve months to collect and arrange, and might perhaps be entrusted to the Commonwealth Department of Health as a function of their",24,Table Showing Toe Painters The Excess Or Percentage Oe Deaths Due To Certain Diseases
90,Sir Littleton Groom,"(Darlingproposed .activities in the direction of industrial hygiene. In the meanwhile, if I might be allowed to suggest it, it would be desirable to inform the International Labour Conference that the evidence available is altogether insufficient to warrant the proposed sweeping reform, involving the total prohibition of the use of lead. Even the most advanced advocates of the control of lead, viz., the medical profession of Queensland, have placed it on record that the total prohibition of the use of white lead is unnecessary. A letter from the Premier of Western Australia was as follows: The Engineeir-in-Chief and the Prinoipal Architect of the Public Works Department are of the opinion that the injurious effects suffered the health and the well-being of the workers by members of the painting trade are only 'partly attributed to white lead, the greater part being ascribed' to the use of volatile oils, and they consider that a draft convention prohibiting the use of white lead in the painting trade should not be submitted to tbe Conference. .The Premier of Tasmania wroteI am of the opinion that prohibition should not be imposed on the use of white lead until research has definitely proved its injurious effects; and, from the economic point of view, until such time as proof is forthcoming that reliable substitutes are available. The Premier of South Australia stated that the Government could not, after the -inquiries made, see its way to support legislation to prohibit the use of white lead, as the evidence available did not warrant the interference w it h such an important industry. Wales Board of Trade, which conducted an inquiry at the request of the Government of that State, reported, after ""the examination of many witnesses, that neither restriction nor prohibition is necessary or desirable, but that proper regulations are sufficient. before the Geneva Conference made this recommendation. port was received by the Government and I am under the impression that it was sent on to our delegates after they had left for Geneva. tility to the use of white lead, would, if effect had been given to it , have been disastrous to certain industries in Australia. Our delegates said that they did not believe that a case had been made out for prohibition. Sir Thomas Oliver, the delegate of the Commonwealth Government, speaking at the Conference, said:Speaking as one of the Australian delegates, I am authorized to say that the Government -Of 'the Commonwealth of Australia is opposed to prohibition and restriction of lead in the matter under discussion It recognizes that the health of the workers must be a first consideration, and it will welcome and carry out loyally any recommendation or resolution which make for improving the conditions of labour and for safeguarding the health of the workers. The Labour delegate from Australia, Mr. Merry, a most conscientious and capable man, who did very fine service, saidOn the Commission I said openly and fairly I did not go behind any one's backI was opposed to prohibition, but I favoured regulation. I have heard nothing in this or the Conference to change my opinion. . . . I will give place to nobody in my desire to uphold of the world, let alone Australia. Mr Bobinson, another delegate, saidThe Government of Australia is opposed to either prohibition or restriction; it favours regulation. I desire to affirm that the first consideration of the Australian Government is the preservation of the life and health of the worker, and I say definitely that commercial considerations ""do not stand in the application of that policy in Australia. Australia's record in this direction, I am sure it will be admitted, has been equalled by few nations in the world. While we will not accept prohibition, either partial or complete, we will give our wholehearted support to any regulations which are shown to be necessary to safeguard the health and lives of the workers. But these regulations, be it understood, should cover the use of all paints, whatever may be their base. The New South Ultimately the French demand for a prohibition was defeated, and a convention was agreed to, our own delegates supporting it . Anybody who looks carefully into the evidence must admit that no case had been made out for prohibition, but there is a case for regulation, and for the consideration of this convention by the competent authorities. Even now investigation is proceeding in Australia. Many cases which were said to be due to lead poisoning have been found to be due to other causes. Past statistics were open to question. Scientific investigation' is now taking place in various countries, as is proper i h The continental hosconnexion with a matter affecting the health of the community. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) has discussed the action that should follow the adoration of the convention regarbSng white lead .

Does he not think that it would be in the best interests of the people to again admit shovels free Of duty? 1. Under the Tariff, shovels are dutiable at 35 per cent. (United Kingdom) and 45 per cent. (General Tariff) as manufactures of metal not elsewhere included. Up to August, 1919, they were admitted under a by-law made by the Minister at 10 per cent, if of foreign origin and free if from United Kingdom. 2. They were removed from the tools of trade list on 30th August, 1919, and then became dutiable according to the Tariff rates. 3. The by-law including shovels under item 219 of the Tariff was rescinded on 30th August, 1919. 4. The ordinary Tariff rate then applied, viz., 30 per cent. (British) and 35 per cent. (General). These rates were raised in the 1921 Tariff to 35 per cent, and 45 per cent. (Tariff item 208). 5. Shovels were dutiable under the Tariff as framed. The Minister (under the Customs Tariff 1902, and again under the Customs Tariff 1908-11) included them in a list of tools to be admitted under by-law for the reason that they were hot made in Australia. When, and because, information was brought under notice that Australian manufacture was established, the Minister removed them i r om the list and duty was charged as intended by Parliament. 6. Three. 7. Fifteen. 8. The official statistics do not record shovels imported. Since 1922-23 inclusive, "" Shovels and Spades"" have been recorded, but the importations of shovels alone cannot be ascertained. 9. Approximately-Yea r 1921, 23,320; year 1922, 19,480; year 1923, 18,800 in number. 10. The intention of the Tariff is to foster manufacture in Australia, and shovels can be and are being made here, and it is considered that the manufacturer is entitled to protection from goods produced under cheaper labour conditions. The quality of the Australian shovel is such that considerable orders are obtained there for from some of the State Railways Commissioners.",33,Still In Existence

Our financial position is such that we should mark time for some years. certainly should not launch out on heavy expenditure at the present time. I know nothing that is likely to attract a population to Canberra within the next fifteen years: climate. MrM c NEILL is very good in summer, but extremely cold. in. winter. However,. I am not saying anything against the site at all. Rightly or wrongly Canberra has been selected as the Seat of Government, and we must abide by the decision. We are from 30 to 50 years ahead of our time. The Government cannot very well at this stage drop the B ill , but I think it would have been wise had it decided to delay proceeding with the measure u n t i l Canberra was actually the. Seat of Government. We are not justified in appointing a Commission at present. The( Mr Bayley) The Committee has agreed' to the appointment of a Commission. The question is whether there shall be one Commissioner or three. MrM c NEILL now discussing whether there shall be a Commission of one member or of one f u l l time and two casual members. I cannot conceive of any two gentlemen capable of filling accepting casual appointments. qualified men should be appointed, and I do not believe that such men wil l sacrifice their present positions to undertake casual work. A Commission is unnecessary, but if it is to be appointed it certainly should consist of one Commissioner only. amendment has been moved to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite, who say that they favour one Commissioner rather than three. I hope, however, that the Committee will yet show its wisdom by refusing to agree to Commission -control of Canberra. If it votes against the clause, it will k ill the B ill , and that is the best thing that could happen. A number of honourable members have not expressed their honest beliefs in this debate. The honourable memstated that we are 50 years ahead of our time. I have looked up the debates which occurred in this House a few years ago, when the Minister then administerWe ing Canberra affairs sought for authority to proceed with additional sewerage work there. Tbe honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) voted against anything being done, and similar action was taken by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell), who said last Friday 'that, as the House had decided upon the appointI believe the climate ment of a Commission, he would vote for the clause. A few years ago he voted against any work being done, notwithstanding that the decision had been made long before to proceed with the construction of Canberra. He was not then prepared to accept the view of the majority. He is inconsistent. On that occasion the Minister, speaking' in favour of the continuation of the work, said that the additional sewerage provision proposed would serve the city for the next 50 years. The present Postmaster-General( Mr. Gibson) interjected, "" For the next 200 years."" Yet to-day he is a member of a hand to three Commissioners its responsibility for work which, in his opinion, will not be necessary for 200 years. I protest against the lack of sinI realize that we are cerity in this debate. Honourable members with views such as those to which I have referred will not be doing the fair thing to the taxpayers if they support the B ill . I shall not enlarge upon my prethe position of Commissioner viously expressed opinion that Canberra Only will be a "" d u d "" city, but I must remark that it will have no means of support apart from revenues which the Commonwealth Government obtains from other sources. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) on Friday supported this B ill with considerable vigour, because he said that it would make for efficiency. TheB ill was also supported by tbe honourable member for Barker( MrM . Cameron) and the honourable member for Boothby( M t . Duncan Hughes). I wish to draw the attention of those honourable members to a leading article which appeared in tbe Adelaide Register on tbe 13th May. That newspaper, as a rule, enunciates the policy and creates the opinion of the section of electors represented by those honourable members. The article indicates clearly that in supporting this B ill those",40,Lands Acquisition Bill

The Register is opposed to the proposal of the Government to give the control of Canberra to a Commission. Australian supporters of the Government ? They should be here. hear my remarks, and |also what ;the Register has to say on the subject. The quotation is as follows:The month's adjournment of the Federal Parliament enabled opposition to develop to the foolish proposal of the Government to control the Federal Capital by a permanent commission, and when the debate on the second reading of the Seat of Government (Administration) ""Bill was resumed on Thursday, the measure was subjected to heavy criticism from both sides of the House. The main objections to the project have already been stated in the Register. Chief among them is the fact that the Bill represents a continuation-in deed, an extension-of the pernicious system of handing over the business of Government to commissions which are only remotely responsible to Parliament, which involve the creation of additional billets, and which, being mistake if they vote in favour of handlargely independent of the Minister, may be used by him as a means of evading responsibility for extravagance and inefficiency. I emphasize the point that, in the opinion of the Register, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) w ill not be supporting economical administration if he votes for this clause. He should give heed to the remarks of that journal, for it is the mouth piece of the organization to which he belongs. It states in unmistakable terms that Commission control means inefficient control. The Register article continuesWhat happened in connection with the War Service Homes Commission is well and unfavorably known to the public, yet the Government proposes to clothe the Canberra Commission with even greater authority than that enjoyed and misused by the former body-the power, for instance, to raise, loans for unlimited amounts. Not only are the principles of the Bill bad, but the Minister for Works, in introducing it, gave ample reasons why the creation of a new and expensive administrative body was entirely unnecessary, the work, as Mr Stewart, candidly admitted, already being efficiently performed, under Ministerial superopposite. Earlyi n the discussion a number vision, by the Advisory Committee and the officers of the public Departments. The concluding sentence is as follows: The Bruce-Page Government will be well admembers. vised to drop the Seat of Government Bill, altogether to Commission control. We have and continue the system of departmental construction, which has admittedly worked well. That indictment of Commission control should cause the South Australian representatives in this Chamber to whom I W h e r e are the South bave referred, to reconsider their position. They have the opportunity to do so while this clause is before the Committee. I remind them that the RegisterI would prefer them to is a maker of public opinion, and the creator, in the main, of conservative policy in South Australia. They w ill be failing in their duty if they disregard its opinions. They should accept the smaller of two evils, and vote for the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and, later, they should vote against the clause. The effect of such a vote would be to destroy the B ill . Those honourable gentlemen bave not supported their expressed opinions w i th very logical arguments. They said that a Commission would be efficient, and that the mistakes of. past Commissions would not be repeated; but we have no assurance whatever that that will be so. They w ill be making a serious ing over the responsibilities of Parliament to a Commission of one, two, or three members, which w ill not be amenable to tbe w ill of Parliament, and which will be only partially under the authority of the Minister. I hope that we shall shoulder the responsibility we bear to the taxpayers of Australia, and retain parliamentary administration of the Federal Capital Territory.. do not feel content to observe in silence the subordination, at the expense of conviction and consistency, which has been shown during this debate by followers of the composite Ministry. I say "" followers"" advisedly, because those honourable members appear to have neither the quality nor the capacity to form an opinion of their own. If they have that power, it is quite evident that they have not the courage to advocate opinions so formed.

No greater measure of uniformity has been shown, nor.has there ever been such an illustration of the control exercised over individual members of Parliament by their parties,than that displayed on this occasion. not been so successful in securing uniformity as has the Leader of the honourable member's party. has been shown is aptly illustrated by the actions of the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), who has just interjected. honourable members opposite who a few days ago were against the appointment of three Commissioners, and even, in some cases, against the appointment of any Commission, are prepared now to support the Government. bers who held decided views are now required to throw consistency to the wind and support the Government. Honourable members opposite must do as they are told, and they are now prepared to adopt an attitude which is not in keeping with the views which they previously expressed. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr bers to administer affairs at Canberra Mackay) definitely said that he would vote against the appointment uf a Commission of three members, but, with other honourable members opposite, I have no doubt that he will be found supporting the Government proposal, and we shall know whether they are influenced by a desire to serve the interests of the Government or those of Australia. direct attention to the important fact that the day-labour system has been in operation at Canberra, to the disadvantage of the private friends of honourable members on the Government side. They wish to .change that system which has been operated so successfully, but they wish also to be in a position to put the responsibility for the change on the new administration of Canberra to be undertaken by the Commission. The history of thc operations of the War Service Homes Commission is not very far behind us, and it shows that publio interests were subordinated to those of private con[33] tractors, who waxed f a t upon the opportunities afforded them by the Commission in connection, not only with the building of War Service Homes, but also with the disposal of the various stocks of material held by the Commission. The Commonwealth has suffered heavy losses as a result of opportunities provided for profit-making by contractors and others associated with the building trade. The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) was called upon to set right the mistakes made by the War Service Homes Commission, and yet, although he is the one man who should be best able to appreciate how very desirable it is to prevent responsiT h e inconsistency that bility for public works being placed in tbe hands of a Commission, he now advocates handing over the responsibility of this Parliament for the construction It is remarkable that of the Federal Capital to such a body. Let us hopo that, even at this eleventh hour, the honourable gentleman and those supporting him will recognize that this proposal will not lead to true economy, and will not save Australia from becomThose honourable meming a prey to greedy, selfish, and unscrupulous contractors, whose existence in this community has been amply demonstrated by the history of the operations of the War Service Homes Commission. I should like to ask the Minister whether he believes that the appointment of a Commission of either one or three memwill in any way relieve the responsible officers of his Department now carrying on work in the Federal Capital Temtory. One of the Minister's strongest arguments in support of this proposal has been that it will meet serious difficulties at present existing in the Department over which he presides. There is no one I who stands higher in that Department than the Director-General of Works, Colonel Owen. He is a most efficient officer, whose work is entitled to our unstinted praise; but w ill the appointment of a Commission to administer affairs at Canberra relieve this officer of his duties in the Territory? It will not. Colonel Owen will need to be on the spot to continue his supervision of building operations at Canberra? W ill the appointment of the Commission relieve Mr. Goodwin, the Surveyor-General? I am sure that it will not; nor will it relieve any other official of equal standing at present engaged at Canberra.

It is evident that members on the other atside are determined to have a Commission. I do not agree with them, but if a Commission is to be appointed, it should consist of one member only. I have taken an active part in the estaband obligalishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra, and have come in personal contact with the men in charge there. They are serving their country well. That being The expendiso, why is this measure now introduced ?

144,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.50],"real question. remarks was that a mistake having been made, it must be perpetuated, however great the cost to the people of Australia. You, Mr Chairman, know as well as I do that even if a Commission is appointed, the real persons in control will be those officers who up to date have carried out tbe work at Canberra so faithfull y and well. The professional men who have been in control of this work in the past would still remain in control if a Commission were appointed. of the House. appointed, would act solely on the advice of their professional officers, in the same way as the directors pf a bank adopt the recommendations of their managers. The action contemplated by the Government would be an injustice to men who have put their heart and soul into this workmen who desire to leave behind them a monument to their ability and foresight. I place these men in the same category as those responsible for the construction of the Assouan Dam and the Panama Canal. The foundation of the Federal Capital has been well laid, and it now remains only for the super-structure to be erected thereon. Are we to pay £7,000 a year to Commissioners, and salaries to messengers, and typists, and incur other huge expenses, merely to have a Commission to finish work so well commenced? The people of Australia should be proud of the Labour party, because by their criticism they have compelled the Ministry to acknowledge that it has made an error. If greater efficiency were to result from the increased expenditure, I would not call the extra cost extravagance, but as that will not be the case, I am justified in asking honourable members on the otlier side to assist in defeating this measure. It should not be made a party matter. When the Labour party was in power in 1910-13 they were neither so blind, nor so stupid, as to think that no one outside that party knew anything. They accepted suggestions from any quarter, so long as they were in the best interests of the' country. matter we are asking only that the best thing for Australia should be done. The Opposition, by its criticism in the present and preceding Parliaments, has saved the country millions of pounds, nnd The substance of their honourable members should not withhold their support from proposals which emanate from this side simply for fear that those proposals may reflect credit upon us at the next general election. They should consider their duty as representative men, and place the interests of the country before those of their party. In advocating the appointment of one Commissioner we have-no particular candidate in mind. I believe that one military gentleman, who has had a succession of public appointments eversince the conclusion of the war, is at present out of employment. I [Quorum formed.] do not know whether .anybody has h i m The Commissioners, if in mind for a seat on the Commission. If a Commission of three men is appointed, the present professional officers of the Works and Eailways and Home and Territories Departments w ill have lo lay the'ir proposals before the Commission for endorsement; and what a humiliating position they w ill occupy if theirrecommendations and advice are set aside by a body of laymen! If the Government had found that the work at the Federal Capital was badly managed and required supervision by a responsible body of professional men, there might be some justification for the creation of a Commission. But the good work clone by the existing departmental officers is admitted by the Government. Therefore, this Commission w ill involve an unnecessary expenditure of money, with no prospect of better results being achieved. As one who was for many years a contractor and a sanitary engineer, I inspected very carefully the work done at Canberra, and I was satisfied that it could not have been done better. Moreover, I found all the officers and men animated by a fine spirit; they desire their work at Canberra to beia monument to them. The pioneering work of the new city has been done, and the casting aside of the existing officers at the eleventh hour w ill be a cruel wrong. Are honourable members opposite so lacking in humanity as to be unable to realize the in j u r y they are doing to a fine set of officers? I should not be discharging Andi n this the trust reposed in me by the electors if I did not protest against such an injustice to those men and to the Australian people at large. Having regard to the manifold duties to",44,Government By Commission
145,Mr Gabb,I call attention to the state,45,Government By Commission
146,Mr West,,45,Government By Commission
147,Mr Hurry (Bendigo) [6.12],"be performed by tbe Commission, it seems to me that it w ill be impossible to find any one Commissioner qualified to control so many diversified operations. Clause 14 includes, amongst tbe powers of tbe Commission, tbe control and management of Crown lands, tbe levying and collection of rates upon land, tbe construction, maintenance, and operation of tramways-wbic b Ave hope w ill be a big work in the future, when a settled population has been established there-the construction aud control of roads, bridges, culverts, levees, sewers, drains, and watercourses, the provision of gas, electricity, water, and sewerage-thes e are works which are usually controlled by a Board-the protection of public health, the construction of all works and buildings, and generally the municipal government of the Territory. they have to arrange for the financial dealings of the whole of the Capital Territory, and the raising of loans for the carrying on of necessary works. Details of that nature are too cumbersome to entrust to one man. possible to obtain the services of a man possessing the necessary qualifications to carry out the whole of those duties. the one hand, Parliament would be delegating far too much authority to one officer; and on the other hand, from the point of view of the man selected, it would be unfair to expect any one man to accept so great a responsibility. For that reason I favour the appointment of a Commission of more than one member, and shall vote to have three Commissioners. This clause is the kernel of the B ill , and if it were cut out there would be no serious objection on the part of the Opposition to the remaining provisions. It is strang'e that the Government, certain members of which a little while ago professed to be very enamoured of the idea of economy, should now contemplate what we consider to be useless and unnecessary expenditure in the appointment of this Commission. on this side have always contended that the Home and Territories Department and the Works and Railways Department are quite capable of carrying on this work. Anything that might not be considered to come within the purview of those two Departments could be delegated to some other body without incurring very great expense. I think it is generally acknowledged that excellent work has been done by these Departments. The officers and Ministers have been eulogized, and every one has agreed that that eulogy has been well deserved. The only persons who propose to pass what amounts toa vote of censure upon the Departments, are the Ministers and the members of the Government. Those who, a little while ago, preached economy, are not now willing to practise it . It is said, of course, that this work has become so great that it cannot be continued by Ministers, or by the . Departments. I remind members of tbe Government, however, that during the last Parliament consideration was given to the appointment of a Public Service Board to deal not only with promotions, punishment, I h addition, transfers, and matters of that description in the Public Service, but also to do a great deal of other work, such as devising better methods of calling for and accepting tenders, supervising various works, and undertaking other duties, the ramifiI t would not be oations of which extend not over a small area like Canberra, but over the whole of Australia. Quite a number of honourable On members opposite, some of whom to-day are Ministers of the Crown, contended in those days that one man should be quite competent to undertake the whole of that work. Now they say there must be three commissioners to carry out work of much less magnitude. When objection is taken to that they make what is called a compromise. They say, "" We must have one commissioner at £ 3 , 0 0 0 a. year, and two others to act in an advisory capacity, these two being entitled to draw fees up to £2,000 a year."" The position in which this compromise w ill place the people of Australia will be much worse than we should have had if the original intention had been adhered to. I cannot understand how those honourable members opposite, who previously would not agree to the appointment of three commissioners, can now say that in the public interest they will accept one com""We missioner and two advisory commissioners. The adoption of that proposal will run Australia into as great an expense as would the appointment of three Commissioners, who would be asked and expected to devote the whole of their time to the service of the Commonwealth. It appears to me that this new proposal is as extravagant as the original one, and",45,Government By Commission
148,Mr F. Mcdonald (Barton) [6.16],"that Australia will lose a good deal by it . Human nature, being what it is, it almost assuredly persons advisory ' capacity will sit each year until they have drawn £2,000. position of those honourable members opposite who formerly would not agree to the appointment of three Commissioners, is a most remarkable one, and one wbich, I think, needs some explanation. The honourable member for Bendigo( MrH u r r y ) detailed the duties that are to be allotted to the Commission in order to show the onerous nature of the work that is to be entrusted to it . Reading this amazing B ill , it will be seen that a very great array of duties is to be performed by the Commissioners. Some people, reading the list of those duties, may say, ' ' You will need more than one ordinary human being to carry out these duties. If you cannot have three, you must have one extraordinary man assisted by two others acting in an advisory capacity."" But, after all, many of the duties that are enumerated could very well be performed for many years .by the officers who are now permanently employed in the Departments of the Commonwealth. There, again, I join issue with my friends opposite. Not so long ago we heard a good deal from them about the duplication of State and Federal Departments. I ask the Minister( Mr Stewart), seeing that we have a Health Department, why could he not find it convenient to take from that Department an officer or officers who would give advice relating to the protection of public health and the maintenance of sanitation at Canberra? necessary to appoint a Commission to see that that is done? Is not that duplication of work and of Departments ? The same argument applies to practically the whole of the other duties set out. The public w ill want to know why, when we have a Works Department, it is suddenly found necessary to form a new branch to carry out work which should be performed by the Works Department. No matter how earnestly we may desire to see Canberra the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, we cannot disregard the fact that this proposal means unnecessary expenditure. I yield to no one in my desire to see the national Capital built at Canberra. moved some little time ago by the honourable member, for Dalley( Mr Mahony). I did not consider it to be a motion bindmeans that these ing upon the next Parliament, or upon who are to act in an the Governor General, to whom it was sent. HadI thought at the time that, The. in order to carry out tbe terms of the motion, it would be necessary to go to the extravagance of appointing this Commission, I certainly would have given long and serious consideration to the matter before casting a vote in its favour. Although, we wish the compact with New South Wales to be honoured, the rate at which work has been proceeding at Canberra is very satisfactory; and even though a delay of six, nine, or twelve months might be necessary for the sake of economy, I do not think a single person in New South Wales would grumble, much as the people of that State desire to see Canberra established. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. MrF . M c DONALD I now desire to direct attention to certain remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. I have no desire to do the honourable member an injustice, but as I was not in the House when he spoke I have to depend on the newspaper report of his speech. In the course of his remarks the honourable member declared that any waste that had occurred in adminstration at Canberra had been during the Labour regime. Of course, if he gives me his assurance that he was incorrectly reported, I shall have no more to say. Isi t correct. ber cannot substantiate his statement. MrF M c DONALD As my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has remarked, the honourable member for Wakefield is not in a. position to substantiate his statement in regard to any waste. I know of no great scandals due to faults in administration at the Federal Capital. The great foundation work which was done there by a former Labour Government stands a monument to its credit.

The Chairman of the Commission will simply have to supervise the work, and, under the B ill , he will have two other Commissioners to assist him. I consider that £1,500 a year would be quite a sufficient salary. Why should we pay him £3,000 a year when the salary of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is a much less sum?

I have recently visited Canberra, and in consequence of inquiries I made, I think that what the Minister proposes to do now is just what should not be done. ILR knows very well that the actual sewerage work at Canberra is costing only one-third of the total outlay, tbe other two-thirds being accounted for by heavy over&ead charges caused by the payment of high salaries to officers, and it is now proposed to increase the highly paid appointments. Tbe cost of various works at Canberra has been enormously increased, not because of the way the men work, nor because of in efficient machinery, but because of the high salaries paid to officials. In Fremantle, a progressive city engineer is employed, and he supervises the whole of the work of that important municipality at a salary of £600 a year. I admit that for an officer having special qualifications -for instance, Sir John Monash, whose administrative capacity probably could not be equalled in Australia-it is necessary and desirable to pay a large salary; but the feeling throughout the Commonwealth is that while the States are in difficulties financially, the CommonCliapman, Austin wealth is paying enormous sums of money to men who do very little for it . The Government, have a capable officer stationed at Canberra who could satisfactorily superintend the work there. Nevertheless, I say without hesitation that brick houses at Canberra that bave cost £1,200 each, should have been built for £ 8 0 0 , and houses for which 25s. per week rent has been charged are not worth more than 15s. per week.

When the B ill was before us on a former occasion, many honourable members expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal to appoint a Board of three Commissioners, and the Government, in order to meet their wishes, framed an amendment which the Minister intends to submit.

Any body of men outside, if it had the opportunity, would smite the Government hip and thigh for its action. difficult to find three men in the community who would .agree to the proposal. The only appointment that need have been made was that of a Director of Worksi n the Territory at a salary of £2,000 per annum. We all are aware of the character of the Director-General of Works, the worry and trouble he has experienced over the establishment of the Federal Capital, and the extent to which he has brought his. abilities to bear upon the works that have been carried out there. Now he is to be supplanted by a Commission of three men, but he w ill still be their mentor and guide, for without him they w ill be able to do nothing. For this proposal of the Government there is some ulterior motive. Committee to follow the advice of the I leader of the Opposition so that money may be expended in the Federal Territory wisely, and the extravagance of creating an ornamental body, the probable personnel of which has not yet been disclosed, avoided.

GEEEN (Eichmond) [10.5] The purpose of the various amendments that have been submitted by honourable members opposite is to k ill the B ill , but the Committee has decided that I could go further in illustrating a Commission shall be established, and the Minister has agreed to appoint only one full-time Commissioner, and two other consulting Commissioners to be paid per sitting a fee to be prescribed. That wording is altogether too vague. The Minister gave the Committee no indication of what the probable expenditure in To"" play ducks and drakes "" fees will be. I suppose he can hardly estimate the number of sittings of the f u l l Commission, and no doubt the fee per sitting will depend upon the calibre and patriotism of those men who are chosen to act as consultants. I cannot support the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield which the Minister is prepared to accept. I ask h i m to either adhere to the l i m it of The £2,000 per annum for each of the two subordinate Commissioners, or to accept the proposal made by the Leader of the I do not know Opposition. Some maximum must be stipulated, otherwise Parliament will have no control over the amount to be paid in fees. If the fee were fixed at, say, £10 per d a y I am not suggesting this amount, but am using it as an illustration-and the Commission met twice weekly, each of the subordinate CommisI t would be sioners would receive about £1,000 per annum, but if the Commission met every day-whic h would mean f u l l timeeach would receive about £3,000 per annum. That is the amount the Chairman is to receive. A fee of £10 per sitting for a man of high professional capacity is not at all exorbitant if the Commonwealth is to receive tbe f u l l benefit of his knowledge and experience, but I appeal to the Minister to propose some limitation of the amount to be paid per annum to the part-time Commissioners. -Before a vote is taken, the Committee should thoroughly understand the position. The clause limits the amount I appeal to the payable to each junior Commissioner to £2,000 per annum. My amendment proposes to strike out the words "" of each,"" and thus fix the amount payable to the junior Commissioners at £2,000 for the two of them.

The opposition of honourable members on this side has been not to Canberra, but to the unnecessary expenditure of £7,000 a year on this Commission. That opposition proved effective to some extent, because a number of members on the Government side also began to feel uneasy. They evidently believed that the people of Australia would not countenance the proposal of the Government, and they told the Minister( Mr. I said that the ChairStewart) that they would expect him to meet them when the Committee stage of the B ill was reached. The Minister then came down with what purported to be a compromise to meet the objections raised The Government by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), and the 'honourable 1 member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). The impression which the Ministeri n tended to convey to the House and the country was that the cost of this Commission would not amount to £7,000 a year, as was originally proposed in the measure, but that he would agree to the appointment of one full-time Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners.

If we deal with the people's money in this loose manner, if we do not make some estimate of the cost of this Commission, the people will be quite justified in telling us that sioners' time will be required to discharge we are not fit to hold our positions. The Minister ought to be able to give us some idea of the duties that these part-time Commissioners will be required to carry out, and the approximate time that they will be occupied. ber could arrive at some estimate of the number of people likely to go to Canberra, and of the wealth of the city in future years, I possibly would be in a position to supply him with the information he desires. Lacking that estimate, no one can give him the details he seeks. Mr O'KEEFE -That furnishes a stronger reason for the acceptance by the Minister of the reasonable amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. much in some years, and too little in others. Mr O'KEEFE -The Bill, in its original form, was very loosely drawn. drawn. Mr O'KEEFE -The Minister brings down a proposal that the cost shall be £7,000 a year. He then accepts an amendment by the honourable member for* Wakefield, which means that the cost may exceed £7,000 a year. It is as well that the country should know that. The position is made so vague that the people of Australia are entitled to tell us that we do' not know what we are doing. Honourable members on this side must be absolved from any share of the blame if the Committee accepts the proposal of the Minister The honourable member for Denison( Mr will really be responsible for the number O'Keefe) was slightly in error when he said that I took up a certain attitude during tlie debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I did not speak to that motion, nor did I indicate in any way my attitude towards the general principles of the Bill. I spoke shortly for the whole term of their appointment, on clause 6, ancl pointed out that the amendment that the Minister was prepared to accept was obviously a compromise to meet the views of those who believed that £7,000 a year was too much to spend on this Commission.. The suggested amendment to this clause does not give the faintest indication of the probable amount. At present, we do not know how much of the assistant Commisthe duties to be entrusted to them. Neither have we any knowledge of the character of the work to be done. My difficulty arises out of the answer given by the Minister( Mr Stewart) to a question which I put to him concerning the appointment of the two assistant Commissioners for four years and three years respectively. I asked if the prescribed fees to be paid per sitting would be payable throughout the whole term of their engagement, and the Minister replied that the fees, as originally fixed, would not necessarily be the fees to be paid throughout the full term of their engagement. If this be so, then Parliamentwill have some control. Mr O'KEEFE -We will have no; conbe too trol at all. The Chairman of the Commission will control the situation. fixed for the whole term, Parliament will have control as to the amount to be paid. 1 If the fees prescribed will not necessarily be paid throughout the whole term of engagement, we may express the view that the fees being paid are too high and order a modification of the arrangement. With regard to the number of sittings, we are in an extraordinary position. Tbe Commission as a whole will be saddled with the responsibility for the proper development of the Federal Capital, and yet, according to the Minister, tbe Chairman will determine when tbe Commission will sit. will be guided largely by the work to be performed. of sittings. Mr O'KEEFE -He may call his colleagues together every day in the week if he likes. but if the fees to be paid are not fixed Parliament will have control.

It goes beyond the bounds of all political decency. This honourable gentleman prides himself on being the high priest of efficiency and economy, but a little knowledge of bis history in South Australia gives one very good reasons to doubt his sincerity. Nobody knows the financial obligations involved in the proposition he has put before the Committee. Even the honourable member does not know or understand the extent to whicli this Commonwealth would be financially involved. It passes my comprehension how he could move such an amendment. It is quite evident that he is not prepared to face the criticism which his action will justly cause, for he leaves the Chamber without giving a single reason why we should agree to his proposal. will be to enable the friends of this Government, who doubtless w ill be the members of the Commission, to extract excessive fees from the Treasury. When I realize that the political text-book which the honourable member reads every day of the week, and, the Saturday issue, three times on SundaysI refer to the Adelaide Register-severel y condemns the attitude which he has adopted, I am more than ever astonished at his audacity. nacular, it is "" the dizzy l i m it . "" Register newspaper does not generally subscribe to the views held by members on this side of the Committee, but it strongly supports the Labour party view on this question.

C. proposition isan extension of the pernicious system of 'handing over the business of government to Commissions which are only remotely responsible to Parliament, which involve the creation of additional billets, and which, being largely independent of the Minister, may be used by him as a means of evading responsibility for extravagance and inefficiency. The honourable member for Wakefield this afternoon charged previous Labour Governments w i th extravagance, although when challenged by me he was unable to give one single instance, and at various times he has charged the workers of Australia with inefficiency and w i th going slow on the job. In view of those facts, he merits the strongest condemnation for moving this amendment. Honourable members who know the record of the honourable member for Wakefield do not find it difficult to understand why he is known in South Australia as "" W o b b l y Foster."" I do not use that term in an offensive sense, but it is characteristic of the honourable member. He and other honourable members who represent South Australia, and hold views similar to those expressed by h i m, w ill find it very difficult to reconcile their vote and the view held by the official organ of their parties. If the South Australian representatives supThe effect of his proposition porting this composite Government f o l low the ignoble example of the honourable member for Wakefield and vote for this proposition, they w ill deserve to suffer the consequences. The Leader of the Opposition has given . an assurance that this is not a party question, but one upon which every honourable member is free to give rein to his own convictions. It cannot be contended that tbe fate of the Government is in To put it in the vervolved. On that account I trust that The honourable members opposite w ill not agree to this outrageous proposal.

No doubt, he recollected the old adageHe that fights and runs away May turn and fight another day. His attitude also reminds me of the remark of Lady Macbeth: "" Give me the daggers."" The Minister was timorous of the task set him, and the honourable member for Wakefield jumped in and saved the skin of the Minister by performing the deed himself. I suppose the honourable member has gone away to hide his head in shame. I dare say that he proposed this amendment on the spur of the moment as the idea flitted across bis mind. I would not say that he was inspired, for inspiration connotes something good and fine. One of his evil spirits has doubtless prompted hi m in this matter. The Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) knows that this amendment will suit him better than that suggested by the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), because it gives unlimited latitude for expenditure on fees. Rather than will over the growth of Boards and Commissions. The wretched story of Commissions that have been brought into existence by the party opposite is fresh in our minds. The Minister for Works and Railways has had to clean up the work of the War Service Homes Commission. Government supporters know well enough that if tbey were spending their own cash, instead of toying with the money of the people, they would not leave the door open for unlimited expenditure as the honourable member for Wakefield does. Now that he has returned to the chamber, let him tell us. why he has submitted the amendment, and how it is to lead to the the future, whenever I hear efficiency and economy of which he prates. What is injurin g the Commonwealth is not the Arbitration Court, as the honourable member would have us believe, but legislation such as he now proposes. The mess brought about by this Government will not be satisfactorily cleared up u n t i l a Labour Administration is returned to power. I hope that the journal in Adelaide that controls the actions of the honourable member for Wakefield will publish another leader concerning his The honourable "" economy."" The honourable member must have had a remarkable brain-wave when he conceived the language of the amendment providing that the Commissioners shall be remunerated "" by way of fees as prescribed."" The electors will require a fairly strong prescription to cure the evil that the honourable member, aided by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Works and Railways, is ready to in flict on the Commonwealth. There is no justification for the proposal. It cannot be shown that existing Commissions are giving value for the money expended on them. The fees of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee amount to £7,129 per annum. The Tariff Board has not been doing its job properly, for it has been urged that it has crippled Western Australia, and is killing the Commonwealth by reason of the duties it has imposed. For the mess into which it has brought the country the Government has had to pay it , up to date, £10,048. The Repatriation Commission for one year costs £5,058, aud the Shipping Boardi n volves an expenditure of £8,780, making a total of over £20,000 per annum for the Commissions in existence. It w ill remain for a Labour Government to remedy the allay the public unrest, it trouble that will be created by the apfoment further dissatisfaction pointment of a Commission to control the Federal Capital Territory. Honourable members opposite who repudiate the suggestion that they are under party domination now have a golden opportunity to do something in the best interests of the Commonwealth.
