If one has a field, although I was interested that for the first strong defence, if one is able to deter aggression, time we have had a report from the Prime it is unlikely that one would have to use the Minister suggesting that he has actually taken forces of this country actually to fight. up with the Soviet Union his concern about its progress in that field. The reality is that the On this side of the House our objective is to strategic defence initiative is just that; it is a make sure that we have a deterrent, non-nuclear defence initiative that is designed to ensure that capability within our Defence Force so that, if if there should be a missile attack on a country there were to be any developing threat against there is a capability of defending the people of Australia, those who would see Australia as being that country against that missile attack.
