The Clerk","It is with deep regret that I announce that Mr Speaker died at Parliament House on Friday afternoon, the 23rd instant. ister [3.1] Mr Clerk,, rising on Friday, last in great alarm, yet with no' such gnv'e anticipations as subsequent events have warranted, most of us little thought that we had looked for the last time upon'the Speaker whom we revered and trusted. I now) with the sincerest regret, beg to move That the Parliament records its high appreciation of the many and eminent services rendered to the Commonwealth by the late Sir Frederick Holder, particularly during his tenure of the arduous office of Speaker, from .its first assembling until his decease on Friday last. Inspired by a lofty conception of the duties of his office, he presided over the House of Representatives with conspicuous ability, firmness, and impartiality. An unsparing devotion to administrative duties was associated with a persona) courtesy which endeared him to members and officers of the House. The founding of a National Library has been among the most important of his special in. teresls. All citizens of Australia will concur in tendering their profound sympathy to the bereaved wife and family of a most distinguished Australian, whose loss is deeply felt by the whole community. That this resolution be transmitted to the Senate for its consideration. Prior to attaining his high office in the Commonwealth, the late honourable gentleman had achieved many honours within, and some without, the State of South Australia. Little favoured by the circumstances under which his career commenced, he was, in the old phrase, ""the son of his own works,"" and furnishes a.fine illustration of. the freedom of Australian life, and the frequency of the opportunities it affords to courage and ability, without restraint of station. Throughout his State career, he was not exceptionally assisted by fortune. Though far from confining himself to a single sphere, his exemplary, laborious, and fruitful labours were to be found in the fields of religious, social, and educational work, as well as in that of current politics. Yet be became prominent in them all, and occupied at the time of our Australian union the highest office in his State. He accepted the position to which he was called by the. members of the first Parliament with the same calm resolution and devotion to the best purposes of the office that had characterized his previous public life. He accepted its varied burdens, and bore them cheerfully. He confronted its inevitable trials bravely, and with complete self-restraint. It .is common knowledge that while even this high position was not his first choice, in this matter, and indeed during the whole of his life, he accepted willingly whatever conditions were imposed upon his efforts. He endured and surmounted them here within our own experience, with most conspicuous success. No Speaker more gentle, patient, or equitable his presided over any deliberative assembly with which. I am acquainted. But the strength of his control was derived from its justice. It came insensiblv, being due in no small degree to the dignity with which he maintained the high traditions of his office.",14,Setup
