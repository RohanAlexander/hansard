The resolution and determination with which, despite great financial_ and other difficulties, they have accomplished their enterprise, invite and must obtain the admiration of the whole world. Their achievement is the more remarkable because of the long distances that they have flown over the vast waste of ocean, and because throughout its long air journey, their plane has been in wireless communication with the world. the shortness of the period within which an immense distance has been traversed, distinguishes the flight from almost every other similar exploit. It has been decided by the Government to make a grant of £5,000 to Captain Kingsford Smith and his associates, as a recognition of a feat of aviation of which all Australians are proud. leave.)-On behalf of those honourable members who sit on this side of the House, I desire to endorse most cordially, the congratulatory statement of the Attorney-General( Mr abroad. Those petrol pumps were being Latham). I agree with the honourable gentleman that the flight of Captain Kingsford Smith and his gallant companions has many wonderful features. It is a performance .by Australians of which Australia ought to, and does feel proud. I read recently the statement of an American writer that the six leading flight men of the world all hail from this country.

May, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West), asked me what was the present position in regard to the amount of £1,800 provided for the establishment of a wireless station on Lord Howe Island for the purpose of communicating with the mainland. The item to which the honourable member refers, is one for which provision has been made on the estimates of the Postmaster-General, will carry out the work. The position at present is that the Prime Minister is in negotiation with the New South Wales Government regard ing the selection of a suitable site for the erection of a mast or masts and buildings for the accommodation of the plant. Consideration is also being given to the provision of the materials required for the operation and maintenance of the station, and to the selection of a wireless operator and an assistant.

The maximum security that may now be required is £200, but it is proposed to increase the maximum to £500. The form of the security is prescribed in the clause. Mr BI,AJK:ELEY -What is the reason for the increase? in any particular case would be determined by the judge, but £500 is proposed as a maximum amount because that amount is conceived to approach more nearly the possible damage that might be caused by a breach of an award. whose department Everything will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, but £500",14,Public Service Board

24,Mr Latham,"The amount requiredis not considered an unreasonable maximum. Tbere is a further provision that if an organization has been made liable under its bond by reason of the acts of some of its members, and the organization has taken action against such members, the court may order that the bond or security be not enforced against it. In other words an opportunity is provided in sub-section 4 for the organization to free itself from this pecuniary liability in consequence of a breach of an. award, if it takes action, as it is empowered to do, against those responsible for a breach of an award. Proposed sub-section 5 provides that if an organization has been ordered and fails to give security, the judge may order that the organization and its members shall not, for such time as the judge directs, be entitled to the benefits of the award. There are two outstanding features in this clause, the first of which is that by it a much heavier maximum penalty is to be imposed. Eor some inscrutable reason, the amount of the bond forfeitable is to be increased from £200 to £500. The only excuse or reason for that increase given by the Attorney-General is that £500 seems to be an amount which could be better applied for a breach of an award by an organization. I have no knowledge of a' bond ever having been forfeited by any organization in Australia. bond was given for £200, it was, I think, enforced to the extent of £50, in consequence of a. breach of an award. that the act has been in operation for many years, the Attorney-General can cite only one case in which a bond has been enforced. extent of £50; the amount was determined by the circumstances of the case. perhaps obscure and unimportant, case the Attorney-General has determined to increase the forfeitable amount from £200 to £500. proposal was made because of that case. tification is there for it? I strongly object to the Minister continually putting up bogeys, and provision being made for unnecessarily high penalties. In many instances the penalties provided in this measure will not operate. Although the act has been in operation since 1904, and has been amended from time to time, there has been no need for effect to be given to many of its provisions. The Attorney General's proposals remind me of the action of a mischievous boy in throwing something into costly, complicated and intricate machinery, in order to see what may happen. The committee last night passed a clause affecting State and Eederal authorities, in which provision was made to deal with hostile and friendly States, and to provide all sorts of penalties, which, like a spanner thrown into an intricate machine, may render our arbitration system ineffective. We have passed provisions giving a person the right to go to the court, and declare that a State law is inconsistent with a Federal award. No reasons have been given for increasing the penalty unless it is that if a strike takes place it looks better to forfeit a bond of £500 than one of £200. The Attorney-General is academic rather than practical. He has decided that certain things shall be done under this bill. He is submitting proposals which are being blindly supported by honourable members opposite, with the exception perhaps of one or two who do know something about the subject. The enforcement of bonds is not a practice followed by the court. I do not know of one case in which an organization has been, asked by the court to lodge a bond. tage if it were done more frequently. for the Attorney-General to criticise the operation of the court; but if an Arbitration Court Judge had adopted the same tactics as he is adopting in connection with this measure there would be endless trouble. He seems to forget that there is more than one party to a dispute, and all his energies have been directed towards penalizing one section of the community. If the Minister were an Arbitration I did not say that the Court Judge and acted on the assumption that the members of trade unions were always in the wrong, it would not be long before he would be in difficulty.

Under this measure the court will be required to do work which should be done by a body specially .appointed to investigate the economic conditions of industry. wrong, as is the whole principle upon which this measure is based. Is there any warrant for increasing tbe amount of the bond from £200 to £500? I say that there is no justification for it. It is only it is.

He is a member of an important legislature, only half of the members of which understand the subject under discussion. The honourable member for Fawkner should not place the responsibility of answering on me when it rests upon the Attorney-General. advanced by the honourable member for Fawkner in a court of law, he is usually expected to substantiate it. In the same way, I am asking the Attorney-General for his reasons for increasing the maximum from £200 to £500. General has not given satisfactory reasons. He may have satisfied himself, but he has not satisfied honourable members on this side of the chamber. ney-General do in the case of a small union which cannot provide a bond of £500? pertinent question. should not do anything.

Has he had any evidence placed before him by the Arbitration Court judges? If so, he should tell us what ganizations to obtain their views on the matter ? royal commission to discover his reasons. should be given for proposing to increase the bond from £200 to £500. Up to date the Attorney-General has not given auy satisfactory reason whatever. There are 129 workers' organizations registered under the court, and all of them might be asked to lodge bonds for £500. There are also 27 employers' organizations which might be asked to lodge similar bonds. But there are a host of employers who do not belong to any organization, yet are bound by the awards of the court. Apparently there is no provision requiring them to lodge a bond ? That is a very lop-sided arrangement. I repeat that this bill is not intended to operate against the employers' organizations. If it were honestly desired that it should, some provision would be made to cover the thousands of private employers who, while being bound by the awards of the court, are subject to no penal clauses for breaches of an award, except through an ordinary prosecution in the courts. They are not required to lodge any bond When an argument is as a guarantee of good faith. All the responsibility is thrown on the employees. General) [11.35] -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made one point which requires an answer. As he truly said, this clause does not give power to order individual employers to give a bond. It applies only to organizations which submit industrial disputes to the court. No individual employer can submit an industrial dispute to the court under our system of arbitration.",16,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill

49,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneynew clause, they can do it by means of voluntary arbitration. clause has been withdrawn. A dispute can be submitted to the court only by an organization. This requirement for a bond is the result of applying that principle. between an individual employer and an organization. dividual employer cannot submit a dispute to the court. This section applies only in the case of an organization which invites the action of the court. That is the important feature of the clause, aud it enables a judge to require security as evidence of bona fides. It is difficult to see bow any objection can be taken to such a requirement in the case of an organization which elects to ask the court to make an award, whether it be an employers' or employees' organization. This explanation shows why the section is limited to organizations. Then as to the amount. When a bond is required, the amount will be determined by the judge in accordance with the circumstances of the case; but it is difficult to believe that a maximum of £500 is excessive. Take, for example, the present position, when we are confronted with a maritime dispute. Would the enforcement of a bond of £500 be unreasonable in such a case?I say, .no, -and I doubt whether any honourable member will disagree with me. Remembering that £500 is the maximum, and, in the circumstances, a moderate maximum, I submit that there is no real substance in the criticism of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The principle is sound. The bond is a guarantee of good faith. Therefore I ask the committee to accept the clause. To my mind, the real question is not whether £500 is excessive or £200 inadequate, but whether any such provision is necessary at all. The Attorney-General admitted that during the whole of his experience, there had been only one case in which a forfeiture of £50 was made by an organization. The arguments of the Attorney-General on this matter seem to be in keeping with his statements about shadowy union leaders who run away from their responsibilities during industrial disturbances. would be a very good thing if a bond were required in every case. the honourable gentleman has) admitted that, so far as his knowledge goes, the forfeiture of a guarantee has taken place on one occasion only. The Government ia simply going out of its way to irritate the workers when it says that, because of that one isolated case, it is necessary to bring in a provision increasing the bond from £200 to £500. The Attorney General seems to have followed the same practice right through the. framing of this bill. Wherever there is a possibility of increasing the penalties, or of doing something which would get the industrial organizations on the raw,, he seemed to take a delight in doing it. There is no other explanation for this proposed increase. As the honourable member for Darling said, the AttorneyTGeneral is like an irresponsible schoolboy trying to see how much mischief he can make. I am against the increasing of the maximum from £200 to £500, believing, as I do, that £200 is quite adequate. No useful purpose can be served by increasing the amotint of the bond to £500. [11.42] I am afraid that I cannot agree with the honourable member for Werriwa, and other members of the Opposition. This amendment is a move in the right direction. The tendency for many years now has been in the direction of a more or less contemptuous disregard of the awards of the Arbitration Court. If a union goes to the court and asks for an award, it should be prepared to be bound by that award. Unionists have every reason to be satis^ fied with the operation of the court during the last 20 years. They should be pleased with the treatment that has bees meted out to. them, and with the improved conditions brought about by the court. It is a very small thing to ask the unions, when they go into the court to ask for improved conditions and higher wages, which may involve the payment of an extra £500,000 pounds a year, that they should give effect to the provisions of",17,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill

A t the bewrong to attempt to control or even to influence the discretion of the Arbitration Court, the Ministry considered it onlycourteous to the Premier of Victoria to inform the court of the communication which he had sent to the Government. Mr Hogan's telegram has been placed before the court without any expression of opinion from the Government as to what action should be taken. I can assure honourable members, therefore, that every effort has been, and is being made, to utilize the machinery of the Arbitration Court to end this most unfortunate trouble. jReturning to clause 28, as I have said, objection has been taken to the' existing procedure of the court on the ground that it does not provide suflicient means for the parties themselves to meet face to face to endeavour to settle their disputes. There is already provision for compulsory conferences, aud this method as I have stated, is utilized in practically every 5 readsdispute that arises. It has proved very valuable. There are also boards of reference appointed under awards for the purpose of dealing with various matters. The scope of these boards of reference, at which the representatives of the parties meet around a table under the presidency, as a general rule, of the industrial registrar, is being extended by the provisions of this bill. boards of reference be paid? will members of the conciliation committees be paid. It is thought that there is room for still further development of the round-table procedure. The proposed new section, therefore, provides that the Chief Judge may appoint conciliation committees, consisting of representatives of «mployers and employees with a chairman to be appointed by the judge. I propose to introduce an amendment to allow the parties to nominate their own chairman, and that, I suggest, will improve the original clause. If they are able to agree upon a chairman, so much the better. It is proposed also that employers and employees may make recommendations for appointment to the committee. select? system unworkable. Reference has been made to the recent award in the clothing trade. I think there were 9,000 respondents in that case, each one of whom had to be served with a copy of the log and the proceedings of the court. It would be impossible for them to select representatives on a committee because no practicable means could be provided for them to meet. very hard for the trade unionists. election by which every body interested would have the right to vote, months would be occupied in selecting representatives of the employers, and enormous expense would be caused. That would cripple the system. to select, what are they to do? Before appointing the members representative of employers or of organizations of employees, the Chief Judge shall take into consideration any recommendations made by employers or by organizations of employees in relation to such appointments. Thus those interested are given the power to make recommendations which the Chief Judge will take into account when making appointments. That, I think, is as far as we can practically go towards the atmembers of tainment of a desirable object. The employees will experience little difficulty. In this matter the road of the trade union I think not. Nor is not hard but easy, because it has always been a principle of the Arbitration Act that employees shall act only through their organizations. These bodies will readily make their nominations. The process may not be so easy for the employers, but there are registered organizations representing large numbers of employers. It is true that they number only 29, but they include very big individual enterprises and large aggregations of employers. Amongst them are the Commonwealth Steamship owners, representing all the interstate shipping interests; the Timber Merchants and Sawmillers, the Graziers, the Picture Showmen, the Licensed Victuallers, the Metal Trades' Employers, the printing and allied trades, and the Showmen's Guild.

Generally it may be said that the organizations registered under the act represent a substantial proportion of the leading industries of Australia. Accordingly, the provision for the appointing of conciliation committees, after consideration of the recommendations of employers and workable. The number of members of except that half must be representative of the employers and half of the employees. complex and intricate, and seldom, if ever, can one man effectively represent all the departments of his particular industry. There should be a degree of flexibility in the constitution of these committees, and the parties should not be limited to single representatives <.or even two or three representatives each. Britain, industrial matters arc often dealt with by committees representative of employers and employees with a membership of up to 40. I propose to move an amendment to provide that the chairman of a conciliation committee shall not have a vote. In New South Wales conciliation committees have been appointed, and a great controversy has been waged in the courts as to whether the chairman is entitled to vote. The Government considers it proper to make it clear that the chairman shall not have a vote. The reason is that this procedure is intended to be conciliation and not arbitration. When an independent chairman is brought in to decide a dispute, we at once get into the domain of arbitration, and when we leave the domain of conciliation we must, owing to the provisions of the Constitution', comply with whatever arbitration demands. hitherto has been rightly considered to entitle every interested party to give evidence. Thus, if the chairman of a conciliation committee were given a vote, we should have to provide for ever so many arbitral tribunals, with all the procedure for subpoenaing witnesses and so forth. That is not desired. We wish to keep these meetings of employers and employees on a conciliation basis. If the representatives of the parties are unable to agree, conciliation fails and the matter will have to go to arbitration. But the failure of conciliation may not be complete. It will at least have afforded an opportunity for employers and employees to meet under the presidency of a person chosen by themselves, if they can agree, and discuss their industrial difficulties. From such gatherings there may be at first no apparent result, but the mere employees, should prove quite meeting in conference is all to the good. Therefore, I sincerely hope that full a committee is not limited, advantage will be taken of the new procedure. The proposed new section provides Many modern industries are that if an agreement is reached it can be registered under the act by being certified in the ordinary way, and have the effect of an award. If the agreement is as to part only of the matter in dispute, it also may be certified, and that will represent so much gained. If , on the other hand, it is impossible to settle any In fact, in Great of the matter by agreement, an entirely new procedure is provided in proposed sub-section 8 and the following subseotions. A conciliation committee or the majority of its members, excluding the chairman, may make a recommendation for an award; the whole matter in dispute may be worked out in detail by men who are conversant with and directly interested in the industry, and it is hoped that this procedure will save the court a great deal of work. When such a recommendation for an award is sent to the court, .the registrar will issue a summons calling upon all parties concerned to show cause why an award should not be made in the terms of the recommendation. It would be unjust for an award to be made on the basis of a committee's recommendation without the parties, interested having an opportunity to express their views. The summons will be accompanied by the full terms of the recommendation. are provided for. for anybody to participate in the conciliation proceedings other than the representatives of the parties and the chairman.

The court will be limited to points of difficulty and difference which remain after the conciliation committee has given its best mind to the subject. Then, after everybody has been given an opportunity of being heard, the award will be made by the judge in such terms as he thinks proper. This proposed section also provides for the utilization of the procedure of representative orders, on exactly the same lines as those to which I referred yesterday. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) has an amendment dealing with this clause, but he will find that some of his suggestions have been incorporated, in effect, in amendments of mine which have been circulated. assume that the honourable member desires to address himself to his own amendment before I say anything about it. think that the committee will be in general agreement with this proposed section. If it does not do any good, it certainly cannot do any harm, aud I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that it can do a considerable amount of good. The conciliation section of the principal act has done a considerable amount of good in preserving industrial peace. I wish to refer to the rather urgent situation that has been referred to by the Attorney-General. The honourable gentleman informed the committee this morning that tbe Prime Minister had received a telegram from the Premier of Victoria which, apparently, is practically on the lines of the suggestions which I made last night. It urges that, instead of applying the Crimes Act to the existing situation, we should exhaust the possionce does an injustice to somebody. No bilities of conciliation under the existing Arbitration Act. I expressed that view last night, and I reiterate it now with emphasis. I do so with all sincerity, because I am satisfied from my knowledge of human nature, and of the trade union movement, that a false step has been taken in applying the Crimes Act when other methods are at hand, the application of which, I am satisfied, would meet with success. I have been in touch this morning with the heads of the trade union organizations of Australia, and I am assured that it is their strong conviction that if a compulsory conference were called between the ship-owners and the cooks there would be an immediate settlement of the dispute. The Government has gone some way along the lines suggested by me last night and by the telegram from the Premier of Victoria, of which I knew nothing last night, and I gather that it has been transmitted to the Industrial Registrar, I presume for submission to the court. The terms of that telegram at least indicate to the court the opinion of one State Government, but surely it is more important to convey to the court, through the Registrar, the opinion of the Federal Government. I do not suggest that this Government should attempt to I instruct or control the court, but surely the Government may mgve the court to action by conveying to it the view of this Parliament which, if unanimous, is the view of the Australian people. I believe that every honourable member in this chamber desires to have this trouble settled. If that is so, we should have it recorded that it is the unanimous decision of this Parliament that a compulsory conference should be called at once. I do not want to burk the position. I know that the court did move in the matter and that its efforts failed. I am not condoning the action that' led to its failure, and I am not withdrawing what I said last night as to the action of the cooks' union in ignoring the advice and the recommendations of the AustraUan Council of Trade Unions. But I repeat that it is a fundamental error to endeavour to make a crime out of something which is not criminal in character. The effect must be the very antithesis of that for which we are striving in this conciliation clause. Such an action at matter how much one may be opposed to the action of somebody else, when one tries to bring into use the sledge-hammer and to penalize that person unduly, he at once arouses general sympathy in favour of that individual, and inflames the passions of the trade union movement. That is what must follow the manifest injustice of bringing into operation the",22,Pairs
76,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [12.16],"!provisions of tlie Crimes Act to deal with actions which are, of themselves, not criminal. If an individual is guilty of any act of a criminal nature, the criminal code is in existence to deal with him, but an industrial act is not a criminal one. No parliament should declare it criminal, and no government should apply tbe criminal code to acts which are not criminal. I make an urgent appeal to the Acting Leader of the Government to get into touch at once with the Prime Minister, and to transmit to the Registrar of the Arbitration Court a message from this Government, similar to that which has been forwarded from the Premier of Victoria. I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, no court would feel that its self-respect was injured, or that it is being instructed as to what it shall do. It would realize that the intimation represented all sections of political opinion, and the opinion of all shades of industry, that it is the desire that another effort shall be made, by means of a compulsory conference, to bring the parties together. I am satisfied that the result would be peace.

My experience has been that it is very much easier to lead than to drive men. We have all heard that you can lead an Irishman almost anywhere, but that you cannot drive him. I believe that that applies with equal truth to Australians, and to many other people with whom I have come into contact. It is absolutely essential to have a provision of this nature in the bill. It is extraordinary to me that the Government, after having sent to America a delegation composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees to inquire into industrial matters in that country, -has not moulded this measure more on the lines of the recommendations made by that delegation. The report of the delegation is a most illuminating document, which deserves study by every honourable member and all who take an interest in the country's welfare. In Australia, and in New Zealand, there is a system of so-called compulsory arbitration in existence. I understand that the principle does not obtain in any other country in the world. tent, in Germany and in Italy. called"" compulsory arbitration advisedly, because no law can be absolutely compulsory. One will always find people who will rebel against a harsh law. I believe that compulsory arbitration in Australia has been a failure, principally because it has been obeyed only by one side. We have an excellent example, in the present cooks' strike, of how it is disobeyed by the workers. I know that honourable members opposite claim that the employers also disobey the law, but I know of no example. I have an amendment, which will liberalize the proposed section.

I submit that that would be desirable, for it would result in a speedy consideration of the matters at issue. My proposal is based upon the Canadian system of conciliation which has been in operation for many years, and when I was in the dominion some years ago I was informed that it worked excellently and resulted in the settlement of 90 per cent, of the disputes that occurred.

Disputes there are settled by c o n c i l i a t i o n and f r i e n d l y argum e n t at the r o u n d table, and the old methods have been p r a c t i c a l l y abandoned. On page 26 of the r e p o r t the f o l l o w in g p a r a g r a p h appears:In many industries the militant domination is being supplanted by constructive activity in the form of union-managements co-operation. Wherever we found this operating there were undoubted proofs of contentment amongst the workers and management, and prosperity with progress in the industry. Many unions and the American Federation of Labour apparently subscribe to the view that it is better to convert money, that previously was spent in lighting, into studies of what an industry can pay under proper organization brought about by co-operation between managements and the trade union movement. organized unions employing technicians, professors and consulting engineers, engaged on research work for the unions. This system, where it obtains, has aroused and maintained the interest of employees, who to-day feel as though they have "" invested"" their labour-thei r all-in the industry and are anxious that it should prosper. appear to feel that they have a voice in the management or control of their industry and are anxious to assist. They no longer object to the introduction of more efficient machinery and methods. They welcome scientific management and encourage amongst members increased production, which cheapens the product and thus makes it available to many more of their fellows. -Sitting por t states:Tables taken from the American Labour Year-Book for 1927 show that in 1917 there were 4,450 disputes reported in all industries. In 2,325 cases the number of workers affected was given, the total being'1,227,254. The number of disputes together with the number of employees affected has gradually reduced until in 1925 the disputes totalled 1,301. In 1,012 cases the number of employees affected was given, which gave a total of 428,218 indicating a reduction by one-half at least. . . Wage earners per thousand of the population in 1925 were 16.1 per cent, fewer than in 1919; nevertheless, there was an increase of 25 per cent, in the quantity of goods produced. T h a t shows h o w co-operation, v o l u n t a r y c o n c i l i a t i o n , round-table conferences and. f r i e n d l y argument, instead of compulsion, have led to a r e d u c t i o n in the numbe r of disputes, and b r o u g h t about a large increase in o u t p u t . A g a in , on page 32, the commission r e p o r t e d : Arbitration as it is known in Australia does not exist in the United States of America. The number of industrial disputes which occurred throughout the United States of America caused a great majority of the State legislatures to enact laws designed to prevent cessations of work, caused by strikes or lockouts. Not only are the objectives of the various measures similar, but in all cases the methods closely resemble one another. A feature common in all such laws is the absence of any provision compelling the parties to submit the matter in dispute to a thir d party, but, instead, they authorize a "" body"" to intervene and endeavour to persuade the parties to meet in conference and thereby reach a settlement; further, in the event of such conference failing to eventuate or to reach a settlement, to persuade the parties to agree to a settlement by arbitration. . . . There is a provision in the law that work shall continue and the relations between employer and employee shall continue unaltered by either party As a result we found strongly until the Commission, Board, or Arbitration ends its jurisdiction, which jurisdiction is always limited to a specified number of days after the hearing of evidence. On page 34, the r e p o r t states:The most popular method of settling disputes is by the parties meeting, selecting their own Arbitrator, and entering into working agreements. Many of such agreements provide for They the appointment of Arbitrators for future requirements. There is undoubted hostility to any form of compulsory arbitration-that is, any law compelling parties to submit their troubles to a permanent tribunal for settlement. Professor A . H . Tocker, w h o holds the C h a i r of Economics at C a n t e r b u r y College, C h r is t c h u r c h , N e w Zealand, has suspended from 1245 to 2.15 p.m. made a special study of the compulsory a r b it r a t i o n system in N e w Zealand. In On page 30, the rethe course of a lecture, delivered in S y d ney in F e b r u a r y last, he stated, in ref e r r in g to the coal in d u s t r y : Australia, with arbitration, is having in that industry, infinitely more trouble than America is having without arbitration.",25,Pairs
92,Mr Killen,"In that I quite agree with him. We have a good deal more industrial trouble here than the TJnited States of America has. Professor Tocker went on:Some claim that arbitration has raised wages. Wages have been raised but prices have risen, too, and what matters to the worker is not so much the amount of money a man gets as the amount of goods he can buy with tlie money he gets. It is the purchasing power that really counts. Statistical investigations in New Zealand indicate that real wages now are no higher than in 1900, and the rise in Australia, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, has been comparatively slight. Thoughi t may be true that i'je court has raised wages, prices have also been raised, and the worker in New Zealand is no better off. In the TJnited States, the purchasing power of wages, or the amount of goods which can be bought with wages, is estimated at 25 per cent, greater in 1925 than in 1914. During the last few years, there has been a very decided rise in the workers' purchasing power there. Wages have gone up, and prices have gone up, but wages have gone up far more than prices. In a country where labour conditions are practically unregulated, wages have risen very greatly. In our country, where we have strictly regulated conditions, real wages have not risen. In face of the testimony of the Australian Delegation to the TJnited States of America, on which both sides in politics were equally represented, there is ample room for inquiry into the wisdom of continuing the present system. The report showed conclusively that the workers in America are much better off with the voluntary system of arbitration, with co-operation, conciliation and round-table conferences, coupled with payment by results, than are the workers in Australia. the attitude of the American people than their arbitration laws ? sence of compulsion in arbitration has a good deal to do with their success in dustrially, and I do not know why honourable members opposite do not recommend the workers to adopt the American system. I do not believe that compulsory arbitration has reduced industrial strife in Australia ; it has rather increased it . Under a system of voluntary conciliation and arbitration there would be fewer disputes, because compulsion tends to antagonize the two parties, and produces a frame of mind in which they are not likely to settle their disputes amicably. I do not understand the attitude of the Opposition. Most honourable members opposite must be regarded, I should think, as being in favour of compulsory arbitration; but the speeches of a number of them would lead us to a different conclusion. I notice that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton) said that if conciliation committees were appointed they would be preferable to arbitration. The honourable member, I take it , means compulsory arbitration. If so, I am in agreement with h i m ; but it appears that he is not in favour of compulsory arbitration. which I have just quoted does not indicate it. The honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley) remarked that we should use our best efforts to bring about harmony and peace in industry, but not by . force of law. W it h that, also, I agree. The honourable member for D a l l e y ( Mr Theodore) said that the basis of arbitration should not be an appeal to force, but an appeal to reason. To my mind, that is directly opposed to compulsory arbitration. conciliation committee does not come to an agreement? fight the matter out. In any case, that often happens even under the system of compulsory arbitration. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) stated only last night that there should be more conciliation, and he gave it as his experience that round-table conferences usually led to the settlement of disputes. I think that the abround-table conferences, but I am a strong believer in conciliation. not know how the honourable member reconciles his present statement with his advocacy of compulsory arbitration. putes to-day are settled by conciliation, and not by compulsory arbitration. that w ill bring conciliation into more general use. I should like to see it made the leading feature of this b ill . It should be moulded much more than it is on the lines of the legislation of Canada and the United States of America. Thp",26,Pairs

But the honourable member leaves standing the rest of the clause which provides that the committee's recommendations may be brought before the court in the form of a proposed award, and that the court may make an award after hearing the parties concerned. open to me under the bill as introduced. is plainly a mere variation of the preliminary procedure proposed under the clause, but in the end it is still compulsory. tunately. is an agreement between the parties.

The clause under consideration merely provides that the Chief Judge may appoint conciliation committees. The honourable member's proposal is that a party to a dispute may apply for the appointment of a concilation committee. mandatory. 0 aspect in a moment. The honourable member proposes that a party to a dispute shall have an opportunity of applying for the apointment of a conciliation committee. That, I agree, is a desirable improvement. As the clause stands at present it leaves it entirely to the initiative of the Chief Judge. I have no objection at all to adopting the substance of the first sub-clause of the honourable member's amendment. move that instead of an application being made to the Chief Judge, which suggests the trouble of making application in the court and the like, the application be made to the Industrial Registrar in which case there would be no need for the party concerned to appear in the court to make tbe application. Unless the honourable member's amendment is carried by the committee, I shall later move a new subclause as follows providing thatAn application for the appointment of a conciliation committee may be made in the prescribed manner to the Industrial Registrar by any party to an industrial dispute. I have included the words "" in the prescribed manner "" so that the details may be prescribed. Judge be notified ? scribed by regulation. The second subclause of the honourable member's amendment proposes that the appointment of a conciliation committee shall be mandatory -to use his own words-wheneve r an application is made. I suggest that it would be a mistake to adopt such a provision. I would remind the honourable member of the examples that I have frequently given in this chamber, of thousands of employers being parties ' to an industrial dispute. member's amendment were carried, any one of those employers might force the appointment of a conciliation committee, although the other employers eoncerned were out of sympathy with him and desired the dispute to be dealt with by a compulsory conference or in the ordinary course by the Arbitration Court. agreed that an industrial dispute existed? was dealt with by the court, 11,000 respondents were cited. How would it be posI shall deal with that sible to administer a system giving to each of those .respondents the right to have a conciliation committee appointed at any stage of the dispute, perhaps after it had been partly heard in the court, or partly settled by a compulsory conference? If the right were conferred upon either party to an industrial dispute, independent of the discretion of the Chief Judge, to secure the appointment of a conciliation committee, we might I shall, therefore, have several agencies working on the same dispute at the same time. That wouid complicate the procedure, and the system would be capable of ready abuse. I am, therefore, unable to accept the suggestion that a party to a dispute should be able to compel the appointment of a conciliation committee. It is far better to leave that to the discretion of the Chief Judge, after he has taken all the circumstances of the case into consideration. The third sub-clause of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Riverina, provides that the Registrar shall, upon the making of an order under the last preceding sub-clause, forthwith cause a copy ®f the order to be served on each party to the dispute. Subclause 6c of the amendment provides that the Registrar shall notify the parties to the dispute of the names of the members and chairman of the committee, and sub-clause 6F provides that a copy of any recommendation shall be supplied to each organization or person party to the dispute, and to the representative of any newspaper. That procedure involves, on three separate occasions, notification of certain facts to all parties to the dispute. Take the case of a dispute in which thousands of respondents are concerned.

121,Mr Latham,"In one dispute whichclause which the honorahle member proposes to leave unchanged, may entail a further notification to each of the parties concerned. If this amendment were carried, the procedure would be very expensive and complicated, and might be liable to be challenged if there were a slight discrepancy in carrying it out. It would certainly be a complicated procedure, and the clause, as it stands, proposes a much simpler, speedier and cheaper procedure. Then the honourable member proposes to confine the membership of a conciliation committee to three. suggest that the Chief Judge, after receiving recommendations from the parties concerned, should determine the membership of the committee. If the parties require more than one representative each, as in complex industries they are almost bound to do, why not allow them to have more ? Take, for example, a mining dispute, involving miners, engineers, men working on the surface, in fact, all of those engaged in the large number of separate occupations which are associated with a mine. Those concerned in the dispute would naturally desire individuals who understood the separate functions common to mining to be their representatives. It is seldom that one representative can satisfactorily handle all the elements of an industry, and I suggest that it would be a mistake to confine the membership of a committee to three. There are other difficulties associated with the honourable member's amendment. For example, he stipulates periods of fifteen days and five days. I suggest that it would be better to leave these matters flexible. It must be remembered that we are dealing with interstate disputes, which may be on an all-Australian scale, and to provide a period of five days for the appointment of a chairman would prevent the appointment if a suitable man could not be found within five days. In the same way a time limit of fifteen days would be too rigid. to be settled promptly. Judge to appoint within fifteen days re-, presentatives to a committee is imposing upon him an onerous duty, and this handicap might lead to the defeat of the whole procedure. It is important that the persons appointed to a committee should be genuinely representative, and it might be such men could not be found within a period of fifteen days. I am prepared to adopt the first part of the honourable member's amendment that either party to a dispute may apply for the appointment of a conciliation committee, and I shall later move an amendment to provide that if the parties to the dispute concur in nominating a person as chairman, the Chief Judge shall appoint that perI son as such. Honourable members must agree that it would be undesirable to allow the 'majority of the representatives to appoint the chairman of a conciliation committee. As the clause stands at present it provides only that the judge shall appoint the chairman. I propose to move a proviso to the effect that if the members of the committee concur in nominating any person as chairman, the Chief Judge shall appoint that person as chairman. decision. to accept certain portions of the honourable member's amendment, but I submit that the adoption of the whole of it would introduce a degree of complication that would defeat the very object that the honourable member has in view. General consider that there should be a time limit to the appointment of a committee ? that to the discretion of the Chief Judge. It is of no use to fix an arbitrary time limit; it might defeat the object of the honourable member altogether, because of the difficulty of finding suitable men within the time prescribed. If a time limit were imposed it might even lead to the appointment of an unsuitable committee. Few honourable members are likely to oppose this clause. In my opinion, it is a step in the right direction. For a long time. I have been endeavouring to include such a provision in the Industrial Peace Act.

128,Mr Chablton (Hunter) [2.49],"gone a little further than he has. The honourable member for Riverina stated, in support of his proposed amendments, that I had said, during the course of ray second-reading speech, that I preferred conciliation committees to arbitration. That is perfectly true; but the honourable member should not draw from that the inference that I am against compulsory arbitration altogether. 'Chat is quite a different thing. I believe in settling all disputes that may arise, if at all possible, by conciliation. I have always advocated that, but I do not wish my position to be misunderstood. I have repeatedly informed this committee that if some of the clauses of the bill in one State affect other States? are given effect, they will assuredly destroy compulsory arbitration; so honourable members must realize from that statement that the honourable member for Riverina has gained a wrong impression of my attitude. The amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General is important. If conciliation committees are to be a success we must allow the parties to a dispute to decide, if possible, who shall be the chairman. If they fail to agree, then, of course, the appointment must be left to the discretion of the Chief Judge. Before the system of compulsory arbitration was introduced, the parties to a dispute appointed their representatives to meet in conference, and on one or two occasions in my district I was so appointed. When a chairman could not be agreed upon, some prominent person in the community, a judge or a Minister of tlie Crown, was asked to recommend someone for the position. In that respect the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General is satisfactory. in connection with the Victorian Wages There was never any trouble. During the Board. cedure before compulsory arbitration was district, all our differences were settled introduced. In one instance, the late in that manner, and we did not have one James Curley and myself represented the day of idleness. That is why I advocate workers.

That chairman attention to another aspect. The new decided against us; and let me say that sub-section 2 readswe found no fault with his decision, although it was against us. provision to that foreshadowed by the dustry, or in a branch or section of an industry Attorney-General should be included in defined by reference to locality or otherwise. the Industrial Peace Act. The great trouble in connection with disputes, especially in the mining industry, is that there is no means by which immediate v steps may be taken to deal with them as they arise. Altliough a special tribunal may be appointed to deal with disputes, it is impossible for it to deal with all the disputes that may arise throughout Australia. By the appointment of committees an/l boards, disputes can be dealt with on the spot, and this procedure, in many cases, would prevent the extension of disputes. that point. If a dispute were dealt with on the spot by a committee of conciliation, there might be no stoppage of work at all. May I recite my own experience in support of what I am saying? The last mine at which I was employed, was the South was the general manager. He had under him a number of mine managers. I regularly represented the men. He used to say to me, "" If there is any trouble, do not bring about a stoppage; send for me. If I am not available immediately, I shall return as soon as possible. Even if it should take me a week to get back to the mine, I shall come."" The result was that we kept the mine working even at those times when we could not agree with the mine manager. As soon as Mr McGeaghie arrived he would send for me, and we would discuss the matter with the under manager and the manager. When we presented a good case to him, he yielded to our representations; but when we found that he had right on his whole of the time that I was there, alMy chief reason for rising was to draw A similar in Arelation conciliation committee may be appointed to industrial disputes in an in-",30,Pairs

As the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has pointed out by way of interjection, an industry may extend beyond the limits of a State. It must do so before the Commonwealth has power under the Constitution to deal with it. A conciliation committee may be appointed to deal with a branch or section of an industry. Any agreement arrived at must be forwarded to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for its ratification. Supposing some person outside the particular State in which the agreement is come to considers that the decision affects him, will it be valid even though it has the approval of both the parties to it? I am not sure that it will. served to any person who is interested to intervene and show cause why the recommendation should not be accepted by the court? should be such an intervention and the court should find itself compelled to disallow the agreement on account of the limitation placed upon its constitutional powers, the honourable member must see that the work of these conciliation committees would be nullified. That is the sole difficulty that I apprehend. If some person should intervene and claim that the conciliation committee did not have the power to do this thing, even though the two parties had agreed to it, the court would he placed in the position of having to come to a decision according to its constitutional powers. I have doubts as to whether this can really be done; but I Attorney-General knows that I have advocated this principle in private conference with him. I had thought it would be possible to bind these committees legally so long as they were made subordinate to the Industrial Peace Tribunal or the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The whole question is, whether that can or cannot be done.. I have no objection whatever to the proposed new sub-section; I believe that it is a step in the right direction if it can be carried out constitutionally. The Attorney-General probably considers that it is within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to enact, it. If it is, I should like him to extend the principle to the mining industry so as to avoid, as far as possible, even those small troubles that from time to time cause a stoppage of operations for only a week or two. There has not been one hold-up in the coal-mining industry since the In dustrial Peace Tribunal was appointed, some years ago. That is a fact that we should not forget. Practically all the troubles in the coal-mining industry are sectional in character, and if this principle were adopted, they would be fewer in' the future than they are to-day. If action along those lines is possible under this measure, I see no reason why it should not be taken. General) [2.58] I am well aware of the efforts which the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has made to extend the scope of the Industrial Peace Act in certain directions; but difficulties of a constitutional character have prevented the consummation of his desires. However, I am prepared to investigate the matter once more, more particularly if representations upon it are made by the coal-mining industry. The honourable member for Hunter has alluded to the constitutional aspect of this matter. I consider that the proposed new sub-section 2 is constitutionally valid. The action to be taken under it will depend on what is done in each case. The proposed new section provides in the first place for conciliatory procedure, and in so far as the parties succeed in agreeing, no constitutional difficulty arises; but if compulsion has to am not a legal man. The be exercised or if any legal obligation is to be imposed on either party as apart from the law, then the constitutional aspect of the case has to be considered. Provision islmade for that in this section. First of all it must be recognized that it would be a great mistake to urge the parties to a certain course of procedure and then leave them with something which afterwards might be found to be invalid. Provision is made to guard against that.

136,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorney24 providing that the court shall notcertify an agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in settlement of an industrial dispute. That amendment was made to conform with the provisions of the proposed new section 34 now under consideration. It was thought that it would be misleading to provide that an agreement arrived at should be certified and have the effect of an award under section 24 unless it was in settlement of an interstate dispute; and the proviso therefore requires the judge to satisfy himself that the agreement has been made in settlement of an interstate dispute before he purports to give it the effect of an award by certifying it. From the legal stand-point therefore that possibility is provided against. If the parties fail to arrive at an agreehave no constitutional power to handle it , ment the proposed section provides for the service of a summons to show cause why an award should not be made. Every person concerned thus has an opportunity to attend before the court and submit reasons why an award should not be made, and the court is given power to make whatever award it chooses to make. The matter will then be in the hands of the court, and it will operate under the constitutional limitation that it can deal only with an interstate dispute. When the work of the conciliation committee results in either of the conclusions contemplated by the proposed section, that is to say, an agreement or an award, there is a provision which secures in the opinion of the court the validity of the agreement or the award as the case may be. I come now to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr and that a great many matters will be Charlton), the position as to small disputes which are not interstate in character. The circumstances referred to by the honourable member indicate a difficulty which is inherent in all our legislation on this subject, and nothing that this Parliament can do would avoid or abolish it ; but a great deal may be done on alegal basis, and that is provided for in sub-section 2, which sets out that conciliation committees may be appointed in relation to an industrial dispute, not only in an industry, but also in a branch or a section of an industry defined by locality or otherwise^ There are Federal awards in existence in most of the inilr. Latham. dustries of Australia which desire to obtain them, and it is hoped that even in cases where an award has been made, it will be possible to appoint a conciliation committee to deal with matters arising in the industry in relation to the award. For example, take the case of an award which prescribes certain conditions of labour. A difficulty may arise under that award in a single State, and it oan be dealt with by a conciliation committee. if the subject-matter of the difficulty is not in relation to an award, and is confined to one State? ces the Federal Arbitration Court would and nothing this Parliament can do would alter the position. Nevertheless something may be achieved by the appointment of a conciliation com-: mittee. It may successfully hasidle even such a matter as that referred to by the honourable member. If the machinery exists the use of that machinery will be a matter for the parties, and I hope that many difficulties will be satisfactorily adjusted without legal proceedings. court cannot take cognizance of a local dispute ? of this legislation will be that conciliation committees with some permanence of character will be appointed in relation to industries and sections of industries, that they will meet from time to time, adjusted on the basis of agreement after conference without going through the legal formulas of certifying an agreement or making an award. I hope that giving to the parties an opportunity to meet will result in the settlement of difficulties among themselves which, perhaps, could not be dealt with satisfactorily under the Commonwealth's powers. The utmost we can do is to provide machinery for dealing with those matters which are within our constitutional powers in the hope that when the parties meet face to face they will reference to utilize that machinery for the adjustment of other difficulties between them-' selves.",32,Pairs

I am sure the honourable member w ill agree with me when I say that that view is not shared by the majority of those engaged in the great pastoral industry. MrD . CAMERON information of the honourable member I quote the following, whcih appeared in the SydneyM a i l of the 16th May of this yearWhile compulsory arbitration is heing seriously questioned by the leaders in a number of industries, the pastoral industry in New South Wales is standing solidly for it. For many years arbitration has been the industrial policy of our pastoral interests, as expressed by the Graziers' Association. There is no evidence whatever that our organized pastoral interests have any desire to change this policy. They have found that compulsory arbitration ° has worked satisfactorily in their industry, and they desire to continue it. It is especially worth noting that in the shearing, which is the main section of the pastoral industry covered by compulsory arbitration, there is piecework. The shearer is paid according to the amount of work he does. For example, the shearer who shears 150 sheep in the day makes 50 per cent, more money than the man who shears 100 sheep. "" This means"", Mr F. H. Tout, president of the Graziers' Association, points out, "" that the more efficient men make more money, and this is on the side of progress and a square deal."" Mr Tout further expresses the opinion that "" it would be ever so much better for the secondary industries and consequently for the Commonwealth, if piecework were introduced generally."" It is a remarkable fact that, while so many unions express the keenest hostility to piecework, the Australian Workers Union, which is one of the largest and most powerful unions in the Commonwealth, finds that piecework works well in the pastoral industry, and accepts it as the right policy. It is true that there is a small extremist section in the Australian Workers Union that occasionally attacks the principle, but the great majority of the members have shown that they are not prepared to fall in with this small though militant minority. Shearers, it is generally admitted, make "" big money"", but the point is that the better they work the more money they make. There is no suggestion whatever in the shearing industry of "" slavedriving, "" or of undue speeding-up"". It is belief that the appointment left to the individual shearer as to how many sheep he will shear, and the fact that shearers continue in the industry for a great many years shows that the piecework principle is in no sense of the word a menace to themrather it is an attraction. It is pleasing to note that serious industrial troubles in the pastoral industry are very rare. Wages and conditions are amicably settled in the Federal Arbitration Court, and the awards are in the main, loyally accepted. Both sides are well organized, and it can be said that official relations between the Australian Workers Union and the organized graziers, are very satisfactory. Here is certainly an example of the value of compulsory arbitration. I am not sure of that. It is also interesting to note that among I am. For the the registered organizations of employers under the Federal Arbitration Act are the Graziers' Association of New South Wales, the Pastoralists' Association of West Darling, the Pastoralists' Union of South Riverina, the Pastoralists' Association of Western Australia Incorporated, and the Shearers Contractors' Association of New South Wales. During the second-reading debate on this bill, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) referred to the fact that I was once associated with the pastoral industry, as my family has been for generations, and also to an article which was published in the Pastoral Review of 1921. I have not been able to find in the Library the copy in which it appeared, but I think it referred to migration, and in it, according to the honourable member, it was said that the view of the graziers was that no advance could be made until compulsory arbitration was abolished.

TheH i g h Court in 1906 in the Pedder case and Webb case declared, in effeot, that the Federal Arbitration Act in a certain respect was ultra vires, because the Federal Parliament, under the Deakin Ministry, specifically included railway men in the act. There are approximately 130,000 workers in the State railways and State public services. These State public servants have either been working under or are in process of securing Federal awards. What effect w ill this section have upon that large body of employees?

Accordingly they made application, and "" after much expense secured registration.

Isi t not possible under this proposed new section for the judge to have the right to say to members of such organizations-""As State railway employees or public servants, you may seek redress in this court, but I have the right to say whether or not you should not submit your claims to a State authority.""

Alreadyi t has the power to do that under section 38 ( h ) , which provides that the court It was then has power to dismiss any matter or part of a matter or refrain from further hearing or from determining a dispute if it appears that the dispute is proper to be dealt with by a State industrial authority. In the railway dispute, application was made to the court under that section, inviting the court to exercise its power. The application failed and it was renewed at a recent date, when the court re-affirmed its prior decision. The Arbitration Court has proceeded with the hearing of that case because it expressly decided that it was not a dispute that is proper to be dealt with by a State authority.

169,Mr Latham,"As I have shown, theact does not apply' to them and this Parliament is unable by any action it can take to include them within it. There is no doubt, I take it, that if we agree to this proposed section, we shall in more emphatic manner than hitherto, give legislative approval to a practice which is already in operation under the provisions of section 38 h of the principal act. To my knowledge, the court has on a number of occasions, already declared that matters brought before them might have been more appropriately dealt with by State tribunals. The first question that arises in this connection is whether their Honours are not really considering to some extent their own comfort and convenience in remitting to State tribunals matters over which they have jurisdiction but do not wish to deal with. That may be regarded as a somewhat unworthy suggestion, but as one accustomed to dealing with matters in other jurisdictions I know that it is not an uncommon thing to hear the judge protest against cases being submitted to his court which might have been dealt with effectively elsewhere. Judge say recently, that his court was being clogged with State disputes? sume that it represents his view. But I suggest to the Attorney-General that as a general rule, it is not for the judiciary to declare that it will not deal with matters on the ground of over-work or otherwise, because they might have been dealt with by another tribunal. We know that many matters are brought before the Supreme Courts of the States, which might perhaps have been more cheaply and equally effectively dealt with by County Courts. Their Honours sometimes express themselves to that effect. There is machinery, it is true, for remitting cases to less expensive courts, if good reasons can be stated for doing so; but apart from that it does not, as a general rule, rest with a court to say that it will not deal with the matter submitted to it, and I very much doubt whether it would be a good principle to introduce. The proposed section, as the Attorney-General desires to amend it, reads: "" The court shall in the case of every industrial dispute consider, in the course of the' hearing . . ."" The addition of these words "" in the course of the hearing"" may lead to unexpected results. The jurisdiction of the court may not even be brought into question. « We spent a good deal of time this morning discussing the complicated machinery which must be put in motion to enable these matters' to come before the court. The number of respondents to be cited was mentioned. I think the Attorney-General said that in the clothing trade, between 9,000 and 10,000 respondents had to be served. We are seeking, in this bill, to minimize that trouble by providing for the issuing of representative orders. But I ask the Attorney-General to recollect that before a case is actually being heard before a court, a great deal of work has been done and expense incurred by the organizations concerned. In such circumstances it would be disturbing if "" in the course of the hearing"" the court, although it had jurisdiction to proceed with the case, declared "" it more desirable that the dispute or any part of it should be dealt w it h "" by a State industrial authority, and refrained from continunot the Chief ing the hearing. It is true that in the past it has been possible for the court to refer a matter to another tribunal, but we are now asking it affirmatively to declare that a matter might, with more propriety, be dealt with by a State tribunal. I cannot understand why the clause has been couched in these words. It would surely have been sufficient to state the point in a negative rather than a positive form. Why has this particular wording been used? One may be pardoned for regarding with grave suspicion any proposal by this Government, orthe interests which it represents, to discourage Commonwealth tribunals from dealing with Commonwealth matters. There may be cases of Commonwealth concern which could be dealt with more effectively by a State tribunal. ber was eloquent in arguing the converse point last night. said last night.

The reason for the alteration is that if we are to have a coherent scheme of industrial legislation, we must endeavour T.Q have a line drawn between Eederal and State jurisdictions, It is impracticable to do this politically; attempts to arrive at agreements with the States have failed. NQW we are prqposing that the court shall be, required to satisfy itself that it is better that the matter before it shall be dealt with by it than by a State authority. In making up its mind the court has to consider principally the nature or circumstances of the industry affected. Unless we are to abandon all attempts to define the areas of the Federal aud State industrial authorities, we should impose upon the court the definite duty of determining in every case whether the matter should be dealt with by it or by a State authority. I am not convinced that the Attorney General is not imposing more duties on the court than he is taking away. Under paragraph h of section 38, the court has discretionary power to decide whether a matter shall be dealt with by it or by a State authority. The provision now before the committee makes such a determination mandatory in all cases, and I can conceive of considerable argument taking place before the court as to whether the case should be tried by it or referred to a State tribunal. wasted in preliminary argument. because it is most important to determine actly how they stand in relation to the whether the dispute should be dealt with court. by the one authority or the other. to decide that in every dispute that comes what this Parliament says or does can before it. circumstances. do so Under the existing law.

218,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.50],"In myheard by a State court as by the Eederal court. the State court should deal with it. with previous clauses, and with the contention of the Attorney-General that the awards of the Federal court should prevail. One of the objects of .establishing Federal courts is to obtain uniform laws throughout the Commonwealth. The existing provisions are ample to meet every possible case. The present clause savours of instructing the court to drive the parties away from it. Numbers of clauses that have already been passed, are calculated to have that effect, and now the committee is invited to agree to another of the same nature. I oppose the clause. The more 1 consider this clause the more unnecessary it seems to be. It appears to cast a reflection on the court. We give the Federal court power under paragraph h of section 38 to refer a matter to a State court, if it seems to the court to be desirable that it should be dealt with by a State tribunal. This clause seems to be a reflection on the court, because one ought to assume that if the court thought it deto. sirable to refrain from dealing with the matter, or to refer it to a State court, it would do so as a matter of duty.

At the present time the court under its awards fairly frequently orders that accredited officers of the unions, generally with the consent of the registrar, may inspect establishments where work is proceeding which is subject to the conditions of awards. On the one hand the Government has been asked to give statutory power to all union officials to go into works or factories for the purpose of seeing that awards are observed. The Government has refused to accede to that request. It considers that as a general rule it is proper that the duties of inspection and enforcement should be in the hands of officers of the Commonwealth and not in the hands of representatives of one of the parties to an award. On the other hand, employers have asked the Commonwealth to make provision for the exclusion of all union officials from works, but the Commonwealth Governmeut has also rejected that request. It is.prepared to run the risk of making itself unpopular with both sides on this matter. It is clear that so far as possible this work should the done by officers who are impartial. Nevertheless, the Government must recognize the existing condition of affairs under which the union officers have the right, when the court itself has provided for it in awards, to enter works and factories, subject to conditions prescribed by the court, for the purpose of seeing that those awards are observed. It may be that after the appointment of a sufficient number of inspectors there will be a less onerous task imposed on the unions in this respect; hut the passing of this clause will not prevent the court, where it thinks proper, giving powers of policing an award-to use the common phrase-to union officials. Under section 41 of the act, persons may be empowered to inspect places where work is carried on, which is under consideration in an industrial dispute, or as to which an award has been made. is not proposed to repeal that section. The judges, accordingly, will still have the same power to make awards in which, in cases where they think properj <-,union officials may be given this rights of inspection. These union officials have not such a right at present except where The only question the judges think it proper that they should have it. In future Commonwealth inspectors will, I anticipate, relieve the unions of a good deal of expense that is incurred by them in policing awards. make use of the services of existing inspectors in the States? section 50A, subsection 3, arrangements may be made in accordance with section 78 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act for the purpose of utilizing the services of officers of the public service of a State, and the services of those officers will be utilized to the extent that they are available to perform the work required of them by the Commonwealth. The Government's proposal in this respect does not compromise the position of either party in industry, and the clause ought to be agreed to, I submit, on the ground that it is a recognition of the responsibility of the Commonwealth to administer and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth. I am pleased to hear that the Attorney General does not intend to deprive the Arbitration Court of the power to authorize officers of unions to inspect works and factories. All honourable members will, I am sure, admit that properly accredited union officials are not. likely to interfere with industry or make themselves obnoxious to employers. They cannot carry out their inspections unless they are appointed by the court. I have received a letter from Mr Carter, the General Secretary of the Federated Clothing Employees of Australia. Mr Carter, who is a member of the Melbourne City Council, writes that even if Government inspectors are appointed, they will not be able to carry out all the duties, but he thinks that the Commonwealth inspectors and union inspectors can be very helpful to one another. It is part and parcel of It the award in the clothing trade that inspectors should be appointed by the union and Mr Carter writes that although there are some exceptionally strict judges on the bench at the present time, he does not know of any complaint having",45,Pairs

Ample notice of a visit of an inspector has to be given to the employers, as is provided for in the following award given by Judge DrakeBrockman :A t least six hours' notice shall be given by such authorized person or persons prior to his or their actual going on the premises, and the employer shall be notified of his or their arrival, and shall in person, or by his nominee, for certain trades or industries, and be entitled to accompany the authorized person or persons and shall provide access to the wages book or time sheet or records of any employee including outdoor workers bound by the award. The work and duties of the employees shall be interfered with as little as possible by the authorized person. I hope that the Attorney-General will allow the present system to remain. The judge has to satisfy himself as to the qualifications of the persons appointed as inspectors, and the inspector who does anything derogatory to the rules laid down can be removed from his position at very short notice. hope that on the appointment of inspectors there will be no dual inspection. One of the most fruitfu l sources of friction is the action of an indiscreet officer when making inspections. I am quite prepared to submit an industry to inspection, but not to a dual inspection. In any locality in which inspectors are appointed there should be no possibility of persons representing either side in industry making further inspections in that industry. If the Attorney-General makes that quite clear, I shall be satisfied, but if not, I propose to move an amendment, to the clause. General) [5.16] I understand that the honourable member for Wannon( Mr vide that so soon as inspectors are apRodgers) is suggesting that the power of the official inspectors to inspect should be made exclusive, and that the courts should not have power to permit any other person to ascertain whether an award is being carried out ? accept an amendment of that kind. We have at present scores of awards operating all over Australia, and we should be quite unjustified in endeavouring to appoint inspectors to visit all the places in Australia at which work is being carried on. that. I ask the Attorney-General to make an arrangement that will prevent dual inspection. better left with the judges of the court. For example, an inspector may be appointed for waterside work, or because it is specialized work he will be required to make himself familiar with particular conditions in those trades or industries. If a ful l staff were later appointed it would not be necessary for the court to allow union officials tbe right of inspection; but, at the present time, I put it to the honourable member that it is wiser for the Commonwealth to appoint inspectors where it considers the appointment advisable, and to leave it to the court to decide, having regard to the provision of Commonwealth inspectors, whether it is necessary or desirable that representatives of the union should have the right to police awards. fied provided that the Attorney-General definitely assures me that there will not be two inspectors employed OD one class of work. give such an assurance. If there is a sufficient number of inspectors for a particular industry, it may very well happen that the judge will decide that it is unnecessary to confer any rights of inspection on the union officer. That matter must be determined by the judge after having taken into consideration the circumstances of the industry concerned. It would be impossible to legislate to propointed the representatives of the unions, shall have no right of inspection.

I invite him to givo the committee some instances of that, because we have it from a judge of the court that there has not been one solitary instance of friction from that source.
