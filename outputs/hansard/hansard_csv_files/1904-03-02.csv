The precedent of other Parliaments, .already followed by this House, is that the so ably devoted to the discharge of the nomination of the Speaker shall be made duties of his high office in the past Parand supported by members not holding liament. office; but as I understand that there is no likelihood of opposition being offered Ho rise with the object of striking any discordant the election of the honourable gentlenote at this stage; but I think that the House man who has hitherto filled that high ought to be made aware of what I believe to position, it seems to me fitting that our be a constitutional impediment to the occu-choice should be expressed in a manpancy by Sir Frederick Holder, not merely ner somewhat more formal than has of the office of Speaker, but of the posibeen customary.

I am gratified to be able to say that the Speaker in the first Federal Parliament was successf u l in earning the entire confidence and approval of honourable members belonging to all political parties. I may, perhaps, be permitted to add that in the midst of the congratulations which I shall presently offer to the Speaker on his re-election there will be a certain tinge of regret, because I feel that the distinguished capacity for public affairs of the honourable member who is the iubject of the present motion, is such that his removal from the arena of active politics will be a great loss to the people of Australia. Whilst, however, I feel that sensation of regret in the midst of our unanimity of praise and congratulation, I wish also to say that honourable members on this side of the House view, with great pleasure and satisfaction, the confidence which the second Federal Parliament is now showing in the Speaker of the first Federal Parliament. of the members of the Labour PartyI have great pleasure in supporting the motion.

After three years' experience we submit myself to the will of the all share the conviction that the great rights and privileges of Parliament which are to a large extent intrusted to the Speaker could not be placed in better hands. Whilst felicitating you, I feel that congratulation is really clue to the House, which has done honour to itself by the choice which it has made in again placing you in the position of the First Commoner of the Commonwealth. heartily congratulate you, Mr Speaker, upon your re-election to your high and To-day I honourable office.

30,That Mr Speaker Be Requested To Convey The,"Federal movement. As a member of the National Convention which drafted the Constitution under which the Commonwealth came into existence, and subsequently as a member of this House, and one of the leading lieutenants of the Opposition, he played a part signalized throughout by extreme courtesy to all his fellow members, coupled with a parliamentary ability which merited for him the high place he gained in the esteem and respect of the House. can ill afford to part with men of affairs of such great and varied experience, men of scholarly and literary tastes, who have also made their mark in the field of practical achievement. They could ill be spared from any representative assembly in the world. 'His was a jfigure which any assembly must have been proud to possess, one which Ave shall long remember, and whose loss we all deplore. the Government in taking the course they have followed, and the Prime Minister by the remarks which he has made in submitting this motion, have both pursued a line of conduct which commends itself to the feelings of the House. I desire to add but a few words to the graceful references which the honourable gentleman has made. It can be well understood, Mr Speaker, that we deeply feel the loss which we on this side of the House have sustained, in common, . as the Prime Minister has justly said, with the House generally, and the whole of the people of Australia. A more loyal friend and ally-and I think I shall command the concurrence of all honourable members opposite, when I say a more honourable opponent-tha n the late right honourable member never lived. 'will fill a conspicuous place in the annals not only of the Commonwealth, but of the Empire. His was a singularly attractive and signally useful career. I am sure that we all feel reluctant to invade the sacred sorrow which must fill that home, in which he was loved so well, by the side of the Tasman Sea; and yet we consider that it is our duty to place upon the records of the House an enduring monument to the worth of the departed statesman, and a record of our unfeigned sympathy with his widow and children. all members of the House will join in the expressions of regret to which utterance has just been given by the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. I do not suppose there is one honourable member, no matter to what party he may belong, who does not deeply deplore the removal from our midst of a gentleman so distinguished in politics, and, in other respects, in the Empire's history, as was the late Sir Edward Braddon. I am sure that we all feel a desire that we may have many more men in the We history of the British Empire who, in many different capacities, will help as the late right honourable member has done, to advance the name of Englishmen among the nations of the world. I join with those who have just spoken in expressing the deepest possible regret at his departure from amongst us. Question resolved in the affirmative.

As copies of .His Excellency's speech will be handed to honourable members presently, I will assume that it is their clesire that it be taken as read. That a committee consisting of Sir Langdon Bonython, Mr Mauger, Sir Malcolm McEacharn, and Mr Storrer, be appointed to prepare an Address in Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of Parliament. .

If private members are to have an opportunity to bring business before the House, it should be afforded on Thursday afternoons, between the hours of half-past 2 and 6 o'clock, at which hour Government business could take precedence, giving Fridays up also to Government business. If Friday be a Government day, a good attendance will be insured; but if it be set apart for private members' business, the experience of the previous sessions will be'repeated, and has predicted, may be enjoyed by himself representatives living in New South Wales and South Australia, who can conveniently et away to their homes at the week end, will do so, making it impossible to take private members' business for want of a quorum. Inmy opinion it would be better to give no opportunity for the discussion of private members' business than to make a farce of the matter by setting apart Fridays.

The Address in Reply was read by the Clerk as follows:May it please Your Excellency, We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. move That the Address be agreed to by the House. I should like, at the outset, to heartily reciprocate, on behalf of honourable members, the good wishes expressed in the speech of His Excellency. I am sure that we all trust that the bountiful harvest to which he has alluded, and the good times which he and his good lady, as well as by the community generally. I am sure, too, that honourable members join with the Government in the hope expressed that the war between Japan and Russia may soon terminate, and that the neutrality of Great Britain may be maintained. I agree that it is the duty of the Government to learn as much as possible from the experience of other nations, and I therefore hope that the intention to send an experienced military officer to the seat of war will be carried into effect. I trust, however, that the officer chosen will be an Australian. I am sorry that there has been an inclination on the part of those in authority to rather keep back officers of Australian, birth and training, and I hope, therefore, that the Government will require that an Australian soldier shall be sent on this important mission. I heartily congratulate the Treasurer upon the good work which he did in connection with the recent Conference between him and the Treasurers of the States. The difficulties in the way of funding the debts of the States are exceedingly great, because problems to be solved are so intricate. Still, a matter is in good hands when the rightalthough a great deal Has not yet been accomplished, .1 look forward to the time.

Such an event is to be heartily welcomed, and I hope that the present Government will bring it about, so that we may have something more than a mere promise. Old-age Pensions Departments in some of the States, they are not all working satisfactorily, while there are States in which this great privilege-o r right, as I should rather call it is denied to the people. have no claim to a pension at all. member must have been pained to learn that a large number of old and worthy colonists cannot obtain pensions because they are living other than those in which they were born. There has been quite a number of such cases, and there will be no satisfactory settlement of the difficulty until we' establish a national system of pensions, making the pensions a right and not a mere dole. am reminded by the Minister for Defence that the Minister for Home Affairs when in power there gave New South Wales its OldAge Pension Act. I hope that he will determine that the Cabinet of which he is now a member shall confer a similar benefit upon the Commonwealth.

Acording to this report, the duties levied by Russia amount to 131 per cent., by.the United States to 73 per cent., by Austria-Hungary to 35 per cent., by France to 34 per cent., by Italy to 37 per cent., by is that, notwithstanding the high duties Germany to 35 per cent, by Belgium to 13 per cent., and by Australia, the lowest of all, to a little over 6 per cent. Notwithstanding the fact that Russia imposes duties amounting to 131 per cent., I find that the United Kingdom, in 1902, imported from Russia goods which I think ought to have been imported from Australia, in the shape of food-stuffs to the value of £13,500,000, and raw materialto the value of £10,000,000. these goods? made arrangements by which the goods could be supplied by Australia, though there, is no doubt we ought to supply them. In addition, the United Kingdom imported from Russia manufactures to the value of £195,000, semi-manufactures to the value of £205,000, and other articles to the value of £1,170,000. This gives a total of £25,000,000 worth of imports into Great Britain from Russia, a country which imposes duties to the extent of 131 per cent. as prepared by the Board of Trade, which shows the duties on articles imported from Great Britain, and does not give a general average. of duties in South Africa7 per cent., and in Australia, 6 per cent. ? tries are suffering. suffering, as I shall show directly. reduced. from is a table showing the ""estimated average ad valorem equivalent import dutieslevied by the undermentioned countries on the principle articles of British export from the United Kingdom."" there they are imported here. able member's pardon, but that is the case. In Russia the duties on these articles amount to 131 per cent., whereas in Australia they amount to 7 per cent., and my point imposed in Russia, Great Britain in 1901imported from that country £25,000,000 worth of goods. prove ? dition to the duties imposed at present by the Commonwealth would not in any way prevent trade with Great Britain. It further, proves that Russia took £i4,ooo ooo worth 4 of goods from the United Kingdom in the same year, thus showing that these duties do not in any way interfere with trade. The imports to which I have alluded embrace a large number of articles in which our farmers and producers are deeply interested. The returns show that from British possessions in 1902 there was m; ported £2,534,286 worth of butter, while from foreign countries there was imported no less than £17,992,404 worth. I ^contend that by proper arrangements a large percentage of. this trade ought to be st cured to the Commonwealth, and not allowed to go to Russia and other foreign countries.",20,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

The minimum wage should be £ 1 , and only 10 per cent, paid to the men as pocket money during service. direct attention to a very important conference of the Society of Architects and Engineers which took place in China last year. Mr Stuart, a member of the Society, saidAs a result of a rather long experience in superintending Chinese labour, he had great Tespect for Chinese workmen. He could not perform so much work in a given time as the white man because he was not so strong, but he made some amends for this by working on Saturday afternoons, Sundays and holidays. His working year contained about 15 per cent, more working hours than the British workman's, and he seldom went on strike. I hold that this has to do with Australian and British workmen, inasmuch as it lowers the standard of living, and is degrading to all white labour. -going on in Central Africa for ages. It is -a horrible thing. same conference, saidThe previous speaker had undoubtedly proved it is wanted as cheaply as possible. that the Chinamen were from 40 per cent, to 50 Queensland authorities, I am glad to know, per cent, cheaper in most industries than white' are doing much to facilitate the attainment labour.

In view of such observations, and in view of the fact that we did so much in regard to the South African war, we are quite within the range of our business when we enter an emphatic protest against introducing Chinese labour into the mines of South Africa. I would briefly allude to the proclamation of the Defence Act, and would say that to me it is a matter of regret that this Act did not incorporate a Council of Defence, such as I advocated on the floor of this House. Great Britain has recently adopted such a Council, and has abrogated the old system of governing the army member's advocacy? been adopted since the question was discussed here. It will also be noticed that the United States Government has done the same thing, and that even Japan has got rid of her Generalissimo, or Commanderin-Chief, and has adopted such a Council. I do not wish to cast any reflection on any gentleman at present occupying a high post in connection with our defence forces, but I do hope that before any future appointments are made the Government will consider the subject, and review the whole staff system, with a view of bringing our forces more into line with the idea of a citizen soldiery. in the Cabinet. gentleman referred to will not dominate in the wrong direction.

I am quite sure that the Government will recognise the decisions given by this House in regard to both of those questions. I notice that.the Government are making inquiries. I hope that they are making inquiries from the right people. I have not much confidence in official reports; and I trust that no step will be taken until the House has again had an opportunity of debating and. reviewing the decisions they arrived at.

While I recognise fulky the magnitude of the work which had to be done, I cannot help thinking that the desire to be over-economical tended to a great extent to make the difficulties greater than they would otherwise have been. A number of men were put into positions in which they knew Jess about the work than the work knew about them. In many instances these men, if they were not sweated, were paid miserable pittances for the work which they did. Poll clerks were paid 15/ for a day of something like 16 hours. The State always paid something over £ 1 for similar work. I hope that the Government will do something more than rectify mistakes.

He is placing the responsibility upon the wrong shoulders. Eight or nine of the Victorian constituencies' are represented by gentlemen who were returned by minorities, and this ought not to be permitted. In Germany they have overcome the difficulty by means of a second ballot, and I hope that the Government will give the introduction of some system with a similar object their : earnest and careful consideration.

It is a matter for congratulation that the drought has passed away, arid that the past year has been one of plenty. The State from which I come has suffered, not from drought, but from too much water, which has to a very large extent spoiled our harvest.

It is a matter for regret that twogreat nations should have entered upon a war; and I trust we shall be spared the consequences of any interference by Great Briglad, to see that a proposal is made with regard to the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth.

In order to avoid this we has been too much extravagance in the should levy higher duties upon foreign States, and perhaps also under the Commongoods than upon those imported from Great wealth administration, and I am glad that Britain. The old country has stood by r.s the Government have resolved to carry on in the past, and will continue to befriend our business with due-regard for economy. us, and therefore, by giving preference to I fully endorse the action of the Governher products, we shall not only, confer an ment in reference to the message sent from Mr Storrer. I believe so many representatives of Australia in the the Commonwealth to the old country, regarding the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaal. I do not go the whole length with some of my friends in reference to prohibiting the introduction of Chinamen, but after Australians and Canadians, and, in fact, the men of all the Britcharged in other portions of the Commonish dominions have shed their blood in the Transvaal in defence of the rights of British subjects, it is not right that Chinamen should be imported.,fo perform Work which should be given to our fellow white subjects. I trust, therefore, that our interference in what may be regarded in some .quarters as other' people's business will have ;some effect, and that the importation of Chinamen into the Transvaal will not be persisted in, but that British subjects will be employed in recovering gold from the mines there. If Chinamen are imported into the Transvaal, they will take back all the money they can, and thus enrich their own country. allow them to take away much money. of the mine-owners' is to procure cheap labour, but the mines should be so worked as to'enable a fair .day's wage to be paid for a fair day's work. That is the only way in which a prosperous community can be built up, I do not intend to refer to the question of the selection of the Federal Capital site, because that will be more fully discussed later on. I am glad to see. that tbe Defence Forces in the various States are to be placed upon a.uniform footing. I regret that, owing to some misunderstanding last year, some of the Tasmanian volunteers were not paid at the same rates as were the men in other States. ment objected to their receiving the higher scale of pay. that can be proved. I have not yet seen any documents upon the subject, and I do not know anything about it. At any rate, I am not responsible for the acts of the Tasmanian Government. I hold that all the men connected with the Defence Forces should be placed upon the same footing, irrespective of any wish expressed by a State Government. I am glad to learn that there is no longer ground for complaint, and that the forces in all the States are to be treated upon a uniform basis. I note that a conference of representatives of position, and I have pleasure in complying the Governments interested in the Pacific cable is shortly to be held in London, and I trust that one result of its deliberations will be to place Tasmania upon the same footing as that occupied by the other five States of the Commonwealth. I utterly fail to see why its people should be required to pay telegraphic rates which are in excess of those wealth. To be compelled to pay an additional halfpenny upon ""every word which is contained in messages despatched to and from that State constitutes a very great hardship, especially so far as thePress is concerned. Surely if Federation be worth anything, the States in .this matter should be placed upon an equality. I trust, therefore, that the existing evil will be speedily remedied, and that in future Tasmania will be granted a fair field. Its people ask for no' favour. The inequalities and anomalies which have discovered themselves iii our Electoral Act will, I hope, be quickly remedied. Personally, I am in favour of our elections being conducted under the Hare system. I have never yet found any one who has investigated the merits of that system and who has had experience of its working who does not prefer it to the block system which operated in connection with the recent Senate elections. Under these circumstances I am exceedingly hopeful that the' Hare system will be con-, sidered when we are amending the Electoral Act. I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address in Reply. my honourable friends who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address in Reply had an opportunity afforded them to see His Excellency the Governor General's speech before honourable members listened to it in the SenateChamberI had not that advantage, and I feel that it is only right I should havs some littH opportunity to consider that speech, which was a long and very important one. Under these circumstances, and following the usual practice, I move That this debate be adjourned until to-morrow.
