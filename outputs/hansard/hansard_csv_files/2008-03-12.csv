Wednesday, 12 March 2008 ----Mr Trevor Drayton Hunter winemaker Trevor Drayton. He was killed in tragic circumstances at the Drayton winery in Pokolbin on 17 January 2008. Eddie Orgo was also killed and William Rikard-Bell was left with burns to 80 per cent of his body. Trevor was not only an industry leader, renowned the country over, but also a personal friend. Trevor will be sadly missed, not only by me but by his many friends and of course his close-knit family. Trevor was the beloved son of Max and Caroline Drayton and the cherished partner of Abesi Mwenda. Trevor was a much loved brother, brother-in-law and uncle to John and Jan, Greg and Chris, Peter and Leesa, and their families. Trevor’s work in the community was outstanding and he leaves the legacy of a man who made a difference well beyond his incredible contribution to the wine industry. Trevor was regarded not only as an iconic winemaker but also as a man who gave much to his community. Trevor was once transferred by the Westpac rescue helicopter and, until his death, he worked tirelessly to repay that debt. Since then the Drayton family has become a major sponsor of the helicopter service, providing wines for special occasions to help boost the finances for the organisation. Trevor never had any doubt he would carry on the family tradition of winemaking. He always wanted to be a winemaker and all his energies were aimed in that direction. In 1973 Trevor left home to attend Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia to start a five year course in oenology. In his time at Roseworthy, Trevor topped his second year and won a silver medal, topped his third year and won a gold medal, and topped his final year and was awarded dux of the course. Upon his return, he took up the position of winemaker for the family business. He produced many classic wines, including ‘William’ Shiraz, ‘Caroline’ Sparkling Burgundy, ‘Maxwell’ Shiraz and ‘Suzanne’ Semillon, but the most notable was the 1985 ‘Joseph’ Shiraz, which was awarded the Douglas Seabrook Memorial Trophy for best red wine in show at the 1995 Royal Melbourne Wine Show. Trevor was past president of the Hunter Valley Vineyard Association and was instrumental in the push for federal government funding, through Tourism Australia, after the devastating floods in June last year. The Drayton family are one of the Hunter Valley’s pioneering winemaking families, and Drayton is one of the few companies that are still family owned and operated. Trevor had a dream: to build a Hunter wine museum that would show the proud heritage of wine in the region and to display the equipment that pioneered the industry as we know it today. I will be speaking to other members from the Hunter region to help bring Trevor’s dream to reality. This would be a tribute not only to Trevor but to all who came before him and all who will come after him. May his soul rest in peace. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Amendments To Standing Orders Set Up By The Engineer Of Friday Sit Orders Tings The Leader Of The House Would Not
275,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 9.42 Am.,,176,Statements By Members
276,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (9.43 Am),"I rise today to record the sad passing of renownedMoreton Electorate: Roads Rudd Labor government are driving real transport solutions in the Moreton electorate. Within our first 100 days of government, we announced the preferred option for the Kessels Road and Mains Road intersection upgrade to deal with a major traffic headache on Brisbane’s southside. The upgrade will involve the construction of an underpass to take Kessels Road traffic under Mains Road. Kessels Road traffic will travel along a more free-flowing road, which will vastly reduce air and noise pollution for local residents as this road carries the greater number of heavy commercial vehicles. This should result in a decrease in diesel particulate matter especially. An average of 70,000 vehicles are already using the intersection each day, including more than 5,000 trucks and buses doing local business. I am pleased that cabinet has approved $300 million towards construction of the project, but I also recognise that, unfortunately, there will be some impact on local residents and businesses. Nevertheless, from day one the local community has been fully involved in this Rudd government project, and the federal and Queensland governments will continue to engage with the community through a detailed consultation process. The feedback will help shape a business case for the project. Separating the two roads with an underpass will ease access into suburbs straight away and will cater for the expected growth on Brisbane’s great southside for at least the next 20 years. I am also pleased to inform the House that construction is progressing well on the $113 million Acacia Ridge rail overpass on Beaudesert Road. The 18-month project will see a 1.4kilometre section of the interstate standard-gauge freight rail corridor lowered about 10 metres and two three-lane road vehicle bridges constructed. For years, southside residents have had to put up with long traffic delays at this rail crossing. Thankfully, when the overpass is completed, motorists will no longer face delays of up to 15 minutes-me included-while kilometre-long interstate freight trains grind slowly through the crossing at sloth-like speeds. It will also boost safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to get around the Acacia Ridge area. Work is also underway to construct sound barriers on Riawena Road-an important link in the Brisbane urban corridor. The need for noise barriers on Riawena Road was first identified in the Brisbane Urban Corridor Planning Study, which was undertaken way back in 2002. Since my election in November, I have been working hard with the state member for Yeerongpilly Simon Finn to ensure this important work is completed as soon as possible. While I am pleased to see progress on these fronts, I am conscious that this speech should have been made 10, 11 or 12 years ago. Instead, the people of Moreton have waited and waited and waited. They grew tired of the ‘all talk and no action’ agenda of the previous government. There is still much to be done and that is why we, together with all levels of government, are getting on with the job of improving transport infrastructure in Moreton.

278,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.48 Am),"I once lived in Brisbane but in 1968-before thethere at the moment. It took me half an hour recently to go from the Storey Bridge down Ann Street. It is just hopeless. In my electorate of Herbert in Townsville, I have Australia’s largest Army base, by far. There are several battalions but we also have a very significant RAAF component. We have moved all of Australia’s Caribou aircraft-which service the Army-up to Townsville, and that has created two issues. First of all, we do need more hardstand. I ask the Defence infrastructure group to have a look at that issue urgently, because when we have major operations there is not enough area to park aircraft. We really do need to solve that problem, hand-inhand with the commercial operators of the Townsville Airport, so that we have the facilities necessary to park aircraft in times of major operations. The second issue is that the Caribous are pretty old now. I have heard rumours within my RAAF community that the Caribous will cease flying in about two years and there is nothing to replace them. I would like to put those rumours to bed. I would like my people in RAAF Townsville to know and understand that the Caribous are going to continue flying. They have a very solid airframe which could go on for decades yet. Yes, there are some minor issues with the engines, but those aircraft are going to keep flying and they are going to continue to run out of RAAF Townsville. All of the staff at that particular wing can be assured that their jobs are protected. I would also like to indicate to the parliament that on SundayI was at Holsworthy Army base visiting the Chief of Army Cadet Team Challenge. A mighty fine group of young men and women from all around Australia were there competing in a whole range of tasks and demonstrating their professionalism in what they do. We are very lucky to have the cadets in our system. They provide leadership skills and training skills and, of course, they also provide a source of new recruits for the Australian Defence Force. I thank all the cadet leaders around Australia for their voluntary work, because they really contribute to the future leaders of our country and to our Australian Defence Force. Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Seaford wetlands, a large part of which are in my electorate of Isaacs, as well as the work of the Friends of Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands, a dedicated community group. The wetlands are listed under the Ramsar convention as being of international significance. The two sites which make up the wetlands are the last remnants of a formerly extensive wetland, the Carrum Carrum swamp. During the 19th century, this swamp was largely drained for agricultural activities. Over the last 30 years, there has been extensive rehabilitation and active management by Melbourne Water. There have been massive changes to the local landscape since European settlement so that the wetlands are now surrounded by suburban development, which makes the preservation of these wetlands particularly important. The Edithvale-Seaford wetlands support a very rich biodiversity. Of particular note is the importance of the area as a site for migratory birds, including some 25 species listed on the Japan-Australia and China-Australia migratory bird agreements. In particular, it supports more than one per cent of the flyway population of the sharp-tailed sandpiper. The area also supports significant populations of the Australasian bittern, a species listed as endangered by MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members
279,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (9.51 Am),"I would like to speak today about the Edithvalethe Victorian government. It is also an area of noteworthy flora, with 41 plant taxa of regional significance having been recorded in these wetlands. Finally, the wetlands are of social and cultural significance, especially as an example of the benefits of active management to the preservation of the wetlands. The wetlands are important as a centre for nature based recreation within the local community and the region as a whole. On any weekend, one can see many local residents enjoying these wetland environments. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Friends of Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands for their work in protecting the environment of this area. Their endeavours are of great importance to the local environment and to the local community generally. This group has worked for the last 30 years to protect the wetlands and, as Jenny Lindell, the member for Carrum in the state parliament put it recently, to maintain a ‘vigilant watch’ over this area. Recently, the group has had difficulties in recruiting members to serve on the executive committee to help run the organisation. I know that many community organisations face the problem not so much of getting volunteers but of getting an executive committee to do the management. The friends put out a call to the community and I am told that they received a good response. I hope, as do many members of our community, that they will continue their important work in the years ahead. Debate interrupted. ticipants in the Interparliamentary Study Program for 2008.

Grey Electorate: Tunarama Festival morning I would like to bring to this House’s attention a beautiful city in my electorate and a fantastic event. The city is Port Lincoln on the Lower Eyre Peninsula. Port Lincoln is the home of the biggest fishing fleet in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a beautiful, stunning place to visit. To visit Port Lincoln is to love Port Lincoln; it is a fantastic place. It is a growth centre for aquaculture in our nation. It is also the home of the southern bluefin tuna industry and the home of the Tunarama Festival, which has been running for 47 years. This last year it attracted 28,000 people. Port Lincoln is a city of less than 10,000 people, so it is a significant influx. The festival highlights the region’s seafood, art, wine, music and people and the fantastic landscapes around Port Lincoln. For three fantastic days the four local wineries and seafood producers occupy the yacht club and produce a good amount of cheer. It is a good showcase for our wares. The festival is centred on the foreshore, which is the home of the now-famous Makybe Diva statue-a statue of the only horse to win the Melbourne Cup three times. There are stalls, music and food stores. One of the highlights is the tuna tossing competition, where people throw an eight-kilogram tuna as far as they can.

281,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (9.55 Am),"I also welcome the delegation. Enjoy our country. Thispian, Sean Carlin, with a 37-metre throw, but I might point out that my neighbour, Steven Hitch, from Buckleboo-I live 200 kilometres north of that-has won the competition for three out the last four years. Hitchy, a character at the best of times, says that he is the greatest tosser in the world. The Tunarama Quest also raises a great deal of money for charity. This is a fantastic quest that has been going on for the length of the festival, and I might point out that this year’s winner in the quest, Alicia Schillabeer, after being told she had won the quest, was overcome with emotion on the stage. Her boyfriend came through the crowd, came up on the stage, popped down on one knee and asked her to marry him-which left not a dry eye in the house, I can tell you. Suffice it to say that this fantastic festival is organised by about 40 volunteers, who volunteer 3,000 hours a year, and it is supported by 130 local businesses. They received only a $5,000 grant from the South Australian Tourism Commission and $30,000 from the local council, but it is a great celebration of the local community doing what it can to help itself and promoting itself. I congratulate them. Corio Electorate Geelong lies the Geelong Botanic Gardens. Dating from 1851, these are the fourth oldest gardens in Australia. Over the years they have had many redevelopments, the last being in 2002, which resulted in a new arid plant display, at the centre of which is the dragon tree. The Geelong Botanic Gardens are served well by the Friends of the Geelong Botanic Gardens, and their president, Jane Salmon. To the north of Corio Bay, and to the east of Geelong Grammar School, are Limeburners Bay and Hovells Creek. It was here on 16 December in 1824 that the Hume and Hovell expedition south of Sydney reached its southernmost point. Along the edges of Limeburners Bay is a group of white mangroves-one of the southernmost mangrove swamps in the world-and this is an important habitat for the endangered orange-bellied parrot. Between these two points lies almost the entirety of Geelong’s bay frontage, around Corio Bay. Along this frontage there are dozens of points of interest and beautiful and historic places which speak of the rich history of Geelong. But there is no continuous walking or biking path which connects these two places-the Geelong Botanic Gardens and Limeburners Bay. To be sure, there are paths along much of the route and there is a bike route which will take you from the botanic gardens to Limeburners Bay, but only after diverting you through much of Geelong’s industrial heart. Indeed, it is the north of Geelong, in the suburbs which are often forgotten, where the bay frontage is least accessible and where the suburbs are most disconnected from the bay. I think that there should be a continuous path-a bike and walking path-which connects the Geelong Botanical Gardens with Limeburners Bay. It is not immediately obvious how one would do this. There would need to be a significant amount of cooperation between the council, the City of Greater Geelong, the port of Geelong and a number of landowners. But if it were able to be done, it would be a wonderful asset for the City of Greater Geelong and it would be a wonderful act of cooperation between all those parties. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Statements By Members
282,Mr Marles (Corio) (9.58 Am),"To the south of Corio Bay and to the east of the City ofThis is a small project which highlights how important Corio Bay is to Geelong. It also highlights how much of Geelong remains disconnected from Corio Bay, particularly out in the northern suburbs, and how important the development of the shore frontage of Corio Bay is to the future of Geelong. There has been some media comment in the last few days about that. I support a greater degree of planning cooperation between the Victorian government and the City of Greater Geelong about planning-and, indeed, a long-term plan-on how we might get development along the front of Corio Bay done properly. For decades Geelong has turned its back on Corio Bay. The city waterfront has been the first occasion where we have seen a reawakening of the bay, and I think that a continuous walking and bike path might just be the trailblazer for Geelong to reconnect to the entirety of Corio Bay. Pension Bonus Scheme which was introduced by the former coalition government in 1998. The Pension Bonus Scheme pays a tax-free lump sum to people who defer claiming their age pension and continue to work. It is a voluntary scheme and, to be eligible, people must register with Centrelink within 13 weeks of reaching the eligible pension age of 63 for women and 65 for men. It gives people who are nearing retirement, and who will be eligible to receive an age pension in the future, a viable option of continuing to work and increase their retirement nest egg. It offers people choice and opportunity. There are almost 13,000 people receiving the age pension in Canning. However, I have had some constituents who have approached me with a couple of glitches in the scheme that preclude them from receiving this bonus. Under the Social Security Act 1991, if a person receives the age pension at any time prior to registering for the scheme, or after they have registered, they are then not eligible for the payment. This is a steadfast rule which, on the face of it, seems to be fair enough because of the blanket rule. But, because of this blanket rule, there is no discretion to be exercised in extenuating cases. Mrs Lonergan of Halls Head claimed the age pension in 1995 for two months. The scheme was not introduced until 1998. She applied and registered and was advised that, if she continued to remain in full-time employment for five continuous years, she would requalify for the bonus. She remained in full-time employment for 12 years and was then informed that she was not entitled. She was penalised, despite the fact that the scheme was not even introduced when she briefly received the pension. Mr and Mrs Brereton of Armadale registered for the scheme in 2003. However, in February 2003, Mr Brereton became redundant and had to apply for income support payments. Mr and Mrs Brereton initially applied for unemployment benefits but, due to their combined earnings for the year to that date, they were advised that they would not qualify for any unemployment benefit; however, they were told that they could receive income support payments by way of the age pension. The first payment of the age pension was payable to them on 1 April 2003 and, by 24 April 2003, Mr Brereton contacted Centrelink to advise that he had successfully gained employment, commencing on 28 April 2003. Centrelink cancelled their income support payments, as their combined incomes had placed them over the threshold. In other words, the 27 days that he received the pension had made him ineligible. I ask that the government look at some ministerial discretion in these matters where people want to stay in the workforce-and, with our current unemployment levels, we do need older, MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Melbourne Grand Prix particularly those in Albert Park and West St Kilda, and commuters in surrounding suburbs, have, first of all, been restricted from and then denied access to the very extensive recreational facilities in the middle of my electorate-the Albert Park Reserve-by the Australian Grand Prix. The Grand Prix takes place this forthcoming weekend. The Melbourne Grand Prix is the first in the international grand prix season. Recently the head of Formula 1, Mr Ecclestone, claimed that he had spoken to the Australian Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he had done no such thing. The local head of the grand prix, Mr Walker, explained that Mr Ecclestone gets his international leaders mixed up and apparently had spoken to the Premier of Victoria. This is an amusing and somewhat indicative example of the international grand prix understanding of local attitudes and personalities in our state and in Melbourne. I think the Victorian government is coming towards a more objective evaluation of the Melbourne Grand Prix. At the moment the Victorian government estimates that the race is involved in a $30 million net loss to the state in terms of the set-up costs-versus the benefits to the people of Victoria. The Australian Grand Prix Corporation of course argues that the promotion of our great city internationally has an unseen value to Melbourne. This reminds me a bit of the argument that the local council put out for the great St Kilda Festival, where they spend millions to promote St Kilda, yet most people already know St Kilda and go there for its great entertainment value anyway. I think a lot of local people resent all of the drunken yobs-we had the term ‘tosser’ used earlier; I think that is appropriate-who tend to disturb many local residents during the St Kilda Festival. The prospect of the Grand Prix being moved to 3.30 in the afternoon for the first time has been raised by the corporation. I notice Mr Walker, the Australian chairman, has proposed moving it to 5.30 pm, which would mean that it would finish around 8.30 pm or 9 pm. And Mr Ecclestone has demanded that the race be run at night. How a race of that nature could be run, even under very powerful lighting, on an inner-city track like that without dangerous consequences escapes me. I am absolutely opposed, as are local residents, to the already great disturbances that are felt being exacerbated by having this race time moved later and later. I hope the Victorian government has a strictly practical attitude towards the evaluation of the benefit of this race to Melburnians. (Time expired) Carer Payments commit to continuing the carer bonus, an initiative created by the Howard government. The bonus to carers is an annual one-off payment made since 2004 and is an essential contribution to the budget of families and carers. This decision to not continue it will impact the most vulnerable in our community. The Labor government are talking about the budget causing pain, but this poorly thought out decision will impact carers and those they care for.

285,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (10.07 Am),"I wish to call on the Australian government toTen-year-old Georgia was born with an undiagnosed genetic condition which has left her with the intellectual and developmental age of an 18-month-old. ‘I’m still feeding her, changing her nappies, giving her a bath, brushing her teeth…all things I should have stopped doing eight years ago,’ her mother Linda says. Again, in Linda’s words: ‘As parents we can never relax. We’re always on edge and trying to anticipate the next step.’ The daily regime begins early with a nappy change. ‘Even to get nappies for a 10-year-old isn’t easy. You can’t just pop down to the supermarket and pick them up if you run out. You have to plan ahead and order them as it takes a week for them to arrive.’ Once she has dressed Georgia, Linda sits her in a modified high chair and feeds her finely mashed food. ‘ThenI do all personal care such as teeth and hair and get Georgia ready for the school bus.’ After school Georgia likes to spend time in her treasured swing in the backyard. ‘Georgia could spend all day in that swing and would let us push her for hours on end. Luckily Kevin is a hands-on dad and is great with her when he comes home from work.’ When Georgia is at school Linda is able to work, managing the promotional products section of her parent’s business. ‘I am fortunate my parents were able to restructure their business to employ me. …’ Linda and Kevin work as a tag team. They are a great team. But without the carer bonus they will not be able to purchase essential items for their daughter, Georgia, such as shoes, which cost over $200-they are special shoes designed for her to keep her safe and to ensure that they stay on her feet. The carer bonus enables them to purchase large products. We heard in their story about the swing; the swing cost over $800. They could not just pop down to the shop and buy a Target or Woolworths swing for $150; they had to get a special one built for her, and this bonus enables them to do that. A payment that is spread throughout the year, whilst maybe beneficial, would not enable them to purchase the big things that they need. It is important to note here that, if Linda did not have the circumstances associated with Georgia, she would be able to earn a lot more and would be able to provide for her family in a greater way. (Time expired) Ms Viola Hill Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (10.10 am)-I rise to acknowledge the passing of Viola Hill and give tribute to her contribution to the local community in northern Brisbane. Viola Hill passed away on 18 February 2008. She was a well-respected Aboriginal elder for her time and work within the wider Brisbane community. Viola was born in Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission. AlthoughI do not have time to talk about Viola’s time in Cherbourg, I can say that, as a devoted Christian woman of the AIM Church, Viola eventually became a Sunday school teacher and leader. This led to her missionary work for the church. With her missionary work, Viola relocated to Rode Road, Chermside in the early 1980s with her son, Phillip. Living at Chermside, Viola provided care and accommodation for people who came to the city for medical treatment. During this time Viola had also become affectionately known as Auntie Vi. Living in Chermside she had worked with Auntie Evie Walker, Auntie Nellie O’Chin and Pastor Malcolm and Ada Munro. Together, they visited many Indigenous communities in Queensland and Australia with their missionary work. MAIN COMMITTEE Auntie Vi moved from Rode Road to Deagon where she lived for the past 28 years and continued with her missionary work with Auntie Nellie. Auntie Vi and Auntie Nellie used their own money to regularly visit the prisons, hospitals and schools. Auntie Vi was a surrogate mother to many kids from different backgrounds, especially those she had met in prison. To her they were all equal. Her limited education and communication skills did not stop her hunger for better treatment and living conditions for her people. She lobbied many parliamentarians for years to have equal rights and basic needs implemented into mainstream Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Auntie Vi was a tireless community worker, initiating many community programs and employment opportunities for Indigenous people. Another testament to Auntie Vi was that she helped to establish the Koobara Aboriginal cultural organisation at Zillmere, where she was honoured with life membership. Her other involvements were with the Nalingu Respite Centre and as an initial founding member of the Ti Tree Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing program at Sandgate. Through her vision, energy and drive Auntie Vi achieved many goals in her life by negotiating with local councillors and state government departments to help improve services for her community, especially for the Indigenous people in the local community. In 2006, the completion of the Rainbow Street units in Sandgate, named in her honour Viola Hill Place, is a testimony to her outstanding work and service in the Sandgate area and beyond. Viola’s contribution and commitment have established networks of services and support for both Indigenous and nonIndigenous people. I wish to pass on my condolences to Auntie Vi’s family and to all those people in communities, not just in Petrie and Lilley but all over Queensland, who are feeling the sadness of Auntie Vi’s passing. Her spirit will forever live on and so will her work. the time for members’ statements has concluded. 2008 Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. and Access) Amendment Bill 2008 is to amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to extend by a further 18 months the operation of network protection provisions.

Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would no doubt appreciate, during my time with the Police Federation of Australia. I had significant involvement with early negotiations for telephone and telecommunications intercepts. I know from my colleagues right across the nation that the highly evasive communications networks that have emerged are always difficult to detect and infiltrate and they require not only the development of equally sophisticated methods of maintaining access to telephone intercepts, upon receiving warrants, but also maintenance of the integrity of those networks. The need for effective protection of corporate networks was also recognised in the Review of the Regulation of Access to Communications, conducted by Mr Anthony Blunn, who was a former secretary of the A-G’s department. That report was tabled in parliament back in September 2005. The Blunn report, as it has effectively become known, recommended that access be allowed to the content of communications outside of the warrant regime for the protection of corporate communications systems. It proposed an 18-month extension to the existing network protection provisions that will ensure that law enforcement and security agencies can continue to protect their networks while comprehensive long-term solutions are developed. These comprehensive solutions are also subject to a rather comprehensive and very structured integrity regime with regard to how they are deployed. When the initial legislation was introduced in this House in the form of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 2006, it initially only applied to the Australian Federal Police. These provisions are subject to a two-year sunset clause which will expire on 13 June. However, subsequently, access was granted to additional law enforcement agencies and other police services through the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Act 2007, but the original sunset clause was retained. Therefore, the sunset clause will expire on 13 June this year. These amendments, by and large, provide some additional time to work on the recommendations contained in the Blunn report-many of which I have to say are very much supported. The legislation takes a contemporary view of the protection of a communications network and also looks positively at ensuring that the law enforcement agencies have the degree of access as required by the act on warrant. It also specifies the process and integrity regimes that need to be followed. These are matters that require additional work. This bill before us effectively grants additional time beyond the original scheme of the act, which was a sunset clause due to expire on 13 June. In conclusion, this bill is an important element in ensuring that the legislative framework for access to telecommunications information for law enforcement and national security agencies remains clear and effective. It contains no new powers for security or law enforcement agencies and it strengthens the reporting and accountability framework. I commend the bill to the House. thank the member for Werriwa for his contribution to the debate. He has taken a consistent MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Telecommunications Interception And Access Amendment Bill
290,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (10.37 am)-in reply-I would like tointerest in law enforcement and security matters generally and brings to the federal parliament considerable expertise in this area. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2008 is important in maintaining the capacity for stipulated agencies to protect their networks for an additional 18 months. This will provide the necessary time for the government to consult widely on a more permanent legislative solution. This solution needs to be focused on current network technologies and ensure that network operators have the legal capacity to protect their networks and provide a proper degree of privacy protection for users of that network. In many ways, the exercise that is being held this week, Cyber Storm 2, which was kicked off yesterday, I think, underlines the need for an overhaul of systems generally, both public and private. The technical amendments to the interception regime will improve, clarify and simplify the operation of the T(I)A Act. These include removing several provisions that became redundant when certain functions were transferred from the Australian Federal Police to the Attorney General’s Department, following the passage of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 2006. As such, this bill is a further step in the ongoing modernisation of Australia’s laws for accessing telecommunications information for law enforcement or national security purposes. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 February, on motion by Mr Snowdon: That this bill be now read a second time. supports the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The bill introduces far-reaching reforms to the ADF summary discipline system, stemming from the former coalition government’s response to the 2005 report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee entitled The effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. This bill amends the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, or the DFDA, and the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955, or the DFDAA, to simplify and redesign summary discipline procedures and represents one of the widest ranging reforms to the Australian Defence Force summary discipline system since the introduction of the Defence Force Discipline Act. The Howard government first introduced these amendments last year, but the 2007 amendment bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued. This bill includes measures included in the 2007 bill and also the amendment flagged by Bruce Billson MP in the second reading speech on the Howard government’s bill last year responding to the concerns of the Senate committee that examined the bill-chaired at the time by Liberal Senator for New South Wales Marise Payne-regarding the simplified rules of evidence at a summary trial. There is bipartisan support and cooperation on military justice reforms, and the coalition remain committed to ensuring these reforms are adopted and, more importantly, successful-consistent with our response in government to the recommendations of the Senate committee’s 2005 MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Telecommunications Interception And Access Amendment Bill
291,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.40 Am),"From the outset, let me say that the oppositionreport. This bill, consistent with that proposed by the former government, aims at ensuring an appropriate balance between the maintenance of discipline and the protection of the rights of Australian Defence Force members. The bill’s key amendments include enhancing the summary procedures by introducing a number of significant safeguards, such as an automatic right of appeal to the new Australian Military Court for summary trials, while still enabling commanders to maintain effective discipline and recognising the need for time lines and fairness to protect the rights of the individual. Currently, an ADF member has no mechanism to appeal to a court martial or a Defence Force magistrate with regard to a conviction or punishment imposed by a summary authority. This bill enacts one of the recommendations of the 2005 Senate report by introducing the right of appeal from a summary authority to a single military judge of the Australian Military Court. It was argued in the 2005 report that service personnel should have this right for charges that would potentially lead to a criminal record or affect them post military service. Another key amendment is the right to elect trial by a military judge of the Australian Military Court for most disciplinary offences. This amendment again stems from the 2005 report and is similar to the Canadian armed forces summary disciplinary system. Further, amendments relating to the simplified rules of evidence are significant. The evidence regime currently applicable to summary trials is overly complex and not easy to apply by persons without formal legal training. The bill will make it clear that a summary authority will not be subject to the same formal rules of evidence that apply to the Australian Military Court but must not depart from the fundamental principles underpinning the rules of evidence. The new evidentiary framework is based on the successful system which has been used for many years by the Canadian forces. Further amendments include: a form of review for technical errors related to the awarding of punishments and orders; simplification of offences and punishments; and changed jurisdictions of superior summary authorities and discipline orders. When the 2007 bill was examined by the Senate committee it was welcomed and endorsed by Army, Navy and RAAF as well as the then Acting Chief of the Defence Force. Given the defence forces expressed their belief that these amendments struck the right balance, we welcome its consideration. In offering our support the coalition call on the government to monitor and review the impact of these reforms to ensure that they are working as envisaged and have no unintended consequences on ADF personnel, particularly in relation to the rules of evidence. In keeping with the previous examination of such issues the coalition believe that a review by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade should be considered. Furthermore, last year the then shadow minister Alan Griffin expressed his view that Labor believed there were still a number of reforms to the military justice system they would pursue. The coalition calls on the Labor government to continue in the same manner as the coalition in government and ensure that any changes involve extensive consultation amongst stakeholders, particularly within the ADF, as well as to commit to extensive scrutiny in the parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE Given the bills introduce a number of significant enhancements to ensure the right balance is struck between maintaining effective discipline and protecting the rights of individuals, the coalition, as it did in government, commends this bill to the chamber. am)-I wish to speak in support of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. The substance of the bill provides for further reforms to Australia’s military justice system. It may be recalled, as the previous member indicated, that the bill was introduced in parliament before the last election. The bill is substantially the same, except for a number of changes to the evidentiary framework that applies to summary proceedings, following recommendations from the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report that originally proposed the bill. Whilst in my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement I have no direct responsibility for the operation of the military justice system, I certainly have an interest in its effectiveness and note the importance of such a system for our Defence Force. I would like to begin by outlining the importance of a strong, fair and effective military justice system and also outlining some of the history to the reforms contained within the bill before I address its substantive provisions. As Australians we expect our legal system to be strong but fair. One of the guiding principles within our democratic system is the tradition of the rule of law. While this concept has been the subject of abuse and misinterpretation, the rule of law basically refers to the principle that no one person is above the law. It is valuable to consider how this applies to the actions of government. Accepting that no one person or entity is above the law necessarily prescribes the action a government can take against an individual. The rule of law provides the principle that the power of a government and its authority can only legitimately be exercised within a framework of written and publicly disclosed laws which are adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedures-that is, they are enforceable by due process. This principle places a necessary limitation on the arbitrary action a government can take against its citizens-it provides for an individual’s rights. This is a key defining principle of our legal system but one that we can often take for granted. However it is imperative that public officials and those who advocate on behalf of others keep in mind the importance of this principle in the conduct of their roles. I have learnt from my time in public service that Australians demand and expect an appreciation of the rule of law underpinned by a strong sense of giving people a fair go. They therefore expect to see their public institutions pay adherence to these principles in the conduct of their roles and responsibilities. This expectation of the Australian public extends of course to one of our most important institutions: namely, the Australian Defence Force. The ADF is an institution that exercises governmental authority and power. The ADF and their leaders are very aware of the expectations upon them and they are acutely aware of the importance of the rule of law and due process. They have seen, in conflicts around the world, the problems that have arisen when such principles are not adhered to. They also take great pride in the principles and values of our democratic system of government-values, of course, that they are serving to protect. In order for the public to continue to have high regard and faith in the ADF as an institution, the military justice system that governs it must be seen as principal. It is therefore vitally MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
292,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (10.46important that our military justice system is seen to be adhering to these values and to be a strong, effective and fair system. The bill is part of a series of reforms to that system of military justice designed to help ensure the continuation of public faith in its exercise. Whilst recognising the importance of the rights of an individual and the rule of law, it should also be acknowledged that the military justice system is required to operate in quite unique circumstances. Given the nature of ADF operations and the importance of a high level of discipline to the success of these operations, it should be recognised that at times a stricter form of punishment may be required for an offence which in the civilian world would not seem to warrant such a severe punishment. It is also an element of our justice system that is required to operate both within and outside of Australia in times of war and peace. None of this is to suggest that this is an excuse for an unfair justice system that does not accord an individual adequate rights-it certainly is not. Instead, though, we need to recognise that there are unique characteristics that are part of our military justice system which must be acknowledged and considered by the government in its formulation of reforms. I believe that the reforms contained within this bill and those that have preceded it help to strike the right balance in that regard. Australia’s military justice system has two distinct but interrelated elements: the discipline system and the administration system. The discipline system provides for the investigation and prosecution of offences committed under the Defence Force Discipline Act. Offences dealt with under the discipline system can come under three categories. The first category covers offences peculiar to the defence forces, such as absence without leave, disobedience of a command and endangering morale. The second category under the discipline system covers offences similar or identical to civil offences but that relate to service personnel or equipment, such as assault of a superior or subordinate, destruction or damage of service property, or dealing in narcotic goods on a base. The third category covers offences imported from civilian criminal law, such as murder, manslaughter and theft of non-service property. The first two categories that I have just outlined are offences that relate specifically to the military and the third category is an incorporation of civilian criminal offences into the military justice system. The need for this incorporation comes from a recognition that these offences may occur when an ADF member is deployed overseas, in which case there may be an inadequate criminal law framework or the application of that country’s law may be undesirable by our standards-an example is the application of the death penalty. The second element of Australia’s military justice system is the administrative component. The administrative system deals with the decisions and processes associated with control and administration of the ADF. It is designed to encourage service personnel to maintain high standards of professional judgement, command and leadership. The administrative system broadly comprises an inquiry system, adverse administrative action in response to a member’s conduct, and internal and external review processes. The bill relates to the operation of elements of the discipline system that I have just outlined. Over the past decade there have been a number of inquiries into the military justice system following some high-profile cases which demonstrated some deficiencies with the system. Each of these inquiries identified flaws in the system and its related processes. However, it was a Senate inquiry that really started the impetus to a strong reform program. MAIN COMMITTEE In October 2003, the Senate referred the issue of military justice to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The committee was instructed to inquire and report on the effectiveness of the military justice system in a number of areas. These included: determining whether the system provided impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes for ADF members; mechanisms to improve transparency and public accountability of military justice procedures; allegations of the mistreatment of ADF members and of drug abuse; and the handling of peacetime deaths in the ADF from any cause. The findings of the committee were of great concern. The Senate committee, among other findings within the report, concluded the following: the ADF was manifestly incapable of adequately performing its investigatory function; boards of inquiry were lacking in transparency and independence; processes of investigation and trial were found to have placed great stress on individuals, leading to a loss of confidence, loss of employment, suicidal thoughts and attempted and actual suicides; and ADF members were reluctant to lodge complaints because they doubted the effectiveness and impartiality of the system. They were findings of obvious significance and concern from the Senate committee. Broadly, the committee reached a conclusion that major change was needed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the military justice system. In 2005, the then government issued their response to the report, agreeing to 30 of the 40 recommendations that had been made. The recommendations that were not agreed to involved a greater civilianisation of the military justice system. Labor agreed to the government’s response at that time but noted that the agreed reforms must be effective or further action along the lines proposed by the committee would have to be considered. The Rudd government still maintains that view. There were two areas of reform covered by the then government’s response to the recommendations of the committee. The first involved the replacement of the Defence Force Magistrate trials with a new Australian Military Court, the appointment of an independent director of military prosecutions and a Provost Marshal ADF. The first stage of these reforms was introduced by legislation in 2006. This included the establishment of an Australian Military Court which came into effect on 1 October 2007. It was a significant reform. The second involved a number of reforms associated with the administrative system itself. The majority of these reforms are now in place and their progress is being updated in regular six-monthly reports back to the Senate committee. The bill deals with some of the final reforms that were intended following the committee’s reports. I would now like to summarise some of the major provisions of the bill. Firstly, the bill seeks to simplify and redesign the summary discipline proceedings. The summary discipline system is designed to deal with offences of a less serious nature quickly and efficiently. This helps commanders in the field maintain discipline and morale among their troops and it can be used on a daily basis to help ensure the welfare and safety of ADF members. The Rudd government is of the view that the summary discipline system, given its importance, must be efficient, simple and fair. Given that its operation is conducted by officers who have no formal legal training, it is important to make it as easy as it can be for it to be applied while still maintaining the rights of the individual. This has been the basis for the government’s proposed reforms within this bill. The bill basically contains four major changes to this system. The first of these is the introduction of a MAIN COMMITTEE right in all cases to appeal a summary authority conviction, order or punishment to a military judge of the Australian Military Court. This meets one of the Senate committee’s important recommendations allowing for the introduction of a right to appeal summary decisions before an independent permanent military court. It is schedule 2 of the bill that will give effect to these reforms. In practice, it will allow for a statutorily independent military judge of the Australian Military Court to deal with an appeal on its merits by way of a fresh trial or a paper review of the evidence. If the appeal is upheld, the judge may substitute or quash the conviction; order a new trial; or confirm, quash or vary the punishment given. The second change is to allow a right to elect trial by a military judge of the Australian Military Court for all but a limited numbers of offences. Again, this serves to address the concerns of the Senate committee. The provisions that give effect to this change are contained in schedule 1 of the bill. For all but the most minor offences, ADF personnel will now have this right. For those minor offences where no right to elect a trial is present, there will be a limitation on the forms of punishment that can be given. If a variance to these forms of punishment is considered, the right to elect a trial under the Australian Military Court must also be offered. The third change involves the introduction of a revised evidence framework for the conduct of these proceedings. When this bill was introduced before the lapse of the last parliament these changes were not contained and were recommended by the Senate committee that reviewed the legislation. The Rudd government has made these changes in recognition of the need for rules of natural justice and the desire to apply fundamental evidentiary principles to these proceedings. These changes are outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. The fourth area of changes covers a number of significant reforms to the review process for summary convictions, which are covered under schedule 4 of the bill. These include an obligation on reviewing authorities to recommend appeals to the Australian Military Court, where substantive errors are identified, and a new mechanism for correcting technical errors. These are considered and measured reforms that will have a great impact on the operation of the summary discipline system. They will help maintain the need for a simple and effective system while also providing for the strengthening of an individual’s rights. The second key area of the bill follows from a review of the offences and punishments in the Defence Force Discipline Act. Schedule5 of the bill outlines the changes to be made, which include: an expanded ability to deal with drug charges for offences committed both inside and outside of Australia by ADF and Defence civilians; making it clear that a failure to act can be as reprehensible as a wrongful commission of an act for some areas of modern military responsibilities; reinforcement of the need for a high standard of weapons safety; and an improvement in the accuracy and fairness of sentencing by allowing more flexibility in application of punishments in line with current civilian practice and ensuring that the status of a summary conviction is of relevance for service purposes only, so as to ensure that ADF personnel are not disadvantaged in their civilian lives. These reforms collectively are designed to introduce both a new thoroughness and fairness to the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act. Schedules 6, 7 and 8 of the bill cover a number of other smaller proposals designed to implement earlier recommendations of reviews that have not been acted upon, the clarification of the powers of the Director of Military Prosecution and a number of administrative reforms. MAIN COMMITTEE They were outlined by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel during his second reading speech. He will also be outlining an amendment to the bill when he speaks in due course. All of these are designed to provide clarification, to improve and streamline the operation of our military justice system. I would like to conclude today by expanding on my earlier arguments on why these reforms to our military justice system are so important. You will recall that I earlier referred to the relationship between the public’s requirement that our institutions of government act in accordance with the rule of law and accord to an individual adequate rights. This of course remains the core reason for these reforms but, apart from that, I believe there are also two compelling reasons that these changes are needed-one is strategic and the other moral. The strategic reason relates to the challenge posed by the government’s need to increase levels of recruitment and retention in the ADF. This will obviously be influenced by the public perception of the military justice system and the sense of security an individual will receive by knowing that their rights are protected within the workplace. Without a strong and fair military justice system there would be no chance of the government meeting the challenges in recruitment and retention in the ADF that it now faces. The moral reason is quite simple: it is the government which sends the young men and women of the ADF overseas, often into dangerous situations. If the government is prepared to do this, it must also be prepared to provide them with the rights and the system of justice they deserve. We have all seen the examples of things that go wrong and when the system is not working properly; therefore, I believe we have a strong moral obligation to extend all of our efforts to ensure that these incidents do not occur again and that there is a fair system of rights. I commend the bill and believe that it, and the reforms that have preceded it, will help to make a real difference in our efforts to achieve a strong, fair and effective military justice system. Amendment Bill 2008. The purpose of the bill is to give effect to what was in the original Howard government bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007. The bill introduces wide-ranging reforms to the Australian Defence Force summary discipline system. The bill provides for a further set of changes which in part build on the changes in the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2006. The changes are intended to provide for, and balance, the maintenance of effective discipline and the protection of those individuals who are subject to the military discipline system. It introduces another element of military justice, which reflects the fairness of civilian processes of justice but in a way that recognises the realities of applying military discipline fairly and efficiently not only in Australia but in the field of combat operations across the world. The 2007 amendment bill was introduced by the Howard government in mid-August 2007 to give further effect to the Howard government’s response to the report by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee entitled The effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system by amending the Defence Act 1903, the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955. There have been numerous inquiries over the past decade and a number of court challenges and publicly-aired complaints brought by former and serving personnel, their families and other community members sugMAIN COMMITTEE",188,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
293,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.04 Am),"I rise to lend my support to the Defence Legislationgesting that the military justice system was flawed. Significant official inquiries included the 1997 study into the judicial system under the Defence Force Discipline Act, by Brigadier the Hon. Justice Abadee; the 1998 Commonwealth Ombudsman’s own motion investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences; the inquiry into military justice procedures in the ADF by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in 1999; the same committee’s inquiry report, Rough justice? An investigation into allegations of brutality in the Army’s Parachute Battalion, a battalion in which I served as an officer in 1993; the 2001 Burchett QC Report on the inquiry into military justice in the Australian Defence Force; and the 2002-03 Western Australian Coroner’s investigation of fire onboard HMAS Westralia. This bill, cognisant of the inquiries that have gone before it, relates to the less serious offences and aims to modernise and redesign the summary discipline system. These less serious offences include offences peculiar to the Defence Force, such as absence without leave, disobedience of a command and endangering morale, and offences which are similar or identical to civilian offences but which relate to service personnel or equipment, such as assault of a superior or subordinate, destruction or damage of service property, or dealing in narcotic goods on a base. As I have already stated, there have been numerous inquiries into the administration of justice in the ADF. Many inquiries made suggestions for improvements to the military justice system; some suggestions were acted upon and some were not. By the time the 2003 committee published its report in June 2005, it acknowledged: For ten years now, there have been increasing calls from servicemen and women and their families that all is not well in the military justice system. The 2003 committee made 40 recommendations for change. Thirty of the 40 were accepted in whole or in part by both the previous government and the current government. This bill is a direct response to those recommendations. The 2003 committee stated in its report of 2005 that it ‘believes that the military justice system in its current form clearly needs a comprehensive, ground up reform’. The 2008 version of the bill-virtually a copy of the Howard government bill-delivers that ground up reform. It creates a new system with many built-in safeguards. There is a system of review and appeal which, on its face, should deliver outcomes that are fair, informal and timely. The ADF has asked for simpler rules of evidence. Although the formal rules of evidence will not have to be applied, the bill requires that summary authorities comply with the rules of natural justice and the basic principles of the rules of evidence relating to relevance, reliability, weight and probative value. The bill is very welcome. I am one of only three former serving military officers in the House of Representatives. I have previously felt the weight of an unjust military justice system. In my time at the Royal Military College DuntroonI was-and I know that you will be shocked-charged for being absent without leave. I am appalled to say it. I missed a night-time lecture. The fact that I was at the college and was indeed not absent, and not absent without leave, was deemed irrelevant. The rules of evidence are somewhat loose when one is an officer cadet. As a military officer, I have defended and prosecuted numerous soldiers and fellow officers. IfI can use a phrase, I have stood there while the chorus has rung out numerous times to ‘march the guilty bastard in’. And having previously been one of those ‘guilty bastards’ marched in, it is a little disconMAIN COMMITTEE certing to hear that my fate had been decided by the company sergeant major outside the door before indeed I had ever faced the summary authority. Currently-prior to this bill-there is no appeal from a summary authority, be it an officer commanding or indeed a commanding officer. There is no appeal for the poor ‘guilty bastard’ being marched in. There is no right to apply to a single judge of the Australian Military Court. This bill seeks to right that wrong. My fellow officers have gone through a number of court martials and inquiries, not least being the one into my former battalion, the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, and the one into the Blackhawk disaster. They have come out confused, scarred, disappointed, feeling they have been failed and let down by a military that they had committed their life to. Many of these officers welcome the changes being brought in today. Colleagues, the days of Napoleon and Wellington are over. The days of marching to war and on day one hanging one to make sure that the rest will follow are over. Combat effectiveness is predicated on faith that the man next to me will do his duty; that the man sharing the foxhole with me in the dark hours of the morning will stand to, man his weapon and do what is right. Injustice weakens faith. Injustice weakens combat effectiveness. It weakness unit cohesiveness. If soldiers and officers have no faith in their commanders-who by the Defence Force Discipline Act, sit as summary authorities, both at officer commanding and commanding officer levels-and lack faith in the justice dispensed by their senior officers, they will lack faith in their ability to lead in times of turmoil. This bill ensures that the average digger, the hard working NCO and the commissioned officer are fairly dealt with in a way that is cognisant of their rights. It gives the poor ‘guilty bastard’ outside the opportunity to be fairly heard and to take their right to go to a single judge of the Australian Military Court if needed. On behalf of the diggers, the hard working NCOs and the commissioned officers out there, I commend the bill to the chamber. still out. We will pass judgment on him a little later on. I rise to support the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. As has been said, this legislation comes about because of the dissolution of the House in 2007. The amendment represents what is considered to be a key and necessary stage in the reform of matters to do with the military justice system within our Australian Defence Force. The bill provides for the implementation of a new system by which grievances of a military nature can be heard within the military justice system and where military and other related breaches can be properly aired and swiftly dealt with. Under the previous government there were no fewer than six separate reviews of matters relating to the broad theme of military justice. These reviews included two inquiries by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in 1999 and 2001. Those inquiries were preceded by a report by Justice Abadee in 1997 and one by the Ombudsman in 1998. There was also a report-which my colleague the member for Fadden just mentioned by the WA coroner in respect of the fatal fire on HMAS Westralia, and another report written by Mr Burchett QC in 2001. But the catalyst for action came in May 2005, following the recommendations tabled in the Senate by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee after its inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system, which found serious shortcomings within the military justice system and further highlights the fact that the proposed MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
294,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.13 Am),"To the member for Fadden, at this stage the jury islegislation introduced here today is, quite frankly, overdue. The recommendations essentially covered two broad themes. The first was the replacement of the old system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate trials by a new Australian Military Court, retaining the existing right of appeal to the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal, an independent Director of Military Prosecution and the Provost Marshal ADF. The second was the major reform of the administrative system through which grievances are in fact handled. The majority of these reforms are now in place and appear to be operating satisfactorily, as regular six-monthly reports to the Senate committee indicate. On that point: all these reforms, including those introduced by this bill, are also subject to six-monthly reporting to the Senate committee. The bill also provides implementation of the final links between the new summary discipline system, which is part of the military justice system, where many breaches of military discipline are first dealt with, as well as a number of other related matters. In 2005, when the previous government responded to the Senate committee inquiry, Labor in opposition did not accept all those recommendations. However, we gave conditional support to the bill at that stage and indicated that we would certainly be reserving our decision in relation to evidence in particular. Labor had a strong position on the evidentiary provisions, the rules of evidence, as they would apply to military justice. Our attitude has remained the same; hence, some of the provisions of the bill before the chamber reflect that very same attitude to the principles of military justice to which we previously referred when this matter was originally raised in the House. Last September, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in its report on the bill, expressed reservations about the provisions of the bill governing the application of the rules of evidence in proceedings before a military summary authority. The Rudd government does not believe that the previous government’s response to the committee’s recommendations on the matter was sufficient; hence, this new bill includes a provision to strengthen the rules of natural justice and the basic principles of the rules of evidence relating to relevance, weight and reliability, with those to be applied by any military summary authority. As a result, the government has through this bill strengthened the application of the rules of evidence. The government is committed to continuing the reform of the military discipline system to address the concerns of defence personnel, the parliament and, to some extent-probably to a large extent-the community generally. It is not only fair that the changes intended to be made represent a balance and the maintenance of effective discipline but also very important that there is proper protection for those individuals who are subject to the military justice system. I think that point was made very effectively by the member for Fadden when he spoke on this bill. The bill introduces another element of military justice which reflects the inherent fairness of the civilian processes of justice but in a way that recognises reality as it applies to military discipline and ensures that it is applied fairly and efficiently and can be done so in the field. It also recognises that ADF operations are to some extent quite unique, requiring a far greater level of regulation than would normally be encountered in employment. The demands and the role of a military force require that our people working in such areas of conflict are able to effectively administer discipline efficiently and in a timely manner, but it must be done fairly. I think that is the point that has been made constantly as people support this particular bill. MAIN COMMITTEE The Rudd government, in recognising the need for additional constraints to these standards, believes that the military discipline procedures that accompany military justice must be timely, impartial and fair for all ADF members, and must be seen to be so by the Australian people as a whole. We know that commanders, particularly commanders in the field, bear great responsibility. Their role may require them to use lethal force. These commanders are required to ensure that this lethal force is used lawfully and to do this requires discipline. Discipline is the cornerstone of the ADF. It is the cornerstone of most military forces. That is certainly what is recognised in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. In particular there is the summary discipline system, which is subject to this bill. The summary discipline system enables the timely dispensing of discipline with a view to maintaining not only discipline but also morale. The balance between discipline and the rights of individuals is key to achieving the operational effectiveness and the success that a nation expects of its military force. It is this balance that produces a defence force that can wield lethal force while reflecting not only the values of our nation in complying with our international obligations but also, to put it in lay terms, our position in relation to a fair go. The Australian Defence Force summary discipline system forms part of the military justice system, which, taken as a whole, must provide the safeguards necessary to protect the interests and rights of individual members of the ADF. What this bill does is ensure the fairness and rigour of the military justice system through a number of means: simplifying and redesigning the summary discipline procedures, simplifying the rules of evidence as they apply, providing the right of appeal from a summary authority to a new Australian Military Court and the right to trial by the Australian Military College instead of a summary authority, and providing a review of summary proceedings. These are very important provisions to ensure that fairness and transparency operate in the way we administer our military justice. This is not about hindering the application of justice within our military service; it is not about constraining or imposing greater responsibilities upon commanders, whether it be in country or in periods of conflict overseas; it is about ensuring that it is conscious in the minds of all of those responsible for others that fairness and decency must be applied in the way we apply ourselves and judge one another in administering justice. This bill is to ensure that the men and women of the Australian armed forces are provided with the necessary recognition under a system that presumes innocence, although it does take into account the unique nature of the military force where discipline must be administered swiftly, in a timely manner and often in the field. As a consequence of that, we recognise that there are two main aspects to this bill. Apart from military justice, we are certainly cognisant of the fact that this goes to the maintenance of morale and the rights of men and women of the Australian military forces in how they appear and are judged before an Australian military court. The matters subject to this bill are included in a review by the Senate committee, which will review and make recommendations on a six-monthly basis. I commend this bill to the chamber. Amendment Bill 2008 to address the military justice system. At the end of 1987 I resigned from the Australian Federal Police to begin 18 months of very interesting and exciting training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, starting in January 1988. Unfortunately, to my shame, I was charged twice as a cadet. That was my introduction to the military justice sysMAIN COMMITTEE",194,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
295,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11.26 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Defence Legislationtem. It is a disgrace! Both my cadet charges were for heinous offences relating to uniform shirts-polyester shirts. It is a grievous tale. About eight weeks into my training, an inspection revealed that there were not enough ironed shirts hanging up in my cupboard, and so a charge was laid against me. As a result of that charge I had what was called a ‘restriction of privileges’, another very exciting moment in my life. After that charge was heard I had to report four times a day for seven days for dress inspections, and for one afternoon of about 45 minutes to an hour of drilling on the parade ground in marching order-which was with helmet, webbing, pack and, at that time, greens. That, too, was a lovely moment. About a year later, in my final six months at Duntroon, after an inspection of vehicleswhich was random in those days, interestingly-I was charged for having another uniform shirt in the boot of my car. It should have been in my cupboard. The week before, we had been drilling on the parade ground-those were the days of SLRs. Shoulder arms was a requirement as part of the drill. My buddy on my left and I were standing a little too close together. The bayonet on the end of his rifle went up and cut the inside of my sleeve-luckily only the sleeve. I thought that further ironing of that shirt was a bit pointless and, probably a bit recklessly, I chucked it in my boot, thinking that that would be okay. Unfortunately, that inspection-looking for contraband, which was just alcohol in those days-took place, and I was caught in possession of goods. As a result of that I lost two days of leave for the offence of failing to comply with a lawful standing order-in other words, having military equipment in my vehicle. So they were my first two experiences with the military justice system. I think most cadets at Duntroon had similar experiences. The essential point here is that obviously these were not major offences in the military system, but they were treated as training opportunities. Every time you got charged, you then had to go forward and ask one of your mates to be the prosecutor, someone else to be the defender and someone else to be the clerk, as I recall. The cadet company drill sergeant, who was a member of the regular Army, a sergeant from one of the infantry battalions normally, would oversee the training aspects of the hearing, and the officer commanding, the OC who was the major in charge of the company, would hear it. As a little aside, I thought it was a bit ludicrous to be charged for a torn shirt. When they read the charge out, I looked down at the OC’s eyes-he had his cap on and was seated at his table-and a slight wry smile came over his face. ThenI started laughing. My lack of respect for the system probably cost me those two days, whereas I might have got off with some other punishment. But loss of leave was not a big deal compared to the restriction of privileges and marching on the square. After DuntroonI tried to keep on the right side of the military justice system. In June 1989 I graduated and went straight into the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police. In many ways military justice and the DFDA-the Defence Force Discipline Act-were pretty much the bread and butter of my occupation, at least in the early days of my career in the Army. Within the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police there are basically two main streams: the general duties side, which is the field force military police, and the Special Investigation Branch of the military police. The SIB is tasked with doing investigations within the military. The general duties side involves field military police doing things such as battlefield circulation-some people call it traffic control-in the area of operations and some investigations. But the SIB MPs were something like army detectives, although only about five per cent of them had ever actually done the full police detective course. MAIN COMMITTEE In my case, having come from the AFP, I had done stage 4 training, as we called it in those days, including records of interview and investigations in general. In my time with the MPS I also did a three-week investigators course with the Victoria Police. That all took place before I even did the eight-week SIB course in the military police. As an SIB commander with the rank of captain I was fortunate enough to lead teams of investigators-this was in 1993across the major bases in Darwin, Townsville and Brisbane. I was posted to Brisbane. Unfortunately, in 1993-94 the SIB was broken up as part of an efficiency review. That left the SIB teams split up and without the technical support of an objective chain of command. I will cover the objective chain of command soon, because it will become relevant. Under the revised structure I headed a small group of investigators based in Brisbane, again, unfortunately, with a marginalised MP SIB technical chain of command. That chain of command had no platoon command and few resources at its disposal. So we struggled with a command structure that was made up of a commanding officer and other ranks that had no experience whatsoever of commanding or administering SIB investigators. This was bad for professional military police investigators, because to receive resources for investigations I actually had to go to the unit commander and tell him where I wanted to go and what I was going to do there. An example of the absurdity of the situation was when I informed my commanding officer-I think he was a transport corps Lieutenant Colonel-of my suspicions regarding the loss of property and fraud at a particular unit in southern Queensland. I informed him of that and asked him for resources. He said that he would think about it. I later found out that he had told his friend, who was the CO of that unit, about what I was talking about. I felt that that was a significant undermining of the investigations process within the military. I therefore believe that leadership remains an important part of the military justice system, because it has been the lack of leadership that has led us to the point where this legislation is required. Given what I have already spoken about, it is from my experiences of conducting many an investigation in the Army and seeing the way some commanding officers acted that I now pass comments on this bill as possibly more than just a bystander in the process. I served this country as a commissioned officer for about 15 years and, for almost the entire time, I believed that the trouble with the military justice system was that the system was not allowed to work. I believe that the MPs and the SIB could do the job and that we MPs could operate within the DFDA to properly investigate matters. Sure, the equipment was not as good as it is now, but I had my view that we had enough to get on with the job. My view changed around the time. I finished my duties working on Olympic security at the end of 2000. What changed my view was that, as a major, I was given the task at land command to commence collating a list of harassment and similar problems across the units of the command. Land command controlled two divisions of the Army and the brigades down to almost all the field units. They were all under the command of land command. My recollection is that that amounted to more than 10,000 full-time and reserve soldiers. From the records I started assembling I saw that, while the Army was probably no worse than most large organisations at the time, there were enough cases to lead me to believe that there was a fundamental problem preventing the system from working. But, before imparting my views in this place, it is probably best to speak a little bit about the leadership training of young officers in the Army. Again, my view is that the leadership MAIN COMMITTEE training is very good within the Army. Members may be aware that, when the Army talks about a commanding officer of a unit, they are invariably talking about a person holding the rank of lieutenant colonel who may well be in command of a battalion or a regiment. COs would always tell their young officers that, whatever happened, the buck always stopped with the CO. I think we even hear a bit of that around here. From what I saw during my time in the Army, responsibility very rarely seemed to land at the feet of the CO. I suspect that true responsibility ended when officers no longer immediately resigned their commissions when they disagreed with orders given or with government policy. Nowadays, officers seem to wait for a job before resigning and then they speak about how much they disagreed with their orders. Again, we have seen examples of that in recent history. I mentioned before that I thought the system was not being allowed to work. I reiterate my confidence in the training provided in the Army for investigators; although some decisions made in the past did undermine the experience and skill levels of investigators serving at the time. It is my view that the problem originated where MP-SIB investigators did not have the ability to initiate investigations. Unit commanders, the COs, had to call for the SIB before an MP investigation would commence. My experience was that so often the damage was done before the SIB was allowed to investigate an incident that had happened weeks before. It always seemed that some poor sergeant or lieutenant from the unit was told to investigate the incident while still doing all their other duties. I recall several incidents of harassment that were investigated in that manner. I would like to talk a bit about a not very happy little story that occurred in a unit in Enoggera around 1993 and was investigated within the Army. It transpired that a young female soldier was posted to an electrical and mechanical engineer workshop and a couple of corporals that had a command responsibility over that soldier took a liking to her for physical reasons. Those days are what I call some of the dark days of the military where there was still some tolerance, although hardly any, of this sort of thing. I recall that centrefolds could be displayed in working areas. These two corporals actually held up a centrefold and tried to make some verbal comparisons between this young soldier and the images on the centrefold, in some sort of infantile manner to attract her attention or make themselves more interesting to her. Of course that was a complete failure. But, again, there did not seem to be a whole lot of action taking place to stop that sort of behaviour on the floor in that workshop. There was a breakdown of the command structure and leadership within the unit. The next thing that happened-and this is where things got out of control-occurred at a corporals’ dining-in night at the soldiers mess at Enoggera. Often the privates were told that they were rostered on to do the waiting and everything like that-bring the food out et cetera. Corporals obviously were the main ranks at the tables that were being served. Officers were invited as well. The case involved these two corporals. They were seated with a lieutenant in between them and this young soldier served them. During the evening, they talked about her and made jokes about her. After the dinner concluded, the young male lieutenant went to that female soldier and said, ‘It’s probably best if you do not go home tonight back to your barrack room because those two corporals talked about how they were going to come to your room and try to rape you.’ Obviously great moral doubt should be cast upon the corporals but, above all, the main problem I see is that a lieutenant did not see that he had a responsibility to act and take action within the unit. He would have said, ‘I’ve discharged my responsibilities MAIN COMMITTEE by warning that young soldier that there was about to be a problem.’ He did not order those soldiers to the guard post or tell them they would be charged with prejudicial behaviour, which is what I think we called it in Defence in those days. He thought he had discharged his responsibilities by saying, ‘Look after yourself; just don’t go back to your room.’ The fact that an indictable offence, in civil terms, was about to be committed did not seem to have any impact. I think that maybe leadership training was not exactly all that successful in those sorts of cases. It is no great surprise that aggrieved soldiers of both sexes have been dissatisfied with some of the processes within military justice. After a major incident, an investigation would be done on a part-time basis by unskilled persons, guided by the interests of the CO and heard by either the CO or, depending on the charge, a major within the unit. Possibly weeks later-and we are talking about the early nineties-the brigade legal officer, a major or a captain, would get to see the file. I guess what I am trying to say is that if a CO thought it was in the best interests of the unit, even those sorts of matters he would have investigated within the unit and charges would be brought within the unit, and people who were not really skilled in any form of investigation would take care of these matters. So it is little wonder that people had some doubts about whether justice was being done and whether the interests of the vulnerable were being looked after. I do not mean to say that COs always, or even frequently, intentionally acted to try to hush up incidents. In most cases, they tried to use their considerable experience to make judgements about what they thought was best for their units. It is, however, my view that because of this approach the system of military justice, where it specifically involves the ability of the military to investigate itself, comes undone. I have great faith that a properly resourced and commanded investigations unit, as we have today, is capable of conducting investigations to the necessary and required legal standards, but it has to be backed up by a willingness of unit commanders to have problems investigated quickly and appropriately. Unfortunately, I cannot see that such a willingness has existed at all times. I would just like to say briefly that I commend the new government for bringing this bill of the previous government back after it lapsed in 2007. I have very limited time left, but my key point is that rank has its responsibilities within defence. Leaders have a responsibility to stand up for the weaker and more vulnerable. Unit cohesion is not actually served by sacrificing the vulnerable. In my time in defence I have seen some outcomes of a misguided belief that the unit’s standing was more important than a properly constituted investigation. From that beginning, all other aspects of hearings, outcomes and even punishments are affected downstream. Overall, the system has worked in the past, but in some cases it has not. Given the origins of this bill and what it proposes, I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) sure that the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 came forward. We all know that it was introduced by the former government, and that it has the support of the opposition, the government and the military, so it is non-contentious. I propose to use a small amount of the parliament’s time to visit an issue that I am getting some constituent concerns about, in relation to the military justice system. Again, this is something that both sides of the parliament should consider. There is no politics in this. It is important that things are seen to be done right. The issue is in relation to miliMAIN COMMITTEE",196,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
296,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.46 Am),"Thank you to the current government for makingtary boards of inquiry. I refer to three recent boards of inquiry, and one of them is current. The problem for defence is that defence is dammed if it does and damned if it does not in relation to making military boards of inquiry open and transparent. I will give you an example. You will all remember the loss of a Black Hawk helicopter off Fiji last year. In fact, two members of the military were killed. One of them was from Townsville and one was from Perth. We all remember the bravery of Melissa Bingley on the loss of her husband, and how she handled herself. The problem was that the government asked the board of inquiry not to publicly release the footage of the helicopter arriving back at the ship. But in its wisdom the board of inquiry said, ‘No; things have got to be open, transparent and accountable.’ So we were treated to endless replays of the deaths of two members of the Australian Defence Force on our television screens during the evening news bulletins. And it went on for a long time. I found it quite sickening to think that these were images of two members of the ADF going to their deaths. That should never have been broadcast. The point that I am making is that the boards of inquiry need to be open and transparent but they also need to think about the family members who are left behind. In relation to Jake Kovco’s inquiry-and that is still going, in another form-the military knew of the very sensitive personal matters that were behind that particular issue. They should never have been made public-they should not have. They could have been dealt with behind the scenes, but they became public, causing enormous stress to Private Kovco’s family. In relation to the current inquiry into the death of Ashley Baker in Timor, who took his own life quite recently, I have had a significant number of emails from defence families in Townsville who knew Ashley, saying, ‘Why does all this graphic detail have to be made public?’ I think you all know what I am saying. The problem, of course, that defence has is that if it does not make things public you get the squawking classes who say, ‘They’re hiding something. They’re holding inquiries in secret.’ Defence is not like that. Defence does not cover up. If something has to be addressed, it will be addressed. The senior leadership of defence is here in this building right now. They are very fine people. There is no way they would ever, ever cover things up and not act upon them. I think we have to have a little more trust in the senior leadership of the ADF and say to them: ‘Where there are sensitive matters, keep them sensitive-keep them out of the public arena. Think about the families and members of the ADF who see this salacious material being paraded on the national news.’ That is my point. I do hope that the Australian public, the Australian media and the Australian Defence Force will have a rethink about what gets released from boards of inquiry. Certainly this particular bill is a very solid step in the right direction in relation to simplifying and redesigning the military justice system. I certainly will be supporting this bill. (Time expired) just need to advise that in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment, but I do not appear to have the documents from the Clerk in relation to the amendment motion. Firstly, may I thank the member for Paterson, the member for Fadden, the member for Cowan and the member for Herbert, from the opposition, for their contributions, and also Parliamentary Secretary Combet and the member for Werriwa, from the government side. As we know, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 has the support of both sides of parliament. It was an MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
297,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (11.52 am)-Iinitiative which was discussed in the last parliament and it has been resubmitted in this parliament. The amendment bill will introduce some efficiencies in the process of summary justice. Essentially, the bill is designed to streamline the handling of trials where there is more than one offence but where those offences range in seriousness-that is, one, two or three. Where there are multiple offences, they will be bundled together and dealt with together according to the process for the most serious of the offences. This may be at the summary level, for all minor offences, or, for serious offences, before a single judge of the Military Court, or perhaps even a judge and jury. It also provides for more than one offender. Provision is also made for the defence military prosecutor to use his or her discretion in determining this process. I beg your pardon: I should not be reading that amendment. the process at this stage is that you sum up and then we will move into committee and can deal with the amendments. ment. Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 recognises, perhaps a bit belatedly, that military personnel should have the same rights and protections as ordinary citizens. They should be protected by similar processes, recognising at the same time that military discipline must not be undermined. The Military Court and the Director of Military Prosecution are now in place and independent of the chain of command. These are important fundamental reforms that were recommended by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in its report of 2005. We also have some genesis in numerous other reviews, not least of which by Mr Burchett QC, Justice Abadee and parliamentary inquiries. The path has always been tortuous, but I think it is fair to say that there is unanimity in this place about the necessity for these changes. I again record my appreciation for the support of the opposition, bearing in mind that it was an initiative of the previous government in the first instance. We believe that, with this body of reform, the shortcomings of the military justice system that were identified by the committee will be overcome. The reforms will be underpinned by transparent, independent and fair processes. We also hope that, as a result of new fairness and independence, much of the behavioural problems at the base of past breaches will also be removed. But there is more to do than this, and we acknowledge that. While we must be practical and recognise the realities of military discipline and its effectiveness in the field, there has been a traditional culture in some quarters which has not been conducive to better practice. Getting the balance right is therefore very important. For those who rue the loss of the old system, which was based on the old attitude of ‘march the guilty one in’, let me say that, unless this culture is diluted, the military’s image will continue to suffer. Australians, particularly young Australians-the notorious generation Y-have unprecedented choices in their careers these days and their interest in military service hinges on incentives and other attractions. I say that this equally applies to the administrative system for the handling of grievances. The process MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008

301,Mr Snowdon,"But at least I admitted it. I again thank all those speakers. The Defenceof military justice must be independent and beyond question. It must be fair and transparent and it must be seen to deliver justice expeditiously without undermining military discipline in any way. It may be true that it is more cumbersome, less efficient and more expensive than the old system but we make no apologies for that. In a democratic society, military personnel, like other citizens, have rights and in future those rights will be better protected. In conclusion, the additional clarity we have sought to apply to the rules of evidence in this bill, as opposed to the bill’s lapsed predecessor, is an attempt to get the balance right. We do recognise the need to be practical about minimising legality. We recognise that discipline in the field must be ready and uncomplicated but, at the same time, some of the basic principles of gathering evidence ought to be instinctive and should be based on some very important principles. There are checks in the system-we know that-but we would rather get the evidence better the first time, if only for the sake of efficiency, to avoid delays and to reduce the consequential impact of mistakes on ADF personnel. I will address the amendment in the consideration in detail stage. I thank all those who contributed to this debate, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

(3) If the accused person, or all the accused persons, make an election under subsection (2), the trial is to be by a Military Judge alone. 132AB Trials of class 3 offences (1) This section applies to a charge of a class 3 offence, unless section 132A or 132AA applies to the charge. (2) If the Director of Military Prosecutions has decided, under subsection 103A(2), that the charge is to be tried by a Military Judge alone, the charge is to be tried by a Military Judge alone. Note: The maximum punishment that may be imposed on a person who is convicted of a class 3 offence that is tried by a Military Judge alone, because of a decision by the Director of Military Prosecutions under subsection 103A(2), is imprisonment for a period of 6 months: see clause 2 of Schedule 2. (3) If subsection (2) does not apply to the charge, the trial is to be by a Military Judge alone, unless: (a) if one accused person only is to be tried-the accused person elects to have the charge, or (if 2 or more charges are to be tried together) all the charges, tried by a Military Judge and military jury; or MAIN COMMITTEE (b) if 2 or more accused persons are to be tried together-any of the accused persons elects to have the charge, or (if 2 or more charges are to be tried together) all the charges, tried by a Military Judge and military jury.

(14) Schedule 8, page 73 (after line 27), after item 4, insert: 4A Application of amendments to trials by the Australian Military Court of multiple charges or accused persons together The amendments made by items 2, 30A and 30B of Schedule7 to this Act apply in relation to a charge of a service offence against an accused person that is to be tried by the Australian Military Court if, before the commencement of those items, the accused person: (a) had not made an election in relation to the charge under subsection 132A(2) or (3) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, as in force before the commencement of those items; and (b) had not been asked to plead in relation to the charge. This is an important amendment-so much so that the passage of the bill is very opportune. The amendment will introduce some efficiency into the process of summary justice. Essentially, it is designed to streamline the handling of trials where there is more than one offence but where those offences range in seriousness-that is, between classes 1, 2 and 3. Where there are multiple offences, they will be bundled together and dealt with together according to the process for the most serious of the offences. This may be either at the summary level-for all minor offences-or, for more serious offences, before a single judge of the Military Court or perhaps even a judge and jury. It also provides for more than one offender. Provision is also made for the defence military prosecutor to use his or her discretion in determining this process. Allowance is also made for circumstances where the accused has made an election for a trial in preference to a summary process. This is a straightforward issue but, as we can see from the amendment, it is indeed very complex in the drafting. I may also say that it is, perhaps, inevitable in a matter such as this, where the reform to the military justice system is so far-reaching, that operational realities in this new legal regime might be unforeseen. This is one such instance, and no doubt we will see further need in due course to undertake some finetuning. I commend the amendment to the committee. support this amendment in the general direction in which it goes. This amendment was flagged at a briefing with Senator Minchin last week. However, the detail has only hit our desk today, and I have had very limited time to read through it. Whilst the intent is admirable, I think that perhaps, giving consideration to the number of reports that have been conducted by the Senate, it might be prudent for the Senate to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to look over the implications of this, to examine it, to provide evidence and to report back. It is key and critical that we do what we can to support the men and women in our Australian defence forces and that we give them a level of surety in the direction in which any disciMAIN COMMITTEE",203,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
303,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.01 Pm),"From the outset, we would say that the coalitionplinary processes go. I am attracted to the option for them to elect to have trial by a single Australian Military Court judge or, indeed, to have a jury there. These are attractive propositions. The proposition that it be made possible for the charge sheet for a series of offences to be brought together and heard in one jurisdiction is also attractive. But, as I say, the detail provided to the coalition has only been here for a matter of moments. In future, on matters like this-requiring, and deservedly so, bipartisan support in making sure the men and women of our military forces are represented with their best interests in mind-perhaps a briefing ahead of time on the intention of the amendments so that they can be fully supported without any reservation would be prudent. Without taking up any more time of the Main Committee, the coalition supports these amendments because it supports the rights to access benefits for those in our Australian Defence Force. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House with amendments. Cognate bills: (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 February, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr STONE (Murray) (12.04 pm)-I rise to support these bills. These bills, of course, are not unfamiliar to the coalition or to me as shadow minister for the arts. It was the Howard government that determined the film industry was best served with an amalgamation of the three different but like-minded agencies to form a merged Screen Australia. Our bill to effect these changes was made available for public comment in September 2007, and you see it virtually unchanged or identical in wording to this bill presented today. The Screen Australia Bill 2008 will create a single authority that should more effectively and efficiently serve the great Australian film industry. Screen Australia can then better support what is a culturally very important and financially significant film industry; something that we are all very proud of. We have a long history of producing quality, innovative and culturally significant films. Through international exposure, our film work has helped create our reputation based on both our historic tradition and our view of the future. Film making is a high-risk, high-cost business and one that does need careful government support-especially as governments in other countries like Ireland and New Zealand compete with tax measures that offer alternative locations and production opportunities. The new entity created through this legislation, Screen Australia, will be responsible for managing support and sponsorship for film projects. Still not yet decided, and an issue which I hope the minister is giving his attention to, is just how the Australian content or Australianness of the films will be determined. Will eligibility for funding be cultural context and content or will it be the country of origin of the various workers in that film itself? That is yet to MAIN COMMITTEE be decided. The film industry, of course, is very keen to know. Screen Australia will be responsible for managing the Howard government’s film rebate scheme as well as the offshore production rebate that we put in place. It should build on the legacies of the Howard government in this area of the arts, provide a solid vehicle for future expansion and encourage quality work within the Australian film industry. More specifically, the bill provides for Screen Australia to carry out the following functions: firstly, to support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry; secondly, to support and engage in the development, production, promotion and distribution of Australian programs, and the provision of access to Australian programs and other programs; and, thirdly, to support and promote the development of a screen culture in Australia. Unfortunately, it is not sufficient to create this new entity. It also has to be adequately funded. There has to be resources for the new administration to be set up. There has to be a lot of extra investment in bedding down this new agency so it can fulfil those important and significant functions. We have already been told that this Labor government has slashed some $3 million over the next four years from what was the Film Commission and what will become part of Screen Australia. So it will be a new agency, but it will be, it would seem, a poorly funded new agency, perhaps strangled at birth unless this minister can become more influential with the razor gang. The second bill before us is the National Film and Sound Archive Bill 2008. This is a bill to establish an independent agency. The National Film and Sound Archive is Australia’s preeminent audiovisual archive. It is to be found not far from here in its home on a Canberra campus. for the preservation and accessibility of the nation’s audiovisual heritage. Independence and autonomy are not ends in themselves, but a means to an end. In fact, the existence of an effective and sustainable guardian for the national audiovisual memory is essential, but it too must be adequately funded. Again, I have to stress that this new government, the Kevin Rudd government, has seen fit to slash arts funding. With the new two per cent efficiency dividend, not to mention the other razor gang slashes already mentioned, we are living in quite some trepidation about how the National Film and Sound Archive will continue the excellent work it has been doing with its significantly diminished Australian government support. I need to remind the minister who is in the committee room today that UNESCO has outlined very special requirements for audiovisual heritage. It sets out minimum standards of autonomy to support organisations in their mission and it does not shy away from the fact that this costs money. UNESCO defines an audiovisual archive as follows: An audiovisual archive is an organization or department of an organization which has a statutory or other mandate for providing access to a collection of audiovisual documents and the audiovisual heritage by collecting, managing, preserving and promoting. All of this of course requires adequate funding. The archivist’s mission is defined by the Australian Society of Archivists as follows: Archivists ensure that records which have value as authentic evidence of administrative, corporate, cultural and intellectual activity are made, kept and used. The work of archivists is vital for ensuring organMAIN COMMITTEE",207,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2008
304,Mr Neville,It is a very important facility.,209,National Film And Sound Archive Bill 2008 Screen Australia And The National Film And Sound Archive
305,Dr Stone,"Indeed, it is a very significant facility. It was established in 1984 to provideisational efficiency and accountability and for supporting understandings of Australian life through the management and retention of its personal, corporate and social memory. The audiovisual heritage includes documents, objects, artefacts and technology, the latter giving AV archives a strong museological aspect. The International Council of Museums, or ICOM, defines a museum as: … a non-profit making, permanent institution in the service of society and of its development, and open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits, for purposes of study, education and enjoyment, material evidence of people and their environment. That is what we hope will be the fulfilled destiny of our stand-alone National Film and Sound Archive for Australia. You heard my emphasis on the non-profit-making aspect of such an institution and therefore, unfortunately, it is dependent on public funding. AgainI have to stress that this minister, in his first 100 days in office, has presided over the slashing of funding to such institutions, and this is of very real concern to the opposition, who when in government made sure that there was in fact an increase in arts funding in recognition of the significance of such a sector in our society for supporting the cultural development and well-being of all Australian people. The definitions I have just mentioned demonstrate the philosophical and professional lineage of the NFSA within the field of memory institutions-the libraries, archives and museums which collectively maintain access to the nation’s memory. Let me tell you how little consideration those institutions have, sadly, been given in the first 100 days of the Labor government. I mentioned the museums and archives. Unfortunately, funding for the National Maritime Museum, which is in fact based in Sydney, has been slashed by $1½ million over the next four years-these are the arts cuts already announced. Funding for the National Library of Australia has been slashed by $3,000,800. Funding for the National Museum has been slashed by $2,000,600. Funding for the Australia Council itself has been slashed by $4,000,400. These are major, iconic Australian institutions which cannot continue to collect or acquire our ongoing cultural materials and artefacts, given their treatment by this Labor government in its first 100 days. We just have to hope the penny drops soon and the first 100 days will lead to backflips, as they have with things such as carer benefits-and, it would seem now, with something as simple as a horse levy, the $100 equine flu levy, where a backflip is in the wind. Let us hope that backflips on the slashing of Australian arts funding come through soon. I see the minister nodding; I am pleased that he understands the importance and significance of those slashes to funding. The National Film and Sound Archive Bill will create a stand-alone statutory authority with, as I said, the responsibility for collecting and maintaining Australia’s film collection for the enjoyment of future generations. The Australian National Film and Sound Archive is already internationally renowned; in fact, it has The Kelly Gang, which has recently been acknowledged as the world’s oldest feature film, made in 1906-07. The significance of our Film and Sound Archive is recognised globally, and long may we be able to retain its excellence. As I said, though, it will require a different attitude from this government as to its resourcing. There is another significant issue that I hope the minister will turn his attention to when it comes to the film archive-it is very closely related-and that is statutory deposit arrangements. We do not know what this government is going to do about statutory deposit arrangeMAIN COMMITTEE ments. This, for the minister’s edification, is all about where or how statutory deposits of film may be made. Perhaps there will be a selective statutory deposit scheme where the film archive is notified of what new film material is made and then choose what it wishes to have donated for collection for all time, or maybe the minister is thinking about a compulsory statutory deposit, something like the National Library system. Of course, film material is much more plentiful than published material, so these considerations have to be actively contemplated right now. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the minister is even aware of this issue or of how he might be dealing with it as we establish this independent archive authority. Let us hope that, as a result of my reminding him today, he will turn his mind to the statutory deposit issue. It is certainly exercising the minds of archivists as we speak. The third bill is just a consequential and transitional provisions bill to ensure that the agencies in the first and second bills-Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive-can be established through a set of reasonable transitional arrangements. I repeat that, since our government introduced these initiatives in September last year, we support these bills. They are, of course, not unfamiliar to us. Let me go on to talk about what is unfamiliar to us, and that is the incredible crashing and burning of arts funding in this country in the last 100 days. I am spending a lot of time talking to the arts community now, and I am quite shocked at the reductions in important programs that they are having to make. In considering their younger performer programs, they are quite aware that there will quite probably be an intergenerational gap in excellence in performer training in this country given the way the funds are being cut. They cannot continue as they were before with major support for young performers in this country. Let me go through for you, item by item, what has occurred in these first 100 days of Minister Garrett being responsible for the area of arts and perhaps being a victim of the Rudd Labor government’s razor gang. I cannot imagine he went along willingly with their decisions. What did we do in the coalition government years? What did we commit to? What did we achieve, and what has happened in these first 100 days of the Rudd government? First of all, we were committed to developing a rich and stimulating cultural sector accessible to everyone in the Australian community. Let me stress ‘everybody’. I am the member for Murray, a rural and regional community, and we do not see much of the opera or the ballet, but we have certainly had a lot of touring companies like Bell Shakespeare, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus and so on. They really add to the cultural life and the sense of inclusion of our rural and regional community. The first thing that the arts institutions have decided is that with the slash in funding-the two per cent efficiency dividend, for example, which has been required of them-they will stop their touring programs. Australia is a huge country; the tyranny of distance is always a major contributor to whether or not we move programs across from, say, Sydney to Perth. Of course touring is the first thing to go if you have to cut performances. That is a great tragedy for this nation, particularly for rural and regional Australians, who are doing it so tough with drought or with flood. I see nodding opposite, so I am pleased that they understand. We also assisted Australian artists to create distinctive and Australian cultural works that enrich our culture, national identity and reputation for international excellence. We helped the Australian film and television industry to forge new pathways to investment and to capitalise on opportunities for international partnerships. It has always been Liberal governments that MAIN COMMITTEE have built on the capacity of Australians to perform and to produce new works. It began for the Australian film industry in the days of the Gorton government, followed up by the Fraser government, who introduced the 10BA tax measures which stimulated the great Australian film industry resurgence. In helping the film and television industries to forge new pathways, the Howard government understood cultural diplomacy. We established the Australia on the World Stage program, which was funded to the tune of some $20 million over four years. The program gave emerging artists, new companies, smaller companies and even larger companies the opportunity to tour overseas to develop international partnerships and their international reputations. I have to say that one of the very first cutbacks by the razor gang was to slash Australia on the World Stage. It is gone, so Australian performers, dance companies, poets, musicians and visual artists will no longer be able to have federal government support to move into the international arena to show their excellence. As I mentioned before, Australia is an expensive place to move from. It is not like slipping across the border in Europe. Without that funding, Australia’s new, emerging and established artists will be less able to gain recognition and less able to enhance the reputation of Australian performing arts offshore. I think that is a great tragedy. I ask Minister Garrett to review that particular funding slash. Perhaps it was the razor gang not understanding the importance of cultural life in this country. I ask that he revisit cutting the funding to that particular program-and others I will refer to-because it was a cruel blow. The coalition also worked with our Indigenous artists to identify ways of protecting the value of their unique expertise and works of art. We were particularly concerned that a lot of our Australian Indigenous artists did and still do depend on CDEP-the Community Development Employment Projects program-funding, particularly in Northern Australia. You could say that Indigenous artists have been exploited over several generations, having been paid an allowance equivalent to Work for the Dole rather than being commercially rewarded for the value of their work. And it is not just the artists but those who support the artiststhose who live in the communities, those who help market their art and those who work in the art galleries-particularly in smaller places like Katherine, Finke River and Haastes Bluff. The coalition government understood only too well the potential for exploitation, and, in fact, the real exploitation, of a lot of Indigenous artists. We were in the process of transferring people in the arts sector-people in the emergency response areas of the Northern Territory, in the first instance-to real, paid jobs. We already had the first of these people on salaries, particularly in places like Finke River. I have to say that I was hugely disappointed to hear that one of the first moves of the new Rudd government was to announce that our transitioning of people off CDEP-work for the dole for Aboriginal people-into real jobs was to be halted and that there would be a review in some six or eight months about the whole business of CDEP funding. In the meantime, our transition to real work programs has been halted and therefore those art communities are back where they were, depending on welfare subsidies. I am talking about some of the most significant artists in Australian society today. I think that is shameful, quite frankly. I think it was one of the short-sighted moves in response to pressures during the election campaign. The Labor candidate, the member for Lingiari, went about talking to those who were profiting from the status quo of CDEP-and they were a tiny minority, those who were able to gain more income from top-ups and so on. The candidate helped secure his re-election by promising that CDEP would be retained. CDEP was sit-down money. It MAIN COMMITTEE excluded some 80 per cent of the local population who had no jobs and most of those on CDEP, mostly men, had no real work to do. It was a huge disappointment. AgainI say to the minister: please re-examine what we were doing to support Indigenous people in the arts sector to be properly reimbursed for their artwork and to be genuinely upskilled, trained and initiated into the mysteries of art marketing and resale. I put another issue to the minister, and that is the royalty resale scheme, which I understand the Labor government committed to as part of its election commitments. I have heard nothing from the minister in the first three months about the royalty resale scheme. It is a complex issue and, for Indigenous artists in particular, as he would acknowledge, a matter of huge import as their artwork passes from one owner to another, going from several hundred dollars reimbursement, say, out at Finke River to hundreds of thousands of dollars perhaps on resale in the international market. I ask the minister to address the royalty resale scheme urgently, because it is a matter that is of very live and real interest, particularly to Indigenous artists. I want to talk about building upon the success of our world-class training institutions. The coalition put a lot of resources and effort into our training institutions to provide Australia with our next generation of artists and performers. We encouraged understanding, knowledge, participation and appreciation of Australian culture across Australia and the world. We did this through funding programs, not by writing press releases, giving interviews or making feelgood statements. We actually put resources behind our ideals and our values. Let me go back to the business of younger people. I mentioned that our coalition government was very concerned about ensuring generations of young musicians and others develop their talents. The Young and Emerging Artists Fund was a coalition initiative which was commenced in 1996. It is in limbo, I am sorry to tell you. The Young and Emerging Artists Fund provided funds for fellowships, cadetships and so on for rural and regional artists, as well as metropolitan artists. As we speak, there is no advertising of those positions and there are no calls for expressions of interest, because bodies like NIDA, the Australian Youth Orchestra and so on have no idea what Labor is going to do about this emerging artists fund. They have had no instructions and no information. They do not know whether it is like the other axed programs: simply gone. Or is the minister contemplating something even more generous than that which the coalition put into the system? The young artists and performers want to know. They have to know. Our young and emerging artists deserve better than what they are getting right now from the Rudd government. The coalition provided record levels of financial support, totalling $680 million in our 2007-08 budget. That represented an increase of $40 million since the previous year, and an increase of more than 65 per cent since Labor was in office last, in 1996. As I have said repeatedly, Mr Garrett has presided over a slash of over $40 million in his first 100 days. Sadly, we are told there is more to come, with the depreciation issue being revisited and the two per cent dividend on the table that the agencies must deal with. The coalition introduced a $282.9 million film package, which was to bring more international film productions to Australia, encourage greater investment in the Australian film industry and strengthen our film production and acting skills base. All we have got so far from Labor is the legislation before the House today, the Screen Australia Bill, but no funding attached to it and heaven knows what might be attached in the future to anything they might call a film package. We committed almost $420 million over three years from 2007-08 for the MAIN COMMITTEE Australia Council-an increase of $20 million over the previous three years. Labor has already slashed the Australia Council funding by $4.5 million. That has been announced and is already being dealt with by the Australia Council, which is an umbrella funding body for the other institutions. We committed over $30 million over four years from 2006-07 to make Old Parliament House the premier institution interpreting Australia’s political history. Canberra citizens are still reeling from the shock of the slashes to the National Capital Authority, which is making the icon institutions in the Australian Capital Territory look very much like the poor relations, given that many of them are still young and building up their collections. We committed $26.5 million for the National Archives of Australia over four years for the new purpose-built preservation and record storage facility. As we say, the Labor government has no such commitment. All it is doing is enacting our legislation. There was a commitment for $10.6 million over four years, from 2006-07, to improve the governance, finances and artistic standards of the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra, and Orchestra Victoria. Mr Garrett is silent on that issue too. priate title. Australia’s small to medium performing arts companies with funding boosts in the 2004-05 and 2007-08 budgets, providing $7.8 million per year to 60 small to medium arts organisations. As I keep saying, Labor has slashed that funding, demanding a two per cent efficiency dividend overall, and of course it has taken away the international touring opportunities for any performers who wish to take their talents offshore. Then there was the Australian Chamber Orchestra’s funding slash. They can no longer put forward their international competition and their masterclasses-something they had become internationally famous for. We had enhanced the stability of Australia’s 20 major performing arts companies, which benefited their combined audience of around 2.4 million Australians, including one million children. The 2.4 million Australian audience was a direct result of their better resourcing. Even more importantly than the better resourcing, we had ensured the stability or security of ongoing funding. Without that security, our 20 major performing arts companies are in serious jeopardy. We provided $6 million over four years, from 2007-08, for the Bundanon Trust. We had developed and extended the visual arts and craft strategy to support artists, galleries, Indigenous visual arts centres and contemporary art exhibitions. Until three months ago, that coalition strategy had resulted in a 23 per cent increase in the earnt income of the organisations, a 98 per cent increase in public programs and a 41 per cent increase in gallery visiting numbers. We are very proud of those achievements of the John Howard government in the visual arts and craft strategy area. What have we had in the first three months, or 100 days, of Labor? As I have said to you, we have seen funding slashed, we have seen the heart taken out of young performers’ futures and, in particular, we have seen a constraining of international exposure for our artists as our Australia on the World Stage program was slashed. As I said to you before, to ensure that generations of young musicians could develop their talents through the Australian Youth OrMAIN COMMITTEE",209,National Film And Sound Archive Bill 2008 Screen Australia And The National Film And Sound Archive

307,Dr Stone,"I will, Madam Deputy Speaker. We were committed to securing the future ofchestra, we provided $1.9 million over four years. We do not know about that funding’s future. We certainly do know that the Young and Emerging Artists Fund, which commenced in 1996 and needs re-funding from June this year, is in limbo. We also supported the National Institute of Dramatic Art to the tune of $4.8 million over four years. NIDA-in the minister’s own electorate-waits with bated breath to see if it will be able to continue to be pre-eminent in Australia, training not only some of what have turned out to be the world’s best actors but also the producers, the makers of costumes and the interpreters of great and new works. All of that, as I say, is in limbo. I will end with a quotation from the minister himself which I think is rather compelling. The minister, Mr Garrett, said: I think most people who have ever had a go at writing a poem or doing a painting realise it’s very hard to do it well, but at the same time, for artists, it’s a choiceless act, although you’re choosing to do it because it’s your vocation. You need more than a vocation; you need Australian government funding support. Arts can never be financially self-sufficient right across the board. I ask the minister to rethink his funding cuts. (Time expired) (12.34 pm)-in reply-I thank the member for Murray for concluding her remarks with a quote from me, and I would be happy to provide her with further quotes, at length, to deal with some of the issues that she raised in debating and responding to the legislation before the House-the Screen Australia Bill 2008, the National Film and Sound Archive Bill 2008 and Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008-but I do not think that is what people want to hear. I will say that the member opposite, the shadow minister for the arts, spoke about the Liberal Party’s commitment to the arts and Australian political history, but there is one thing that she neglected to address: that is the fact that, for the first time that I am aware of in Australian political history, the government of the day, the Liberal-National coalition, went to the 2007 election without an arts policy. There was no arts policy at all. We basically heard nothing from the then minister for the arts, Senator Brandis; we knew nothing of his views about the future of arts and culture in Australia. It was a glaring absence, a remarkable absence, at the time. I say to members opposite that, rather than their description of the Rudd government’s approach to ensuring that there is fiscal prudence operating across all departments and portfolios-something that I had every expectation the opposition would in fact acknowledge and support-as slashed funding, what we are actually talking about is an efficiency dividend. That is absolutely clear. This government is tackling the inflationary pressures that were left behind by the previous government, and I do not expect any aspects or parts of my portfolio to be immune from that. At the same time, this government will ensure that Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive are properly resourced. We will ensure that there is robust attention to the situations and conditions that artists across the spectrum find themselves in. We will ensure that there is a strong and clear voice of support for their endeavours. The voices that we heard from the past government-the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, and others-were voices of derision. The voices of the Rudd Labor government are voices of support. MAIN COMMITTEE",214,National Film And Sound Archive Bill 2008 Screen Australia And The National Film And Sound Archive
308,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith,"Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts)I will refer very quickly to a couple of other remarks that the member for Murray made. I was very interested to see that she raised the discussion paper on the legal deposit issue. My understanding is that a discussion paper was committed to in 2004 and, three years later, it was produced. That seems to have been the totality of the opposition’s commitment to legal deposits. It is an issue that I will be looking at further down the track and I will endeavour to move a little more quickly than that, I have to tell you. Finally, in relation to the shadow minister’s remarks about UNESCO, I really look forward to the opposition reviewing its approach generally to UNESCO and other UN instruments, because for 11½ years what we really had was disdain for the UN from Mr Howard, the former Prime Minister, and from members opposite. Now it seems they have discovered that House. I hope this leads to better things-in other words, a more mature, more constructive multilateral engagement by the opposition with UN fora and institutions, including UNESCO. AndI look forward to their support for a resale royalty. It is our intention to introduce legislation for a resale royalty scheme for visual artists. We have long said that it is a great deficiency in our system that artists, particularly Indigenous artists, whose work experiences pretty significant increases in price do not gain some measure of benefit from that. SoI look forward to the support of the opposition. As I said when we introduced these bills into the parliament on 20 February-and I do acknowledge the role played by the previous government in bringing this legislation forward in its initial phase-the government place a very high value on a creative and viable Australian film and television industry, and the passage of these bills is one means of providing support to the industry as it seeks to meet and overcome the many challenges it faces. I note that the public consultation process showed widespread support for the new agency, which I strongly supported from day one in opposition in the Labor Party and in my capacity as shadow spokesman for arts and then shadow minister for the arts. I want to acknowledge and thank all those who took time to provide submissions. While all the submissions could not be acted upon, nevertheless they did inform the overall process and will continue to inform Screen Australia as it goes into its establishment phase. If Screen Australia is to do the job it is being set up to do, it cannot simply be an amalgam of the three agencies which will be merged into it, although the government acknowledges the very fine efforts of these agencies over many years. But Screen Australia cannot operate in distinct silos nor, on merging, with three separate cultures. It must become a unified single entity with a fresh perspective on the challenges which the Australian film and television industry faces. The government expects Screen Australia to adopt a balanced approach to the various functions which it is required to undertake, to offer leadership to the industry during a period of significant change and to be efficient in its operations so that it maximises funding available for its programs. As Screen Australia will have a number of diverse functions and a broad range of stakeholder interests to consider, the board and management will need to ensure wide consultation in relation to agency priorities, objectives and processes to ensure all voices can be heard as the new entity emerges. However, I caution that the industry will need to be patient as the agency builds up to full capacity. The industry must also seek to change, grow and become more sustainable. The new funding body cannot and will not have all the answers. It will operate alongside the producer offset, and its functions and operations must be seen in MAIN COMMITTEE that light. The government is committed to putting the framework for change in place, but the extent of the change which occurs will largely be determined by industry willingness to embrace new approaches and explore new business models. It is an exciting challenge for both Screen Australia and the film and television industry, but one I am sure they will be able to meet. In particular, I want to emphasise the importance of documentary funding through Screen Australia. As I indicated in the second reading speech, it is the government’s intention that the National Interest Program, currently administered by Film Australia, be strengthened and broadened so that programs of all types which are of special cultural and historical importance can be made. This is not meant to constrain Screen Australia from supporting documentaries through other funding programs where they meet criteria for funding. Indeed, I would hope that the documentary sector as a whole will benefit from stronger resourcing as a result of the creation of Screen Australia. I am also excited by the potential of the new National Film and Sound Archive to become a national collecting institution of some note and to build on the good work that has been done by archivists there. I know that many people have lobbied hard for the archive to have statutory independence to assist it to be an even more effective institution than it has been to date. In particular, I want to thank Senator Kate Lundy for her ongoing support for the archive, and also the member for Fraser, Bob McMullan. I trust supporters will continue to provide input to the archive’s objectives, priorities and programs. As I said when introducing this legislation, the archive cannot just be about maintaining and preserving the national collection. It will need to have a high public profile and an outward focus on developing public awareness of and access to the collection, as well as providing support to other less well-resourced collecting bodies around the country. With its new autonomy comes a requirement for greater transparency and accountability. Both the government and the industry will have high expectations of what the archive can achieve. I hope the archive itself will embrace this new role and status and seek to work with all its stakeholders to strengthen and expand its role so that generations to come will see it as a valuable resource and leader in its field. This legislation is important. The government strongly supports a viable and sustainable film industry, an expression of the great cultural vitality of our creative communities and of our nation.

Infrastructure Australia is a proposed statutory authority that will be established to advise all levels of government on matters relating to the provision of infrastructure. Infrastructure is important to many people. It is something that governments do need to act on, particularly for people in Western Sydney and in my electorate. I, like many others, will be supporting the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 today in the hope that we can get rid of some of the obstacles to getting good infrastructure that exist at the state level and the local level. I would like to start, however, by making some general points about this bill. There are some concerns about this new statutory body. Firstly, I think it is very important that this body created by government not become an extra hurdle or burden that vital infrastructure projects have to get over. It must not add any delays or burdens to processes that, because of our federal system, can already be complex and unwieldy. I note in particular that there will be a 12month review period, and I hope that this period does not become an excuse or justification for inaction on vital infrastructure by a new government. Secondly, I would like to say that Infrastructure Australia does need to be non-partisan in its approach. All of its appointments are made by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and, in view of the gross politicisation of sectors of our Public Service at a state level, our community will be watching the operation of this new government bureaucracy carefully in the hope that it will be genuinely independent and able to add some value, not burden, to infrastructure planning in Australia. There are going to be 12 appointees, some made in agreement with the states, and I would also add a concern that there has been a lot of failed thinking in relation to the provision of infrastructure at a state level. I think it is quite necessary that we do not allow that same sort of thinking to dominate outcomes in relation to infrastructure from a national perspective. I am going to spend some time today talking about some of the significant failures at the state level because I think Infrastructure Australia will achieve nothing if it is just the same faces and the same thinking. For example, if you look at New South Wales and examine the state public private partnership deals that have been allowed to exist under the current Labor state government, you see state government departments such as the Roads and Traffic AuMAIN COMMITTEE",215,National Film And Sound Archive Bill 2008 Screen Australia And The National Film And Sound Archive
309,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12.46 Pm),"Coming from an electorate which represents one ofthority allowed to engage in contracts with various companies, essentially to receive a payment direct to their department to close a legion of public roads, forcing people to use the privately funded infrastructure-the infamous Cross City Tunnel. That Cross City Tunnel deal, when it became public, became a scandal that the people of Sydney rejected. The government was forced to break its contract and, of course, the Cross City Tunnel consortium is now bankrupt. These kinds of episodes and experiences give a very bad name to public-private partnerships and this is, we know from experience, a further disincentive for private capital to get involved in public-private partnerships and also another burden. So it will be a good thing if Infrastructure Australia can examine some of the contractual arrangements at state level in particular and determine why there have been such failures. The north-west of Sydney, my electorate, is one of the fastest-growing areas of Sydney. It is on the urban fringes of Sydney, one of our biggest cities. Infrastructure is desperately needed in Mitchell to meet the massive demands of growth. The north-west of Sydney is earmarked as one of the biggest growth corridors in our country. I guess one of the first performance measures that infrastructure will face is that if infrastructure continues to not be provided in urban fringe areas in the major growth corridors of our cities, then it will not have achieved anything except to add an extra layer of bureaucracy. For example, in the north-west of Sydney you have one of the biggest business parks, with the major national headquarters of 500 companies. There are 20,000 employees there. That will grow to 40,000 in about 10 years. There is no rail line. There is no mass transit system in this sector of Sydney and it is essential that we get one in the near future. There has been some suggestion that the previous federal government failed somehow in relation to infrastructure, but the only working, functional piece of major infrastructure that has gone into Western Sydney in many decades was the M7. I am going to speak some more about that later. The M7, the orbital motorway that surrounds Sydney, has been a major success. In fact, when you look at some of the other state funded infrastructure and managed projects you get a lot of complaints about tolling and other matters, but I receive no complaints about the M7. It is a working and vital piece of infrastructure that was fully funded by the Howard government. When you look at the provisions of this bill, there is scope for some positive developments. We do need to consider how best to remove regulatory barriers to getting good infrastructure at different levels, and hopefully this can be achieved. Looking at state and local governments, you can see some systems, levies and charges that really prevent good infrastructure from getting built. For example, infrastructure levies at the state level need to be looked at as well as the rates of infrastructure levies and the rate of return that people get for the amount of money that they are forced to pay in levies, taxes and charges. In the 2006 National Housing Infrastructure Costs Study that was commissioned by the Residential Development Council it was found that indirect infrastructure charges for housing and home units have increased significantly in Sydney, far outstripping the growth in construction costs. Significantly, it has been the increase in indirect infrastructure charges covering roads and public transport which has been the most dramatic. As a result of these increases in levies, houses in Sydney now incur infrastructure charges of $68,233, of which over $66,000 relate to indirect charges. From 1995 to 2006, total indirect infrastructure MAIN COMMITTEE charges per lot for new housing developments increased by $55,000; an indexed increase of 171.9 per cent. By stark comparison, Brisbane homes have seen no increase in indirect infrastructure charges while Melbourne has seen an indexed increase of just over 30 per cent. I will say that again: there has been an indexed increase in Sydney for new housing developments of 171.9 per cent for infrastructure. These significant increases in indirect infrastructure charges in Sydney have had a serious impact on the housing affordability in my electorate of Mitchell. Whilst the residents of Mitchell are paying more and more for infrastructure, they continue to receive some of the most substandard public transport facilities in the country. They are paying an indexed increase of 171.9 per cent, but the state government will not fund a rail line for the north-west of Sydney. I want to speak about that for a moment. The New South Wales state government has really abandoned one of its core responsibilities here. One of Infrastructure Australia’s first priorities should be to consider the construction of a heavy rail line in the north-west of Sydney. I have written to Minister Albanese requesting an urgent meeting to discuss what the federal government can do to fund vital infrastructure in Western Sydney in a timely fashion. I know that the minister states that he wants a 12-month review-a 12-month delay to give time to discuss or examine that. A 12-month delay when you have been waiting 20 years for a rail line is another unfair imposition on the people in Mitchell. If you look at the record of the New South Wales state Labor government, there is a case for the federal government to intervene. On 29 November 1998, three months prior to a state election, the New South Wales state government first promised $29 million for the north-west rail link from Epping Station to Castle Hill. Since then, the government has re-announced the north-west rail link five times. On9 June 2005, Bob Carr announced an $8 billion, 15-year metropolitan rail extension program. This announcement included the north-west rail link, a new passenger line from Cheltenham to Rouse Hill and long-term plans to extend the Vineyard and Richmond lines. On 20 November 2006 the government re-announced the completion of the north-west rail line by 2017-the first stage to be completed by 2015 and the second stage by 2017. The government recently re-announced the line in June 2007 with an extension from Rouse Hill to Vineyard station on the Richmond line. All of this shows that if it were not for the previous federal government, very little would have been done in the last 10 years. The states are failing. Another important matter that Infrastructure Australia needs to consider-and one of the major disincentives-is the bad reputation infrastructure is getting from tolling. The New South Wales state government have used a system of geographical discrimination based on where people live. They subsidise people for using some tollways but not for using others. They do it on the basis of where a person comes from and how they get to work. For example, people in my electorate pay tolls to get to work. Based on a 48-hour working week, motorists travelling to the city are now paying $16.90 a day-which is $84.50 a week, $330 a month or $4,056 a year-just to go to work. By contrast, a person using the M4 and M5 motorways in the south-west of Sydney pays $1.20 a day-which is $6.00 a week, $24 a month or just $288 annually once the state government rebate is received. That is $4,056 a year versus $288 a year. This is another example of a failure in the system of infrastructure that has been created in Sydney. MAIN COMMITTEE Residents of north-western Sydney pay an average of $4,000 in post-tax income on tollsincluding the M2, the M7, the Lane Cove tunnel and the harbour tunnel-while residents in western Sydney using the M4 and M5 pay less than $300 a year due to cash-back schemes. For those members not from Sydney, what is the difference between M2 users and M4 and M5 users? I would argue that it is where they live; it is discrimination between a safe seat and a marginal seat; it is a deliberate policy of geographical discrimination put in place by the state government. Infrastructure Australia must take state governments to task for these appalling and discriminatory decisions. The use of subsidies for some areas of Sydney but discrimination against other areas, on no logical basis, must be abandoned. It will be a good thing if Infrastructure Australia can remove these sorts of scandalous arrangements from infrastructure management in Australia. There are other major infrastructure projects that the New South Wales state government has failed on, and arrangements that must be considered in this review. You could talk about things like the closure of Epping Road-another public-private partnership in which the state government has closed lanes towards the Sydney CBD on a major public road to funnel people into a privately operated tollway. Again, the tollway and the public-private partnership is a good development. It is good to get private capital into infrastructure. It is good for the government to be encouraging it and ensuring that the arrangements can be put into place to manage it. It is manifestly wrong of any government-whether it be a state government or a federal government-to close public roads that have been paid for by people’s taxes over many years in order to funnel motorists onto a tollway or motorway so that they have no choice about the roads they use. In addition we have seen other fiascos in Sydney such as the T-card fiasco. We are one of the few major cities in the world that does not have an integrated transport network. The New South Wales state government has spent 10 years planning for a smartcard system on Sydney’s buses, trains and ferries, yet it has become a total and unmitigated failure. This is another thing that is preventing the construction of integrated and future orientated infrastructure. Major cities around the world-including Hong Kong, London, Singapore, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth-have successfully introduced smartcard technology for public transport, but not Sydney. We have four separate ticketing systems for trains, ferries, buses and light rail. That is disgraceful in city like Sydney. I also want to talk about some of the failures in infrastructure planning that have happened in other parts of Sydney. For example, we have had more rail lines cancelled. A Parramatta to Epping railway line has been announced many times before state elections but cancelled after those state elections. My essential point in reinforcing this failure at the state level, particularly on the part of the New South Wales state government, to provide infrastructure is that states do need to be taken to task over these failures. Infrastructure Australia ought to cooperate with the states, but it also needs to be very frank with them. It needs to say to the states: ‘You have failed here. You have given commitments. You haven’t met your commitments. We require a better performance from you.’ You cannot be cosy with the states when they have not provided essential infrastructure. It has to be critical where required, and it has to point to the failures of public-private partnerships whereby state government departments have negotiated their own deals which have resulted in a scandal and the bankruptcy of those private organisations. People in north-west SydneyMAIN COMMITTEE Ms Neal-It’s a private risk. state government. I would argue that is one of the biggest risks. Never mind the constant attacks on oil companies. People in north-west Sydney also pay 52c a litre in excise. I think people want to see that 52c going back into their roads. It is not right that governments levy such a substantial amount on each dollar we pay at the petrol bowser and yet our roads in north-western Sydney are still in a shocking state. We need major upgrades. Another important concern of Sydneysiders in the future will be the F3 motorway. Each day we have 75,000 vehicles travelling on the F3. During peak times 3,000 vehicles an hour vie for lane space. The F3 is well past its capacity and usefulness as Sydney’s northern gateway. Recently we saw the whole motorway closed because of a bushfire, and people were unable to access the northern gateway to Sydney. There was a recent report in the Sunday Telegraph that there were 16 closures on the F3 in at least one direction in the past year due to accidents or bushfires, causing delays of between 30 minutes and several hours. The recent Pearlman report recommended that the government could begin work immediately on the construction of a link between the F3 freeway and Sydney’s north-west orbital at the M7. I strongly support option (c) of the Pearlman report. I would make another observation about this report. Infrastructure Australia are going to conduct a 12-month review. In this review they ought not to reinvent the wheel and start from scratch. They ought to consider examining very valuable and detailed reports such as the Pearlman report, which has recommended vital infrastructure. If Infrastructure Australia is only directed by the minister to look at the projects that he considers to be important, rather than having a broader look at what good work has already been done at the federal and state levels in recommending vital infrastructure upgrades, that will be a weakness in the new Infrastructure Australia system. The Pearlman report does call for option (c) planning to be commenced, which would see the second crossing of the Hawkesbury River. It would provide greater opportunities for business and better conditions on local roads. It is the option that the majority of local residents in my electorate of Mitchell would support. The state and federal governments do need to get on with the job of progressing option (c) and giving residents in north-western Sydney some reprieve. There has been a contention in this bill and the events surrounding the formation of this bill that there was no action by the previous government in relation to infrastructure. As I mentioned, people in Western Sydney know that the previous federal government believed in the provision of essential infrastructure, and the M7 orbital project is an example of one of the best motorways in Sydney. Due to the strategic and economic importance of Western Sydney, and the fact that it had become the third-largest producer of GDP behind the Sydney CBD and Melbourne, the Howard government funded the Western Sydney Orbital. Many of my constituents remark that the tolls for the M2 and the state funded access routes to the city are exorbitant and negative. It is widely regarded that the M7 is well priced and useful, something that we can thank the previous government for. Infrastructure Australia will be of no use to anyone if it is not completely non-partisan. In the interests of transparency and open government that we hear so much about from the other side these days, the directions from the minister to Infrastructure Australia ought to be tabled before the parliament. I think that would really strengthen the system and the accountability to MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
310,Mr Hawke,"Risk becomes a big thing-the risk is dealing with the New South Walesthis place. It is a sensible and proper proposal. It will not work if it does not ensure that there is accountability for the minister’s directions to Infrastructure Australia. I note that at the moment it is proposed that they be in the annual report of the Infrastructure Australia body. If that is the case, then why would there not be a provision for the minister’s directions to be tabled in the House? Infrastructure Australia could be an important development in infrastructure in Australia. It must not, as I have spoken about, add an extra regulatory burden to infrastructure provision in Australia. It will not succeed if it does not urgently review some of the discriminatory policies that have happened at state level and some of the failures that states have made in the provision of infrastructure in Australia. It must urgently consider major projects in some of the fastest growing corridors of Sydney to recommend and fund the urgent construction of projects such as the north-west rail line and a second crossing of the Hawkesbury River. This minister and this Labor government must ensure that Infrastructure Australia is something that adds value to the process of infrastructure provision in Australia and does not add regulation and unfair burdens to already challenging circumstances. Sitting suspended from 1.06 pm to 4.32 pm Australia) (4.32 pm)-I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. Failure to address the infrastructure challenges facing Australia will threaten our national prosperity, our job markets, our cities and our ability to address inflationary pressures. Put simply, this is an issue that directly impacts our quality of life. That is why the Rudd Labor government is establishing Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will advise on national infrastructure priorities, better arrangements for investors, better use of our current assets and improved capability and planning. Better infrastructure means better communities. It means liveable cities; water and energy getting to where they are needed; cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes leaving and arriving on time. It means a more productive economy delivering better living standards and reductions in man-made emissions to the air, soil and water. Australia is a trading nation. Getting our agricultural products, manufactured goods, minerals and services to international markets is how we make our way. Australia’s geography and distribution of our population means that we are dependent on efficient infrastructure investment and use. Underinvestment in infrastructure reduces our ability to trade in international markets. Failure to fix infrastructure shortfalls, supply chain bottlenecks and urban congestion puts a brake on economic and productivity growth. It also puts stress on our communities. Infrastructure is about the future. National coordination of infrastructure is a key element in the government’s plan to lift productivity and fight inflation. It requires national leadership to tackle the bottlenecks and backlogs in strategic infrastructure such as transport, energy, communications and water. It was recently estimated by CEDA that it would take around $25 billion of new investment just to bring Australia’s strategic infrastructure up to scratch. In an intelligent economy, infrastructure systems interact organically, building interdependencies, network benefits and synergies. In Australia, our infrastructure systems can create interdependencies, but frequently they heighten the risk of problems flowing virus-like from one network to another. For example, capacity constraints on our railways and on our roads affect the functioning of our ports. Water shortages impede industrial and mineral production and, MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
311,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northernfrequently, improvements to our arterial roads simply push traffic snarls and congestion downstream. The solution requires cooperation at all levels of government-Commonwealth, state and local-as well as the involvement of all sectors of the economy, public and private. Unfortunately, until now, the provision of important infrastructure has been considered in silos, in isolation, within different levels of government and without dialogue between the public and private sectors. As recently demonstrated capacity constraints in the Queensland and Hunter Valley coal chains have shown, a lack of coordination between governments and the private sector inevitably results in a loss of national income and reduced opportunities for our export industries. Infrastructure investment needs to be determined objectively and according to long-term need, thereby creating an environment conducive to greater public and private investment in common user and public infrastructure. The Business Council of Australia in its Infrastructure action plan for future prosperity report called for an integrated long-term planning framework across jurisdictions for the coordinated provision of infrastructure to underpin sustained strong economic growth. The nation needs a mechanism that will achieve both of these ends and, in so doing, lock in Australia’s future prosperity and higher productivity. The government has started building that mechanism. It is called Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia takes a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it will lift investment in new infrastructure. Secondly, it will make better use of existing infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia’s initial task is to conduct a national audit to determine the capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure. This audit is to be completed and presented to the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, by March 2009. It is ambitious, but we have to be ambitious. The longer we wait and the slower we are, the worse the problem will get. After taking into account expected future demand, the audit will also identify gaps, deficiencies, impediments and bottlenecks across important sectors of the national economy. Infrastructure Australia is the new mechanism to identify the nature of our infrastructure shortfall and the broad investment, legislative and regulatory responses required. Synergies from streamlining guidelines, legislation and regulations across jurisdictions will make for more competitive environments and more efficient planning and use of infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia will have the capacity to improve tender processes and contract documentation between Commonwealth and state jurisdictions. Harmonising procurement guidelines means investment partnerships being better. Whether they provide for public-private partnerships, private delivery or public delivery of infrastructure, they can deliver better value for money and investment dollars can be matched with infrastructure priorities. Nationally consistent best practice public-private partnership guidelines will be available by the end of the year and will make it less expensive for local and international companies to invest in Australian infrastructure. Robust regulatory and market priced frameworks will encourage efficient use of infrastructure and timely investment in new and updated infrastructure. The matter is urgent. Our cities are facing challenges that reduce their liveability. While the economic cost of congestion in our major cities has been estimated at $9.4 billion in 2005, on a business-as-usual basis it is expected to increase to $20.4 billion by 2020. The solution cannot be simply one of building our way out of the problem but of examining more fundamentally the competing demands and overloads right across the infrastructure MAIN COMMITTEE spectrum. This legislation establishes Infrastructure Australia as a statutory advisory council to develop a strategic blueprint for our nation’s future infrastructure needs. In partnership with the states and territories and in consultation with the private sector and local government, it will oversight the blueprint’s implementation. Infrastructure Australia will provide advice about the infrastructure gaps and problems that hinder economic growth and prosperity. It will also identify investment priorities and policy and regulatory reforms that will be necessary to enable timely and coordinated delivery of national infrastructure investment. The Infrastructure Australia council will have 12 experienced members, drawn from industry, government and local government. The new Office of the Infrastructure Coordinator will be a statutory office within the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government portfolio, supported by a small team of professionals. COAG has created an infrastructure working group which will have a critical role in devising the reporting arrangements to COAG for Infrastructure Australia as well as the scope for the infrastructure audit. The emphasis will be on the future capacity of strategic infrastructure to improve national productivity. In addition, Infrastructure Australia will be expected to provide advice on regulatory reform that can improve the utilisation of infrastructure and streamline new projects. It will propose ways to harmonise legislation and regulation across jurisdictions. Our infrastructure shortfalls and bottlenecks have developed over the past decade. They are exacerbated by the current economic circumstances. Solutions will take time but we must start now. Infrastructure Australia is the first critical step. I commend the bill to the chamber. tralia Bill 2008. This bill is for the establishment of a new body, as the previous speaker was outlining, whose primary function will largely be the provision of advice on infrastructure priorities to the federal government and governments at the state and local level, to investors in infrastructure and to owners of infrastructure. It will advise on Australia’s current and future needs and priorities relating to nationally significant infrastructure. It will also advise on impediments to the efficient utilisation of national infrastructure networks and provide advice on options in reforms, including regulatory reforms, to achieve efficiency gains in the nation’s infrastructure networks. There is no doubt that infrastructure planning and delivery by definition need to be well planned and coordinated in order to maintain a healthy level of growth in the Australian economy. Without regular investment in road, rail and port infrastructure, bottlenecks develop and these hinder productivity, which in turn can increase costs faced by business and industry. But let us not deceive our constituents by allowing a false perception to be created by this bill. Under the Australian Constitution, much of the nation’s vital economic infrastructure is the responsibility of the states. Roads, highways, ports, electricity and water have traditionally been funded and provided by state governments and, in many cases, local governments under the authority of state governments. However, traditionally the Commonwealth has had the financial capacity to assist the states in the provision of infrastructure and provides grants to state and local governments to fund infrastructure projects. Let us also understand the issue and not deceive our constituents into thinking that this bill marks some form of new ground zero in national infrastructure development in this country, because it surely does not. The Commonwealth government has become involved in important nation-building projects over many, many years. The most obvious and the most signifiMAIN COMMITTEE",223,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
312,Mr Morrison (Cook) (4.42 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Infrastructure Auscant and iconic in the Australian imagination and in reality is the Snowy Mountains hydro scheme, built between 1949 and 1974. It was the largest engineering project ever completed in Australia’s history. This project and its workforce changed our nation forever. More recently AusLink was established by the former government under John Howard to deliver funding for the nation’s most critical land transport infrastructure. AusLink mark 1 was an $11.8 billion land transport plan that incorporated former national highways, key urban freight routes and key rail links between capital cities. An investment of this scale could only have been made possible because of the Howard government’s strong record of economic management. A record 10 surplus budgets in a row delivered the capacity to deliver billions of dollars of national infrastructure projects, including roads, railways and ports. AusLink identified a national land transport network, including links to airports and shipping ports. It was a multimodal plan comprising both road and rail and was applauded at the time for integrating them. There was an emphasis placed on improving transport corridors between the nation’s largest cities. Improvements to freight routes were also vital for business and industry. During the 11½ years of the Howard government many important infrastructure projects were delivered as a consequence of good fiscal responsibility and strong and prudent economic management of our nation’s purse strings. Some examples in my own home state of New South Wales of the benefits of this sound economic management and funding that found its way to important infrastructure projects include the Western Sydney orbital, a project which I think is one of the only Sydney road projects, at least in recent memory, that has not become a public farce. Three hundred and fifty-six million dollars of federal funds was given to this $1.5 billion transport project, at the urging, I might stress strongly, of the many Western Sydney Liberal members of parliament at the time. The remainder of the funds came from the private sector. The orbital has proved to be critical infrastructure for Sydney’s booming employment hub in Western Sydney as we see whole new developments come up along the hub and along the corridor. This is becoming an important distribution network for Sydney, for New South Wales and for the nation more generally. But there are others. The Albury bypass: $25 million of federal funds was given to this $524 million project to construct a freeway standard bypass of the Albury urban centre. The Tugun bypass, an infrastructure project straddling the New South Wales and Queensland border: $120 million of federal funds was given to this $543 million road project linking Queensland’s Gold Coast with the Pacific Highway near Tweed Heads in northern New South Wales. There was the duplication of the Sheehan Bridge on the Hume Highway at Gundagai. This project is being undertaken entirely with funds allocated by the former Howard government under the AusLink program. The Pacific Highway upgrade: before 1996 just nine per cent of the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the Queensland border had four lanes. Because of funding provided by the Howard government, more than 39 per cent of that highway is now dual carriageway in the areas I have mentioned. There is the widening of the F3: $86 million of federal funds went into widening the F3 between the Hawkesbury River and Calga. This project has improved traffic congestion on a road that carries more than 60,000 motorists and 7,000 freight vehicles per day. The North Kiama bypass: the Howard government contributed $34 million to this $179 million project, which removed a dangerous bottleneck on the Princes Highway south of Wollongong. The Hume Highway: federal funds were allowed MAIN COMMITTEE for forward planning on the Newell Highway bypass at Holbrook and Tarcutta. The $179 million Coolah bypass is being fully funded with federal funds under AusLink. Also, members driving to Canberra from Sydney will have noticed recent improvements to the Hume Highway north of Goulburn at Towrang and Carrick roads. These roadworks were completed with federal funding of about $7.5 million. The benefits of AusLink did not stop at highway construction. There was significant funding allocated to important railway infrastructure. The Australian Rail Track Corporation manages over 10,000 route kilometres of standard gauge interstate track in four states, which I am sure would be of great interest to the former member for Farrer and former Deputy Prime Minister, who is a keen enthusiast on rail matters and would have been very excited about this initiative. Recent investments of federal funding through this program included $2.4 billion invested to upgrade the interstate and Hunter Valley rail system. Federal funding enabled the replacement of the old rail bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga. Trains no longer need to slow to 20 kilometres an hour. They can now cross the river at the more acceptable speed of 80 kilometres an hour. The Sandgate flyover in the Hunter Valley provides grade separation between coal trains heading to the port and other trains using the main line between Sydney and Brisbane. This $80 million investment delivers the rail infrastructure that is needed to meet the future demands of Australia’s coal exports from Newcastle. I now turn my attention to some of the failures that we have seen in infrastructure in my home state of New South Wales and also locally, and the failure of the state government of New South Wales to invest in infrastructure. It is not a misrepresentation of the truth to say that the New South Wales state Labor government has a reputation for being a bungler when it comes to important infrastructure projects in that important state-that is, the projects that it delivers. Many do not even get past the announcement phase. They get announced many times-in fact, I suspect more has been invested in the public relations associated with the announcements of some of these projects than has actually been invested in infrastructure itself-but many do not even get past the announcement phase before they die a horrible death at the hands of the New South Wales Treasury, the New South Wales Treasurer or just general government incompetence. An example of their track record includes, of course, the Monty of them all, the Cross-City Tunnel. The handling of that project was nothing short of a debacle. This $1 billion investment by the private sector opened in 2005 and, within months, the state Labor government reversed local road closures and diversions as part of a contract they negotiated in secret with the Roads and Traffic Authority. This was taken by many to be a signal that you cannot do business with the New South Wales government. If you are going to have negotiations about infrastructure projects, have them in the open. Do not have them behind closed doors. When you are exposed by the incompetence and narrow-mindedness of those negotiations, you put at risk the credit and investment reputation of your state because you have been unable to be upfront with the people who put you there in the first place. As a result, it was not long before the tunnel owners went into receivership and a fire sale saw the project sold for just $694 million. But, despite all of this, and the reputation of the tunnel, motorists are going to be slugged with a 46c increase in their toll next month. The 3.6 kilometre Lane Cove tunnel, built at a cost of $1.1 billion, opened to motorists in March 2007. It should have opened in February 2007 but, as we know, this was delayed, at MAIN COMMITTEE some considerable cost to the taxpayers of New South Wales. During the construction, part of an apartment block fell into a section of the excavations. Some of us will remember the fairly devastating image that we saw of units hanging precariously over a large hole. We also know of the tragedy and devastation experienced because of how long it took for those people who were affected by that incident to get compensation. For many in Sydney, this project, this hole in the ground, reflected everything that was wrong with the city’s crumbling infrastructurecongested roads and poor public transport. But worse was to come. As I said before, it did not open until March. It was supposed to open in February. At a $25 million cost to the taxpayer, it was delayed until after the March 2007 state election. Ms Hall-Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a question that I would like to ask the member for Cook. tion? Ms Hall-My question to the member for Cook is whether in his speech he is advocating that the federal government take over all of the Sydney infrastructure or whether he is just having a general complain or whinge about the state government. I ask what he is really contributing to this debate, other than to just talk ad nauseam about state issues instead of trying to put forward some ideas for the federal parliament. I would be very interested to know whether he wants the federal government to take over the role of the state government. ganisation will, I suspect, provide advice-that seems to be its primary reason for beingabout who should be handling these things and how they can be achieved. The simple point I am making is that the government is making quite a lot of noise about its intention to do something about infrastructure but it would seem that the clearest obstacle to infrastructure delivery in this country presently is the incompetence of state governments-and that is something it is going to have to address. The Prime Minister puts himself out there as some sort of new ‘father of federation’ when it comes to these issues. I would be very interested to know what Infrastructure Australia is going to have to say about how the federal government is going to get the state governments to actually do their jobs, and we will see an endMs Hall interjectingthese things. I am joining a very strong chorus of people in New South Wales who are sick to death of the bungling of the New South Wales state Labor government. We do not want to see this continue. If the Prime Minister believes he can come to a better deal with the states about how these things are delivered, so be it, but these things must come to an end and we need the infrastructure this is talking about. I have spoken about the Lane Cove tunnel; I want to talk about the desalination plant, which is another legacy of Bob Carr’s trip. Ms Hall-Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, I seek to intervene.

The Iemma state Labor government ignored all reasonable arguments against a desalination plant and proceeded with this enormous waste of taxpayers’ money. In particular, they completely ignored the opportunities for stormwater harvesting and recycling. They totally overstated, and continue to misrepresent, the cost of stormwater harvesting and, more importantly, water recycling in New South Wales. They completely dismissed a very constructive proposal from the opposition regarding the conversion of the SOS system in south-western Sydney to produce potable water for Sydney at half the cost of what was being proposed for the desalination plant at Kurnell. They also broke the trust of the community and the expert panel, breaking their promise not to proceed with the desalination plant unless dam levels hit 30 per cent. Currently, Sydney dams are at 66.5 per cent of full capacity and are rising. Recycling is not the more expensive option, as the government like to claim. When they talk about recycling being more expensive they are referring to the turning back of the Sydney ocean outfalls, which will cost upwards of $3 billion. But there are other options available to the New South Wales state government which they routinely ignore, which does not make good economic sense and certainly does not make good water management sense. Finally, given the constraints of time and the questions posed by those opposite, I will address one last matter. It is a matter that is very dear to people who live in the Sutherland shire: the F6. The F6 is a freeway extension that is an absolute necessity for the people who live in Cook and electorates that surround Cook. If this freeway is built, it will take thousands of cars off local streets of the Sutherland shire each day and improve truck access between the Illawarra, Sydney airport and Port Botany. These ports are increasing their activity and will be putting more traffic through the suburban streets of the shire. These are the streets where, at one point in time, kids used to play footy on the nature strip. These streets are now clearly too dangerous because of the traffic volumes that are going through the suburban streets in the shire. The time has come for the F6, which has been on the record books since at least 1951 or earlier; it is about time to get on with it. I would hope that this project receives some serious priority in the national infrastructure audit that is to be undertaken by Infrastructure Australia. Currently, the freeway ends at Waterfall and, from there, each day thousands of cars must use the Princes Highway and other local roads to get into Sydney. The benefits of building the F6 extension have been well known for a while and were recently highlighted in a report released by the NRMA. The report indicates that there would be economic flow-ons arising from the construction of this project that would not be confined to the local region but would be shared throughout New South Wales and Australia. The report shows that more than 1,000 jobs would be created directly as a consequence of undertaking MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008

321,Mr Morrison,"The desalination plant was a legacy of Bob Carr’s trip to Dubai. Laborthis project and the total economic impact of the project is worth $3.4 billion to our economy, at a cost of just $2.3 billion. Incidentally, that is roughly the same cost of the desalination plant at Kurnell. Industries likely to gain a benefit from the project include the road transport industry and the fuel industry, and the food and beverage industries will profit from lower transport costs. Despite these benefits to the region and to the Sutherland shire more specifically, our state Labor member for Miranda maintains his opposition to this important infrastructure project while vehemently supporting the desalination plant that nobody wants or needs. If we had the choice, if there were $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion on the table, which there clearly is on behalf of Premier Iemma in New South Wales, to undertake a major infrastructure project that will benefit the people of the Sutherland shire, it should not go to the desalination plant at Kurnell-which has just added further disgrace to a site that should be revered as our nation’s birthplace and one of the most significant sites in our nation; it should go to the F6 extension, which would provide real economic and social value. The cost of the project I have referred to is the tunnel option, the preferred option. If the issues surrounding tunnels are properly managed-and I must admit I am somewhat concerned about the ability of the state government to actually manage a tunnel project where the filtration is properly managed and properly funded-the tunnel option is far superior to continuing the farce at Kurnell, which is the desalination plant. What is created by this bill is not a road or a bridge; there are no funds for roads or bridges in this bill. There are no funds for new ports or new coal loaders in this bill, and there is no new Snowy in this bill. This is a bill to establish a government agency to provide advicethere are no new funds-and that is meritorious, which is why we are supporting this bill. Let us have the advice, let us have the agency, let us get out there and do an audit of the infrastructure needs and let us be candid about that audit. I wish them well with their objectives but I remain to be convinced that it will be little more than another bureaucratic adventure at the hands of the bureaucratic master himself, the Prime Minister. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (5.02 pm)-I am very pleased to rise today as a representative of the great nation-building Labor Party to support the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. After 11 years of Howard government neglect a more nationally coordinated approach to infrastructure reform is long overdue and certainly critical to our future. It is critical because unlocking the infrastructure bottlenecks that exist around our nation will help to unlock better economic performance and higher national productivity. This is the proposition that we put to the Australian people last year, a proposition they endorsed at the ballot box, and I am pleased that we are acting on that proposition so early in our first term. The two key roles of Infrastructure Australia will be to audit the adequacy of the nation’s infrastructure and to develop an infrastructure priority list based on this audit for consideration by the Council of Australian Governments. Infrastructure Australia will advise governments, investors and owners of infrastructure concerning nationally significant infrastructure priorities; policy and regulatory reforms that are desirable to improve the efficient utilisation of national infrastructure networks; options to address impediments to the development and provision of efficient national infrastructure; the needs of users; and possible financing mechanisms. MAIN COMMITTEE Nationally significant infrastructure would include transport, energy, communications and water infrastructure in which further investment will materially improve our national productivity. Infrastructure Australia will be structured with a 12-person council, and I am very pleased that the minister has announced Sir Rod Eddington as the chair. The Office of Infrastructure Coordination will be created in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, with an infrastructure coordinator and up to 15 staff to support the work of Infrastructure Australia. Those are the mechanics of this legislation and of Infrastructure Australia. The philosophy behind it, though, flows from the great Labor tradition of nation building. It was Chifley who built the Snowy, Whitlam who brought First World infrastructure to the outer suburbs of our cities and Keating who introduced the Better Cities Program, one that I certainly had intimate dealings with as a director of the Honeysuckle Development Corporation in Newcastle. So in Newcastle we do know a bit about the Better Cities Program and the sort of national building programs that Labor has historically instituted. The Better Cities Program certainly helped us after the BHP steelworks closed, when we needed to transform from an industrial city to a city with a diversified economy. The Better Cities Program was a great model of how communities undergoing transformation could boost their economies, investing in areas like affordable housing, creating jobs and bringing a new vibrancy to their cities. As Newcastle continues to grow and change, so do its infrastructure needs. Its energy, transport, water and communications challenges are laid out for us as we face greater population pressures. SoI am very pleased that the Rudd Labor government that I am a part of will continue in that fine tradition of nation building. We have appointed the nation’s first minister for infrastructure and we are here debating a bill that is the embodiment of our desire to once again give the Commonwealth of Australia clear leadership when it comes to nationally significant infrastructure. In stark contrast, the former Howard government left us with an 11-year legacy of neglect. In communications you will recall that the former minister had 18 different broadband policy announcements, but we still have the slowest speeds of most developed countries. Not one of those policy announcements resulted in areas in my electorate like Shortland or Thornton getting decent connections. With water infrastructure we had the former environment minister’s $10 million grant for experimental rain-making machines, which was against his department’s advice, I recall. In energy we had the former Prime Minister’s plan for 25 nuclear reactors along the east coast, including one proposed for Port Stephens, in the Hunter region. In transport we had such neglect that without action we know that the congestion on Australia’s roads would be likely to treble by 2020. Fortunately, the Rudd government plans to put Australia back in the business of nation building through improvements to its infrastructure. We are getting straight to work on the more than $25 billion infrastructure backlog that the previous Howard government has left us. The first task we have set Infrastructure Australia is to audit our national infrastructure and set out a priority list of projects. This is the first step: taking stock of the deficit and developing a plan to tackle it. By taking a coordinated national approach to infrastructure investment, we will make sure investment is directed where it is most needed-in productive capacity. MAIN COMMITTEE Infrastructure shortfalls are currently costing us 0.8 per cent of GDP in lost production. We have low export volumes, high foreign debt and 3.6 per cent underlying inflation. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration during the parliament’s last term, so I well remember the 20 warnings delivered by the Reserve Bank to the previous government. They were very specific and very pointed but they were ignored. Last year, for example, at our August hearing the RBA Governor said: ... inflation is likely to be around three per cent over the coming year and near the top of the target zone in the following year That was about three months before the election-an election in which we once again saw the former government ignoring the warnings and continuing its irresponsible spending spree. What the Rudd government wants to do is to invest responsibly in the areas where our productive capacity will actually be enhanced, because there are areas that do need investment. In my own electorate we are very much aware of the shortfalls, and off any of our beaches you can see our coal ships lined up over and over again. By 2009-10 the mining boom will have delivered close to $398 billion into federal coffers. By the time of last year’s federal election, the former Howard government had really delivered no sensible ideas on breaking the bottleneck at the port of Newcastle. While I acknowledge the contribution of the ARTC, it was certainly a matter of too little, too late; their efforts to continue that expenditure have been very welcome. I also note that Nick Greiner, the former Premier of New South Wales, is currently looking into a solution to the bottleneck at the port of Newcastle and I applaud the state government’s initiative in that regard. The shipping of coal out of Newcastle is an extremely complex business. It is not like 1799, when piles of coal sitting by the dock were loaded onto ships via wheelbarrows. We ship nearly 81 million tonnes of coal, valued at almost $6 billion, each year. Thirty different coal producers send their coal from the Hunter Valley along the coal chain and along a railway track owned by the private and public sectors to the port of Newcastle. The trains are operated by two different operators and it becomes very complex. It is a big job but I also note the state government’s investment in a third coal loader, which will increase our capacity by about 30 million tonnes when completed in 2010. It is long term and it is complex, but with Infrastructure Australia the Commonwealth will finally be looking at how places like the port of Newcastle fit into the national economy and national infrastructure plans. In June last year, during one of the wildest storms that most of us had ever seen, people will recall that one of those coal ships waiting off the coast, the Pasha Bulker, actually ran aground. While that ship was being beached, thousands of Newcastle homes were being flooded due to a massive failure of the stormwater system under those extreme conditions. I note that one of Infrastructure Australia’s tasks will be to provide advice on infrastructure policy issues arising from climate change. If we are going to experience those weather extremes more often, then Infrastructure Australia will have a big role to play in making our cities not only more liveable but also sustainable and survivable. Last year I convened in my electorate two meetings of my region’s energy industry representatives-the energy generators, coal companies, researchers and unions-to talk about positioning our region to lead the fight against climate change. They were very positive meetings. We all recognised that, as a centre for energy production and export, our region has a MAIN COMMITTEE responsibility to make these activities sustainable into the future. At last year’s election, Labor committed $50 million for an Australian solar institute in Newcastle and $55 million for a clean coal package. So the Rudd Labor government has made these concrete commitments to fighting climate change and securing a sustainable energy future. Once again, the audit of infrastructure needs by Infrastructure Australia will help us to understand how regions like ours fit into the energy infrastructure of our nation as a whole. As with all of the policies that we put to the people last year, Labor is about looking to the future and tackling the big issues such as climate change, infrastructure and productivity. I see an exciting role for my region in that future, but I also see a growing population demanding the infrastructure they need to productively contribute to the economy. They certainly do not want to see infrastructure lag behind the progress of regional growth. They want something to be done about the congested roads as people commute in and out of our city every day. For cities like ours, which are linked to major areas like Sydney, the Hunter and the Central Coast, the people do want to be able to get to Sydney or to travel north by train or road faster and with fewer delays. The F3, the major link between Newcastle and Sydney, has already had major blockages twice this year as a result of crashes. Most travellers also agree that the time it takes to get to Sydney by rail could certainly be reduced. Without investment from the Commonwealth government those sorts of major projects really have not been able to be escalated. But Labor did make some excellent commitments at the election to help get freight onto rail to ease road congestion, and I look forward to Infrastructure Australia’s audit of other projects that will help the productive capacity of my region. I also look forward to its consideration of airports. Newcastle is the fastest growing regional airport in Australia and I notice it has been mentioned in dispatches recently when a second Sydney airport was floated again in the media. So the future of our airport definitely needs to be considered in the national context. We will have to look at the road links to the airport as well as the rail links, of which there are none at the moment. When you live in an industrial revolution, you see such rapid growth. Our region is one of mining engineers and skilled people who are constantly flying out of our city to consult and advise around the world. So if we are serious about expanding our airport, which I am, we have to be serious about improving the infrastructure and transport links to it. Once again, I look forward to Infrastructure Australia’s audit of our nation’s priority needs and seeing where my region and the city of Newcastle fit in. Unlike the Howard government’s approach, this bill establishes a way of looking at our needs from a national perspective so that each region fits within an overall coordinated approach so that it can fully contribute to our nation’s productive economy. I commend the bill to the House. lieve me, some interesting finds were made while researching for this debate. It is interesting to note that prior to the 2007 federal election much was made by, at that stage, a campaigning Labor group talking about the need for a fresh approach to the creation and funding of infrastructure right across Australia-because the states, presumably, were doing such a poor job of the situation. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, that the states are responsible for the creation of infrastructure that keeps the products of this nation moving. It is interesting that on the one hand this Labor Party seeking election was saying that the infrastructure of Australia had collapsed and was substandard. I presume, therefore, that on MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
322,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (5.14 Pm),"This has been an interesting debate so far, but, be the other hand the Labor governments in the states were substandard and that there was this great need for a new initiative. This new initiative turns out to be a rehashed old initiative. As I said, when I was researching my speech it became very confusing because I was referring to two documents. One was a transcript of a speech to the Infrastructure Finance Forum back in June 2003 made by the Hon. John Anderson, Deputy Prime Minister at the time. He was also Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The other document I was looking at was the current minister’s second reading speech. I found some amazing comparisons. For instance, the minister speaks of ‘the cooperation of all Australian governments’. AndI find in Minister Anderson’s speech a reference to ‘the cooperation between all levels of government’. The minister: ‘lifting investment in the nation’s physical infrastructure while at the same time getting the most out of our existing assets’. Minister Anderson said: ‘better ways to utilise existing and new infrastructure’. The minister said: ‘involvement of all sectors of the economy, both public and private’. Minister Anderson said: ‘drawing in private sector expertise and financial flexibility’. It goes on and on and on. At the end of the second reading speech by the minister, he referred to the wonderful vision of former Prime Minister Chifley in reference to the Snowy Mountains scheme, how it crossed borders and was not for just one state but for the nation. Quite frankly, I would suggest that the current minister would have done a lot more, and done so more honestly, had he referred to the hard work of former minister Mr Anderson and his speech to the Infrastructure Finance Forum back in 2003 and had he honestly and sincerely acknowledged the formation of AusLink1 and 2 which has been left as a very solid heritage for this new government in Australia. We have already had a number of commitments from this new government. Perhaps they were throwaway lines, but the Australian public did not think so. The party said: ‘We’re going to control grocery prices. We’re going to reduce fuel prices. We’re going to reduce interest rates. We’re going to take a magic wand to every pre-existing condition right across Australia affecting the hard working families of this nation. And we’re going to create this wonderful new entity called Infrastructure Australia.’ I put to you that they are simply going to re-badge AusLink1 and 2, the main principles of which were in place by 2005, with state transport ministers reporting net infrastructure priorities to the Commonwealth. This new, re-badged AusLink1 and 2 has already suggested that we are going to continue with the funding initiatives of AusLink1 and 2. But that calls for funding of $22 billion through to 2014. We also hear from this new government that we are going to tackle inflation. And yet we have had a statement from the leader of this new government to the effect that he will spend in excess of $2 billion on necessary transport infrastructure across Australia. And, further, he gave a commitment to attend to all pre-election promises. If we are going to tackle inflation in a serious manner, if this is such a serious threat to the economy of this nation when we are making never seen before budget surpluses, if inflation is such a major problem, how will this Rudd government solve the problem by putting an additional $2 billion of funding out there for hastily selected projects, cherry-picked around the nation, in addition to the $22 billion already committed under AusLink1 and 2? The whole premise of the debate today is the necessity for this wonderful new entity. Is it new, or is it simply plagiarism of the very solid, effective ideas of a previous governmentrebadging them at unnecessary and huge cost to the taxpayers of this country with new letterMAIN COMMITTEE heads, new signs on offices and a whole new group of people forming yet another committee? We have the committee for grocery price reduction and the committee for fuel price reduction, we are going to make housing more affordable, we are going to reduce interest rates-all manner of things are going to be tackled with this new government’s magic wand. But for what gain? Is this new government seriously condemning the state Labor government transport ministers and the veracity of the program that they have put together? It is probably lurking somewhere on the existing minister’s desk right now, being absolutely ignored because this new federal government obviously does not trust the workings of the existing state governmentsthis, of course, from the leader who says, ‘No. 1: we’re going to end the blame game.’ I wish he had said that he would start recognising the great financial foundation that he inherited, that he would give due process to playing the credit game. ‘Give credit where it’s due’, ‘A fair go for all Australians’-great old Aussie adages. But, no, this new government publicly state that they are going to end the blame game, but they immediately, by their actions, blame the state transport ministers for being incompetent, because the program that they put together, and had been doing so since 2005, does not have the prioritisation of infrastructure necessary for the nation and its transport task. If there were any relevant, solid contradiction to what I am saying then we would not be talking about funding in excess of $2 billion worth of hand-picked, favoured infrastructure projects. We would not be talking about the infrastructure in the nation being substandard. We would be saying, ‘We have a Constitution, and the Constitution clearly states that states are responsible for land management.’ In that regard, going back to the statement that they will end the blame game, an article in the Australian back in 28 January, written by Nigel Wilson, says: Rudd believes Infrastructure Australia is a way to manage problems inherent in the Australian Constitution, which gives the state governments responsibility for land management. What does this mean? The author of this article, I believe, thinks that we now have such a degree of self-importance that not only will we usurp the states and their role in providing those necessary infrastructure projects but we will reinterpret the Australian Constitution to our own advantage. What end to the megalomania? Perhaps we need several magic wands so we can keep up this pretence to the Australian people that in the past all things were bad and in the future all things will be rosy courtesy of this new Labor government, adding to the current wall-to-wall Labor governments right across this nation. Many Australians were conned by this incoming government. They listened to the pre-election rhetoric, heard what was being said, believed it and voted-and I accept it-very convincingly. But I wonder how they are going to feel down the track when they see no effective change. How are they going to feel about grocery prices continuing to be within the same range, petrol prices continuing to go up and interest rates continuing to go up-twice since the government was elected. How are those voters going to feel? Dudded, to say the least, Mr Deputy Speaker. They will feel absolutely dudded. They will start to ask themselves: ‘Why did we do this? We believed the rhetoric.’ And the rhetoric was just that. Where is the substance now? Where is the new information contained in this bill that was not contained in AusLink1 and 2? Where is it? MAIN COMMITTEE I have reams of information which I find has been plagiarised, virtually, from things that were said by the previous government in 2003. What is being said by the government? They are saying: ‘We are going to attend to the needs of regional centres because many of our regional centres require the turnover of tourist dollars. If those centres do not have good road infrastructure they will not get the tourists coming, because the highways will be congested. So we need to approach the issue of reducing congestion on the highways.’ That is in this new legislation and in the minister’s second reading speech on the legislation-but, hey, it is also contained in the 2003 speech to the infrastructure finance group. Remarkable! It continues: ‘If we do not have good forward planning, our cities will be less liveable and there will be growing public health problems associated with vehicle emissions.’ There is a reference to that in the minister’s second reading speech. It was also contained in the speech to the forum back in 2003. I cannot find anything new in this information. Why didn’t this wand-waving new government simply accept the fact that there was a fine system for the regulation and prioritisation of infrastructure in this nation and that it was being well funded from the Commonwealth perspective-not from the states’ perspective because, remember, under the Constitution they are responsible for land management. The additional top-up fund from the Commonwealth was coming from AusLink1 and 2. The new government has decided to accept it and to continue it, yet we had this circus pre-election campaign about the wonderful new era of infrastructure in Australia. There has been a lot of bluster, a lot of rhetoric and a lot of hot air spouted about this brave new world. But, at the end of the day, what we have is simply a little more of the plastic facade of this government as it tries to maintain the pretence to the Australian people that it will actually do something about the existing problems, rather than simply face up to making the hard decisions to change the situation and ease the impact of some of those problems on the hard working Australian families that we are all here to serve. We are not here to serve the continuing rhetoric of this new government; we are here to serve the people of Australia. The people of Australia were well served in the past, and my fervent desire is that this new government, with all its bluster and wand-waving, will be assessed by the Australian public in six months time or 12 months time-but not in three years time, let me assure you-as having done the job. I suggest to you that this government will be found extremely wanting because nothing in this legislation provides for change. Nothing in this legislation says anything about this brave new world; all it does is re-badge the existing legislation at additional cost to the Australian taxpayer-and the Australian taxpayer, do not forget, is a member of a hard working family somewhere and they are the people that we are here to serve. As the House reflects on passing this legislation, I wonder if they would contemplate whether there was any necessity to make any change whatsoever and whether we are going to see in this brave new world the new Prime Minister breaking his promises to the electorate and not funding all of these pre-election promises. Is he going to break his promises or is he going to attend to those promises, maintain the expenditure of $22 billion up until 2014 and fight inflation? That will indeed be a magic act to see. I suggest it will need multiple magic wands because he is going to spend more money, he is going to, by his actions, reduce jobs and he is going to keep inflation down. I look forward to that outcome because he will be a replacement for Merlin the Magician, I am sure. MAIN COMMITTEE I am not sure that when he attends to those election commitment promises he will cast his eyes much further than the horizon of the state of Queensland. I represent the powerhouse of this nation’s wealth, the Kalgoorlie electorate in Western Australia, and I have looked at the commitments. We are talking about $2.2 billion in Queensland and $160 million in Western Australia. Well, isn’t that pathetic? Obviously, he allocated the funds on the basis of need. Obviously, the Queensland government is incredibly behind the pace. They must have been doing a very bad job, because they need $2.2 billion. Western Australia, where we have the longest roads, the most sparsely populated area and are making the money for this nation, is going to get $160 million dollars. It beggars belief. I wonder how the facade has been maintained for even this long. Good luck in the maintenance into the future and, even though we know we will not be able to prevent the passage of this bill, good luck to the people of Australia. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (5.33 pm)-I must say I found the contribution just made by the member for Kalgoorlie really missing the point of the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 that is before us for debate. the central essence of what Labor is trying to achieve and that is to acknowledge what the Reserve Bank had warned your government, the previous government, of for over a decade: that the infrastructure bottlenecks were causing capacity constraints in the Australian economy. We want to do something about that in cooperation with the states and we want to end the kind of blame game that we saw exhibited in the comments that the member for Kalgoorlie has just made in his contribution. I think the member for Kalgoorlie really does miss the point that, over the time of the Howard government, the federal government vacated the field in terms of nation building. And the Rudd Labor government certainly sees a very important role for the federal government, with an agenda that includes a vision for the future, nation building and working cooperatively with existing state governments and local government. I want to talk a little bit about the bill rather than engage in a response to the member for Kalgoorlie’s comments, which really had little bearing on the detail and substance of the issues that are before us at the moment. As you know, in the lead-up to the election the Rudd Labor government made much of the fact that we needed to lift the level of investment in new physical infrastructure-and not, as the member for Kalgoorlie suggests, just in the road network; it goes beyond that-and at the same time make better use of the nation’s existing infrastructure. Our investment in this area is part and parcel of our fight against inflation, our commitment to raise productivity and our commitment to sustained economic growth into the future. It does recognise, unlike the member for Kalgoorlie, that the Reserve Bank has been sending warnings that infrastructure bottlenecks-they exist in my region; they probably do in the west as well-are a severe constraint on our economic capacity and performance. As part of our plan to fight inflation, the Rudd government is offering for the first time a truly national and long-term approach to the provision of infrastructure. We have been working hard since coming into government to put in place the right policy structure to support our infrastructure plan and program. And that is the issue that is before us in the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, the details of which were remarkably neglected in the contribution made MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
323,Mr Haase,It wasn’t complimentary.,237,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
324,Ms George,"It is not the issue of being complimentary; the point is you have missedby the member opposite. You would know if you looked at the detail of the bill that the policy structure that we are promulgating in this legislation is the creation of Infrastructure Australia, a statutory advisory council consisting of 12 members drawn from industry and all levels of government. We believe that, in providing new national leadership on a very important infrastructure agenda, we need to take a two-pronged approach to tackle existing bottlenecks. First of all, we need to look at creative means for lifting investment in new infrastructure. That will obviously involve working in public-private partnerships where they are appropriate. At the same time, we want to make better use of our existing infrastructure assets. Strategic investment, in our view, is required to overcome our infrastructure backlog, which in the areas of land transport, water and energy alone is estimated to be worth in the order of $25 billion. Obviously that is not going to be solved overnight, and we do not profess to have any magic wands, but we do recognise that it is a severe problem in terms of fulfilling our mission to see sustained economic growth and to keep that inflation genie in the bottle. We need to have a clear picture of our investment needs and time frames, so one of the first tasks of our new statutory authority will be to undertake a national audit to first of all determine the capacity and condition of Australia’s nationally significant infrastructure. We hope this audit will identify gaps, impediments and bottlenecks, as well as taking into account expected future demand. This information will inform the development of the infrastructure priority list to guide future investment decisions. We hope that this will be completed within 12 months and presented to COAG by March 2009. The time frames, as set out in the bill, are ambitious but obviously they are necessary. The information determined by the audit will provide us with a sound base upon which decisions for the future will be made and allow a better matching of investment dollars with the nation’s infrastructure priorities. While no doubt there is a need for investment in new assets, we must also recognise that it will take time before new infrastructure is built. However, we believe there is much action that can be taken in the short term to help ease the kind of infrastructure bottlenecks that my colleague the member for Newcastle referred to at the port in her region. We will be looking at streamlining guidelines, legislation and regulations across jurisdictions to see whether we can coordinate them in a more efficient way and use our existing infrastructure in a more efficient manner to serve the economic imperatives of the nation. Interestingly enough, the Productivity Commission itself estimates that, just in the implementation of competition and regulatory reforms affecting transport, energy and export infrastructure in areas of regulation and planning, if we were to have a concerted effort to implement competition and regulatory reforms we have the potential to save around $10 billion and, by so doing, add to national output by up to two per cent of GDP. The issue of what can be done in the short term with existing infrastructure is a vital component of our overall agenda. My area of the Illawarra is a major industrial centre and we do require, like other regions, efficient and up-to-date infrastructure. We have had a lot of investment by the New South Wales state Labor government in the port at Port Kembla, which is going to be expanded to become a major centre for imports in addition to the large exports of coal and steel already handled there. Investment in two infrastructure projects in particular would help the Illawarra cope with the increasing commercial and industrial activity that we will see coming through MAIN COMMITTEE the port, and those are the urgent need to upgrade sections of the Princes Highway and the positive signal for the possible resumption of construction of the Maldon-Dumbarton railway link. The upgrade of the highway has been at the centare of the blame game. It is a state road. People have argued that it ought to be a road of national significance. I think the constituents just want someone to fix the existing problems. The upgrade of the highway, particularly to the Jervis Bay turn-off by having a dual carriageway, is a very urgent imperative and one that could see a greater commitment from the federal government in assisting the state to finish those links. We need it because, when we get more traffic through the port, that highway will be a very important regional, intrastate and interstate link for the movement of goods. The highway currently has an appalling crash record and there has been an unnecessary loss of life. The upgrade of the highway will serve the interests of major employers like BlueScope Steel, Manildra and the aviation industry around the town of Nowra in the adjoining electorate of Gilmore. We have been working with a local lobby group known as PHocus to try to get additional commitments to the upgrade of the highway. Of course, we are seeking the continuation of the important role that our own regional airport plays, one of the remaining regional airports that is actually owned by a local government authority. There was investment in the past from the former government in the necessary security upgrades that were needed for that airport and that will need to continue into the future. A Liberal state government in New South Wales halted the construction of the MaldonDumbarton rail link about 20 years ago. We believe there is a significant economic imperative for that work to be revisited, particularly as we are hoping that up to 250,000 cars, 50,000 containers and 125,000 tonnes of break-bulk cargo will come through the port of Port Kembla. So there is a great economic imperative to revisit that project. I thank the member for Batman, in his former role as shadow minister in this area, for his very welcome commitment made in the lead-up to the federal election to provide the Port Kembla Port Corporation with $300,000 to commission a pre-feasibility study into completing the Maldon-Dumbarton freight rail line. In conclusion, I welcome the bill and commend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for bringing it to the House so expeditiously. I think it is a great achievement that, for the first time since Federation, we have a Labor government committed totally to the issue of nation building through having an infrastructure minister, an infrastructure department and concrete and positive plans to deal with the great backlog of infrastructure in our nation which is creating a huge capacity constraint and having a negative consequence for our potential economic performance. your position. This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate you on joining that wonderful club of deputy speakers. The matter we are speaking on today is the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008, and it is something that is actually very dear to my heart. When I was first elected, a little over nine years ago, like most members in the HouseI made my maiden speech. But my first speech in parliament after my maiden speech was actually about infrastructure and, in fact, my first private member’s bill was about infrastructure. One of the first standing committee reports that I instigated was about rural infrastructure. So it is actually something quite dear to me and very important to the constituents of my electorate of Barker. MAIN COMMITTEE",237,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
325,Mr Secker (Barker) (5.44 Pm),"Congratulations, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, onInfrastructure, if you really understand it, is not just about roads. I think a lot of people would just refer to roads, but infrastructure refers not only to rail, electricity and, of course, ports and airports but also to social infrastructure-things like hospitals and services to areas. Unfortunately, in rural areas we seem to get a fairly raw deal compared to our city cousins. But, despite that, I think all these things are very important. I think this bill is more to deal with the hard infrastructure needs of this country. WhilstI welcome a commitment from this government to the infrastructure needs of this country, it is a lie to say that the Howard government completely ignored infrastructure. In fact, even in my own electorate I can point to such things as the $205 million for the Sturt Highway-a very important road because it services the Barossa and the Riverland in my electorate and, of course, is the main road from Adelaide to Sydney. So $205 million has gone a long way towards fixing up some of the problems that we had in my electorate. Of course, it was not only for the transport needs but because of the fact that there were accidents occurring on that road due to poor infrastructure. Of course, we have spent enormous amounts on the Dukes Highway on the South Australian side of the main road from Adelaide to Melbourne. I have to pose the question of why this government has promised to have a dual lane from Melbourne to the Victorian-South Australian border but, once the road gets to South Australia, there is no commitment to a dual lane for the Dukes Highway. I assure you that the same trucks will be using the road on both sides of the border; the same cars will be using the road on both sides of the border. SoI think this is a real gap in what they are promising for what is arguably-and, I think, without too much argument-the most important road for South Australians, either for their local transport or for their interstate transport. It certainly has the highest traffic levels. Certainly in my time we spent a lot of money on putting in passing lanes, which have helped the situation. In fact, we had a recent commitment from Bordertown to the Victorian border because of the road break-up, and we spent something like $15 million on 17 kilometres of road. It is now actually the best part of the Dukes Highway. But, of course, the state government, unlike with the rest of the Dukes Highway, have kept the speed limit at 100 kilometres an hour instead of the normal 110. And guess where they have the police with their radars trying to catch people: it is actually on this best part of the road. Their basis for reducing it from 110 to 100-which I agreed with-was the state of the road. It was not a very good road-certainly not up to scratch. But once it was fixed they still kept the speed limit at 100 kilometres an hour, and I understand they are getting lots of revenue from that road even though it is the safest part of the road and there is no real argument to retain the 100 kilometres an hour speed limit when the rest of the Dukes Highway is 110. Of course, when you go across the border, anywhere where you have dual lanes it will be 110 kilometres an hour as well. So there has been a lot of money spent on infrastructure already in my electorate. I also think it is important to note that we were the first government since Federation that actually committed to building the Adelaide to Darwin railway line, which I think was probably the first piece of major railway line infrastructure built in Australia in the last 50 years at least, if not the last 100 years. That is a major connector between Adelaide and Darwin for the transport of a lot of our goods-especially, but not all, agricultural goods. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, would acknowledge that the Heysen tunnels that we built leading into Adelaide on the main highway from Melbourne have been an absoMAIN COMMITTEE lutely brilliant bit of engineering and infrastructure that have been so important to South Australia. So to suggest that we as a government ignored infrastructure is a great lie. I certainly will not accept that sort of statement being put out there. When you look at AusLink, which basically this new government has copied-in fact, it has met the commitments of Auslink under the AusLink program-in real money terms, it is four times more than the Snowy Mountains scheme. So this idea that we did not commit money to some great engineering feat for Australia is false. We certainly had the vision and once we could afford it under the good management of the Howard government we were able to commit these extra funds to AusLink, and I think it is something like $23 billion, which is a huge amount of money in anyone’s terms. The greatest problems I have ever had in my electorate have been state government responsibilities. I warn the new minister about this, although I would hope that he is aware of it because he has already been to my electorate and had the state minister ask for funding for an area which is really a state government responsibility. I am always happy to get a commitment from any government for road funding in my electorate, but it is interesting that-looking at the areas that have been divided between local, state and federal governments in this country-we, through the Roads to Recovery program, more than doubled the amount of money we were giving to local governments so that they could maintain their local roads. The state governments get about half of their money from the federal government for funding of roads, and yet you see very little for that in South Australia. I cannot speak for other states, but certainly on those major highways that are a state government’s responsibility they have been found wanting. For example, the Riddoch Highway is the main connecting road from Keith to Mount Gambier. It is about 200 kilometres of a very important road for local and interstate transport-certainly intrastate transport-but the state government has hardly spent any money on that road, which is one of the major roads of South Australia. The states will certainly see this as an opportunity for another pot of gold that they can use to blame the federal government if they are not doing their job. Frankly, I think they should be made to wear their responsibilities. Certainly for any of these roads that are state government responsibilities, they should be putting in at least 50 per cent of a greater share of funding for those roads. I hope that the minister has the sense to see the state governments for what they are. As a result of the funding that we have given them through things like the GST, through their extra receivables of land tax and so on, they are receiving in South Australia about $1 billion a year more than they would have under the old system. So they are doing pretty well. But where have we seen that with the infrastructure bills that we need in South Australia? We have had a Labor state government in South Australia for six years and, frankly, we really do not have much to show for it. That is a shame, because anyone who represents a rural area knows how important the road and the rail infrastructure are to their lives. They depend on them not only for getting to and from work but also for transporting the goods that they produce, which is the wealth of this country. So the responsibility for infrastructure, as I said, has been spread across the three tiers of government. Indeed, the state government trading enterprises-not budget funded state government agencies; they have a very clever way of having these hollow logs-provide much of the electricity, water, urban transport and ports. Indeed, if a federal government put money MAIN COMMITTEE into a port, I would bet you that a state government would still like to receive all the funds from that port, even though they have not put in as much of the money as they should have. Local government also funds and provides infrastructure, and more and more of the private sector is becoming increasingly involved in the finances. Local governments, through the Roads to Recovery program, have spent their money well-certainly in my electorate, and I have 21 local government councils in my electorate. They have spent every cent of that money on their roads and you can certainly see the difference it has made to their areas. They are very thankful for the Roads to Recovery program. I know that local government fear that they will not get that commitment from this government. So it would be good if they were finally relieved of that concern. In 2001 the Australian Infrastructure Report Card Alliance, which is a group of major infrastructure stakeholders, prepared a report on infrastructure adequacy. I think it is noteworthy that, in the areas where the Commonwealth had whole or partial responsibility-such as airports; telecommunications; and national roads, which are the major highways around Australia-they actually ranked relatively highly. Unfortunately, areas of state government, and to a lesser extent local government, responsibility were the most in need of remediation. That was an independent infrastructure report. So to suggest that the federal government was at fault was clearly shown to be false by that report. This is particularly true in my electorate of Barker, specifically in the rural community of Keith, which has suffered long blackouts during the past summer, for example. This problem is not just localised in Keith. I know about it because I happen to live there. Blackouts further south are causing concerns for residents towards the south-east coast as well. ETSA Utilities, which is South Australia’s electricity distributor, is to conduct an audit of power infrastructure at Keith and across south-east South Australia to investigate the long blackouts. You may think: ‘What is the problem with blackouts? We have to put up with that in cities a bit.’ But every time you have even a fraction of a second blackout when you are running a pump for irrigation, for example, your pump turns off. Unless you are awake to it or aware that you have had that momentary blackout-or even a brownout, which means that you are not getting full power-the pumps will turn off. That can ruin your whole irrigation program. The problem is that strong economic growth has supported industrial expansion and an increased use of pumps, which means a greater demand for power. ETSA appears to have been unaware of the cumulative impact of this growth and have not addressed the resultant infrastructure requirements. The outcome is that large areas of the Tatiara in my electorate suffer low-voltage problems every day the temperature is over 35 degrees. In my electorate this has been every one of the last 10 days, and I understand it is forecast for the next seven days at least. So we are having this long-term problem whenever we have those high temperatures. They promised to audit the infrastructure to determine what improvements are needed. I make the point that, while the interrelationship between federal, state and local governments drives the need for infrastructure, when this fails, it is the state and local governments which must bear that responsibility. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government stated in this place that the OECD ranked Australia 20th out of 25 countries when it comes to investment in public infrastructure as a proportion of national income. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to assert that Australia is underperforming when it comes to investment levels. The MAIN COMMITTEE fact is that expenditure in public infrastructure as a proportion of national income between countries is not a barometer of infrastructure investment. Different countries have different infrastructure needs, and so it can be expected that there will be different investment levels. Nor do such comparisons take account of the quality of investment. I think anyone in this House who has ever been overseas will know that, by comparison, our traffic jams and our transport systems have far fewer blockages than most countries in Europe and certainly in Asia and Africa. So it is not really a valid comparison. Privatisation of former government trading enterprises and the entry of the private sector into traditionally public infrastructure such as roads, electricity generation and rail make this comparison inequitable as well. Infrastructure Australia is not actually an original idea. It was the Howard government that in 1996 conceived the idea of a national infrastructure council. Unfortunately, Infrastructure Australia has not been carefully thought out. Labor’s model will become a conduit for incessant demands from state Labor governments for more infrastructure funding. I have no doubt about this because I have seen this happen from my first day as a member of parliament. Whenever state governments are asked about why they do not fund certain infrastructure that is their responsibility, they say: ‘The feds don’t give us enough money.’ It is almost a daily rant by state governments. I have to say that it is not only Labor state governments that have said that sort of thing. In light of Labor’s poor record of economic management, it is unlikely that the budget will be able to sustain that funding. There is nothing in this model that will address the fact that state Labor governments have largely shunned the transparent processes found at the federal level. There are many examples where state government assistance to industry has been long fraught with special concessions and deals. Infrastructure Australia does not address this. Instead, Labor has produced a structure that will become yet another layer in the process of assessing and responding to Australia’s infrastructure needs. The Energy Supply Association has already questioned Infrastructure Australia’s role in the electricity and gas business. It was the Howard government’s taxation reforms in respect of financing arrangements for infrastructure that encouraged private investment through the reduction of compliance costs. These tax benefits gave greater certainty to private builders of major infrastructure. Labor has turned its back on this approach in favour of an unproven regulatory body. I wish this new body well, but Labor’s record at the state level in respect of these types of bodies is certainly not one to admire. Infrastructure Australia fails to address issues such as how to prevent cherry-picking and how to ensure that regional and rural Australia-in particular, regional and rural South Australia-do not miss out in favour of eastern states’ or city-based white elephant projects while regional infrastructure projects are overlooked. After all, a lot of our wealth is actually produced in the regional and rural areas, and they demand and need those sorts of infrastructure fixtures, probably more so than some in the city. I do not resile from the need for infrastructure in the city; I just wish sometimes people would think about the needs of rural areas as well. Infrastructure has been run down by Labor state governments-trains, ports, water, hospitals and education in every state-which attests to their failure to act on infrastructure and development. Infrastructure efficiencies in the electorate of Barker are by no means limited to MAIN COMMITTEE electricity supply. The state government has done an appalling job of managing transport and communication. Indeed, if it were not for the success of the Howard government’s AusLink and Roads to Recovery programs, things would be in a much more dire state in the electorate of Barker. Under the Howard government, the electorate of Barker received those AusLink funding commitments. Roads are important to an electorate like Barker because it is a big electorate with a lot of roads. My electorate is actually 10 per cent bigger than Tasmania, so you can imagine the number of roads there are in Barker. There is nothing in this legislation to reassure the people of Barker that their road or other infrastructure needs will be addressed or even removed. provide for the establishment of Infrastructure Australia and the infrastructure coordinator. It is a bill which provides the kind of leadership we need-firstly, to tackle inflation; secondly, to provide a nationally coordinated approach to tackling infrastructure bottlenecks; thirdly, to drive investment where it is needed most, fuelling the nation’s productive capacity; and, finally, to ensure that infrastructure development and investment is motivated by value, not the margin of a seat. This is another of those bills that shows that it is Labor that is the nation-building party. The previous government had 11 years to fix bottlenecks and 11 years to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. They failed; they were never interested in nation-building. It took a Labor government to appoint Australia’s first federal infrastructure minister. This is a party which has a proud record as the nation-building party. It was the great Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley who started the massive Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. It was the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who gave us practical infrastructure solutions like fixing sewerage and building new hospitals. He appointed Tom Uren as Minister for Urban and Regional Development. We saw then the creation of land commissions which provided for reasonably priced housing blocks and the development of new planned communities. Again, it was the Labor government of the 1990s which saw the introduction of the Better Cities program under Minister Brian Howe. That was a broad-ranging strategy of reform that included innovative housing programs and a focus on urban consolidation. So it has always been Labor that has been the nation-building party, and Labor again turns to this task. Now what is the modern infrastructure challenge-the challenge of the 21st century? I think the big infrastructure challenge is public transport. It is clear that reducing congestion and improving the efficiency of transport networks will play an important part in the abatement of greenhouse gases and will improve urban amenity. It is also clear that climate change, with its effects on infrastructure reliability and maintenance costs, will present new infrastructure challenges-for example, from coastal and storm flooding. I noticed just yesterday that Professor Ross Garnaut’s paper on transport and urban planning included an issues paper which found that building new roads may make Australia’s greenhouse emissions from transport worse. He noted that the provision of road infrastructure may induce growth in passenger car use by reducing the competitive advantage of public transport and possibly inducing additional travel. This came at the same time as, in my own state, we had an announcement from the Victorian government that all unzoned land within Melbourne’s urban growth boundary will be released for development to accommodate the city’s booming population. Clearly, we have to ensure that moves like this do not add to the city’s reliance on cars. We certainly have MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
326,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (6.04 Pm),"The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 willstate government policy which seeks to reduce car trips and increase the use of walking, cycling and public transport. Clearly, what we need is a focus on public transport infrastructure. Despite having one of the highest levels of urbanisation, Australia remains the only OECD nation where the federal government does not provide funds for sustainable transport infrastructure. This places Australia at an international disadvantage compared to countries such as the UK and the United States, whose national governments do invest heavily in public transport infrastructure. The federal government currently funds major upgrades of roads and I think that public transport should be eligible for similar funding, given its role in the reduction of congestion and its role in relation to greenhouse gases. Congestion is a very serious national cost. Delays in delivery schedules and opportunity costs-the costs of congestion-have been estimated at over $20 billion annually. Something like $2½ billion of that directly impacts on Melbourne’s eastern and south-eastern suburbs. These are suburbs which are part of a prominent industrial hub and I think it is imperative that they are provided with an efficient and readily available public transport system to reduce overall traffic congestion. Again, the area of eastern and south-eastern Melbourne is responsible for hundreds of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This is something which will rise exponentially in future years if congestion is left unchecked. Although it is clear that respective state governments need to be ultimately responsible for public transport services, I think there is a role for federal involvement through joint funding arrangements which will provide for appropriate accountability in project delivery. I commend the work of the Metropolitan Transport Forum, the MTF, and the Eastern Transport Coalition, which jointly represent 26 Melbourne councils. I commend the work of Councillor Mick Van de Vreede, the Chairperson of the Eastern Transport Coalition, and also the work of Councillor Jackie Fristacky, from the Metropolitan Transport Forum. They have put forward some very useful ideas for public transport infrastructure in Melbourne, essentially under the heading of the need for the federal government to allow urban public transport to be funded under AusLink or through the creation of specific programs and, secondly, proposing that the federal government provide funding for a number of urban public transport initiatives in Melbourne’s east. As they say, it is clear that Australia is facing immense challenges to create sustainable cities for the future. This is something which was looked at by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, which published the report Sustainable cities back in August 2005. It looked at many of these concerns, and it recommended: ... the Australian Government significantly boost its funding commitment for public transport systems, particularly light and heavy rail, in the major cities. It further recommended: ... the provision of Australian Government transport infrastructure funds include provision of funding specifically for sustainable public transport infrastructure for suburbs and developments on the outer fringes of our cities. That is consistent with the federal Labor Party’s platform, which states that we need to ensure that Australians have access to adequate public transport services by providing appropriate financial assistance to state governments to improve and extend public transport systems in urban areas. It is also consistent with the kinds of initiatives which occurred during the time MAIN COMMITTEE of Better Cities, when there were cooperative funding arrangements struck with the Victorian government to fund extensions to light rail and upgrades to heavy rail. There are several projects, which have been mentioned, in the eastern metropolitan area of Melbourne which would help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I mention to the House the rail to Rowville project, which would provide a heavy rail connection from Huntingdale station to Rowville, along the median of Wellington Road to Stud Park Shopping Centre at Rowville. That would remove thousands of private vehicles from the road network. That project has been proposed for the past 40 years. The City of Knox has undertaken a prefeasibility study for that project, and a great deal of work has been done on it. Furthermore, there is a proposal for the Belgrave and Lilydale lines beyond Ringwood to be duplicated, with the addition of a third track in a number of locations along the Belgrave and Lilydale lines. That would assist flexibility in train operations and improve safety and service levels. Thirdly, there is a proposal for rail to Doncaster. There is a space along the Eastern Freeway median to provide heavy rail from Victoria Park to Doncaster and beyond. It should be noted that you would need to get extra capacity on the Clifton Hill group of lines and an upgrade of the city loop as part of such a project. There are also proposals to improve the coordination and transfer of passengers at transport interchanges. Commuters hate changing modes, and little is done to assist with protection from the weather or with directions and real-time information. The current network of public transport requires greater coordination between modes, and better passenger facilities are required where train, tram and bus services meet. These are all very important and sensible proposals. I hope that they are given consideration, and I hope that both the federal and state governments work hard at meeting our public transport infrastructure needs. I commend this piece of legislation to the House. from a number of speakers on the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 and I have heard all sorts of claims and counterclaims. It is fascinating that it happens in this parliament all the time. The member for Wills articulated a number of instances where previous Labor governments have been infrastructure builders, but he forgot the former government’s very significant infrastructure programs-AusLink1 and 2. They are programs that have been taken up by the current Rudd government as basically a multibillion dollar nation-building exercise. I was privileged to sit on one of the transport standing committees earlier in my parliamentary life and at that stage we recognised the need to look at not only road infrastructure across the country, which has been discussed here, but also the rail system. We also looked at the necessity of having a national plan to fix the rail system, particularly in New South Wales or the eastern states, and also of making multimodal arrangements. That is proceeding. The sad part about it is that it should have been done by the state governments. The state governments have let Australia down badly. It is such a shame that much of the state infrastructure ran down. The federal government is now looking at taking over responsibility for the country’s ports which, again, are the responsibility of the states. This bill is certainly welcomed. All of us have a responsibility to make sure that we get our infrastructure right. and I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate. I would firstly like to tell you a bit about MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
327,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (6.15 Pm),I have listened to the contributions this afternoon,246,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
328,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (6.18 Pm),"The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 is very important,the electorate of Grey and the things that are happening there at the moment. Whilst the thrust of this legislation is not unwelcome, what I am very concerned about is that Infrastructure Australia will be just another body that may not have the teeth that we need to get the job done. One of the things that I have been increasingly worried about as I look around my electorate is that federal governments have funded much of the capital works and the infrastructure that is happening and we seem to see a great lag in state governments carrying their fair share of the load. I do not want to get into state-bashing on this-it is important that we bring everyone together-but my concern is that Infrastructure Australia will not have the teeth to perform this job. Our states are swimming in GST collections. As we are talking about infrastructure issues, I might raise the issue of fuel. Some three years ago, fuel was around $1.10 a litre and it is now $1.50 a litre-a rise of 40c. For every litre, that is an extra 3.6c that is collected in GST. There were 37,000 megalitres consumed in Australia in 2007. South Australia’s share of the GST windfall on that consumption was around $100 million. That is unbudgeted income. It comes as a windfall for the government, and still things are not happening as quickly as we would like to see. Page5 of the Bills Digest, providing information and analysis advice on this bill, says: It is noteworthy that the areas where the Commonwealth had whole or partial responsibility-airports, telecommunications and national roads-ranked relatively highly. Areas of state government (and to a lesser extent local government) responsibility were most in need of remediation. In the concluding comments on page 19, the Bills Digest says: But what the relationship will be between Infrastructure Australia and regulatory bodies-such as the Australian Energy Regulator, the Australian Energy Market Commission, and state bodies such as Essential Services Commission of South Australia-is unclear. Nor is the relationship clear between Infrastructure Australia and other Commonwealth government agencies such as Treasury, which play a role in developing policy that affects infrastructure. Hence my concern about the weaknesses of Infrastructure Australia. The seat of Grey promises great things to come. I spoke a little in my maiden speech about my electorate, as new members are wont to do. Grey will become the economic generator for South Australia. I call it the 92 per cent factor. Grey covers 92 per cent of South Australia; thus it stands to reason that we have 92 per cent of the resources. We will probably produce less than 92 per cent of the exports but, with the great explosion that is happening in the mining industry in South Australia at the moment, I believe that the great wealth that will underpin the South Australian economy will come from my electorate. It is my intention, as the member for Grey, to make sure that the windfalls from that increased production, the explosion that we are going to see, will be reinvested back in the electorate and be invested in infrastructure. So what needs to be done in Grey? I have quite a long list of issues. It seems exceedingly long but, as I pointed out, as Grey covers 92 per cent of the state, we might well need more than just one-ninth of the infrastructure-as 11 seats in South Australia would indicate. The port of Thevenard, on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, already puts through two million tonnes a year of traditional product-gypsum and wheat or grains. There are problems at the Thevenard port. It is very shallow. There is a mineral sands deposit north of Ceduna being developed by Iluka Resources of which will produce 500,000 tonnes of zircon and ilmenite a MAIN COMMITTEE year. The current ship limitation at Thevenard is 20,000 tonnes. To move around the world the type of commodity that we are talkings we need to be able to get bigger ships in. If we cannot achieve that, we are looking at much more expensive options much further away. The next port is 400 kilometres away in Port Lincoln. So there are problems there. A report that was prepared for the Eyre Regional Development Board puts forwad a $39 million solution. For the farmers out there, if we do not achieve a breakthrough soon, the shipping will dry up completely and they will be looking at freight bills of $40 to $50 a tonne. This brings me to Port Bonython, just out of Whyalla, in the upper Spencer Gulf. We will need a new deep sea port in the upper Spencer Gulf, as there are a lot of projects swinging in the state at the moment in the mineral exploration area which will otherwise become unviable. We have four companies that have recently banded together to push for development of the port-Western Plains Resources, Centrex Metals, IMX Resources and Ironclad Mining-who estimate there will be 20 million tonnes of ore going out of northern South Australia by 2015 and, at this stage, we have no means of getting that onto a boat. There is already an iron ore loading facility at Whyalla controlled by OneSteel, but we are going to need a lot more. We have a backlog on maintenance of state roads. The last official estimate I saw, which was some years old, was a $200 million backlog. Old worn-out roads on Yorke Peninsula and in the mid-north, roads like the Kulpara to Yorketown, and the Barrier Highway north of Burra are old bitumen tracks which you can barely drive a truck on and are ill suited to the needs of a modern export economy. We have growing communities on Yorke Peninsula. Yorke Peninsula is becoming, dare I say, the Sunshine Coast of South Australia, and we are seeing major developments, with a Greg Norman golf course going in at Moonta and major housing developments. People are moving up from Adelaide; they are taking their retirement cheques, getting out of the smoke and going to the beautiful shores of Yorke Peninsula. Many of these communities are on antiquated water systems. Once again, there is a backlog due to underinvestment by state governments. The delivery line into Ardrossan is 75 years old and we are sitting on refusals for development there because there is just no more water. In the mid-north town of Orroroo, only 800 people live in Orroroo, but they have been living there for 90 years-I do not mean all of them individually; not everyone in Orroroo is 90 years old, I might point out. But it is a town that has been there for a long time and has proof of its existence. It is only 25 kilometres away from a pipeline, yet none has ever been built. While we know water is a big issue, there are also all these infrastructure problems. We have a number of wind farm developments, on the Eyre Peninsula in particular, have stopped because the interconnector to Eyre Peninsula that used to bring all the power into the peninsula was designed 30 years ago-consequently we have turned around and there are now enough wind farms on the Eyre Peninsula to send the power back down the line the other way-and is no longer capable of getting away what could be generated in that part of the world. The Peninsula is particularly friendly for wind generation. So there is this backlog of infrastructure issues in Grey which needs to be addressed. I would like to point out what has been good. In the last 10 years or so a lot of money has been spent on infrastructure, in particular on the roads under the AusLink program. We have seen major upgrades of National Highway1 from Port Wakefield to Port Augusta. We have seen the Eyre Highway widened and upgrades to the Stuart Highway. We have seen enormous investment in local roads through the councils. If anyone should think to ask the councils MAIN COMMITTEE what they think of government funding, they would say, ‘Well, we don’t even bother to ask the state any more; we just go to the federal government, because we know that, under the Roads to Recovery program, if we put up a good project we have a good chance of seeing it approved.’ We had a rail upgrade, once again on the Eyre Peninsula. If something was not done, the railway was going to have to close. We were looking at growers transporting grain 250 kilometres or more by road to port, with the accompanying stress on the roads. I will just run you through the figures in the rescue package for the railway. The federal government put up $15 million under AusLink; the operator put up $11 million; ABB Grain, the main operator of the grain accumulation set-up along the railway line and on the Eyre Peninsula, put up $4½ million; a levy was placed on the growers to produce $2 million towards this $30 million upgrade; and the South Australian government matched the growers, putting up just $2 million. The point of all this is to say yes, by all means, establish Infrastructure Australia. But what are we going to do to make sure that this body has got teeth? I seriously wonder whether Infrastructure Australia and the regulations that surround it have the power to fix any of this or whether it is just going to be another talkfest. I certainly hope they do fix it. I certainly hope they can make a difference. But will it be able to, in the end, get the state Labor governments to lift their end of the bargain and step up to the plate and deliver what they should be delivering from the windfall tax dollars that they are receiving at the moment? Ms KING (Ballarat) (6.30 pm)-I am really delighted to be following the new member for Grey, who spoke about the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. I congratulate him on his election to this place. I also wish to say that I think what he demonstrated in his speech is actually why this bill is so desperately needed. The connectivity issues that he raised, the issues around the tiers of government and the fact that a lot of the focus has been on road funding and not necessarily on some of the rail freight issues and port connectivity issues or on some of the broader issues around broadband are really important issues that we want Infrastructure Australia to deal with. We certainly look forward to the opposition’s support on this bill. This bill provides for the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, whose role is to advise government, investors and owners of infrastructure concerning nationally significant infrastructure priorities; policy and regulatory reforms desirable to improve the efficient utilisation of national infrastructure networks; options to address impediments to the development and provision of efficient national infrastructure; the needs of users; and possible financing mechanisms. The bill is another example of the government delivering on its election commitments. The bill keeps our promises to concentrate our efforts on expanding the capacity of the Australian economy and to combat inflation. Infrastructure Australia will play an integral role as the conduit for a more nationally coordinated approach to infrastructure. Australia does need a strategic blueprint for our country’s infrastructure needs. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with the responsibility of auditing the adequacy of our nation’s infrastructure as its first point of business. The review of the current state of play is needed so that we can start to really understand what is happening and how to address Australia’s national infrastructure bottlenecks. Within 12 months, by March 2009, Infrastructure Australia will develop an infrastructure priority list for presentation to the Council of Australian Goverments. This list will clearly set out the partnership approach between the state and federal governments and where the priorities lie MAIN COMMITTEE when it comes to national infrastructure investment. These priorities will be based on the needs of our nation and its economy. In its dealings with COAG, Infrastructure Australia will continually monitor and report information on the progress of nationally significant infrastructure investment and also on the progress of the implementation of relevant decisions set out by COAG. Infrastructure Australia will also take part in combating our climate change future by providing advice on infrastructure policy issues that arise from this great concern. Infrastructure Australia’s other responsibilities include the following: where commissioned, they will also deal with policy, pricing and infrastructure issues that impact on infrastructure utilisation; where commissioned, they will evaluate business cases of projects, project financing options including public-private partnerships and manage the probity process; and they will also identify disincentives to investment in nationally significant infrastructure. This will be done with scope to harmonise regulations, legislation and guidelines across jurisdictions by improving the efficiency of the delivery of projects or by standardising formats in tender documents and contracts. Australia has to be competitive in world markets. We must set clear investment priorities. Infrastructure Australia will focus investment away from the previous government’s political approach to infrastructure funding decisions and focus on a needs based infrastructure investment system-a system that will act in the national interest and tackle infrastructure bottlenecks head-on, a system that will be decided not on the basis of the margin of a seat but on a strong cost-benefit analysis. The Australian Labor Party have always recognised the need to act in the national interest to build this nation’s infrastructure. We led the way in nation building under Ben Chifley’s watch with the beginning of the Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Scheme. Gough Whitlam came to power when our hospitals and sewerage systems were badly in need of mending and upgrading and got on with the job. Tom Uren, as minister for urban and regional development, saw the creation of land commissions to ensure availability of reasonably priced housing blocks and the development of new planned communities. Bob Hawke pushed forward an economic agenda that allowed us to be competitive with the rest of the world. Paul Keating completed the standardisation of rail tracks in 1995 and introduced reforms that saw innovative housing programs under the Better Cities Program. Today the Rudd government is continuing Labor’s nation-building tradition. The bill is essential to growing the Australian economy. We have introduced the bill to the House so early in our term because Australia needs sound investment in infrastructure. We have heard example after example of where lack of strategic investment in infrastructure is contributing to capacity constraints within the Australian economy. According to CEDA, our current infrastructure backlog has been conservatively estimated at $25 billion in water, energy and land transport alone-infrastructure shortfalls that are costing us 0.8 per cent of GDP in lost production. The Infrastructure Australia Bill is vital to growing the Australian economy. A coordinated approach to infrastructure investment, which is what this bill would deliver, is imperative for Australia’s growth. We simply cannot do without it. If you just look at what we inherited from the 11 long years of the Howard government, the former government left behind high inflation, a skills crisis and significant capacity constraints in the Australian economy. Although the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that the economy was left in absolutely MAIN COMMITTEE first-rate condition, after over 20 ignored Reserve Bank warnings on inflation and recurrent investment rate rises, I think the term ‘first-rate’ is embellishing the truth a little. We are also now picking up the pieces of a government that was never interested in nation building. No plan or policy was ever established by those opposite to coordinate its approach to infrastructure investment. The bill has received widespread support from industry groups. These groups, like the Australian Industry Group, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia and Engineers Australia, have all called for a coordinated approach to infrastructure planning and development. Engineers Australia have maintained that for more than a decade infrastructure throughout Australia needed better coordination and long-term integrated planning. The Business Council of Australia has called for an integrated long-term planning framework across jurisdictions for the coordinated provision of infrastructure to underpin sustained economic growth. The cries of groups like the Business Council of Australia and Engineers Australia were falling on deaf ears under the previous government. This country is in desperate need of Infrastructure Australia, a body to coordinate the provision of infrastructure and to set a long-term plan for the country’s infrastructure needs. In the past this has not existed. This is in fact the first time we have actually had a minister for infrastructure, and I congratulate my colleague the member for Grayndler on his appointment and also for his dedication and hard work on this most important and difficult portfolio area. Infrastructure is one of the five points in Labor’s plan to lift productivity, fight inflation and sustain economic growth. Without modern and maintained infrastructure, particularly in the areas of transport, energy, communication and water assets, Australia has no strong economic future. The bill clearly provides a foundation as part of our five-point plan to provide national leadership to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks. The coordinated approach will ensure that our view is long-term, and not one that extends only to the next election. This coordinated approach will ensure that infrastructure is approached in a structured, sustainable manner and that Australian taxpayers are getting value for money. The bill will provide the base that will enable Australia to lift investment for new infrastructure whilst making sure that our existing infrastructure is used to its maximum benefit. While new investment in infrastructure is absolutely critical, it is essential that the benefits are maximised and not approached in a haphazard way. This bill will see a more streamlined approach to infrastructure establishment and maintenance. One of the first jobs of Infrastructure Australia is to undertake a national audit that will determine the condition and the capacity of our current nationally significant infrastructure. This is a major task of great importance and the expectation is that it will be completed within 12 months-a big job but one that this government is up to. The audit will provide the evidence that is necessary to funnel real dollars from real investments into real projects. The audit will identify the gaps, the impediments and the bottlenecks of our current infrastructure and provide guidance as to our future demands. It is not going to be an easy task to tackle; we absolutely acknowledge that. Our nation’s major infrastructure concerns are a very complex task to fix. We cannot click our fingers and fix every one of them tomorrow, and there is a lot of money involved in the investment, but with this MAIN COMMITTEE bill the Rudd government is determined to make an absolutely serious start. I commend the bill to the House. Australia Bill 2008, a bill which will establish a statutory authority known as Infrastructure Australia. While I do not oppose all the points in the bill, I call on the Australian government to do several things: firstly, to lift restrictions upon Infrastructure Australia undertaking a review of its own volition; secondly, to ensure that the minister’s power to give new functions to Infrastructure Australia are subject to primary disallowance; and, thirdly, to ensure that the minister seeks advice from Infrastructure Australia before appointing the Infrastructure Coordinator. The coalition government, through strong economic management, were able to invest in the upgrading of Australia’s infrastructure. The coalition reformed previous ad hoc approaches put in place by the then Labor government and developed the AusLink program-a program which invested a total of $38 billion over a 10-year period; a program which identified corridors of national importance and developed long-term plans; a program which included Roads to Recovery, which funded over 25,000 local council roads and benefited my electorate and every other electorate in the country. We also reintroduced the Black Spot Program, which had been axed by the previous Labor government-a program which aims at improving road safety and, on average, upgrades 300 black spots on our roads each year. These have been extremely successful programs. The question I put is: why does the government feel the need to create another bureaucratic layer when the current programs are successful and deliver positive outcomes? Why add another layer of red tape and bureaucracy? The cost to the taxpayer of this layer of bureaucracy will be $20 million over four years. We already have the Council of Australian Governments and the reports they have committed to providing every five years. I note the first of those reports should already be sitting on the minister’s desk. Why do we need another level of bureaucracy when we have AusLink under the reporting mechanism through COAG? Given that these reports provide information on rail, roads, airports, seaports, energy and water for each state, why does the Labor government need to create a new layer? Does it simply not trust the information it has from its own state Labor governments? I have seven roads in my electorate which urgently need upgrading. These roads were identified by the Hawkesbury City Council and local residents in my community. Unlike the Rudd Labor government, the then coalition government did not need a statutory authority, at a cost of $20 million, to advise them that these roads needed upgrading. I would like to draw the attention of the House and the government to the following roads in my electorate that need upgrading. The roads include Freemans Reach Road, which carries approximately 5,500 vehicles per day and needs to be rehabilitated at a cost of $305,000. Comleroy Road, at Kurrajong, needs a portion of its road shoulder resealed at a cost of $585,000. Three kilometres of work needs to be done between Old Bells Line of Road and East Kurrajong Road. Terrace Road, North Richmond, needs to have a portion of its road shoulder sealed at a cost of $741,000. The 3.7 kilometres of work would start from the end of the factories at North Richmond and end at Wire Lane. There is Grose Vale Road, from North Richmond to Grose Vale, a portion of which needs to be resealed at a cost of $995,000. The 5.1 kilometre roadworks would start at the entrance MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
329,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (6.40 Pm),"I rise to speak to the government’s Infrastructureof the Sydney Water depot in North Richmond and would finish at Grose Wold Road. Scheyville Road, Oakville, needs a portion of the road sealed at a cost of $836,500 to provide adequate carriageway width. This particular roadwork would start at Old Stock Route Road and finish 4.29 kilometres down the road at Dunns Road. Old East Kurrajong Road over Howes Creek needs the approach road sealed by the construction of multicell box culverts at a cost of $425,000. This would provide flood-free access based on a one in 20 year flood occurrence. Finally, Old Stock Route Road, Brennans Dam Road and Commercial Road, Vineyard, need construction, again, of multicell box culverts and adjacent roadworks at a cost of $975,900. This project would, again, provide flood-free access based on a one in 20 year flood occurrence. The total cost for the upgrade of these roads in my community is approximately $5 million. I would like to point out that the then coalition government, late last year, acknowledged these roads and committed to upgrading them. I call on the Australian government to honour this commitment and demonstrate their care and concern for the people of Greenway by funding these roads. I would like to advise the House that today I received communication from my local Rural Fire Service advising that another road needs urgent attention: the intersection of Boundary Road and Old Pitt Town Road, which was, tragically, the site of a major vehicle accident only 11 days ago which resulted in the loss of a life. Last week there was another accident at the same intersection, involving a mother and her daughter. Fortunately, they are okay. This is, again, another road in my electorate which needs a safety upgrade, and I am calling on the Australian government to commit to funding these urgent needs. The response to Infrastructure Australia has been mixed, and concerns have been raised regarding how Infrastructure Australia will perform the functions it has been allocated. I am concerned about the lack of transparency. The minister will be able to give direction to Infrastructure Australia without being accountable directly to the parliament. What we will have is an annual report, and within that, again, there will be no transparency or accountability to the parliament. A report by the Australian Infrastructure Report Card Alliance in 2001-the group is a major infrastructure stakeholder which prepares a report on infrastructure adequacy-gave rankings of: (a) very good, (b) good, (c) adequate, (d) poor and (e) inadequate. In this report, it is noteworthy that the areas where the Commonwealth had full or partial responsibilitynamely, airports, telecommunications and national roads-ranked relatively highly but areas of state government and, to a lesser extent, local government responsibility were most in need of remediation. I think that while this bill focuses on another layer of bureaucracy it may fail to look at certain inadequacies of the state Labor governments and their management of infrastructure, particularly where they have been responsible. We will see the Rudd Labor government, over this term, talk about the delivery of infrastructure, but I would like to remind the House that this is, indeed, possible because the coalition government, having managed the economy so well, has placed in the hands of the new government a significant surplus, which will reach an estimated $20 billion, and has also put in place restructuring and reform in the form of AusLink, which has provided funding infrastructure up until 2013-14. I recommend and encourage strongly that the Australian government look at the three points that I initially made in speaking to the House today-that is, again, to lift the restrictions upon Infrastructure Australia to undertake reviews of its own voMAIN COMMITTEE lition, to ensure that the minister’s power to give new functions to Infrastructure Australia is subject to primary disallowance and to ensure that the minister seeks advice from Infrastructure Australia before appointing the Infrastructure Coordinator. Labor’s commitment to being the party dedicated to building a nation. Frankly, all members should be aware that the ongoing development of the nation’s infrastructure is critical in meeting the challenges of the 21st century. It is vital for meeting just about every economic measure that contributes to our nation’s well-being; therefore, the development of Infrastructure Australia has been one of this government’s highest priorities. It is one that the government said would be achieved-that a new organisation, Infrastructure Australia, would be set upwithin the first 100 days of being in office. This approach puts the focus on the development of infrastructure and how critical that is in addressing the nation’s economic performance. It is also important to project that into the future to work out precisely what should be the priorities for infrastructure so that it can not only cope with the changing demands on the country but also advance its productivity. A continuing challenge for the government will be its role in ensuring that there is a sustainable, yet competitive approach to the nation’s infrastructure markets, in setting clear and concise priorities in investment opportunities and in ensuring that appropriate regulation is maintained. The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 before the House is all about raising investment levels in the nation’s physical infrastructure and, simultaneously, getting the maximum from our existing assets. I will quickly outline the provisions in the bill and why they are significant. The reason is simply that the nation needs leadership. The nation needs to have a critical examination of its economic requirements for the provision of infrastructure in the future. It needs to harness those measures with a view to ensuring that sufficient priority is given to Commonwealth assets, in conjunction with state and territory governments assets. Infrastructure Australia will be required to audit the adequacy of the nation’s infrastructure and, within 12 months, to develop an infrastructure priority list based on that audit, which will then be considered by COAG. I do not think an argument has ever been put that the provision of infrastructure is in the sole domain of any one sphere of government in this country. However, it is essential that we have an appropriate and agreed prioritisation as well as the timely positioning of infrastructure so as to cope with the growth within our country and that provides an economic platform to develop and enhance our productivity level. The government has agreed that the role of Infrastructure Australia will be as an adviser to the government, investors and owners of infrastructure about infrastructure priorities of national significance. It will provide policy and regulatory reforms to improve the efficient utilisation of national infrastructure networks as well as options to address impediments to the development and provision of efficient national infrastructure. It will consider the needs of the various users and possible financing mechanisms, which is all-important. Further, when referring to infrastructure of national significance, the bill specifically recognises transport, energy, communications and water as areas in which further investment is vital to develop and improve Australia’s national productivity. This is a critical piece of legislation in establishing this, and I am happy that speakers on all sides of the parliament are supporting this bill, because they should. It is clearly the first conMAIN COMMITTEE",252,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
330,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (6.50 Pm),"The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008 demonstratescrete building block that has been laid in place for developing our infrastructure for quite a long time. In the Australian Labor Party, as you no doubt appreciate, we are not foreign to this concept of nation building. It goes back to the Chifley government, which undertook the construction of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, and the Whitlam government, which provided practical infrastructure solutions such as the nation’s hospitals and, more importantly for me in Werriwa, ensured the provision of sewerage to Campbelltown and Liverpool. That goes back to the sixties and is something that is still talked about by the older generation out there who look at the approaches that were adopted by the Labor government of the time. More recently, the Hawke and Keating governments opened up our economy and made us more competitive. Under Keating the Better Cities Program was introduced. It saw the broadranging strategy for reform that included innovative housing programs and the renewed focus on urban consolidation. That is not a bad record for what Labor has done in terms of community building and nation building when it was in power. I would like to briefly contrast that with what occurred in the past 11 years of the Howard government. The Howard government had a unique opportunity to provide growth within the economy and to invest in nation building and the provision of infrastructure. The Howard government wasted 11½ years of office and of Australia’s need to become internationally competitive through the provision of infrastructure. As a consequence, the provision of our infrastructure is all the poorer. It is clear that the former government was never really interested in nation building. Indeed, it was upon the election of the Rudd government that the important position of federal infrastructure minister was first created. There has never been that position in the past and no indication that that would occur, notwithstanding how glorious and rosy the members opposite would like to say the economy is that they have bequeathed to the country. That same economy, which I would remind you, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Saffin, has now undergone 10 consecutive interest rate rises, and now has the threat of inflation as public enemy No. 1. That has left a considerable amount of work for Labor to do to harness economic growth in those circumstances. The Howard government had 11½ years to fix the bottlenecks and put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates but failed dismally to do so. What did they actually seek to do? They thought up the Regional Partnerships program. It was not a bad program, as my colleague the member for Stirling has indicated, if you had a government seat that was going to be assessed for a program. We heard in question time only recently that many of these regional partnerships grants were granted on one day’s application. In the Central Coast, Tumbi Creek was cleared, and yet it did not need to be cleared. It actually flooded, but they still got their money for it. And today we heard about a cheese factory in the electorate of Indi that did not even have to produce anything. It is still getting its regional partnerships grant and it has closed its doors. That is the difference in approach in terms of a vision of economic drivers in our economy. What was being looked at in those days was simply what it takes to do or say to buy an election win. That is all it was about. ence. Quite frankly, Labor can make fun of the opposition on this because they are worthy of having fun poked at them. But realistically this is the difference between a government which is addressing the long-term needs of the country-not only to next year or to the next election.

While I do not oppose the bill, I am a bit concerned about the involvement of state governments who have a history, particularly in my state of New South Wales, of gross mismanagement of most infrastructure projects. It does not matter whether it is road or rail-although the gross mismanagement in rail is that they shut it down. I suppose that is infrastructure building at its best-when you look around and say: ‘Okay, what savings can I make so that I can pour my money into a city area, into a cross-city tunnel or into some major infrastructure thing that has gone wrong in the city? I think I’ll cut something from the country.’ That has typically been the attitude of the New South Wales government. I am here to raise the issue of Infrastructure Australia and its involvement with the states. I understand that Infrastructure Australia will reside in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. It is regional development that I want to discuss. Most people would think that the discussion around this bill would be primarily centred on roads and associated heavy vehicle industry, rail or Auslink proposals-all of those kinds of issues. But I would like to draw the House’s attention to a few issues that I am having great difficulty with. It is not the first time, and it definitely will not be the last time, that you hear me rise in the parliament to raise this issue. I cite an opinion piece in my local paper, the Daily Advertiser, from 12 March 2008. The opinion piece says that the health sector needs new direction, and it is quite right. The Daily Advertiser and the community of Wagga Wagga have been absolutely scathing of state governments-I have to say, both coalition and Labor-which have been grossly neglectful of them and have been unable to provide Wagga Wagga with a base hospital. This has been going on for years-in fact, 30 years of promises made and promises broken by every form of government. We are still in the same situation. We do need a new direction. We must have a new direction in health. The opinion piece talks about discussions that I had with the previous Minister for Health and Ageing. I approached him many times about making the Riverina a pilot project whereby the Commonwealth would take over the delivery of health to see exactly how it could run it in its entirety. I would really urge the current Minister for Health and Ageing to consider a pilot project, most appropriately in the Riverina, so that we could finally get some action on the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. At this hospital not only are men and women sharing bathrooms but sinks are falling off walls, physicians are unable to attend, surgeons are unable to operate and operating theatres are being shut down because water is pumping through the roof and filling them up with water-near electrical equipment-so all surgery is postponed. It is a saga of sagas; it just goes on and on. And now we find that white ants are eating the kids ward out entirely. This was revealed in the Daily Advertiser on 11 March. I thought I could never be shocked by what is happening in the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital-that there could not be any more said about the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital that has not already been identified. But sadly there is. Sadly, staff discovered the white ants eating away the window frames of the children’s ward. The article in the Daily Advertiser quotes parents and doctors saying that the infestation is just one indication of the ward’s poor condition. MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008
333,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (7.01 Pm),"I rise to speak about the Infrastructure Australia BillThe paediatrician who has worked in the children’s ward is quoted as saying that the ward had been in a progressively poor state for years, that the biggest issue was cross-infection, that the ward was not safe from infection, that 12 children were being actively treated for cancer in this ward, that the treatment suppressed their immunity and that with poor cross-infection control they are most certainly at risk. The doctor went on to say that out of the 10 standards of the national health department the ward failed eight of them. They only had two inadequate isolation rooms, where contagious children were separated by only a curtain, and the ward was also often overcrowded and crammed, with few facilities for parents to stay the night with their dreadfully sick children. It is a disgrace. It is an infrastructure nightmare that should have been addressed by the state government over the years. I admit that I took it to the former Minister for Health and Ageing when the Commonwealth intervened on the Mersey Hospital. I thought that that opened up my case, allowing me to go to the minister to intervene in the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. It is atrocious. Stories of the atrocious conditions that the staff-fabulous staff-are forced to work in are in the paper day after day. I will be raising the issue of infrastructure with respect to the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital on a consistent basis because I believe that the Minister for Health would like to resolve this ongoing issue and I am hopeful that she can use her power to step in. She has already indicated that the reason that it would be better to have a Labor federal government is that the blame game would be stopped between the states and the Commonwealth and the enormous health problem that exists, particularly in New South Wales, would be more easily resolved by having the Labor Party at Commonwealth and state levels. I agree with her. I think that she has the tools and the ability. She is a very competent minister and I believe wholeheartedly that if she really puts her mind to it, she will be able to resolve this ongoing issue for the Riverina people. It is the only regional referral hospital. All the other hospitals were shut down as base hospitals. There is only one base hospital for referral. The difference is that at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, a two-bed ward was made into a four-bed ward and a four-bed ward was made into an eight-bed ward. No additional staff, services or facilities were installed. It is an absolutely disgusting disgrace and staff should not have to work in that area. Communications infrastructure in my electorate is another major topic. It has been an ongoing issue for so long. I was surprised to see, with these major plans for the rollout of broadband, that we are going to raid the rural infrastructure fund-the money put away to ensure that rural telecommunications and communications were always kept up to speed. The interest earned from the Future Fund was to be used to ensure rural and regional people would have access to services and communications capacity, which of course they are entitled to. However, I see in the paper-and that is generally how I find things out now: The federal government will not award a tender to build its planned national high-speed broadband network until September at the earliest, several months later than it hoped. I am quoting from the Daily Advertiser of 12 March 2008. There is an obvious problem. The minister ‘had hoped to award the tender in June to build the $8 billion fibre-to-the-node network’. We all know that $8 billion for fibre to the node means fibre to the node in the city, and fibre to the node to houses in rural and regional Australia is not included in that money. Not only has it not been taking place; it is going to be put off for quite a while yet. That is sad because rural and regional people require access to reliable, adequate, fast and significant MAIN COMMITTEE broadband services. Along with the Deputy Speaker, the member for Maranoa, I have always been pushing the barrow for rural and regional communications. I come to a concern that I have in West Wyalong, which is in the Bland shire in my electorate. Again we have this combination of states and Commonwealth. Within Infrastructure Australia the states are going to have a fairly significant role in this. The Bland shire has a major problem; it is almost unthinkable. I wrote to the minister on 4 December about an issue of road classification confronting the Bland shire, after having had it brought to my attention on that day. I first congratulated the minister, as he should be congratulated, of course. I am sure that he will do a great job in resolving many of these state infrastructure problems, particularly through the Infrastructure Australia Bill. I explained to the minister that the Newell Highway runs through the main street of West Wyalong like a very narrow snake and that it is unsuitable for B-double truck movements. Bland Shire Council established a bypass for heavy vehicles to take B-doubles out of the CBD and an appropriate local road was gazetted as the B-double route. There is a bit of a problem with this. Council have found that there are two major concerns with the bypass road. Firstly, there is a cost involved in maintaining a road to B-double standards. I note that local government is also involved in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in which Infrastructure Australia will sit. We have cost shifted onto local government. Bland Shire Council have not been able to upgrade the road so that B-doubles are out of the CBD, and they have found it very difficult to get the attention of the state government. They sought to reclassify the five-kilometre route as a regional road, which would be funded by the New South Wales RTA. As yet, council have not had any results from the road reclassification panel. Secondly-and we think more importantly-there was an AusLink application. It was rejected because the Newell Highway has been classified as a higher mass limit route. The local roads are not rated to carry the increased loads that are now permitted on heavy vehicle combinations without permits applicable to specific companies on specific routes. In West Wyalong, the council are now presented with the anomaly of the Newell Highway heavy vehicle bypass forcing the trucks with a high mass limit accreditation onto a local road, and now they get fined for being on the local road. They are having a major difficulty there. It is a two-tiered issue. One issue is that they desperately need funding to upgrade their bypass in order that it can meet the higher mass limit route, and obviously they need an expeditious reclassification of the road from local to regional status as well. That would enable funds for upgrading to come from a state allocation. Yet, when I brought this to the minister’s attention, he clearly said, ‘As you would be aware, the New South Wales government, through the Roads and Traffic Authority and local government, is responsible for the operation and the management of New South Wales regional roads.’ I am aware of that, and of course the minister is right. But, if Infrastructure Australia is to genuinely work for all people of Australia, including rural and regional people, and it sits within the minister’s portfolio-and Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is a fairly large portfolio-and if the members of the panel must have expertise, one in local government, I am hopeful that surely the minister will see that common sense prevails on the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. In establishing this body, surely the minister can ensure that common sense prevails MAIN COMMITTEE over this ridiculous situation that Bland Shire Council find themselves in. They are neither here nor there. They have an anomaly, with a road designed to get the vehicles out, where the vehicles can now be fined because it is not a higher mass limits road. They desperately need a road reclassification. I am hopeful that the minister can help us out with that. AgainI see some of the issues relating to the trucking industry when we look at the imposition that we now have on working truck owners and operators and their families. They have a whole new position where registration fees can in some cases go up 227 per cent. As from 2009, I think there is an additional levy of 1.37c a litre-I might be wrong on that figure; it is off the top of my head. Already the industry has been buckling under high fuel prices. It has not passed them on as much as it should and could have to the consumer. At the same time, we have the ACCC inquiry going on into the high cost of groceries and food, and then we impose a tax on the largest carrier. Yet there is no doubt that, whether we like it or not, rail is never going to be able to replace all of the road freight, nor should it. Of course, grocery prices will have to rise as the new tax increases on truckies are passed on to consumers. There is no choice. SoI do not understand how we can be holding an enquiry that is asking questions about why things are so expensive in the grocery and retail sector while we are imposing another set of conditions that the Liberal government fought the states on and won. We fought and won against the states. The states wanted to impose this before and we fought against it. To his credit, Warren Truss, who was then the minister, was able to defeat it so that the cost would not get passed on to the consumer and so that the road transport operators would have a fair go-because without them the future for Australia and Australian consumers is incredibly bleak. SoI raise these issues for your attention. They are just a few of many issues that will come to the fore over a period of time, and I really do look forward to the success of this new unit in delivering greater benefits and greater accountability from the states. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.21 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. This bill clearly is an example of national leadership, nation-building, economic reform and tackling inflation through enhanced productivity. Let me turn to the bill. The bill sets out the plan to establish Infrastructure Australia-the body that will advise the government-and the Infrastructure Coordinator, to support the operation of Infrastructure Australia. It also sets out the composition and functions of Infrastructure Australia. I note with commendation that Sir Rod Eddington was appointed to the chair of Infrastructure Australia, receiving widespread community approval. Infrastructure Australia will have 12 members including the chair, and I am sure it will comprise some women and men of note who will be able to contribute to the auditing and mapping of national infrastructure requirements. We all know that enhancing national productivity is a necessary component in the fight to tackle inflation. It is a fight that we are committed to. Infrastructure Australia will not be about our wish lists-and we all have wish lists for our seats; we know what we want in terms of infrastructure-but it will be about looking at infrastructure right across Australia. It will look at the national infrastructure we need to have in place to support and strengthen the economy and tackle productivity. It will also look at rural and regional infrastructure requirements. MAIN COMMITTEE The bill goes on to define nationally significant infrastructure to include transport infrastructure, energy infrastructure, communications infrastructure and water infrastructure-the four key areas ‘in which investment or further investment will materially improve national productivity’, which is a key focus of Infrastructure Australia. The primary function of Infrastructure Australia is most telling: Infrastructure Australia has the primary function of providing advice to the Minister, Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments, investors in infrastructure and owners of infrastructure on matters relating to infrastructure, including in relation to the following: (a) Australia’s current and future needs and priorities relating to nationally significant infrastructure ... But I go back to the primary function, which involves the Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments, because that is what it is about-it is about cooperation. Cooperation is the hallmark of the Rudd Labor government. If we do not have cooperation across all those levels of government and in this case the private sector-because we have to work togetherthen we will not be able to do what we need to do, which is to map, audit and prepare our national infrastructure to provide us with the basic framework that we need to be competitive and strong and to make our communities sustainable. One of the primary functions of Infrastructure Australia is to advise-it is not to tell us what to do; it is to advise. Infrastructure Australia, supported by the coordinator, will have the ability and the space to be able to do that. They will be able to do the assessment and the research and provide the evidence that we need to make the decisions about what infrastructure we will set up. The fact that the Commonwealth government has a minister for infrastructure and a department for infrastructure-the first since Federation-demonstrates the Rudd Labor government’s bona fides on the matter of Australia’s infrastructure needs. It is a first, and long, long overdue. The fact that the previous coalition government did not have a minister for infrastructure and a department for infrastructure demonstrates their failure to plan and develop infrastructure required to build and sustain a modern framework to support our workplace, strengthen our economy and sustain our communities. The fact that the previous coalition government were missing in action over regional and rural infrastructure needs throughout 11 years of government demonstrates how they had completely lost touch with the communities in rural and regional Australia and with what their needs were. The people in PageI represent live in an area that has no public transport to speak of and a roads network that contains the Pacific Highway-which is not just a highway; it is our local road. It is a road that carries an increasing number of B-doubles and all other forms of traffic. In Page, there is an expanding population of sea changers, an increasing number of aged people requiring different forms of transport, particularly for their medical needs, and an increasing movement of goods within the region. Page stretches up to the Queensland border, where we also have movements of traffic through an inland route coming down the Summerland Way. That is an area that needs to be factored in and looked at when we are talking and thinking about infrastructure. We also have lots of young people wanting to access educational services. All of this activity requires transport. I submit that water is essential, communications is essential, energy infrastructure is essential and transport is vital for all the communities to work and be sustainable. In terms of transport, many in the region of the Northern Rivers want us to look at trains. They want more buses or they want commuter trains to travel on shorter routes. And who can MAIN COMMITTEE disagree, particularly when we are faced with the challenges of climate change? We are told that trains are far more friendly in terms of climate change, but there are costs. We have to determine people flows and how much it will cost-and that is in all areas, not just trains. The member for Riverina talked about trains and how the New South Wales government had cut train services. The cuts to train services have been going on since the sixties. I agree that there have been such cuts, but it is an old problem and it is one that has not been addressed. WhereI live, the train services have been wound back since the sixties. The cuts reached their zenith under a coalition government. The motorail was taken off and the timetabling was changed. It became very unfriendly to country people. People also talk about the ‘missing link’ up my way and how we should have the ‘missing link’. Since 1984 there have been six inquiries done on the ‘missing link’-and the ‘missing link’ is still the missing link. That says something about how all governments have looked at the issue of trains and the ‘missing link’. In fact, when Premier Greiner was leading the New South Wales government, another report was done on the ‘missing link’. It never saw the light of day, but we did manage to get a look at it. It was just one of those issues that nobody would touch. Good infrastructure is the difference. We need good infrastructure. It is actually the difference between a developing and a developed nation. We are a developed nation, but the OECD has said in terms of infrastructure we are No. 20 out of 25 countries on that list. That does not say a lot about the state of our infrastructure. Infrastructure is the stuff that makes our communities work. It is running water. It is sanitation. It is the power or energy system-that is, generally electricity but also changing forms of energy in keeping with environmental and climate change concerns. It is roads. It is bridges. It is schools. It is hospitals. It is also telecommunications, high-speed internet and download capacity. As the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government said in his address to the National Press Club on 20 February: Infrastructure is the basic framework or underlying foundation of an organisation or a system. If we do not get that right, we do not get anything right. That is why it has been necessary to have a minister for infrastructure, to have an infrastructure department and to set up Infrastructure Australia. If we do not get the basics right, it is hard to get anything else right. Indeed it is, but there has been neglect. If we neglect that then we neglect our economy. Our economy relies on sound and modern infrastructure. The previous coalition government, who trumpeted their economic credentials, failed miserably here. They not only did not identify critical infrastructure needs but did not take infrastructure seriously as an issue, which is inherent to maintaining a strong economy and to tacking inflation. This is despite the 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank regarding inflation that they received. The Rudd Labor government know that to tackle inflation we have to address infrastructure shortfalls. This is one part of our five-point plan to do that. The Infrastructure Australia Bill is a central part of the government’s plan to combat inflation. It will drive investment where it is needed most, fuelling the nation’s productivity capacity, not inflation. Under the Rudd government, infrastructure development investment will be motivated by need and not by the margin of the seat. I commend the bill to the House.
