Petition received and read. ister aware that the Lahour Treasurer of Tasmania, in presenting his budget in the State Parliament this woek, made the following statements in connection with the general economic policy to which the Australian Government has given effect: (1) That inflation was being defeated; (2) that, by 1953-54, Australia would seef a return to conditions of even greater stability; (3) that although the eost of living had increased by 20 per eent. over the last two years, wage-earners were better off because incomes had increased by 25 per cent, over the same period? the question? Minister not consider that these statements by the Labour Treasurer of Tasmania confirm the fact that this Govern' [70] [25 BBS, 1952.] Financial Polity. 2209 ment's economic policy is showing very desirable results in the interests of the people generally and that the calamity howling directed against the Government by the Labour party in this House is just so much hooey? Mr Madden thc Treasurer of Tasmania, had made the statements to which the honourable member has referred. I thought that they were extremely sensible statements. It is interesting to note that, although they wero made by a Labour Treasurer in Australia, the people who dislike them are in opposition in this House. Minister for Health a question that concerns homes for the aged and infirm. I understand that it is unlikely that patients in the infirmary wards of suoh homes can be insured under thc hospital benefits scheme and so qualify for the additional benefit of 4s. a day. The Government might he disposed, in the circumstances, to pay the benefit to benevolent homes on behalf of such patients. Is that likely to happen, and, in any case, will the right honorahle gentleman give consideration to the suggestion? has been made with the States fhat havo signed agreements with thc Commonwealth under which an extra 4s. a day will he paid in respect of pensioners who enter "" acute "" hospitals, even thoughthey are not insured. I shall ascertain whether a similar arrangement can be made with respect to pensioners who enter infirmaries, and supply an answer to the honourable gentleman. for Health aware that '. the New South Wales Hospitals Commission has announced that owing, to a shortage of finance the hospitals in New South Wales will have to drastically curtail their activities, and that gome of them may even have to close down wards?

9,Mr Morgan,"I s the Ministerl l r . SPEAKER-Order! I have repeatedly ruled that names of persons must not be mentioned in questions. the Prince Alfred Hospital has stated that it may be necessary to withdraw about 300 beds from use at that hospital. Will the Minuter take up this matter with the Treasurer immediately, with a view to ensuring that the necessary finance will bc forthcoming to enable the Prince Alfred Hospital to keep going? If the Minister still intends to introduce a comprehensive health scheme, when is it expected that the scheme will commence? in New South Wales in relation to hospitals is exactly as I foretold would occur when the Chifley Government's hospital benefits scheme came into existence. It paralysed the whole system. The Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales has pointed out in his budget speech that New South Wales is gaining about £2,000,000 a year for its hospital revenue as a result of the agreement that it has now made with the Commonwealth. As the offer waa made to New South Wales about twenty months ago, the New South Wales Government could have received about £3,500,000 more, if it had come into the scheme at that time. I understand that that Government is short of about £3,000,000 for its hospitals. Tho New South Wales Minister for Health has stated that, because of the method of handing everything out on a free basis, there is a great wastage of food, which cannot be excused in any case. The only way to correct that state of affairs is by the exercise of a sense of responsibility, which will be obtained under the scheme to which New South Wales has agreed. Minister received any approach from the New South Wales Premier, Mr reference to the number of unemployed Cahill, seeking more loan money for the works programme of that State? Has the right honourable gentleman also noticed that the latest variation of the theme song of the New South Wales Government-""Put the blame on the Federal Government""-is to attribute the failure of the socialist venture of the State tile works at Blacktown, in my electorate, to insufficient loan money provided by the Commonwealth? ject of the State tile works at Blacktown is outside the scope of the authority of this Parliament. between £800,000 and £1,000,000 on thia disastrous undertaking suggest that the New South Wales Government is entirely irresponsible in handling public funds? of this kind should not be allowed. asked by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. communication from Mr Cahill on the matters to which the honourable member for Mitchell has referred, and, of course, I ha.ve also received many similar communications through the press in the last fortnight. It appears to he the fashion now, whenever somebody in Australia, and particularly in one or two States, wants money for something, to claim that the Commonwealth is responsible for providing it. That attitude is absurd. Mr Cahill's application is receiving my consideration at the present time. I am aware of thc facts to which the honourable member for Mitchell has referred regarding losses by States in other directions. The remarkable thing is that some State governments have complained bitterly that they have not suiiicient loan money for some really important purpose, yet it so happens that they have already expended probably an equal sum of money on some utterly irrelevant purpose. acting for the Minister for Immigration give me an answer to my question with Italian migrants in hostels and camps, the number coming to Australia, and the steps that are being taken to place them in employment, especially in the country?",12,Health And Medical Services

18,Mr Mullens,"Can the Ministernot been able to give the honourable member the answer to his question before now, but I am having a detailed statement prepared in order to show the position. I recall that approximately 1,100 Italian immigrants are now in camps awaiting what is known in the modern jargon as "" initial placement"". About 300 rural workers have yet to leave Italy for Australia, and approximately 950 are already on the water. The honourable member has asked me what steps have been taken to place those workers particularly on farms. I inform him that in March last the Commonwealth commenced a drive to obtain rural workers, and has placed, in the meantime, no fewer than 2,300 immigrants on farms in Australia and all but 200 of them have been Italians. I believe that a statement on those matters was made in the House, but I shall give the honourable gentleman the details, which I have in my office. acting for the Minister for Immigration aware that wharf accommodation for the reception of /immigrants at the port of Melbourne is inadequate and unsuitable for the purpose? Is he also aware that, in some instances, the long waiting periods involved by customs examinations, &c, have resulted in unpleasant incidents and subsequent court action? Although this matter has been raised on several occasions, there has been no visible improvement at Port Melbourne. Will the Minister arrange for it to he again investigated, with a view to prompt and suitable action being taken? what the honourable gentleman has alleged. [ do not think that this matter has been raised during the time that I have been acting for the Minister for Immigration. I am sorry to hear of this report, and I shall have it investigated. If it turns out that there are unsatisfactory features in this connection, I shall endeavour to have them improved straight away. addressed to the Treasurer. I point out, by way of explanation, that under the taxation law dried fruits growers may be called upon to assess their current incomes at the 31st March each year. Does the right honourable gentleman know that the growers are fully occupied with essential harvest work at that period of the year, and that there is no chance whatever of assessing incomes in this industry until the drying of the fruit has been completed? Will he investigate the matter with a view to overcoming this difficulty? certainly investigate the matter. I see merit in the honourable member's suggestion and I shall be glad to consider it, together with other difficulties or implications that might be involved. whether the 20 per cent, special depreciation allowance in respect of rural houses applies to houses built for casual rural workers ? ance applies to houses provided for all rural employees, whether they be permanent or casual. the Interior had any further discussion with the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Sheahan, in relation to the proposal to construct a bridge across the Goodradigbee River at Brindabella? If so, will he inform the House of the outcome of such discussion? If no discussion has taken place, will the Minister again take up the matter with the State Minister and endeavour to see that some definite arrangement is arrived at so that this essential project may be proceeded with, particularly for the purpose of increasing primary production in the area and opening up of new country for settlement ? heard anything further from the New South Wales Minister for Transport, and I do not know that any good purpose woulcl be served by further correspondence on the subject.

I shall ascertain the progress that has been made towards a decision and advise the honourable member of the result early next week. to the Minister for Health. Has any general direction been given that, recipients of the special tuberculosis allowport, what practical steps does he propose ance must undergo a further medical check-up with a view to ascertaining which cases are chronic and are showing no signs of improvement ? Is it the policy of the Government to transfer such recipients to the invalid pension list, thus reducing the benefit received by them and causing them financial worry and hardship which can only result in further deterioration of the health of sufferers of this dreaded disease?

34,Mr Menzies,"The Joint Coalcountry. It is nd difficulty for this country to go through a short period during which it is actually producing a little more coal than it needs. That is a much healthier position than that which existed in Australia for years past. old story in certain quarters is that Australia should never have reserves of coal. That has been the Communist line in the coal industry over the past fifteen years, but, from the point of view of the nation, there will be great satisfaction in the knowledge that we have, temporarily at any rate, more than caught up with the demand for coal. That position, of course, presents its own temporary problems offinanceand marketing. They are receiving the close attention of ray colleague. to the Minister for Social Services. Is it a fact that when an applicant for a pension dies before the claim has been finalized, the Department of Social Services discontinues inquiries into the claim? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that such claims are finalized for the purpose, of payment of the funeral allowance to the next-of-kin of the applicants? to make the inquiry that has been suggested by the honourable member, and I shall have the practice examined closely. Minister for Works aware that contractors for the building of war service homes are sometimes denied payments that they or three weeks that I have had the have made to sub-contractors if it is opportunity to see the internal workings established by the Crown that the claims of the Postal Department, I have are a few days overdue? In view of the ascertained that the most extraordinary difficulties that are often experienced by care and attention has been given to contractors who are obliged to honour the matters that have been raised by those accounts, will the Minister direct the honourable member. In a number that more sympathetic consideration be of instances it has been necessary to given to those claims before his departadvertise several times for contractors ment decides that it will not meet the to provide mail services, and in some, obligations that have been accepted by the cases, owing to the present conditions, private contractors? sure on this point, but, quite frankly, I am not quite sure, that the Department of Works has anything to do with war service homes. That matter comes under the administration of the Minister for Social Services, whose department usually works on direct contract. I believe that at present all works are being let by direct contract; but, in the past, when direct contracts were difficult to obtain, it is correct, as the honourable member has suggested, that a certain number of contracts went through the Department of Works on behalf of the War Service Homes Division of the Department of Social Services. If the honourable gentleman will supply me with detailed information, I shall have the matter looked into immediately. question to the Minister acting for the Postmaster-General by pointing out that, on the ground of economy, the frequency of many country postal services has been reduced, and the hours of rural telephone exchanges have been restricted. Is the Minister aware that this curtailment of services is causing considerable hardship to many primary producers, especially those of the outback areas? Will the Minister agree that the economies that have been effected are trifling in proportion to the inconvenience that has been entailed? Accordingly, will he give consideration to preventing further retrograde actions of this nature, and to the restoration of the services that have recently been restricted ? it has not been possible to enter into",15,Civil Aviation

I have never heard such a complaint before, but I will be pleased to take the honourable member's suggestion into consideration. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 25th September (vide page 2201). The bill. Opposition) [11.2] I wish to bring to the attention of the committee a matter which has been discussed in broad principle by a number of honourable members. The honourable member for Shortland ( Mr of the provision is obvious. The benefit Griffiths) cited a number of cases in which, in his view, there had not been a proper application of certain sections of the act under which a serviceman or his widow claimed that disablement or death was due to war service. This matter was also discussed by other honourable members including the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Morgan), who played a prominent part in the original drafting of the relevant clauses, some of which the Government has now proposed to amend. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made a suggestion which will have to be considered in the near future. A lot has been said of the administration of the Eepatriation Act by the Repatriation Commission, but the real problem in nine cases out of ten, concerns the disposal of appeals by the entitlement tribunal. There has been a failure on the part of the entitlement tribunals to apply section 47 of the act, which deals with the onus of proof. The broad problem with which the Parliament was confronted in 1943, when the section was extended and redrafted, and when it was my duty to redraft it, was whether disablement could be proved to be connected in some relevant way with war service. The act was so drafted as to enable the ex-serviceman, or, in the event of his death, his dependants, to had contributed to, aggravated or accelerated the condition in some way. Then we dealt anew, as the Minister knows, with the benefit of the doubt provision that is contained in section 47. As it is a lengthy section I shall not read all of it to the House now. There is no provision in any act of this kind anywhere else in the world which is as beneficial to the soldier as is this provision, so long as it is applied. Section 47 provides that the commission, a board or an appeal tribunal shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt about the existence of any fact that would be favorable to the claimant, as well as the benefit of any douht regarding any question that may arise for decision under the claim, including the question whether his incapacity was contributed to in any material degree, or was aggravated by, the condition of his war service. The wide sweep of any doubt in any of these questions must be given to the ex-serviceman. Parliament did not leave the matter there, however. It went further, because the benefit of the doubt provision was linked with a special provision that relates to the onus of proof. Accordingly, it was specifically provided in sub-section (2.) of section 47 that in all cases the onus of proof shall lie, not on the ex-serviceman or his dependants, but on the authority that may contest the claim. It said, in effect, that it shall be the duty both of the commission and the appeal tribunal to. . draw . . . from the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reason.able inferences in favour of the claimant . . . I do not think that the tribunals have sufficiently appreciated the intention of the legislature in relation to these provisions which mean, in effect, that unless it is positively proved by the authority that contests the claim that war service could have had nothing to do with the condition, the decision must be given in favour of the applicant. I admit-and this is a suggestion that I wish to make to",17,Aemed Foeces

56,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thethe Mimster later-that there is repetition there. It arose from the anxiety of all parties in the Parliament that this principle should be made binding at every stage of the application before the commission and subsequently before the appeal tribunal. As I have said, there is no provision like that in any similar statute anywhere in the world. based upon a very simple truth. An ex-serviceman of World WarI . may suffer, 10, 20 or 30 years after his discharge, from a physical condition which may then appoar and cause his death. If the question arises whether that condition was contributed to by war service, that situation will be covered by section 47, which governs the action to be taken in such a case. Take the case of death or disablement from a heart condition. I cannot imagine that any medical practitioner would deny the reasonable possibility of such a condition having been contributed to in some degree by war service. So long as that is possible the decision must be given in favour of the serviceman, because that is what the statute provides. The honourable member for East Sydney had this principle in mind when he suggested that the time was coming when, after the lapse of so many years, the claims of all ex-servicemen of World WarI . , who had served in combat areas, should be almost automatically recognized. It is not to the purpose to say that no symptoms had manifested themselves during the intervening period. Medical science recognizes that the physical and nervous strain of war service is such that it must play a part in bringing about the conditions which entitle a serviceman to compensation. For that reason, there is a special provision. Section 48 of the act, provides that a medical practitioner, who has any doubt about the cause of an applicant's condition, must state the doubt in his report, but I believe that the provision is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I do not criticize the political administration of the act. Indeed, there is no political administration, strictly speaking, because the Parliament has laid down the conditions of entitlement. The DEPUTY Bowden) -Order! The right honourable Dr. Evatt. gentleman's time has expired, but if no other honourable member wishes to speak, he may take his second period now. for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) said that it was necessary for applicants to make out a prima facie case, but in that he was mistaken. On the contrary, the onus It is of proof rests on those who contest the claim before the appeal tribunal. In this, the situation of the ex-serviceman differs radically from that of the claimant for workers' compensation, who must make out a prima facie case that there is a plausible connection between his injury and his employment. I know that the honourable member for Franklin has taken the keenest interest in ex-servicemen, but he was in error when he stated that applicants had to make out a prima facie case. Section 47 of the act makes it clear beyond all doubt that the onus of proof is on the department, that the benefit of any doubt must be given to the applicant, and that it is the duty of the tribunals to draw all inferences favorable to the applicant. Those who are contesting an application must prove that war service eould not have had any connection with the applicant's condition, and I do not think that any doctor would dare to say, after the iapse of perhaps 30 years, that there could be no association between a man's disability or death and his war service. I repeat that sections 47 and 48, which deal with the medical report, were drafted in order to make it clear beyond any possibility of ambiguity that the ex-serviceman should be entitled to have his claim recognized unless those resisting the claim were able to show by overwhelming evidence that disablement, or death was not due to war service. I am not attacking any of the repatriation tribunals. One honorahle gentleman asked whether I should favour legal practitioners appearing before an appeal tribunal. That question does not, arise; but means should be provided to check the decisions of appeal tribunals in order to ensure that they shall carry out this provision. I am convinced that in many instances they do not do so. The section to which this clause relates is most difficult, but the intention of the Parliament is quite clear and I desire to see",18,Eepateiati On Bill 1952
57,Dr. Evatt,"The honourable memberthe kind to which reference has been made-. We have in existence the Legal -Service Bureau which was established uuder another act, but in cases in which doubt arises I should like to see the Attorney-General have the right and, indeed the duty of supervision to ensure that such cases shall be put correctly to appeal tribunals. Such a provision would remove the source of dissatisfaction in cases in"" which there is a feeling that justice has not been done. I put that to the Minister; it has no party political significance whatever. All parties have contributed to improvements of the Bepatriation Act ; but that is a point at which there is considerable anxiety. I am suggesting not that section 47 be further amended, but that it should be applied more rigidly in accordance with the letter and the spirit of it . the A r m y ) [11.18] I appreciate the manner in which the Leader of the Oppositiou ( D r . Evatt) has presented his view on the very important section to which this clause relates. Since the section wao introduced in 1929, no other section of the act, has received more consideration with a view to improving ' it. It was introduced following prolonged discussions in. this chamber, and after further examination it was amended in 1935 with a view to making its application easier. All parties have endeavoured to broaden the onus of proof provision and the benefit of the doubt provision in order to ensure that any ex-serviceman who can justly claim that his condition is due to war service shall be entitled to receive a pension. This matter was considered by the all-party committee that was set up by the Chifley Government in 1941 to review the Repatriation Act as a whole. The members of that committee were the honorahle member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who was chairman, the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), who was deputy chairman, Senator Lamp, Senator Collett, who was formerly Ministerf o r Repatriation, the lionorable member for Corangamite ( Mr Allan McDonald) and myself, I , also, having formerly been Ministerf o r Repatriation. The task of that committee was to review the operation of the Repatriation-Act since its inception during World WarI . and to make recommendations to the Government with a view to improving it on the basis of experience. A very comprehensive unanimous report was made. The Government implemented almost all of the recommendations made by the committee. I am making these points to show that at all times the committee was concerned to ensure, beyond any shadow of doubt, that ex-servicemen shall be treated justly and readily be granted a pension if they are entitled to it . That is the hasis on which I think all parties view this matter. Paragraph 49 of the report, which deals with onus of proof that incapacity or death is not due to war service, statesSection 45w of the Aet provides to the effect tiiat, where an applicant to an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal shall make out a prima facie case in support of a claim that the incapacity from which a member is suffering or had died was caused or aggravated by war service, the onus of proof that such incapacity was not, in fact, so caused or aggravated shall lie with the Commission. The Government accepted that recommendation and amended the legislation in an endeavour to give effect to it . report ? for a very brief period and furnished its report on the l l t h December, 1942. Paragraph 50 of the report reads as follows:A similar provision applies in respect of death caused by accident after discharge, where it is claimed that war incapacity contributed to a material degree to the death. The cominittee considered many instances of persons who had been knocked down and killed because their war-caused disabilities had rendered them so physically unfit that they were unable to jump aside when crossing a street, so that vehicles driven by careless drivers knocked them down. The committee was of the opinion that such cases should come within the terms of the provision to which I have just referred. In that respect the committee stated in paragraph 5 1 The Committee recommends that the principle should apply in respect of all claims and appeals whicli come before the Commission in the future and that such a provision be inserted in section 39B of the Act.",19,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of

60,Mr Francis,"The committee satThat clearly indicated that the joint parliamentary committee regarded this provision as of vital importance. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is in the administration of the act that effect is given to the intention of the Parliament and of the various governments which have administered the legislation. To-day, we have a Repatriation Commission which is composed entirely of ex-servicemen of very wide experience. Most of the deputy commissioners have been with the commission for a long time. I think that the deputy chairman was there after World WarI . , when the Repatriation Department, as it was then called, was established. prominent ex-servicemen who has done a great job for Legacy and similar organizations. The chairman, Major-General Wootten, has had vast military experience -and understands the difficulties of ex-servicemen. All the members of the boards are men of proved understanding of the difliculties of ex-servicemen. Every meniber of the staff, with the exception of the most junior members, is an ex-serviceman who knows what war is and what wounds entail. I am certain that the whole Repatriation Commission staff, whether they be members of -the boards in the States, the Entitlement Appeal Tribunals, the Assessment Appeals Tribunal or the administrative staff, are there because of their qualifications and their known sympathy with the problems of ex-servicemen. At appeals to entitlement tribunals returned servicemen's organizations are entitled to have advocates present to assist in presenting the case for the ex-serviceman concerned. That system has been approved by all governments. Every possible opportunity is given to soldiers to ensure that if they have a legitimate claim they will he entitled to a pension and also to hospitalization, if necessary. In order to do justice to the commission I wish to indicate clearly the nature of the instructions that have been issued. We must ensure that all sections of the Parliament will have an opportunity to improve and amend this important, legislation, and I hope that the measure will overcome the difficiilties of ex-servieemen. The application of Mr Francis. section 47 of the Repatriation Act is a matter to which the attention of all repatriation boards, the members of the Repatriation Commission, and the assistant commissioners, has been directed from time to time, and all are fully aware of its contents. They apply the provisions of the section in the manner set out in the act itself. The High Court, in the case of cx parte Bott, has given a judicial interpretation of that"" section. Although that decision was given in 1943 before section 47 was amended to .its present form, there has been no change in the onus of proof in an appeal to a tribunal. The act provides not that He is a a determining authority shall deal either generously or ungenerously with a claim, but that it shall draw from all the circumstances of the case, from the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant and shall give to the claimant the benefit of any doubt. The oflieers always act in accordance with the provisions of the act. ter's interpretation of the act is not correct. clearly before honourable members the nature bf the instructions given to officers, so that they shall know how the Repatriation Department works, and what it is doing to carry out the intention and the spirit of section 47 of the Repatriation Act. The act requires that the claimant be given substantial justice. Shorn of its technical language, the section lays it down that when a determining authority is in doubt and cannot make up its mind whether a claim should be allowed or refused, the claim shall succeed. The actual composition of the various boards and tribunals ensures that the ex-serviceman's view is fully represented, and that full effect is given to these provisions. The act provides for one member of each repatriation board to be appointed from a list of names submitted by ex-servicemen's organizations. In fact, all the members of the State boards are ex-servicemen. With regard to the entitlement appeal tribunals, the act requires that the two members other than the chairman shall be ex-servicemen, and",20,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of
61,Dr. Evatt.:,I believe that the Minis,21,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of
62,,"Mr Francis I desire to putthat one at least of them shall he a returned soldier selected from a list submitted by ex-servicemen's organizations. The act requires the chairman to be a qualified barrister or solicitor, and, in fact, all chairmen are ex-servicemen. Barristers and solicitors were chosen as chairmen of these bodies because they are the people who are skilled in collating and interpreting the evidence submitted by applicants. In the case of the assessment appeal tribunals, the act requires that the chairman be a qualified barrister or solicitor and that he be selected from a list of returned soldiers submitted by ex-servicemen's organizations. The other two members are required to be medical practitioners, and where possible selections are made from ex-servicemen. In this way the majority on the board or tribunal, as the case may he, represents the ex-serviceman's view, and in the case of each tribunal the requirement that the chairman have, a legal training, makes certain that all evidence before the tribunal will be given proper weight, and that the benefit of the doubt provisions will be given full effect. I have made these observations to indicate that the Repatriation Department is mainly staffed by ex-servicemen who have been especially selected to carry out the spirit and intention of the act. The members of all the tribunals, and the officers assoGroup. Quite a number of those men ciated with them, are ex-servicemen. I have indicated to the House the nature of the instructions that have been issued to the department to ensure that not only will the legislation be applied as to its meaning, but also as to its spirit. These provisions have been under review by the all-party committee of ex-servicemen. The department is doing all that is liumanly possible to observe the spirit of the legislation. That is made clear by the instructions that are issued. I have provided the Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the instructions, and I think he will agree that they are adequate to ensure that any ex-serviceman, who has a reasonable claim for a pension or for hospital treatment shall receive his ful l entitlement. I shall direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) to the points that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. If it is possible to do anything further to ensure that ex-servicemen shall be given their full rights, that will be done. is one phase of the disability allowance table contained in the fifth schedule which I believe to be unfair to pick-andshovel workers, including miners. I refer to the allowances that are payable in respect of a leg amputated below the knee, and an arm amputated below the elbow. The allowance in each case is fixed at 15s. a fortnight. I point out that a pick-and-shovel worker who suffers either of those amputations is virtually totally and permanently incapacitated. He is certainly prevented from carrying on the occupation he followed before his war service. I hope that the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) will give due consideration to this matter because he has coal miners iu his own electorate. Obviously, a miner or, in fact, any pick-and-shovel worker, who has had an arm amputated below the elbow or a leg amputated-below the knee -can no longer handle a pick and shovel. The onus of proof provisions apply in respect of these men just as they do in respect of men who were gassed in World WarI . I remind the Minister that three Australian mining battalions were formed during World WarI . They were known as the First, Second and Third Mining were badly gassed. They included my brother, who would never attempt to prove his claim. He coughed himself to death. Honourable members will have heard also of the late Major Connell, a former member of the Legislative Council in New South Wales. He was well known throughout Australia as a good soldier. As a member of the State Parliament, he assisted many ex-servicemen who applied for pensions because of disability caused by gas, but he did not claim one for himself. He explained his neglect by saying to me, ""What is the use, Rowley? I am getting a parliamentary salary, and I have no need of a pension "". I warned him that, in the event of his death, the Repatriation Department would contend that, as he had never claimed a pension, he had not suffered from any",21,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of
63,Mr James (Hunter) [11.31],"Ther ewar disabilities and, therefore, that his wife and other dependants would not be entitled to any benefit. He said he would consider my suggestion that he should claim a pension but, nevertheless, he died without having lodged an application. brother came to me and told me of his death when I was addressing a meeting at Adamstown. I adjourned the meeting out of respect for his memory and obtained permission to see the doctor who attended him. I told the doctor the story unfair. The rate of benefit should vary that I am now telling to the committee, and said that I believed that Hugh Connell had suffered from the effects of poison gas. The doctor, I am glad to say, provided a medical certificate that enabled the widow to obtain a full pension. There are thousands of men in Australia who, like Hugh Connell, have never claimed war pensions, although they are entitled to do so. I have a; third case in mind. This is the case of a man who rose to the rank of lieutenant in World War I. He is suffering from a very bad heart condition that is due to his war service. He was badly wounded during the war, but he has applied for a pension without success. His application is still being considered. should receive more, than a miserly allowBecause of his physical disabilities, he has obtained an invalid pension, but the fact is that he has been incapacitated by injuries that he sustained as a soldier. I have written on his behalf to tbe Repatjustice. riation Department, although I have not referred the matter to the Minister. He lives at Belmont, but I do not wish to name him here. I ask the Minister for the Army to consider the case of this man who is now 60 years of age. He receives a small miner's pension, which is a contributory benefit in the nature of superannuation rather than a 'pension. Because he receives the invalid pension, he is not entitled to the tion of an occasion when I was in opposifull rate of miner's pension. In New South Wales, the age pension and the invalid pension are taken into account when the eligibility of an applicant for a ex-servicemen, were of the opinion that miner's pension is assessed, but war penthe onus of proof dn relation to any sions are not taken into account. Therefore, if this man were awarded a war pension, to which he is entitled, he would Repatriation Commission, not upon the be able to draw the full amount of the ifr. James. miner's pension. He would, of course, forgo the invalid pension. I ask the Minister to give consideration to this case and to the situation of men who have lost limbs. I emphasize the fact that the degree of disability caused His by the loss of a limb depends on the nature of the civil occupation of the victim. A clerk, or a member of parliament, would receive the same compensation for the loss of an arm or a leg as would be awarded to a manual worker. That is in accordance with the degree of occupational disability. Therefore, consideration should be given to the job that a claimant held prior to enlistment, with a view to providing him with income equivalent to the amount that he was able to earn before his war injury. Surely nobody would deny that it is unjust to award the same allowance to a clerk who has lost a limb as to a manual worker who has lost a limb. A clerk with one arm may he able to perform his usual work without loss of efficiency, hut that is not true of a labourer. A clerk who had lost two arms would probably have the same degree of disability as that of a worker who had lost only one arm. Such men ance of 15s. a fortnight. Their situation ia tragic, and I trust that the Minister will give earnest attention to my representations and decide to treat them with -Vice-President of the Executive Coun-' oil and Minister for Defence Production) [11.41] I enter the discussion on this clause because it refers to one of the most controversial provisions ever included in our repatriation legislation. I think that the committee should be made fully aware of the earlier history of this provision, because I have a lively recollection and a Labour government was in office. Members of the Parliament at that time, particularly those who were claim for benefit under the repatriation legislation should devolve upon the applicant. They were greatly concerned",22,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of
64,Mr Eric J. Harrison (Wentworth,"when they learned that, although that view coincided with the accepted legal opinion, to which I shall refer later, the .Minister for Eepatriation at that time and the commission rejected it. Thc Minister was so incensed with certain action that was taken by one of the war pensions entitlement appeal tribunals, to which applicants for pensions may appeal against decisions of the commission, that he sought to intimidate it. These tribunals, as government instrumentalities, are required to make reports to the Parliament. The No. 1 tribunal decided to expose the conduct of the Minister and the commission in over-riding the legal opinion given by the then Attorney-General, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), that onus of proof rested upon the commission. It dealt with the matter in its statutory report and declared that the law was not heing properly administered by the Minister for Repatriation. The matter was of such vital importance that the Minister tried to force the tribunal to withdraw its report and alter it. He told it that the report would vitally affect his political future and that, if it refused to withdraw the report, he would take certain action. ""When the tribunal refused to yield to his demand, he peremptorily dismissed the members. The chairman was Mr O'Sullivan, a responsible man of high repute and great integrity, who had rendered noble service to the cause of ex-servicemen. The then Minister for Eepatriation, Mr Barnard, deliberately dismissed the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal, because it refused to accept from him a direction that was contrary to the expressed opinion of the Attorney-General of the day. That gives an indication of the importance of this section to ex-servicemen. I believed that the opinion given by the Attorney General of the day at that time was correct, and I disagreed entirely with the action taken by the then Minister for Repatriation and with the commission's interpretation of the position. In order to bring the record up to date, I shall read the following brief passages from the report of the No. 1 tribunal:A t the present time inefficiency persists through every stage in the handling of pensions to prevent ex-servicemen from obtaining claims even up to the appeals of this tribunal. The tribunal recommendedThat a general inquiry into the administration of the Bepatriation Act, including au investigation into the matter raised in the report, be conducted by a competent authority having no association with the Repatriation Department. Those were fighting provisions in any statutory report. They were a damning condemnation of the then Minister for Repatriation. Mr Hickey, a member of the No. 1 Tribunal, informed me that it had been dismissed peremptorily by the then Minister for Repatriation. Mr Hickey, who was the nominee of the Government on that body, wrote to me as follows:The simple fact is that the whole tribunal resisted political pressure placed upon it . It persisted for years in trying to have justice done to ex-servicemen, and in the process demanded that the Repatriation Department, now become an entrenched and powerful bureaucracy, not only carry out the law of the land, confirmed by the Attorney-General, but also improve its grossly inefficient methods. In doing its duty it antagonized successive Ministers of Repatriation. In the case of Mr Barnard, as I shall show later, it resisted political pressure placed upon it in connection with its parliamentary report and persisted in reporting the facts to the Parliament. Finally, having battled for years, the Chairman resigned in disgust last February. It is in t e r e s t in g to l e a r n w h y the t h e n M in is t e r for R e p a t r i a t i o n got r i d of the tribunal, Mr Hickey wroteI n my opinion he sacked the tribunal because the tribunal refused to be intimidated by h i m ; because the tribunal refused to be intimidated by one of the parties to its appeal, the Repatriation Commission; because the tribunal insisted that the Repatriation Commission should obey tlie law of the land, and finally, because the tribunal persistently reported the facts to the Parliament, originally against pressure placed upon it by Mr. Barnard. I regarded this interpretation of the law as sound, and ex-servicemen's organizations accepted it as such. I emphasize that the chairman and one member of the tribunal were nominees of the Government, and that the other member was selected from a panel of names supplied by ex-servicemen's organizations. Because the tribunal sought to give effect to the law, a Labour Minister for Bepatriation deliberately dismissed it in order tlieir just dues. Mr Hickey's letter continuedMr Barnard said that he had been embarrassed by actions of the Tribunal. I said a Tribunal's job had legal and moral obligations, regardless of who was embarrassed and asked what action he meant. I said . . . The Tribunal for years had tried both with Mr Frost. . . and the Repatriation Commission and himself to have rectified what was a scandalous position, and had made no headway. It was, therefore, bound to report the whole matt -r to Parliament. The fact that it embarrassed him, the Minister, who also appointed the Tribunal, could not be helped . . . The Minister said that towards the end of Mr O'SuIlivan's term of oflice . . . Mr Frost was a former Ministerf o r Repatriation. Mr O'Sullivan was chairman of the tribunal. . . . he, O'Sullivan, had seen fit to write a spiteful letter to the Repatriation Commission upon tiie question of the ""Onus of Proof"". I said that the letter in question was from the Tribunal, was entirely objective and set out the true position in law and fact. I said I was astonished that the Tribunal, which was only carrying out thc law., and trying to stop injustices to ex-servicereflect the spirit of the act. men, had been met not only with non-co-operation, but also with active resistance. Ee said he thought the Tribunal had been indiscreet. I said one important aspect of the law was being broken in defiance even of Dr. Evatt's direction. I could continue in this vein, but I do not consider that there is any necessity for me to do so. However, I invite Opposition remainder of my speech on this matter, which is reported in Hansard on the 28th October, 1948, in ordter to ascertain exactly to what lengths a Labour government w ill go to deny justice to ex-servicemen. This has not happened under any other Administration. The action to whioh I referred was taken by a Labour Minister for Repatriation in defiance of the expressed opinion of the Attorney General of the day. Members of the Labour party who t r y to conceal their previous actions behind a smoke-screen should examine the record of the preceding Labour Government in respect of its treatment of ex-servicemen. I give due credit to the Leader of the Opposition, because he has indicated that he adheres to the opinion that he expressed on this matter a few years ago. The DEPUTY The Vice-President Council has exhausted his time. Mr Erio J. Harrison. Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) has injected into the debate some of the comments he made during a fight that has long since concluded. Whether or not the facts stated by h i m are proven has little to do with the case to-day. The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) was consistent w i th the interpretation that he gave in 1943 of the provision relating to the onus of proof. The fact that a former Minister for Repatriation had a quarrel with the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal has nothing to do with the case now under consideration. I think tliat we should return to the matter before the Chair. In my opinion, bureaucracy has not yet "" caught up "" with the interpretation of the Repatriation Act 1947. Even the instruction which the Ministerf o r the Army( Mr Francis) has read does not The phraseology of the relevant sections dealing with the onus of proof is most interesting, because provision is made therein for the benefit of the doubt to be given to the claimant. Section 47 (2.) providesI t shall not be necessary for the claimant, members to read the applicant or appellant to furnish proof to support his claim, application or appeal, but thc . . . Tribunal. . . determining or deciding the claim . . . shall be entitled to draw, and shall draw, from all the circumstances of the case, from the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant . . . and in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim . . . should not be granted . . . Another provision in favour of the claimant is section 48 (2.) , which readsWhere a medical practitioner entertains any doubt concerning any of the matters which . . . he is required to report upon, he shall state in his report that he entertains such a doubt and shall indicate, as far as practicable, the nature and extent of his doubt. Not one provision, but half a dozen provisions urge those who administer the act to be certain that the onus of proof shall not be placed upon the person who of the Executive The Minister for the Army said that the act does not require the determining",23,Chaieman Mr Effect Given To That Intention In Cases Of
65,Mr Hayl En (Parkes) [11.52],"Th eauthority to deal either generously or ungenerously with a claim. In my opinion, such an attitude is completely wrong. The act does not enjoin the determining authority to be completely impartial. Any doubt that may exist shall be resolved in favour of the claimant. The instruction relating to the manner in which section 48 is to he administered conflicts with the provisions of that action. It is not a question house "" and haye presented their appeals, of a determining authority exercising generosity, but of going to the utmost ends of investigation to ensure that the ex-serviceman's claim shall not be damaged because the onus of proof provision has been used against him. The act leans over, as it were, to the side of the ex-serviceman. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the act, in indicating beins; properly administered. how this treatment is to be meted out to the ex-servicemen, is unique in the British Empire. Its provisions are extremely generous. The Minister's reference to the fact that the act does not require a determining authority to deal either generously or ungenerously with a claim is a complete negation of the principles of section 48. The bureaucracy is not interpreting the section as it was intended to apply to ex-servicemen. I leave that point to refer now to the appeal tribunals. I wonder what can be done to improve their efficiency. Notwithstanding the fact that sincerity should be the keynote in all cases and that the most exhaustive inquiries should be conducted, piles of complaints are made, particularly by ageing ex-servicemen, that they are unable to obtain justice. I sometimes think that these complaints result from the fact, not that the tribunals have not the will to do justice, but because their administrative techniques contain the element of injustice. In my experience doctors of high degree and of great experience, whose services would cost many guineas an hour, spend days in the preparation of evidence and its presentation to an appeal tribunal, only to be told in half an hour that the evidence is neither substantial nor material. The only way to overcome that difficulty is to make provision for the appointment of experts to the tribunals. The evidence should be presented and tested by legally trained men. The services of laymen advocates are not good enough. As the Leader of the Opposition said, this is a matter that should be considered by the Attorney-General (Senator Spicer). Perhaps the trained staffs of the Legal Service Bureau oould undertake the work. I believe that most of the disaffection that exists among ex-servicemen, after they have attended what they describe as ""heartbreak is based upon their feeling that the evidence has not been properly tested and sifted, and that too often their appeals are not viewed in the right perspective. How otherwise would the evidence of expert witnesses be treated in such a cavalier fashion? Ex-servicemen believe that the provisions of section 48 are not The machinery appears to break down only at the bureaucratic level. The onus of proof provision should be more strictly interpreted. The spirit that is manifested in every word of the legislation suggests the tempering of justice with mercy, with emphasis on the side of mercy. This matter has always been one of difficulty and has been the subject of lengthy and frequent debate. I reiterate the two points that I have made. First, the interpretation of sections 47 and 48 read by the Minister is not completely sound; and, secondly, the presentation of evidence and the resolution of appeals would be considerably improved if provision were made for applicants to have legal representation before the tribunals. As time goes on the determination of these cases will become increasingly difficult. The span of time covered hy them already runs up to 30 years, and many concern ex-servicemen who until now have not made a claim against the authorities. The illnesses from which they suffer are not shown on their records. Their cases must be judged on the basis of their honesty, their military record, and the hundred and one other small factors that prove the genuineness of their claims. The cases should be considered not by patriotic laymen but by experts who are able to sift and evaluate the evidence. practice not adopted when the Labour",25,Chairman Order Seeks A Pension Or The Redress Of A Claim

Harrison), because there was no merit in it. If the Minister believes that by quoting his own speech he submits evidence, I can only say that I found it very boring. The Minister's interjection was inspired by political bias and demonstrates the smallness of his mind. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! '.rhe honourable member's time has expired. the Army) [12.2] I wish at this stage to propose an amendment so that it may be considered in conjunction with the bill. I move That clause 23 be left out. with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following clause:or nothing. If , as Minister for the Navy, '' 23. Pensions at the rates payable under tin; Principal Act, as amended by this Act, iiro payable from and including the second rlny of October, One thousand nine hundred and lii'ty-two."". The object of the amendment is to enable increased pensions to be paid to ex-service rncn and women as soon as possible after the passage of this legislation which, I hope, will take place within the next IV-w minutes. [12.3] I should not have taken part in tliis debate had not attention been focused on the important onus of proof provision. The Parliament, by legislation, may define all sorts of matters in relation to ex-service men and women but it cannot decide whether ill health suffered by an ex-service man or woman results from war causes or otherwise. The decision of such matters must be left to the competent authorities. The Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) in replying to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said, in effect, that when a determining authority cannot decide whether or not nn application for a wrr pension should be granted, the benefit of the douht should he extended to the applicant. I recall how jubilant the former member for Hindmarsh, Mr Makin, was when, in 1943, he succeeded in his efforts to have an amendment inserted in the legislation which relieved I rose to make some an applicant for a war pension of the onus of proving that his ill health had been caused through war service. As a member of the South Australian Parliament, I worked with Mr Makin on this matter for very many years, and I was well aware of the difficulties experienced by an ex-serviceman in proving that an illness was attributable to war service. The department should prove that it could not have been caused by war service. ber has taken a long time to think about it. enough common sense to listen to what I have to say without seeking to make political party capital out of a subject about which he apparently knows little the honourable member poses as a man of intelligence, as one would expect him to be, I appeal to him to exercise a little common sense and not to make interjections which brand him as a dunderhead. In 1943, when the onus of proof provision was amended, I said that its interpretation would not. be as easy as it appeared to be. Although the onus of proof was placed on the Repatriation Department, I believed that an applicant could not escape from it altogether and I thought that it would be difficult to interpret. I am still concerned with the question of interpretation. My own son joined the Royal Australian Air Force and afterwards was sent to an American hospital for advice on the treatment of his eyes. When he left the forces, he was unable to get even a pair of glasses from the Repatriation Department because it was claimed that there was nothing to show that his disability was due to war service. I did not go to the Minister or argue the ease, but it indicates the difficulty that ex-servicemen experience in getting the benefit of this provision. Honorahle members have knowledge of many ex-servicemen who have died suddenly from heart trouble or some other illness. When",26,Chairman Order Seeks A Pension Or The Redress Of A Claim

It should not be necessary for ex-servicemen to prove that a disability was caused by war service. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) gave to the House a good interpretation of the provision with regard to onus of proof. I believe that those who are administering the law should take into consideration the opinions of so many honourable members and their experience of this matter. I give full credit to the Eepatriation Department in my State for the liumane way in which its officers approach these matters. When I have been dealing with claims, the officers have First Avenue, St. Peters, whom I have often assisted me to take them further. I have no bone to pick with the Repatriation Department, but the Parliament should emphasize the need for more leniency by those who are administering the Repatriation Department in the interpretation of the clause relating to the onus of proof. the greatest admiration for the individual officers of the Eepatriation Department. However, I have found that some of the decisions of the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals are difficult to understand in view of the declared policy of all parties in this ""Parliament to place the onus on the Repatriation Department of proving that a man's death or illness was the result of war service. I have before me papers relating to an individual case which I have referred to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper). I am sure that he will do everything possible men, and that they are men of high repute to rectify it. I wish to make reference to it now as evidence of the difficulty that the ordinary person has in understanding some of the decisions of the entitlement appeals tribunals. With the permission of the House, I shall not divulge the name of the deceased ex-serviceman to whom I shall refer, but I have written a letter to the Minister stating the name and he has it before him. The ex-serviceman died last February, and his widow was of the opinion that her husband's death was due to war service. She made an application to the He Repatriation Department for a war widows' pension. She took it to the Eepatriation State Board and finally to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal. Her appeal was rejected. When she interviewed me in June last, she told me that a very eminent medical practitioner in Adelaide, Dr. J. A. Rolland, was prepared to give her a certificate to the effect that, in his opinion, her husband's death was the result of war service. I arranged with her to consult the doctor and obtain his opinion. I have here the doctor's certificate, dated the 7th June, 1952. It statesThis is to certify tliat further to my previous certificate relating to the last illness of . . . attended since 1928, I wish to state that X am firmly of the opinion that his illness was c:iu?cd by the hardship of war service. (Sgd.) J. ALEX ROIXAND, M.B., B.S., D.O. It is difficult to imagine a more definite certificate by a medical practitioner than this one. I therefore arranged for a further appeal to be lodged with the War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal. The reply that I received from the Deputy Commissioner in Adelaide statedReviewed under Section 64 (7). The Commission decided that the further evidence submitted is not material to, nor has it a substantial bearing upon the claim. In other words, the Eepatriation Department has said that a certificate signed by one of the leading medical practitioners in South Australia is not material to and has no substantial bearing upon a claim. I know that members of the entitlement appeals tribunal are returned ex-servicewho are endeavouring to do a job, but there is a feeling that they are not in all respects interpreting the legislation as it has been passed by the Parliament. The War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal has shown disinclination to allow a widow to appear beforeit. It has been claimed that a widow may become distressed by appearing before an appeals tribunal. However. I am convinced that the majority of widows would prefer to express their views before a tribunal. If the claim is-",27,Chairman Order Seeks A Pension Or The Redress Of A Claim

I point out that manipulative therapists and chiropractors utilize modern X-ray equipment, and they perform very useful work in the treatment of disabilities that have been caused by a dislocation of the spine or pressure on the nervous system. Although such a condition might well be attributable to war service, after an ex-serviceman has passed on there is no opportunity to establish a claim, because fche spinal cord shrinks after death. In ?uch cases the ends of justice could be defeated by post-mortem examinations. Although an ex-serviceman in a mental institution had suffered from a brain tumour, a study of his nervous system or spinal cord after death may not reveal the real cause of that condition. purely technical provisions designed to ensure uniformity of Commonwealth and State legislation.

I am convinced that the provision of manipulative therapy in repatriation hospitals would assist many sufferers. I have before me an extract from Stark Corridors by C.

83,Mr Treloar (Gwydir) [12.281,"Army( Mr Francis) of the onus-of-proof provisions. I have a long experience of repatriation matters. It extends back to 1918, when I was secretary of the Tamworth branch of the returned servicemen's league. The principal difficulties in repatriation cases after World WarI . were caused by the fact that the onus of proof was on the ex-serviceman. Since that provision has been altered, I have experienced no difficulties at all. I do not say that there are not difficulties, but I have not experienced any. I resented the statement of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) about the bureaucrats in the Repatriation Department. If all bureaucrats are like the officers of that department, I have a great admiration for bureaucrats. Repatriation Department officials are all returned soldiers. WheneverI have visited a repatriation office, provided that has expressed a wish against such an I have received the necessary authority from the ex-serviceman concerned, they have always put the relevant file in front of me and have explained the exact position of the man's claim. They haye always been eager and willing to explain the appeals procedure, and I have not yet failed in an appeal. Members of the Opposition have talked about many cases that have been brought to their notice which they have not been able to deal with satisfactorily. I think that much of the trouble that they have experienced is due to their lack of knowledge. They do not know how to handle these cases. There are many honourable members on this side of the chamber who would he very pleased to help them to do so. I suggest to them that, in future, they seek our advice whenever they have a case that they cannot straighten out. We should be delighted to help them, because pur objective is to help returned soldiers everywhere, irrespective of the electorates in which they live. I believe that this measure should be passed without further argument. for the Army) [12.30] I want to make a few brief observations with the object of removing any misunderstandings to which the befogging remarks of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) have given rise. There is nothing base, improper or foul about the provisions that relate to postmortem examinations. The Repatriation Department has a number of hospitals throughout Australia. In all of those hospitals, it is desirable to conduct post-mortem examinations from time to time. The Repatriation Department, in common with all other hospital organizations, has conducted such examinations, but there is some doubt about its legal right to do so. The proposals in clause 16 are designed to remove that doubt. They deal only with a technical point. We have taken precautions to ensure that tender susceptibilities will not be hurt. The clause provides that a. post-mortem examination shall not be undertaken if the deceased person, before his death, examination being undertaken. It provides also that, when no such wish has been expressed, the examination shall not be undertaken unless the consent of the wife, widow, or nearest relative, as the case may be, of the deceased person has been obtained. Any relative will be able to object to a post-mortem examination. Finally, in the clause care has been taken to ensure that nothing shall be done that would interfere with the rights of State authorities to conduct such an examination, or impede in any way a coroner's inquiry when one was necessary. I hope that I have relieved the honourable member for Reid of his anxiety in this connection, and that I have convinced the committee that this measure is designed to improve the lot of ex-servicemen and their dependants. Careful consideration will be given to all the points that have been raised in the debate. I shall invite the Minister for Repatriation and the Repatriation Commission to examine the cases that some honourable members have raised. I know that some of those cases go back almost to the beginning of federation. I have heard them mentioned again and again in this chamber. They are hardy annuals which provide the foundation for a speech on a repatriation measure.",30,Chairman Order Seeks A Pension Or The Redress Of A Claim

The Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes), who introduced the hill, did not say half as much in his second-reading speech about this bill as his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), who introduced a similar measure last year, had to say on that occasion. The bill seeks to authorize the raising of moneys to be advanced to the States for the purposes of housing in connection with the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement of 1945. That agreement has a life of ten years, and so far this Government has continued to provide each year since it came into office, for the advance of the sums of money in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Whilst the agreement may meet with with the approval of all honourable members on the Government benches. Last year, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), in a debate on the similar measure to which I have already referred, used the following words:In my considered opinion the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is an insidious national tragedy which was conceived by the Chifley Labour Government, and was intended to be the basis of the socialist state of Australia. If the honourable member for Bennelong was correct in making that statement this Government is building on that socialist basis, which was allegedly established by the Chifley Government In 1944, that Government appointed a commission of which the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), who was then a member of the South Australian Parliament, was a member. That commission examined the housing position in Australia at that time, and recommended that an agreement be made with the States so that the governments of the Commonwealth and the States could share the responsibility of providing homes for the people. Private enterprise had fallen down on the job. In vestors were investing their money in other industries that were returning much bigger profits than could be expected from investments in house-building.

The honourable member for Bennelong, who seemed to express in his speech the views of the more conservative supporters of the Government, was quite uninhibited in liis condemnation of the measure last year. He saidThis Government has the right to give twelve months' notice of its intention to cancel the agreement. I 6Uggest that if it wants to do something worthwhile for the people of Australia it will give notice of cancellation at the earliest possible moment, and will set about reconstructing the whole scheme of housing in Australia on an entirely different basis. The honourable gentleman has apparently always considered that there is something wrong with the agreement. He is opposed to it on ideological grounds. I consider him to be completely wrong.

Of course, the Government w ill say that the money should come from the loan market and from no other source.

According to figures published in the Quarterly Bulletin of Building Statistics for the quarter ended the 31st March last, the number of houses commenced in that quarter was only 18,790. We must go back to the second quarter of 1949-50' to find a period during which the figure w as lower than that. It is true that move houses are being completed noAv, but that is only a temporary phase. Within a few years, very few houses will be built, and the plight of the people then will be worse than it is now. Last year, the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) made what would seem to be almost an anarchistic proposal for a Liberal member. It was certainly revolutionary. This is what the honourable member saidIn order to encourage people to remain in tliuni the basic rate of interest could be made 3 per cent, with a rebate of 1 per cent., if they lived in them for a period of five years, and a u additional rebate of 1 per cent, if they remained in occupation for 10 years. If they remained in them for 12 or more years, the purchase should be made interest free. ff that proposition had been advanced hy a member of the Labour party, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr last twelve months? Wentworth) would have scented Communist influence, or he might have tried to tie the matter up with the Commonwealth Literary Eund. The theme of most Government propaganda over recent years has been the completely discredited story that the Labour Government discouraged home ownership. The story is false, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) has shown on a number of occasions. His most telling point was his reference to what a Labour government did in South Australia in 1925. ment in New South Wales also encouraged the building of homes for purchase as long ago as 1917. The Minister for the Interior has told us that 47,000 houses have been completed under the housing agreement and that, of that number, 9,300 were finished during the last financial year. The performance is not good enough. At the end of the war, it was reported that there was a shortage of at least 300,000 houses. Some honourable members will dispute that figure, but that was the number stated in the report of the commission of invesMr Calwell. ligation of which the honourable member for Port Adelaide was a member. Australia needs, on the figures presented by the former Minister for National Development, who is now the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), a building construction rate of 75,000 houses a year. At least 60,000 marriages take place each year, and allowing also for new arrivals in this country who require homes, the figure of 75,000 houses a year is probably a conservative estimate of our real need. The fact is that we are not building houses at a rate that will enable us to meet current needs and,, at the same time, overtake the backlog.! Between the end of the recent war and the 30th June of last year a total of 525,000 houses should have been built on the basis of an estimated requirement of 75,000 houses a year. However, only approximately 305,000 houses and flats have been constructed by private enterprise and government agencies during that period. * houses that were constructed during the that I have .been able to obtain is in respect of not the calendar year, but. the financial year, and it shows that 67,000 houses were completed in the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1951. That figure represented an increase of 12,000 on the figure for the preceding year, whilst the figure for the year before that was 4,000 fewer. However, 67,000 is still not 75,000. The rate of building is falling rapidly because of rising costs and the increase of the rate of interest The McGowan Labour Governon housing loans. When, the recent war ended there was a backlog of 300,000 houses and the backlog for the post-war period is 225,000 houses. Thus, we are now 525,000 nouses in arrears of requirements. The task of providing adequate housing for the Australian people is a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility. The honourable member for Petrie, when speaking on a similar measure last year, said that it was ridiculous for members of the Opposition to allege that there was a lack of finance for home-building or home purposes. No one can. deny that there i8 a lack",34,Hughes

104,Mr Calwell,"The latest returnof finance for housing at present. The Government's banking policy does not encourage the construction of houses. It is becoming increasingly difficult for private banks to lend money to homeouilders and, whatever the policy of the Commonwealth Bank may be, the real responsibility in the final analysis rests with the Government which could make adequate finance available for this purpose if it desired to do so. It could instruct the private banks to be more generous in respect of loans for the construction of houses than they are, perhaps, in providing financial accommodation for other purposes However, the Government refuses to take such action. The Opposition would like to see the rate of interest on loans for house construction reduced to 2 per cent.; but the Government is encouraging the increase of the interest rate to such a -degree that, ultimately, it will be impossible for any one to obtain finance for the purpose of constructing a house. Government reduce the rate of interest on loans for housing purposes to 2 per cent. ? vernment maintained the rate of interest at 3 per cent.; but it did not increase it to 4£ per cent., as this Government has done.. A rate of 3 per cent, is at least much closer to 2 per cent, than the present ruling rate of interest which is 100 per cent, more than 2 per cent. In many instances in which persons have entered into contracts for the construction of houses, the houses are only half completed. Such persons will have no alternative but to meet the additional costs that will be involved in the completion of those structures. I turn now to the amount of subsidy that has been paid in respect of imported houses and the provision of such houses under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. In view of the statements made Minister( Mr Menzies) last night in GovernmentI thought that his statement was highly flavoured and was not really intended to present the facts impartially addressed n. question on the same matter to-day to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), and I was furnished with the following reply:A t the 30th June, 1952, a total of £1,958,400 had been paid by the Commonwealth for subsidy on houses imported by all State authorities. This represented £300 a house on G.52S houses. A t the 30th June, 1952, 3,009 houses had arrived in Australia from overseas for erection in projects under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. I ask honourable members to mark the words in which the Minister continued his replyFrom the qutset the Commonwealth indicated its willingness to have under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement all houses imported by State Housing authorities that were certified by the Commonwealth Experimental Building Station as structurally sufficient. All houses imported by State authorities have been so certified. Thus, the Minister for National Development has contradicted the statement that the Prime Minister made in this chamber last night. I repeat that the Minister said that all houses imported by State authorities had been certified as being structurally sufficient. Where is the case for the Government's charge that the Queensland Government has fallen down on its job because houses constructed in that State were not up to specification and. their construction had not been properly supervised? were erected at Zillmere imported houses ? at sea. Every one of those houses was imported, hecause the Prime Minister, in the statement that he made last night, referred to the subsidy of £300 that had been paid in respect of each of them. Affairs( Mr Casey), when he was Minister for National Development, was responsible for importing them. by the Prime Minister arranged for the importation of 7,000 prefabricated houses, of which criticism of the Queensland 6,528 have been brought here.

I shall wait with interest to hear what the Queensland Government has to say about not only the Prime Minister's statement, but also the reply that the Minister for National Development has furnished to me, which I have just read and which contradicts the Priine Minister's statement. I move That all words after ""Tliat"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the followme that the contribution of the honourable ing words:-""the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted "". The Opposition is not satisfied that this bill goes far enough. The important responsibility that this Government and every State government has to discharge is to ensure that the Australian people are properly housed. What is now being done is still not good enough. We are falling behind in the struggle to provide adequate housing for our people. 'I'hat is why we have so many of what are euphemistically described as emergency housing centres. Any one who has visited such centres is aware of the disgraceful conditions under which those who reside in them are obliged to live. Some of those j-ersons may not be a3 satisfactory as they might be from the point of view of good citizenship. human heing3 and their wives and children are entitled to a fair deal. I do not think that the Government will withdraw the bill or adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bennelong that it should reduce the rate of interest on housing loans and use the national credit in order to finance housing programmes, or the suggestion that was made by the honourable member for Petrie that purchasers of houses erected under the Oommonwealth and State Housing Agreement should be relieved of the obligation to pay any interest whatever after they have occupied a house for twelve years. Nevertheless, the Government must achieve better results in this matter than it is achieving at present. Finally, I ask that, if the Minister b'lilt instead houses of a different kind its cannot expand the Government's house action is absolutely dishonest. construction policy he should at least such a thing were done by a private Ur. Galtcell. endeavour to lower the interest rate on finance for house construction, so that people may be encouraged to build and to own their own homes. People who live in houses constructed under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement should be given the opportunity to own their own homes and thus acquire a stake in the community. first, to refer to the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in regard to the housing centre at Zillmere. It seemed to member to-day was a damp squib compared with the fiery way in which he came to the defence of the Queensland Government against the charges that were made against it in the House last night.

The honourable member has endeavoured to transfer to the shoulders of the Australian Government, blame for the failure of the housing scheme at Zillmere. He Nevertheless, they are has stated that every one of those houses was approved by the Commonwealth Experimental Building Station. I suggest that the honourable member should read the statement which was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last evening. Last week, officers of the Department of National Development made an investigation to determine whether the Queensland Government has abided by the specifications which were approved by the station. It is firmly believed that the Queensland Government has departed, to a great degree, from the specifications approved by the Commonwealth.

I am most anxious that the royal commission should not be appointed by the Queensland Government because royal commissions in Queensland liave become notorious. When the terms of reference of such commissions have been drawn up, care has been taken to ensure that anything which might embarrass the State Government or its in strumentalities will not be revealed. This is accomplished by narrowing the terms of reference accordingly. I am, therefore, most eager that the royal commission which I believe should inquire into this matter be appointed by the Australian Government, and that its terms of reference should be as wide as possible. Last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition challenged me to table a letter which I had written to the Queensland Housing Commissioner, but you, Mr Speaker, would not permit me to do so. However, with the concurrence of honourable members, I shall incorporate it in Hansard. It is as follows:18th September, 1952. Mr H. X. Galvin, Commissioner, Queensland Housing Commission, State Government Buildings, ANZAC Square, Brisbane. Dear Mr Galvin, In compliance with your request, I herewith furnish the allegations made by me in .regard to the Zillmere Housing Project. Throughout the project the side lap on the corrugated fibro sheeting used in roofing the houses is only 1"" to l i "" . In the old Chermside of the shoddy and faulty workmanship rectiCamp Area, I understand, there was an experimental liouse erected, the roofing of which was fixed with l i corrugation overlap. A great number of houses in the area have reported leaking roofs which could possibly be caused by the shortness of the overlap used at Zillmere. The tenants maintain that in quite a number of cases when leaking roofs have been repaired it is not uncommon for leaks to break out again on the occasion of thc next rain. It is further maintained by them that when rain is driven in different directions according to the wind, leaks occur in the various parts of the roof. I have personally seen the drainage system pruvided in the area and consider it unsuitable. From one of the sumps in the area I took a bottle of water which was found to be full of mosquito larvae. I have been in several houses which are I shall deal with that almost structurally completed but as yet unpainted in which the walls are out of plumb, the floors uneven and the stumps not level. Many of the tenants complain that the windows in tlieir homes are stuck and can be opened and closed only with the greatest difficulty. All the T.14 type homes which I have inspected have the bearers cut through to allow the waste from the bath to be emptied, and in some instances I have noted thai bearers and joists have been cut through. I have actually seen a bearer which had been cut through propped up with a piece of timber that was not even embedded in the ground. I have seen dry rot on the exterior walls of homes and I have seen walls that were out of plumb. ln almost every house I visited which was tenanted I found the ceilings were cracked. Many of the tenants allege that they have been waiting for periods up to almost twelve months for repairs to be effected to these ceilings, ln other cases where ceilings have been replaced, these have not been painted. In one instance the tenant informed me that <:arppnters came to replace the ceilings which wencracked and discovered that the ceiling joists were seriously affected by dry rot; although admitting tliis, new ceilings were affixed to these same joists and no indication was given that they were to be replaced. The new ceiling has now cracked. Many allegations have been made to me by competent carpenters and tradesmen to the effect that much of the workmanship is of a very inferior standard and much of the material used in the construction should have been rejected. From my own observation as a layman, tlieir contentions appear to be based on sound premises. I have in my possession letters from responsible citizens who are ex-employees of the Queensland Housing Commission and Lecorche Bros, and Schroth, in which it is alleged that they were unable to have much fied and faulty materials replaced, hythe action of either your Administrative Staff or by thc instructions of the Works Supervisor employed by the contractors. It was also maintained that should au Inspector consistently demand that his requests be complied with, he was transferred from the Project to another position or dismissed from the service of the Commission; also that many complaints made by your Inspectors were ignored by the Administrative Staff and to tlieir knowledge have never been rectified.",37,Hughes
116,Mr Ward,Wer e not they prefabri,38,Hughes
117,Mr Wight,"It has also been alleged that some of your technical officers are without sufficient experience to qualify them for their positions. It was further maintained that the specifistated that the method of house drainage cation endorsed by the Commonwealth had not been rigidly adhered to. Many of the studs did not answer to the required lengths and, in order to obtain an evenness of construction, had to be cut. It was maintained that the majority of the workers were not Australian-that the work of the Australian workmen was satisfactory but that the work of the majority of the tradesmen from Overseas indicated that they were not tradesmen, yet had been admitted »nd accepted by the Trades Union and were employed on the Project. Orders given by Inspectors to rectify bad workmanship or faulty or inferior timber were "" rebuked"" and dry rot, if not of considerable proportion, had to be covered and scaled as quickly as (possible. It was further alleged that the paint used in the painting of these homes was of an inferior quality containing a high proportion of lime. In regard to tlie quality of the paint, my personal observation has suggested that tliere is definitely ground for the complaint that the paint is of an inferior quality. I believe this is confirmed by the number of houses which have required repainting so soon after their completion. 1 have personally seen stumps which have been built up by pieces of fibro cement so as to make them meetthe bearer. I have been informed by a most reliable source that the Queensland Forestry Department endeavoured to prevent the use of certain timber but was unsuccessful. Bathroom walls are not properly sealed from the flooring, thus allowing seepage of water through to the framework. A. tenant also informed me that a City Council Health Inspector had condemned the drainage system but a higher authority had negatived every approach, he had made to have thu matter rectified. I trust the information contained herein is in accordance with your requirements. Yours sincerely, (BRUCE WIGHT.) P.S I have surmised that the word -rebuked "" quoted above, and which was used in the letter which I received, actually was meant to be "" revoked"". For the sake of accuracy, however, I have quoted thc word used by my correspondent. BeforeI deal with the irregularities of the administration and construction of the housing scheme at Zillmere, I wish to refer to two statements which have been made by responsible members of the Queensland Government concerning the health menace Mr Wight. that exists in the Zillmere area. TheQueensland Ministerf or Housing has adopted at Zillmere is not considered to be a health menace. In his opinion, the only health menace comes from the tenants themselves. I maintain that the Queensland Government and not the tenants of Zillmere, has caused a serious menace to public health. In Ooxen-street, Zillmere, workmen's barracks have been erected. Immediately adjacent to those barracks is a public lavatory. There is no septic system, in the area, so that the sewage is drained from the lavatory into a cesspit which has been dug at the side of Coxenstreet. This is contrary to Queensland health law3, particularly to regulation 24, which deals w it h sanitary conveniences and the disposal of nightsoil and f u r tlier, which accurately defines cesspits and prohibits their construction. That is not the worse feature of this matter. Every week-end this sewage is pumped from the cesspit into a large tank, which is mounted on the back of a semi-trailer. The sewage is then transported to another street in the housing area, to a point which is surrounded by house.? and there, this sewage is emptied into the gutter in that street. I have in my possession a photograph of that process, taken by a photographer employed by the Brisbane Courier-Mail. It shows the cesspit, the pump mounted on top of the cesspit, the hose connected to the tank, and tlie pumping operation in progress. The sewage when emptied runs from the gutter into an open canal which has been dug between 150 and 200 yards long along the side of Handford-road, the main thoroughfare which connects Zillmere and Sandgate. The canal does not empty anywhere. A f t e r running immediately adjacent to the main highway for approximately 150 yards, it turns to the right, goes under a fence, and comes to an end. The sewage lies 2 f t . 6 in . to 3 feet deep, stinking in the Queensland summer sun. If the Queensland Ministerf or Health considers that that is not a health menace, I suggest that he is not f it to be a Minister of the Crown or a member of any Australian parliament. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall table in. the Library for all honorahle members to see, the photograph to which I have referred. be put there. King's Hall? honourable member for Watson( Mr and had examined by the Commonwealth Curtin) does not maintain silence he may find himself in King's Hall. with the Queensland Housing Commission on this disgusting practice. I was informed by the Queensland Housing Commissioner that originally Hunter Brothers Limited, who are the sanitary contractors to ' the Brisbane City Council, took away this sewage in pans at a cost of approximately £58 a month. Because the cost was considered too great, the commission decided on this new method of disposing of the sewage. The commissioner informed me that it was being done with the approval of the Brisbane City Council. I maintain that the Brisbane City Council has no authority to allow the Queensland Government to break health laws which that Government has passed, and which are still in operation. The only method of household drainage provided at Zillmere is that the household waste empties into sumps which have been constructed in the backyards of the houses. The settlement has been built on what was once fertile and profitable farm land. Yet, not far from it may be found any amount of land that is not productive at all, and which could have been resumed for this settlement. Thus, with a little forethought, the houses could have been built without detriment to primary production, particularly food production. The soil upon which these houses are now built is most unsuitable for the particular type of drainage that has been installed. The type of sump used has been proved hy authorities to be very effective, but it is effective only in a very different type of soil. It is useless in this type of land, because even before many of the houses have been tenanted seepage through the soil has filled the sumps. Consequently, after a house has been tenanted and the housewife washes the child's diapers, and empties washing-up water and bath water which must flow into the sump, the sump overflows into the yard. The consequence of that is that many of the yards at this the housing settlement are veritable morasses. I have here a sample of sullage that I took from the yard of one of the houses, Department of Health. A disadvantage suffered by the people I recently joined issue at this housing settlement is that they havfi had to build duckboard walks between their houses and their earth closets because their backyards are so full of filthy, slimy mud and slush caused by the overflow from the sump. I took a sample of water from these sumps, and if honourable members care to examine it they will see that the water is ful l of mosquito larvae. Indeed, some dead mosquitoes which have hatched out since I took the sample may be seen in the water. I have received a report about this water from a prominent Queensland health authority. Because these mosquitoes are breeding in sumps that were built by the Queensland Government, that Government has contravened section 77, sub-section 2 of the Queensland Health Act, which deals with mosquito prevention and destruction, and it has also contravened section 4 of the regulations published in the Queensland Governmeni Gazette of the 14th April, 1942. The Queensland Government is responsible for the menace to health that has occurred through the breeding of mosquitoes in these sumps. The health authorities to whom I referred this sample of waterstated that mosquitoes carrying the microorganisms that cause dengue fever could easily cause an epidemic of the fever in thi.s area. Malaria also cannot be disregarded as it too could assume epidemic proportions. If such an epidemic should occur, it would be a direct result of theQueensland Government not providing for the proper draining of this area. Much of the household waste water that goes into these sumps contains human excreta from the washing of the diapers of the children, and it also contains putrefying particles of",38,Hughes

During recent summers in Queensland there have been continual epidemics of gastroenteritis, which have assumed such serious proportions that they have caused a considerable number of infant deaths. The Queensland Government, by continuing to allow these bad drainage conditions to exist, is threatening the health of every child and adult within the area of the housing settlement. One woman who lives in the settlement informed me that when she had lived previously in the Kalinga housing .camp her family had suffered no illness at all. Since she and her family had moved to Zillmere she, her husband and her children, had suffered successive attacks of. dysentery. The health authority with whom I conferred informed me that not only was gastroenteritis and diarrhoea to be expected because of these conditions, but also real dysentery of the amoebic and bacillary types could also be expected. Honourable members will remember that dysentery caused a great number of deaths during the 1914-18 war. I suggest that this indictment of the Queensland Minister for Health should make him realize, that he is not only incompetent, but is also unfit to hold his position, particularly in view of the public statements that he has made that no health menace existed at Zillmere. I shall now deal with the prefabricated houses. I have brought with me some samples of the timber being used in prefabricated houses in Queensland. I point out for the benefit of the honourable member for Melbourne that my criticisms are not levelled at the quality of the houses which the firm of Lecorche Brothers and Schroth endeavoured to provide. are levelled at the Queensland Government for its incompetent administration and its inadequate supervision of the construction of these houses. The timber that I have with me to-day arrived in Australia in crates fastened with bands of iron. It was left exposed to the weather for a period of nine months. The Commonwealth officers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture treated the timber as soon as it arrived in Australia, to destroy the syrex wasp, and honourable members may see in the timber, ilr. Wight. which I hope to table in the Library of this building, the holes left by the syrex wasp. agree to the honourable member's suggestion. I shall be happy to allow any honourable member to examine this timber. The Commonwealth authorities treated this timber immediately it arrived in Australia to destroy the wasp. This timber is very absorbent and when exposed to the weather absorbs moisture very freely. .As soon as its moisture content reaches 20 per cent, or more a fungus develops on the timber. That fungus may be seen on the samples that I brought with me. The boards are stuck tightly together and held firmly by this fungus, so that when unpacked, the workmen have to use a pinch-bar to break them apart. After the pinch-bar is used it is found that where the fungus has formed dry rot has started. I have with me two pieces of timber that I broke apart myself and the dry rot in the wood is quite apparent. Frequently when this timber is condemned by inspectors of tha Queensland Government, and when the builders are told to remove it, the instructions are ignored and the timber is concealed by being painted over. In bearers, joists, studs, struts, ceiling joists, and roofing struts of houses that have been tenanted for periods of up to only twelve months, many instances of dry rot are quite apparent. Many of the houses are falling to pieces at such a rate that it has been found necessary to employ a big gang of workmen to travel around continually . to repair and They replace timber and other material. In fact, many of these houses are rapidly falling to pieces. The allegations that have been made by certain building inspectors about the timber used in these houses gives further proof of the necessity for setting up a royal commission to investigate the whole matter. From Dr. Harrison, of the Commonwealth Department of Health, I ascertained that the Queensland Forestry Department had endeavoured to prevent the use of much of this timber but the wishes of the Queensland",40,Hughes

When he demanded an explanation, he was informed that he was "" too hard to get on-with "". He then suggested that if the commission was not satisfied with his work it should dismiss The exer-utive officer laughed and I have before me also photographs which show dry rot in buildings under Mail. The Queensland Minister for Galvin, on an inspection and drew his .attention to similar faults in houses that had not been condemned, hut which were -tenanted by people who were paying from £3 2s. 6d. to £3 5s. a week for them. I showed him bearers in a worse condition -than the ones that had been photographed. They were rotten inside. If adequate supervision is exercised, there is no reason why a bearer containing dry rot should -ever he put into a house. Faults such as that should be rectified before any superstructure is built. Had that been done in -this instance, there would not have been any need to condemn the houses to which I have referred. It was necessary to -condemn the houses because bearers had been placed on faulty stumps and the framework had been built on faulty bearers. The bearers and stumps should liave been condemned and removed long before the roof was put on. The commissioner then took us to -see what was going on in the Chermside Area, where he said everything had been put right. I had a conference with one of the inspectors there and he told me iu the presence of Mr Nowland, the chief architect employed by the Queensland Housing Commission, that he was still not satisfied. He pointed to -several frameworks on which there was no roofing or sheeting. He said, "" I gave strict orders that no other houses were to be erected until these had been roofed and sheeted "". He pointed out that the -quality of the timber being as it was, if rain fell-and it is raining in Queensland now-the moisture content of the timber would be greatly increased and, ultimately, dry rot would set in. After roofs had been built on the houses it would be necessary to remove the outer walls or inner walls to find the dry rot in the -studs. To find the dry rot in the ceiling, it would be necessary to lift the roofing. Dry rot in the bearers could only be detected by removing the flooring or crawling under the structure. houses would be riddled with dry rot. The amortization period of these dwellings is 53 years, but they are likely to collapse within a few years unless they are completely reconstructed. Such work would -come under the heading of maintenance and, of course, the Australian Government is responsible for three-fifths of the Ur.

The Queensland Government has used Commonwealth funds recklessly. It has been insinuated that certain serious irregularities in the administration, particularly the relationship of certain Cabinet Ministers to this matter, should be investigated. I helieve that these allegations are serious enough to warrant the appointment of a royal commission. I hope that this Government will appreciate the importance of this matter and will appoint a royal commission to investigate it. Australian Government is unable to build houses for civilians because members of the present Government parties prevented the Commonwealth from obtaining power to build houses for civilians. They argued that the State governments should build houses and they have built houses. build houses. ber for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) says that no government should build houses. When a Labour government sought to obtain power to build houses for civilians throughout Australia, members of the Opposition at that time maintained that such power should be vested only in the State governments. The opposition to the plan was successful and, therefore, we now have the spectacle of the honoraible member for Lilley( Mr Wight) and others attacking a state government for its alleged failure to deal with the problem of housing. The honourable gentleman, who has bitterly criticized the Queensland Government and its public servants, has lost Those sight of the fact that this Government is a party to the Commonwealth and State housing agreement, under which the Commonwealth has undertaken to provide money for housing in the States. This Government has a responsibility to the taxpayers who have provided the money for the purposes of the agreement. Therefore, if it has neglected its",41,Hughes

126,Mr Petebs,"The honourable memtrust by allowing a State governnient to expend hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions, of pounds wastefully as its agent, a royal commission, if appointed, should investigate not only the conduct of State officials and Ministers but also the administration of this Government. The housing agreement provides for supervision and control by this Government of the housing activities of the State governments, which act as its agents. That is a proper provision, and, if Commonwealth Ministers and public servants have failed to carry out their obligations, responsibility for their neglect should be sheeted home to them. I do not know whether or not the statements made by the honourable member for Lilley were correct aud I do not propose to devote my time to a discussion of the achievements or failures of the Queensland Government in connection with the erection of prefabricated houses. Those houses were imported at the inspiration of a member of the present Australian Government, who was a sort of advertising agent in this country for prefabricated houses constructed in Austria, France, England, and elsewhere. All the houses of that type that I have seen are entirely unsuited to Australian conditions and they should not have been imported. Better houses could be built in Australia for less than the cost of such buildings. The housing shortage is becoming worse and worse. It is not a new problem. It was not caused by World War IL , or by the influx of immigrants since that war. There was a housing shortage between the two world wars, and even before World. WarI . was fought. We had slums and a shortage of good houses in Australia at the beginning of the century. Our slums and the present shortage of houses are a heritage of the ineptitude and incapacity of successive governments, most of which have been anti-Labour governments. In recent years, Labour governments in the States have endeavoured to solve the problems of inadequate housing. They have accepted responsibility for housing the people for the first time in the history they did nothing to honour their of Australia. As the honourable member for Bennelong said earlier, by interjection, members and supporters of the present Government consider that housing [71] should be left entirely in the hands of private enterprise. But the slums of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, and even the new houses that the honourable membei' for Lilley has described as disgraceful, are our inheritance from private enterprise. able member arrive at that conclusion? ing shortages throughout the period of unrestricted speculation by private builders. That was when our slums were built. Houses were erected on pockethandkerchief allotments, and to-day they are undeniably blots on the landscape. Even the anti-Labour governments, to which the present Government is heir, recognized, between the two world wars, that the housing problem in Australia was acute. They declared that governments must do something about that problem, but apparently they spoke with their tongues in. their cheeks. In 1925, the Nationalist party issued a manifesto in which it stated that £20,000,000 would be provided in order to enable people in the cities and in the country to secure their own homes. The Commonwealth Housing Act was passed in 1927, but it became a dead letter after 1929-30, because no advances were made under it after that year. During the 1934 election campaign, the late Mr Lyons, who was then the leader of the party from which the present Liberal party has descended, promised to assist in the building of houses with a view to the abolition of slums. That was a definite promise. Sir Frederick Stewart, in his report to the Government in 1935 on the clearance of slum areas and re-housing, saidNo constitutional hedge could justify our dis-concern, even were we not so definitely commited by pre-election undertakings. Anti-Labour governments promised to tackle the problem when there was an abundance of labour and materials, but promises. In March, 1936, Mr Lyons refused to make money available for the specific purposes of slum clearance and extensive house construction. In 1938",43,Hughes

He repliedI am afraid that that question is neither important nor urgent so far as it is direeted cost £100 or £150 before 1939, cannot be to me. of honourable members opposite in the past.

""Will he explain that he has not referred to me. I think that he has in mind Mr Kent Hughes. members should be referred to by their constituencies. humbly to the right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes). I know that he would dissociate himself from such a statement. The principal problem that confronts a person who desires to purchase a home is the cost-the cost of building, the interest upon the loan, and the price of the land on which the dwelling is erected. Building costs have soared abnormally during the last two or three years. A house which was an £800 proposition in 1939 costs about £4,000 to-day. Let us suppose that a man desired to purchase such a house, and paid a deposit of £500. Interest charges at 4£ per cent, per annum amounting to between £2 and £4 a week would have to be paid before he reduced the mortgage by Id. He would not own the property until 40 or 50 years had expired. That impossible position was In 1939, brought about by the actions of this Government, first, in insisting that the Commonwealth should not take any responsibility for the housing of civilians, and secondly, for relieving the Commonwealth of responsibility for the control of the prices of land and building requisites. Land values have soared in recent years. A block of land in a residential suburb of Sydney or Melbourne, which bought for less than .£500 or £700 toright, too. day. A person pays as much for a building block in a residential area to-day as he paid in 1939 for the land and the house -Of course, people cannot meet tliose high costs, and they would not have to meet them if the Liberal party and the Australian Country party had urged the electors in the referendum in 1948 to grant to the Commonwealth power to control prices. I point out that the prices at which houses constructed 30 or 40 years ago have been sold in recent years have heen determined, not hy the present-day building costs, but by the scarcity of dwellings, and the eagerness of many people to secure immediate possession of houses. In order to do so they have paid prices out of all proportion to either the cost of the labour employed on the erection of the houses, or the cost of the land. ""When the Government removed controls over the price of land, the price became a plaything of the speculator. A block which cost £150 in 1939, cost £700 in 1950. That increase was not due to the fact that labour had been employed at any time to develop and improve the land. The increase was merely the gift of an unearned increment to the vendor. It may be claimed that the disparity between land values in 1939 and 1950 is explained by the diminished value of money, but that does not account for the whole increase. The unearned increment of a block which cost £150 before the war and costs £700 to-day, is approximately £400. Because of that condition of affairs, many people are not able to secure the houses to which they are entitled.",44,Hughes

One honourable member said that the rate of interest on a mortgage on a house should be reduced every few years. I have a better idea than that. I consider that the Government should write off a part of the purchase price of a cottage following every addition to the family. After all, that would only be in conformity with the Government's policy to increase the population of Australia. The Commonwealth has incurredheavy financial responsibilities in order to bring liouse construction, and partly for the adult and even child immigrants to Australia.

A large sum of money is provided each year for that purpose. Last year, direct advances made by the Commonwealth through its agencies and instrumentalities amounted to no less a sum than £70,000,000. This year, the allocation' will be £80,000,000, and that figure does not include subsidiary assistance which will probably bring the Commonwealth's contribution to housing this year to £100,000,000. That is a substantial sum of money. The honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters) made it appear that the Commonwealth is in some way responsible for the present housing shortage. for Wide Bay used to say so when he was in Opposition. government was in office from the end of 1941 to the end of 1949, and a survey of home-building during that period gives almost a nil return. Consequently, this Government has found it difficult to overtake such a big lag, whilst meeting its other £60,000,000 for payment of the war gratuity, and substantially increased social services, yet it managed to make available hundreds of millions of pounds for housing. We have had unfortunate experiences in Queensland in connection with houses imported by the State Government under the Commonwealth subsidy. In these days too great emphasis is placed upon the value of imported houses. I believe that the time has come when the subsidy on imported houses should be withdrawn. Money expended in that way could be much better used, partly to subsidize the small percentage of imported softwoods that must be used in conjunction with native timbers in development of native timbers for that purpose. At present we import timber from countries which, for thousands of years, have used native timbers for house woods are available in vast quantities, particularly in the coastal areas of Queensland. We should endeavour to use a greater proportion of our native hardwoods in house construction. Ample supplies of suitable timber are available to use it* for that purpose. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has said that there is now a shortage of 500,000 houses. When the present Government took office we needed 700,000 new homes. This year, the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities will provide almost £100,000,000 for housing. In these days, when workers are beginning to value their jobs at their true worth, it is ridiculous that carpenters should be able to demand £20 a week. Do honourable members consider that that is a fair wage? honourable member does so, obviously he is not building a house. We should do everything possible to encourage the establishment in Australia of industries from overseas. The establishment of two additional £1,000,000 plants would do much to restore equilibrium to our economy. But overseas industrialists will not be induced to establish branches of their organizations in Australia as commitments.

In addition, £18,000,000 will be made available by the Commonwealth Bank in direct advances and to finance the activities of building societies. As the result of the financial policy applied by this Government the private banks have additional deposits amounting to approximately £330,000,000 and are now in a much better position to make advances for house construction than they were in the past.

They were told that they should do better. The people have been fooled by the present Government. During the 1949 general election campaign, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) statedWe will attack the hasic causes of underproduction and excessive cost. While shortages continue, we will facilitate the entry of selected imported building materials; and will also reviewthe incidence of such imposts as sales tax on home fittings and furniture. The right honourable gentleman did not say that the money would be provided in dribs and drabs. To-day, many people are not only without homes, but are also without jobs. A Government supporter has stated that many men who are out of work should be able to finance the provision of their own homes. He also stated that there are only several hundreds of persons unemployed, but I know that thousands of people are out of work, not only in New South Wales, but throughout Australia. able member should connne his remarks to the bill. vided for our people. In New South Wales no less than six brickyards have closed down. The honourable member for Lilley has referred to the presence of dry rot in the timber of imported prefabricated houses. Possibly that condition existed before they came to this country. It will be remembered that Commonwealth officers went overseas faff the sole purpose of selecting suitable prefabricated houses for this country.. It would seem that they have beenresponsible for the importation of inferior units. Following World War II . the Sydney City Council entered into an agreement; with the New South Wales Government: in relation to a large-scale slum clearance project. In 1945, thousands of substandard dwellings in Redfern and Surry Hills were condemned as unfit for human occupation. It was understood at that time that the Commonwealth would finance the provision of new homes for occupants of the sub-standard dwellings. However, the Liberal upper house in New South Wales considered that the homes were fit for people to live in. Despite the fact that in 78,000 of them there were no baths, tubs or coppers, the representatives of the -big rag shops in New South Wales considered that they were adequate for the people. Subsequently the New South Wales Government entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth in relation to a rebuilding programme, but only relatively few houses have been constructed in the Redfern and Waterloo areas. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr McLeay) told me recently that he had admired the houses that had been built, but, like myself, he wondered when the remainder would be constructed. Many people are still living in camps around Sydney waiting for accommodation. The whole set-up has come undone, as a result of lack of finance. Some honourable, members opposite have stated that homes have been built only in the city areas. Reports that have heen furnished hy the Housing Commission of New South Wales prove otherwise. Only £28,000,000 was expended during the last financial year on the provision of homes for ex-servicemen, many of whom are still waiting for accommodation. Some of them have told me that they consider that at the present rate of progress they will become eligible for the age pension before they are provided with homes. The New South Wales Labour Government has done a magnificent job to try to bridge the gap in housing.",47,Hughes

Clause6 (1.) of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which is set out in the Schedule to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act 1945, readsThe Commonwealth will advance to each State the moneys heretofore expended in the carrying out of a housing project or projects and the moneys that sliall be hereafter required for the carrying out of the State's housing projects as notified to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth from time to time pursuant to clause 7. That agreement would have been honoured had Labour remained in oflice. I believe that the housing of the people is second in importance only to the feeding of the people. housing, irrespective of cost, should be provided by the National Government. Honourable members opposite have claimed that no attempt has been made by the people who have been assisted to obtain houses to repay the money that has been advanced to them. I point out that the people who require housing are quite prepared to pay rent on say, the basis of 2 per cent, interest, where home ownership is not made possible. The honourable member for Bennelong stated that everybody should own his own home, and that houses should be built by private enterprise. If the honourable member had his way, many of the people who are waiting for houses would never get homes of their own. Some honourable members would be astounded at the housing conditions in parts of my electorate. Many immigrants who have been employed on the waterfron t live in those areas. In many instances, the beds that day workers occupy at night are used by night workers when they finish their shift. As many as six beds in each room of a house are constantly in use. This is a shocking state of affairs, which I am sure w ill be rectified when Labour again occupies the treasury bench. The next government w ill be, of course, a Labour government, but I shall tell it , as I am telling this Government now, that the provision of houses for the people should be its first responsibility. The Prime Minister has told us that he w ill stake his reputation and the reputation of this Government upon the result of the Flinders by-election. He should have said that if the Government parties do not w in that election, the Government w i ll resign and permit the people of Australia to repair the damage that it has done during the last three years. no reputation. lost the confidence of the people. I know of an association in Sydney that has been collecting money for the last six or seven years to build an institution. It has been collecting small sums, and has been investing the money in Commonwealth bonds. Now, it wants to build the institution. Owing to the actions of this Government, Financef o r many building tradesmen are out of work, brickyards cannot dispose of the whole of their output, and building materials of every type are available. But, when officials of the association visited a branch of the Commonwealth Bank the other day to make arrangements for the sale of the association's bonds, which have a face value of £24,000, they were told that they would incur a loss of £2,500 if they disposed of them then. This Government is to blame for that state of affairs. On the 30th June, 1949, the New South Wales Housing Commission had completed 10,000 permanent houses in that State. Yet honourable gentlemen opposite tell us that the McGir r Government did nothing to house the people. I prophesy that the number of houses completed in the five years prior to 1949 will not be exceeded in any year during which this Government remains in office. We have been told that this year the Commonwealth has made available to the States sufficient money to enable houses to be built for some time at the present rate of construction, but I say that the money that has been made available to New South Wales this year w ill not be sufficient to pay for one house or for one flat. It w ill only pay for the completion of last year's unfinished programme. Those honourable gentlemen opposite who represent borderline seats have been telling us for the last few weeks what they w ill do about the means test, about pensions, and about houses for the people.",48,Hughes

It was estimated that, last February, 100,000 additional houses were required in New South Wales. I do not think that the money that this Government has made available to the New South Wales Government will be sufficient to finance the building of many of those houses. We have been told that we should not be calamity howlers. At a time when this country is alleged to be more prosperous than it has ever been before, thousands of people are out of work and are without homes. If the Government cannot provide the finance that is required to build houses for the people who are already in this country, why is it bringing thousands of immigrants here each year? I believe that the target is .150,000 immigrants a year. Many immigrants have flocked to Sydney and other ' cities, but they cannot find houses there. I know that in Sydney more than 100 people are living in hostels that were designed to accommodate only 25 people. A member of the Liberal party has said that health inspectors should evict some of them, because the health regulations are being contravened. But that cannot be done, because those people have no other place in which to sleep. Those conditions obtain throughout Australia. The farmers of this country are subsidized from the cradle to the grave. Almost everything that they use on their farms is subject to a subsidy. Their butter and tea are subsidized, in the same way as are the butter and tea of everybody else. They draw the maternity allowance and other social services benefits. The Government will help the farmers, but it will not provide the finance that is required to build houses for homeless people. If the Government can pay subsidies on houses imported from overseas, why can it not pay subsidies to brickyards? If that were done, many brickyards which are now closed could be put into operation again. Minister live up to the promises that he made in1949? He has said that he will hand back to the States their taxing rights, but doubtless he will ensure that the Commonwealth will take the major portion of the people's money. If the Australian people are prepared to agree to an annual expenditure of £200,000,000 upon defence in a time of peace, surely they would rally to the defence of homeless people and raise another £200,000,000 for building purposes. If the Government believes that the Commonwealth has not the power to make special grants for huilding, why does not it ask for that power at a . referendum ? The people would not reject such a request. The land owners of Australia will be given £6,000,000 a year as a result of the abolition of the land tax. Could not that money be used to finance the building of houses? Could not wealthy organizations such as the Rose Bay golf club wait until the people of this country have been housed before they erect new buildings? The Government has sold national assets that the workers toiled night and day to build. During the last war, £10,000,000 was expended upon a graving dock. If a war were to break out tomorrow, money would be the last thing that the Government would think about. Taxes would be increased to provide any money that was required to prosecute the war. If the people can be taxed for war purposes, surely they can be taxed for peaceful purposes. Money spent on housing would be far better spent than the thousands of pounds which the Government has expended on referendums and communism. It would help to free this country from communism and from divorces because the shortage of housing has prevented many young people from getting married. Many others have married and lived in rooms and their living conditions have resulted in divorce. The housing shortage has operated to the detriment of the country more than any other factor. Homes are needed in New South Wales by 100,000 people and 40,000 of those people need Why does not the Prime them desperately. Unfortunately, these people will have to wait for eighteen months befo.re they will have an opportunity to express their opinion of the Government at the next general election. Time and time again the Prime Minister has promised to provide homes for the people. He promised to make them little capitalists. In fact, he has not only deprived them of homes but of jobs also. His policy has put thousands out of work. Since they cannot get jobs they cannot borrow £3,500 from the Government to build a home as the honourable member for Wide Bay suggested that they could. The honourable member has accused me of saying that a person could obtain money from the Commonwealth Government. He could not have understood that I referred to the Commonwealth Bank. order. advises the Commonwealth Bank. The Government has proposed that unemployment relief should be raised from 25s. a week to £2 10s. a week for single men who have been in the habit of earning at least the basic wage, of £11 16s. The Government has alleged that only about 50,000 people are out of work. The fact is that 100,000 people are out of work although many of them have not applied for unemployment relief. The amount of £2 10s. which the Government proposes to pay the single men is not even equal to the age pension yet the Government will expect the people of Elinders to elect its candidate at the by-election. The state of affairs is the result of bad Prime Minister has failed to fulfil the promises that he made in 1949 to provide homes and work for the people and I hope that he will be man enougn to resign after the Flinders by-election. -Order! The honourable member's time wasted money on the purchase of inferior has expired. -This hill provides for the allocation of acquiesce in attempts hy authorities £30,000,000 to the States under the loan such as the Queensland housing agreement. This amount is Commission to have better timber used. nearly £3,500,000 more than the amount The position has arisen also from that was allocated for this purpose last the Queensland Government's lack of year. Wheni t became necessary for the responsibility in relation to puhlic Australian Loan Council to reduce the funds and its lack of the integrity that total amount of loan money to be made we should like to see in connection with available to the States the housing allocation was reduced to a little over £21,000,000. The Government, realizing the importance of the building industiy, decided to increase that amount to £30,000,000 which is twice as much as the sum that was allocated for this purpose by the Chifley Government in 1945. This money will be allocated to the States in the following proportions:-Ne w South Wales, £12,100,000; Victoria, £11,270,000; Queensland, £3,730,000; Western Australia, £2,900,000. This is a most important bill because of the spectre of unemployment which has been referred to by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), and other Opposition members. This £30,000,000 will provide very badly needed houses and will provide employment in that industry which has the greatest effect upon employment. As every house that is built provides employment for six men the provision of this amount will have a beneficial effect on employment. No industry is as important as the building industry in providing employment. At the beginning of the year there was a fall in the number of houses built under the housing agreement because of their tremendously high cost. However, I want to deal with the subject of costs at a later stage. I think it is only fair to comment on the statements that were made last night by the Prime Minister in such a restrained and controlled way when he told us about the shocking and disgraceful state of affairs in Queensland.

166,,"It is the Commonwealth Mr FALKINDER I desire to makeister) [4.32] I move That the House do now adjourn. Honourable members will recall that when I spoke in the House last week on the subject of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries LimitedI said that if the Government decided to sell its shares in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited it would tell the House about its decision very promptly. I now have some information to give the House on this subject. I informed honourable members that this matter arose for Government consideration when the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited informed us that it was thinking of establishing a large oil refinery in Western Australia. I am now able to inform the House definitely that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited has decided to proceed with the establishment of this large refinery at Kwinana, near Eremantle, and will press ahead with all possible expedition with the project. The Western. Australian Government is, of course, giving it all possible assistance, and the Commonwealth Government also will lend its aid wherever this is appropriate. The refinery will have a capacity of 3,000,000 tons a year and is expected to come into operation in 1956. When completed it will be capable of meeting nearly 40 per cent, of the estimated petroleum requirements of Australia at that time. It will be by far the largest refinery in Australia, and will have an operating staff of about 1,000 persons. The plant will comprise distillation units for the recovery of petrol, kerosene, gas-oil and bunker fuel, and for the preparation of feed stock for catalytic cracking. The cracking units will produce high octane motor spirit and residual fuel oil. Subsidiary plants will improve the quality of the distilled petrol, and will perform the necessary refining operations on kerosene and other products. Aviation spirit plant is also to be installed. Tbe tanks required for the storage of crude oil and the products of the refinery will add substantially to the country's strategic policy of the company. On the other storage facilities. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited will provide the whole of the capital required for the new refinery, which is estimated to cost not less than £40,000,000. In addition, the company will expand the storage and distribution facilities of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited at a cost of about £12,000,000. I told honourable members last week that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited was proposing to use the organization of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited to distribute, in Australia, the output of this new refinery. To do this satisfactorily it would be necessary to expand the capital of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited from its present figure of £850,000 up to about £12,000,000, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited had invited the Commonwealth to continue as a partner in this venture and contribute half the extra .capital required. This the Government agreed to do, and the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) made an announcement to that effect in January, 1951. I explained also that, in the future, Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited would cease to be a refiner and would become merely the agent for the distribution of the Anglo-Iranian products. Honourable members will recall that the Government conceived some doubts about whether the Parliament could validly appropriate money for this purpose and sought advice both from its law officers and from Mr Barwick, QC. The advice was that the Commonwealth Parliament did not have the power to appropriate more money for this purpose. In these circumstances, the Government had a choice. In the first instance, it could decide to retain its existing shareholding in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, leaving it to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited to subscribe all the new capital required. This course would have resulted in the Commonwealth owning only a small share in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, the great bulk of the capital being controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited.

167,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime Minsell its interest in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited. Under the oil agreement the Commonwealth is required to give the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited the first refusal of any shares which it desires to sell. What the Government did was to notify the AngloIranian Oil Company Limited of the fact that it had heen advised that it could not legally provide nioney for an increase in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited's capital, and to discuss the situation. I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) to make a special visit to London to take these matters up and discuss them fully with the company and to negotiate with them. He explained the matters which I have just outlined to honourable members. The Government decided that the best course of action was to dispose of its shares, but, of handling 130,000 tons of oil at Laverof course, at a price whicli represented their fair value. There has been quite a long negotiation on this question of price. At the outset, the Government appointed an experienced firm of chartered accountants to make a valuation of its interest in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited. This firm made its valuation and assessed a price of £6 10s. a share, giving a total of £2,762,506 10s. for the whole of the Commonwealth's interest in the company. The Commonwealth indicated that this was its price and after a series of negotianothing should be done which would imtions, in which we began with very divergent views on the value of the shares, I am now in a position to inform the House that the company has agreed to pay the value of £6 10s. put on the shares hy the Commonwealth. In fact, earlier to-day, it paid for them at that price. In return, of course, the Commonwealth has transferred the whole of its shareholding to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited and the Commonwealth directors have resigned from the board. The oil agreement between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, which imposed obligations on each party, has been cancelled. A bill to confirm the Government's action in this matter will be submitted to the House as soon as practicable during this session. In the result, the Commonwealth has disposed of its holding at the price which it was competently advised was the true value. We felt at the outset that, although there was for all practical purposes only one buyer, we should not go below this price, having regard to the fact that we were disposing of a public asset. There has been some suggestion that the action of the Government in selling these shares is in some way depriving Australia of a vital defence asset. This view fails to recognize the obvious fact that there is little purpose in being concerned in an oil or petrol distributing business unless there is oil or petrol to distribute. The project now being put in hand will go a long way towards ensuring just that. The net result when these transactions are brought to their conclusion is that, instead of having an old refinery, capable ton, in Victoria, a refinery which, in fact, did not operate during the war years, 1942-45, Australia will have a modern refinery capable of handling 3,000,000 tons of oil at Kwinana, in Western Australia. I should emphasize that the negotiations over this matter have been exceptionally delicate and important, as the Government attached great importance to the establishment of the large Anglo-Iranian refinery in Western Australia. The Government felt that it was important that peril or delay this great enterprise. I am pleased to report to the House that the negotiations in this important transaction have been conducted without any atmosphere of ill-will being injected into them, and with a high sense of responsibility on both sides. The period of association between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited has been long, profitable and friendly. The Commonwealth welcomes the company's decision to establish in Western Australia this large refinery, a refinery which will be so important for the supply of petroleum products, for our trading position and for employment, and believes that its relations with this great company will be as friendly in the future as they have been, in the past. Opposition) announcement which has just been made by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) as evidence that a thoroughly bad business deal has been made on behalf of Australia. I had hoped against hope that after the debates that had taken place in this Parliament, and after the public discussions that had occurred, the Government would have made an honest review of the position. The statement of the Prime Minister dealt with two entirely separate things. He referred to the establishment of a great oil refinery in Western' Australia-a n excellent proposal, and one in which the Australian Government could have been a partner with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, as was disclosed the other day in this House. The essence -of the arrangement between the Australian Government and the British Government, through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, was that there should be a permanent partnership for the provision of oil supplies for Australia. Now, it has been decided to sell the Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited. The Parliament has not been consulted, and the people have not been consulted. Nevertheless, this extremely successful enterprise from a financial point of view is to be sold at a price that is grossly below its value. honourable gentleman know that? from an examination of the balance-sheet. The Commonwealth's shares are to be sold for £2,750,000, but their value is far in excess of that. right honourable gentleman said that their value was £3,000,000. kind the other day. The Prime Minister will not listen to argument, but keeps on interrupting from his privileged place at the table. Minister was heard in comparative silence, but the same courtesy has not heen extended to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I demand that [4.42] I regard the it shall be. made on the 17th January last that an agreement had been made with the AngloIranian Oil Company Limited to establish a refinery in Western Australia. What the Prime Minister said about that aspect of the matter a few minutes ago was not news. The Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) said that the refinery would supply petroleum products for the Australian and overseas markets and that Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited would handle the distribution of the refinery's products in Australia; and, of course, it would do so in competition with the major oil companies. In order to finance the provision of adequate storage facilities in Western Australia, the capital of Commonwealtli Oil Eefineries Limited was to be increased by £12,000,000, and the Government annouuced in January last that it would provide half of that amount. The refinery was to be the largest in Australia, and. storage was to be provided for an additional 1,000,000 tons of crude oil, Commonwealth's holdings in intermediate and refined products, which, according to the Minister for National Development, would, be an important contribution to Australia's reserve stocks of petroleum products for defence purposes. That was the arrangement that was made with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited only a few short months ago. Why has that arrangement been altered ? It was stated in the press, which seems to find out what happens in Cabinet in respect of important matters of this kind, that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) successfully opposed the proposal to sell the Commonwealth's share in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited although the Prime Minister, the MinisMinister for National Development wanted to make the sale. At present, I said nothing of the the Postmaster-General is abroad, and the Government has now decided during his absence to make the sale. I put it to the House that the Prime Minister's reference to legal opinion is completely unsatisfactory.

It is said that the Australian Government should not be a distributor of oil, but the Government's own conduct in relation to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited made it a distributor. announcement enabled a situation to be established in order to justify this complete sell-out of Australia's interests. The argument that has been advanced on constitutional grounds is merely a pretext. For 32 years, since Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited was established by the Hughes Government, the Commonwealth's holding in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited was constitutionally valid; and it has been continued by every subsequent Government -the Bruce-Page Government, the Scullin Government, the Lyons Government, the Page Government, the Menzies Government, the Fadden Government, the Curtin Government, the Forde Government, the Chifley Government, and the present Government. After 32 years, the discovery is made that the Commonwealth's holding in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited is unconstitutional, or might be found to he unconstitutional. I do not believe that the people of Australia will accept that view. The Government's decision is good news only for the monopoly groups in this country. As Mr Bruce, when he was Prime Minister, pointed out, Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited successfully repelled attacks by the monopoly groups in the 192 O's, and prevented them from increasing the price of petrol and oil. The Australian Government's partnership in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited was really a partnership with the British Government through the AngloIranian company. It was a sound partnership, and it was vindicated in principle by the action that the British Government took during ""World WarI . , when Mr Churchill declared that the British Goverament should hold a dominant share in the Anglo-Iranian company. What is to be the Australian Governprise that is vital to defence and indisment's policy in this matter in .the future ? pensable to the prevention of exploitaThis Government having decided to sell tion by the major oil companies. The its shares, I agree that the AngloIranian Oil Company Limited should be the purchaser of the Commonwealth's share in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited because such an arrangement may assist a future government to repair the damage that will result from this decision. It will be the duty of Then the Prime Minister's a future government to restore the position that exists to-day. Certainly, the Australian Labour party cannot accept this sacrifice of Australia's interest. The sale is being made at an unsatisfactory price and under unsatisfactory conditions. The Government is prepared to sacrifice the vital defence interests of this country. It is useless for supporters of this transaction to say that as Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited was only a distributor of oil it was not performing a service that was vital to defence. The answer to that argument is that the Government's partnership in Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited placed the obligation upon the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited to bring crude oil to this country and thus assure supplies. The loss that will be sustained as the result of this sale should be remedied by a future government at the earliest possible opportunity. I repeat that Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited has been successful financially and has rendered a service vital to defence. As a result of this sale, those who have control of petrol supplies from beginning to end will gain complete control over supplies in Australia. For 32 years, under all of the governments that I have mentioned, Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited has proved to be a success. This Government now refuses to join with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited in this great project in Western Australia. Some members, apparently, think that it might be a good thing to get their way and dispose of the Gover-nment's interests altogether in. Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited. The Government has made its decision without consulting with either the Parliament or the people; but, in the long run, the people will not tolerate action of this kind. This matter involves not any abstract question, but the practical question of disposing of a successful enterGovernment should not have taken the action that it has taken.
