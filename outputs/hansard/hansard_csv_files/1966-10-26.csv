As the United States Government makes no charge upon the Australian Government for carrying mail to and from Honolulu to Australian servicemen in Vietnam, will the Government extend the same postal privileges to our troops in Vietnam as are enjoyed by those corresponding with or receiving correspondence from United States servicemen serving in the same area? ing to the mail of Australian servicemen policy to its obvious conclusion by strengthoverseas come within the jurisdiction of my ening Pegarah Estate before the sale of the colleague, the Minister for the Army.

Its activities would be confined, as the Commonwealth's concern is confined, to tourists from overseas countries, but the activities would be integrated with the development of internal tourism, which is within the functional jurisdiction of the State Governments. There is a council of tourist ministers in the State sphere. It would be proposed that in the Federal body, which might be under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Trade and IndustryI think this has not been finally decided -ther e vvould be provision for associate membership of State representatives at ministerial level and at official level so that there would be a complete integration of knowledge, planning and intention. The State Governments and the Federal Government would reserve their respective authorities over their own funds and expenditures.

Has the Government's attention been drawn to the report that a Malaysian Government White Paper alleges that the illegal Communist Party again poses a threat to Malaysia. Does this threat stress the need for continued vigilance by all countries in the South East Asian area? ledge of the Government that yesterday the Malaysian Government issued a White Paper on this subject matter. We are not in possession of the White Paper and therefore I am not able to comment in detail on it, but it is within the knowledge of the Government that there is a threat from Communists in Malaysia. It is known that the Communists in Malaysia have their headquarters in the area of the MalaysiaThailand border. We do not know the precise number of Malaysian Communists there, but it is known that they have a liaison with representatives in Peking. It is also known that they are supporters of the so called independence struggle in Sarawak. Their activities are of the same general character, inspired from Peking, as those against which Australian forces, together with British, New Zealand and Malayan forces, operated for years when rooting out the Communist guerrillas in Malaya who were attempting to subvert and overthrow the Government of that free and friendly country. directed to the Acting Prime Minister.

They must be sufficient, expressions of aspirations which must be for example, to cope with epidemics, outfutile when it does nothing to promote breaks of disease and that sort of thing. The other thing that is not often appreciated in relation to the reserves of the funds when they are quoted in millions of dollars is that, in relation to numbers of contributors, they are not unduly high. For example, the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd. has something like 2.4 million people covered by its hospital benefits scheme and 2.2 million covered by its medical benefits scheme. Its reserves of $18 milfrom those who have had experience in and lion represents approximately the cost of one day's hospitalisation and one medical service-that is, one visit to the doctor-for each member. In the light of those circumstances, I am sure the honourable gentleman will agree that the reserves are not unduly high. However, I am watching the position closely. Increases will be permitted when opportunity offers, but the point I would make is that they must be gradual so that they can be sustained over a long period. There must be no sudden dissipation of funds in the short term. The final point I would make is that, in any case, these reserves are the property of the contributors to the funds. They belong to the contributors and are there for their benefit, whatever happens. Prime Minister why the new Commonwealth clothing factory is not being established in a provincial or country centre instead of in Melbourne, where the Commonwealth is paying $335,000 for the land alone. In view of the Government's protestations of its faithfulness to decentralisation, why was the new factory not established, for example, in any one of a dozen provincial or country cities and towns? Goulburn, in my electorate, is a centre for the growing of fine merino wool, a centre for the woollen industry and a centre for the manufacturing of textiles, and is ideally suited for the clothing factory. As the value of orders placed by the Commonwealth for clothing amounts to several millions of dollars a year, why was this opportunity for a practical step in decentralisation neglected, and why does the Government continue with inquiries and decentraUsation? with complete authority on this matter, but I can speak with a substantial knowledge of it. The decision to which the honourable member refers is a decision of Cabinet on a matter which was considered by it more than once. In fact, I think it was considered more than twice. The decision was taken against the background of strong advice responsibility for conducting the Commonwealth clothing factory. As I recall, a substantial factor which influenced the decision is that the Commonwealth clothing factory employs some hundreds, of people, a great proportion of whom, I am informed, are skilled people. With the factory re-established in the Melbourne area, where the present factory is, these people, for their part, can retain their employment, and the Commonwealth clothing factory, for its part, can retain the benefit of their experience and their skills. The view of those who advised the Government on this matter was that a substantial dislocation of production would be caused by a move to a remote area, where the existing work force would be unable to follow. I am told that many of the skilled operatives in the clothing factory are married women whose husbands are in employment. They obviously would not be able to follow the factory to another area. As I recall, this -perhap s not completely but certainly substantially-represent s the kind of advice which led the Government to the decision it has taken. dressed to the Minister for Primary Industry.

I believe that tenders were called at the beginning of last month and that they closed approximately a week ago.

The programme has been organised on the basis of phases. We have completed phase four. The recent increase in capital city commercial stations has taken us through another phase. I have indicated to the Parliament and publicly that I have asked the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to make a further survey into the possibility of establishing stations or translators to serve areas not presently served by television.

Are job opportunities declining because of automation in industry? If so, can the Minister explain the reasons for full employment in Australia, bearing in mind that automation has been gradually introduced into industry over the years and at least $20 million has already been invested in electronic data processing equipment alone? largely to the perpetuation of full employment in Australia, such displacements as have been caused in the last few years by technological change have been largely absorbed quite readily. Any fear for the future would rather be that we do not have enough highly trained and technically qualiable from overseas countries, particularly fied people to take full advantage of automation, which is already carried a good deal further in many industries in other countries is not a simple operation and is, in fact, than it is in Australia. Looking to the future, there are some worries associated with the introduction of automation. These were expressed very freely at a seminar conconceived and efficiently implemented plan. ducted recently by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which I addressed. I doubt whether most of those fears are well founded, but they exist. They are real and something must be done to overcome them. Looking to the future, we must be ready to take positive measures to keep in touch with the labour market, to anticipate developprovide training and retraining facilities. Recently, we established a special section in my Department for this purpose. It will co-ordinate the activities of the rest of the Department and I hope, as time goes on, it will publish whatever information may be available as a general guide to industry and labour combined.

55,Mr Speaker,"I have received a letterof public importance be submitted to tbe House for discussion, namelyThe Government's failure to take or permit steps to establish a shipbuilding industry in Tasmania. I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than tbe number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)behalf of the Opposition I formally propose for discussion this matter of public importance, namelyThe Government's failure to take or permit steps to establish a shipbuilding industry in Tasmania. We believe, as does the Tasmanian Government, that the Commonwealth Government not only has adopted a defeatist attitude, but has deliberately denied to Tasmania a major industry-a n industry of great significance-propose d to be established by a company, the Verolme company, which enjoys a worldwide reputation. The company is skilled in shipbuilding and associated industries. This Government has rejected the application by. the company for the shipping subsidy that is applied now to seven other companies in this country. The rejection of the company's application by the Government will most certainly prevent this company from engaging in shipbuilding activities in Tasmania. This Government approved a subsidy in relation to the shipbuilding industry when it accepted the recommendations of the Tariff Board in May 1964. Indeed, the then Minister for Supply, who is now the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairhall), had this to say on 20th May 1964 when presenting the proposals of the Tariff BoardThe present subsidy on vessels built in Australia for the Australian coastal trade, or for use on Australian inland waters, will be continued on vessels over SOO tons gross and will be extended to cover vessels over 200 tons gross and not exceeding 500 tons gross, which are built in Australia in existing recognised shipyards. It is proposed should rest until 1969 when the Tariff to continue the subsidy arrangement until the end of 196S prior to which the industry will again be examined by the Tariff Board. The Opposition points out most emphatically that in this speech no suggestion was made that it should be a recommendation of the Tariff Board that additional shipbuilding industries should not be established in Australia. The Tariff Board merely referred to the question of the subsidy. This question was not under discussion at all. We understand now from what the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) has said on two occasions in this House-las t week and again yesterday in reply to questions directed to him by honourable members on this side of the Housethat the application by this company has been rejected particularly because the Government is not prepared to authorise the extension of shipbuilding activities in Australia, that this shipbuilding company may, if it desires, engage in shipbuilding activities in Tasmania, but that it will not be entitled to attract a subsidy. Nothing was said by the then Minister for Supply in his speech in 1964 that would suggest that additional shipbuilding industries would not be authorised or required in Auslralia at this time. One of the worse features of the position has been lhe undue and, I believe, unnecessary delay that has occurred following the representations that have been made to the Minister for Shipping and Transport by this company. On 4th March of last year, the Verolme company lodged its application with the Minister. On ISth June, following certain inquiries that had been made again of the Minister, the company was advised that Cabinet had considered the matter and decided to seek further information relating to the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Further delay occurred. But the Minister did nothing about the matter until further representations were made to the then Acting Prime Minister requesting him to provide the necessary information to the Tasmanian Government and to the company concerned. So, last week, as I have indicated to the House already, the Minister advised the company through this Parliament that Cabinet had decided not to approve of the subsidy. As I have said, this decision was made largely on the basis that the matter Board again will have the opportunity to investigate the shipbuilding industry or the requirements of that industry in Australia. The Tasmanian Government believes, as the members of the Opposition here believe, that this is an unnecessary delay. Surely",21,Shipbuilding
56,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.24],"O nthe Minister could have agreed at this stage for a company of this magnitude, which could be of such great importance industrially to Australia, to be established in the number of industries, both primary and Tasmania. The company is one of the largest of its type in the world. Verolme United Shipyards v/as established in Holland in 1945, when a modest engineering shop was founded for the repair of marine engines. At present the Verolme group has three shipyards in Holland, one of which is among the biggest in Europe, and has also successfully established shipyards in southern Ireland and Brazil. These yards not only have had experience in the construction of big tankers and bulk carriers but also have built reefer vessels, special carriers for the transparity or why the freight rates charged by port of liquid petroleum gas and molten sulphur, supply vessels, navy craft and dredging equipment, drilling platforms and other general shipping items. Apart from this. Verolme also undertakes extensive repair work at some of the yards and has its own engine works. This is the company with a world wide reputation that the Australian Governmeni dismisses out of hand as not being entitled to attract a subsidy that is already being paid to this country an industry of the magnitude to a number of other shipyards in Australia. We believe that the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) has been unnecessarily harsh in his judgment of this matter. Any argument that the Minister may put forward regarding a shipping subsidy or the need for additional vessels in our coastal trade is related, of course, to the Government's own policy, and this policy denies Australia the right to expand its national coastal shipping line and also the right to establish a national fleet of vessels to engage in the overseas trade. Occasionally we hear a welcome suggestion from a Minister who believes that an overseas shipping line may be necessary, but even the Ministers who express these views are never prepared to do anything definite about the matter. They merely talk. The Government and the Minister for Shipping and Transport are well aware of the demands that have been made on numerous occasions, not only by members on this side of the Parliament but also by interested organisations outside the Parliament, for an expansion of our coastal shipping line and also the introduction of a national line to engage in overseas trade. Surely the need has never been greater than it is now, particularly when one considers secondary, that are experiencing difficulties because of having to depend on shipping lines controlled by overseas interests. Only last week the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) referred to these difficulties. He pointed out that shipping freight charges for the carriage of motor cars from Australia to the United Kingdom are 30 per cent, greater than the charges for transporting cars of similar size from the United Kingdom to Australia. The Minister never attempts to explain the reason for this disoverseas shipping lines have always been loaded against Australian industries, both primary and secondary. We believe that if the Government adopted a realistic attitude towards this matter there would be a need not only for one additional shipbuilding enterprise but probably for several more. The Opposition believes, and the Tasmanian Government believes, that we should not lose the opportunity of attracting of this shipbuilding organisation, which has established itself so successfully in the shipbuilding industry in many parts of the world. All the facts have been made known to the Minister. He fully understands why the company chose to come to Tasmania. He must also know that while negotiations were being conducted between himself, the company and the Tasmanian Government, the Premier of Western Australia was in Holland negotiating with the company to establish itself in Western Australia. Surely the Minister for Shipping and Transport knows that this is so, although he has said nothing about it. The company told the Minister that it hoped to tender for the construction of ships of any size which might be required within Australia, and that, in addition, it hoped to secure a variety of orders from Indonesia. The company did not intend to depend solely on orders from within Australia. It believed it could attract a great deal of the Indonesian business that now goes to other countries. The company told the Minister that it had had more than 10 years' association with the Indonesian Government, for which it had built ships, and that it was currently engaged in building a shipbuilding and repair yard and several special ships near Djakarta. The company saidThe company's experience with the Indonesian it.

58,Mr Freeth (Forrest,"Minister forsetting up of industries which can prosper in that State. But what service is it to the State of Tasmania to encourage the establishment of an industry which is doubtful or speculative or which has, at the most, a hazardous future? That is the only kind of future we can see for the Verolme company in Hobart, as I hope I can show to honourable members. Mr Clyde Cameron -Has the Government lost the pioneering spirit? for Hindmarsh talks about the pioneering spirit. The Australian shipbuilding industry is probably the most sheltered shipbuilding industry in the world. It depends for its existence on Government subsidy. It depends on a prohibition of imports of ships. Even then it has been struggling along for years. IfI may do so without interruption I will quote for honourable members opposite the report of the Tariff Board on the shipbuilding industry. The Tariff Board has no axe to grind in this business. The Tariff Board examined the shipbuilding industry in 1959 and had this to sayNone of the companies concerned in the conThese facilities are not present in Hobart. struction of merchant vessels in Australia depends primarily on those sources of activity for its existence. In other words, shipbuilding was a sideline. The quotation continuesIn the case of the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. shipbuilding represents only a minor portion of the company's total activities. With Evans Deakin and Co. Ltd., Walkers Ltd. and State Dockyard, their interests are predominantly in general engineering. In recent years no company has derived more than 35 per cent, of its total income from its shipbuilding activities. As a result of this survey in 1959 the Tariff Board saidAt this level, even if all requirements for new vessels were placed on the local yards, this tonnage of ship repair work are reasonably good? of orders would only provide sufficient work to keep the industry as a whole operating at something like 50 per cent, of its optimum capacity. That was the situation in 1959. However, if the local shipyards are maintained at less than optimum capacity, building costs will be higher, overall efficiency lower and the extent of assistance required to offset higher costs would be greater than under a programme of reasonably full production. In 1963 the Tariff Board had another look at the Australian shipbuilding industry and brought its conclusions up to date. I will now quote from the Board's remarks in 1963. It saidSuch is the extent of the present over capacity in the Australian shipbuilding industry that the BHP. yards at Whyalla, together with any one of the other major yards, could more than satisfy the whole of the Australian requirements for new merchant shipping at recent levels of demand. That is, the BHP. yard and one other yard could meet Australia's requirements. We have in fact six recognised shipbuilding yards. The report continuedTf this demand were thus concentrated it could result in economies in production because of more sustained and fuller use of capacity and of skilled labour. The importance of these economies is such that they would lower the cost of the subsidy necessary to fulfil the Government's objective of maintaining an efficient shipbuilding industry. WhatI have had to say about the shipbuilding industry and its association with the heavy engineering industry is of considerable importance. In the first place, a good shipbuilding industry depends on having a lot of other industries associated with it. There has to be steel fabrication works in reasonably close proximity. It requires a host of subcontractors who can take up various components related to shipbuilding. This company, the Verolme company, based its case on the ground that it could obtain a great deal of work for a heavy engineering factory. Indeed, this was to bc self supporting, because it is hard to imagine that a heavy engineering factory would depend solely on shipbuilding for its support. This heavy engineering, and ship repair work which it assured the Commonwealth Government it was certain to get, were to be its main support. I put it to honourable members: What is to prevent this company setting up a heavy engineering industry in Hobart? What is to prevent it from engaging in this work if its forecasts I do not know the full facts of the case, but I have been asked for approval-and I have given approval-for a floating dock to be imported to Hobart. Floating docks do not come cheaply. They cost a lot of money. I think that this one is to cost at least $3 million. One would imagine that the Tasmanian Government would have under contemplation a pretty fair quantity of ship repair work if it was buying a floating dock from some company; or else the Tasmanian Government intends to buy the dock purely",24,Shipbuilding

The Tasmanian Government would then be able to say that it has this industry although it would not have given much thought to its long term future. ment is prepared to co-operate with the company; this Government is not. ing. Here is the Tasmanian Government prepared to spend 33 million on a floating dock but it says that this dock will not sustain the company in business and it needs a shipbuilding yard. A shipbuilding yard is a far more precarious undertaking than ship repair work. The Tasmanian Governinent needs a shipbuilding yard for the company to make up its mind on this matter. I was extremely interested to hear the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) say something about ships from Indonesia. He mentioned that this company had established a shipyard in Indonesia; yet part of the case submitted to the Commonwealth Government was that the company hoped to get shipbuilding orders from Indonesia. for Indonesia. is it not? The cost of shipbuilding in Australia per ton of steel in the ships is twice as high as the average world cost for shipbuilding steel. If this company has set up its own shipyard in Indonesia, what is it going to do? Is it going to cut loose and leave the Indonesians high and dry? What arrangements has it with the Indonesian Governnient? I made a few inquiries about this matter and it all seems very vague. I understand that the company has made some quite imposing propositions to thc Indonesians to build ships in that country of thc order of 10,000 tons and upwards. This is quite fantastic and impossible to achieve in the Indonesian situation. There is more to this matter than meets the eye. I suggest that the company and the Tasmanian Government would be in an immeasurably stronger position if the company were to go to Tasmania and become established in business first. Then it would have a claim to go before the Tariff Board and request approval for subsidy in the same way as any of the seven established Australian companies which have been seeking this subsidy and have not been able to obtain recognition for subsidy purposes. This latest endearment of foreign capital to the Australian Labour Party completely amazes me. The honourable member for Newcastle spoke about the shipbuilding industry on 7th May 1963. The health of the shipbuilding industry has been the subject of other discussions launched by the Labour Party. On that occasion he said thisA yard cannot be run economically on the basis of the figures that I can cite. For example, at the Evans Deakin yard the number of men employed has fluctuated from as high as 800 down to about 300. At one time 188 boilermakers were employed in that yard, but within 12 months the number was down to 26. Yet this was a company which depended for only 35 or 45 per cent, of its activities on shipbuilding. The honourable member continuedThat shows the way orders fluctuate and the way labour fluctuates. This Government would not be doing a service to the Tasmanian Government if it allowed an industry to go to that State with that kind of uncertainty hanging over its head. It has been said that the order position of the Australian shipyards is healthy -it is. But all ships for which the yards at present have orders will be completed at the end of 1968. What will happen after that? Can honourable members opposite tell me how many ships will be built and what size they will be? It is all very well to say that this company is entitled to use its own commercial judgment about what is going to happen, but we must remember that there is this deal about the floating dock which, as I say, I do not quite understand. We must remember also that all the other Australian shipyards have been entitled to base their calculations on what they need in the way of labour, work and materials, and their programmes on the assumption that the Government will adhere to its policy of not recognising new yards until 1969. It is not fair to upset their commercial judgment by allowing these new companies in before there has been a thorough review of the industry by the Tariff Board. I fear that the proposed yard is a nit like the fish that got away; it has got bigger and bigger every day. When the proposition for a yard was put to me the company was",25,Shipbuilding

63,Mr Freeth,"This is rather ludicrous,going to employ about 500 men. but according to a report on the front page of the Hobart"" Mercury"" today, there is talk of employing 2,500 men. When the proposition was first put to me the company was going to build ships of 12,000 to 15,000 tons; today it is talking about building ships of 60.000 tons. How many ships of 60,000 tons will be needed about the Australian coast in the next five years? I understand from the figures I cited in relation to Evans Deakin that the figure of 500 to 800 men is a reasonable one for a shipyard. If there is any substance in the story about employing 2,500 men it must surely be based on an engineering industry of considerable magnitude. SoI say to the Tasmanian Government, to the Verolme company and to honourable members opposite that they are not serving the interests of the Australian shipbuilding industry or the State of Tasmania by embarking on an enterprise with so little certainty about the details of its future. If thi.s company is willing to put its capital into that area and back its place in tbe future by starting on the things it knows it can do, it will be in a very strong position when the Tariff Board next reviews this industry. I assert that the Commonwealth Government has been very mindful of rhe interests of Tasmania in its consideraships not only for the coastal trade but tion of this programme. It was for that reason and that reason alone that we looked at this carefully at least twice in the Cabinet fleet. We would give orders to have two or before we were able to come to a final decision on it. Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr the Australian flag and competing with the Freeth) says that the shipbuilding industry is so precarious in Australia that it has to exist on a subsidy. That is a shocking indictment from a Minister for Shipping in this Parliament or in any other Parliament. Evidently the Minister does not know that every shipbuilding industry in every country which builds ships is subsidised heavily, as the industry is in this country. That is not new. If the Government had done the right thing by the shipbuilding firms of Australia the Minister would never have made such a statement. He would never have said that the industry is rickety if the Government was prepared to establish an overseas fleet. It wil] always need to exist on a subsidy. As I have said already, this is the situation in every country. I shall answer some of the other statements made by the Minister as I proceed. The lifeblood of a trading nation is an overseas shipping fleet. The lifeblood of an overseas shipping fleet is a virile shipbuilding industry. The lifeblood of a shipbuilding industry is skilled tradesmen, adequate finance, a continuous stream of orders and availability of raw materials. It is to the everlasting disgrace of this Federal Government that after 17 years of prosperous times and its 17 years of continuous control of administration in Australia this huge trading nation does not own one overseas vessel of its own. Australia is the only large trading nation in the world without its own shipping line. Even Switzerland and Czechoslovakia which have no ports have their own shipping lines. We are utterly dependent on overseas shipping companies wbich we know have the main voice in regard to freight rates. Australia pays $600 million each year in freight charges for imports and exports. Much of this money leaves Australia. We must become independent of overseas shipping lines. A shipbuilding yard in Tasmania would become, under a Federal Labour government, a vital unit in the construction of also for overseas trading and the building up of an Australian overseas shipping three such ships built each year in the shipbuilding yards of the Commonwealth, and in seven to ten years we would have a fleet of at least 20 ships operating under overseas shipping lines, with a chance of reducing crippling freight charges. That will be our programme when we become a government and that is why the new shipyard proposed for Tasmania would be a vital unit in the building up of an overseas shipping fleet. Only part of its operations would be for the building of coastal vessels. The following shipbuilding yards exist in Australia at the present time: Walkers Ltd. of Maryborough, which is building ships of 1,500 to 2,000 tons; Evans Deakin& Co. Pty. Ltd. of Brisbane, which is putting in a do-k which will enable it to build ships up to 50,000 tons; the New South VVales State Dockyard at Newcastle, which builds ships up to 25,000 tons; the",26,Shipbuilding
64,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [3.54],"Th eBroken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. yard at Whyalla in South Australia, which builds ships up to 55,000 tons; Adelaide Ship Construction Pty. Ltd., which m-.inly builds tugs; the yard at Williamstown in Victoria, which is for refits and the Cockatoo Dockyard which is mainly for naval vessels. Only three of the yards are capable of building ships of more than 50,000 tons. Most of the firms to which I have referred are associated also with engineering, as the Minister has said. This helps to keep them active when orders are slack. It is vital in this industry to have a continuity of orders. We grant that. It is vital also to have skilled tradesmen and more are now wanted in the yards. Wc admit thai. The labour force required to build vessels of from 50,000 to 60,000 tons would number about 1,000. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) gave these figures and he knows what he is talking about because he worked in the industry. Of the 1,000 men, 600 would be boilermakers and engineers, which would include fitters and turners. In addition there would bc shipwrights, electricians, ship joiners, blacksmiths, plumbers, sheet metal workers and pattern makers. That is the shipbuilding industry as it exists in Australia today. The industry has been slowed down from time to time by the Government's indifference and by the fact that it will not to grant the 33$ per cent, subsidy has lost enter the field of overseas shipping to give thc shipbuilding industry the boost which is necessary. Thc shipbuilding project in Tasmania was outlined by my colleague, the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). Giving background information he explained that the Dutch firm's decision to come to Tasmania followed a year of negotiations with the Tasmanian Government. The company has shipyards in Holland, Ireland, Norway and Brazil. The company knows what it is talking about and it knows how to build ships. Let us never forget that. The the island would be an outlet for choice of a site was a tribute to Tasmania ancl to its Government for what it was prepared to do. The choice of site was a tribute to the width, the beauty and the geography of the Derwent estuary, for the site is at Margate about 20 miles south east of Hobart. The State Government is prepared to help with finance. Because of the shortage of skilled labour, the company is prepared to bring 500 or more skilled men from Holland and is prepared to establish a college at which shipbuilders can be trained in Tasmania. That shows how genuine the company is. It has the know-how gained from years of experience. We are opposed to overseas capital taking over existing Australian industries. I make no bones about that because it is the Australian Labour Party's policy. We do approve, however, the principle of overseas capital setting up new industries in Tasmania or on lhe mainland. This venture in Tasmania would be part private, with foreign investment, and part public, with local investment. This is not a take-over proposal. The industry would not be a private enterprise venture entirely: it would be a government-private enterprise, venture, similar lo other shipbuilding yards in Australia which are subsidised with Commonwealth money, and assisted with cheap loans. Further, in. Tasmania, the organisation would get a cheaper loan to help it get started. This is a proposal for the establishment of another vital shipbuilding industry in Australia, to be established with financial aid from the State Government and a Commonwealth subsidy of 33i per cent, for any ships built for the coastal trade. This is the type of investment that we support. There is no mystery about that. The refusal to Tasmania a $20 million industry which would employ, when fully operating, 2,500 men. These figures were given by the company's representative in Hobart yesterday. They were quoted by the Minister a moment ago-h e said to his horror. I want to mention another point in connection with this matter. It is hoped that in the not too distant future a small steel industry will be based on the Savage River ore deposits in Tasmania, in the electorate of Braddon. This shipbuilding industry on a portion of the production of that steel industry. I point out that 94 per cent, of a ship is steel and that it is best to have shipbuilding yards established as near to steel industries as possible. The situation in Tasmania would be ideal from this point of view. We have the iron ore and we have the limestone, two vital ingredients for steel production. We have plenty of limestone. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson) captained a ship that came across Bass Strait years ago to collect limestone from the Melrose quarry near Devonport. He knows all about the limestone situation. My electorate has large deposits. I want to say also that Tasmania is at present a mendicant State. We are receiving Commonwealth grants to help us. The way out of our mendicancy is to become selfsufficient. The only way to self-sufficiency is through industrialisation, and a shipbuildit will be found at the forthcoming election ing industry in Tasmania would make a large contribution to the industrialisation that is required for financial independence. Surely it ought to be an aim of this or any other Federal Government to help Tasmania become independent of Federal grants. But this Government wants to keep Tasmania as a mandicant State. It has knocked back the Tasmanian Government's request for a thermal power station and for an irrigation project as part of the State's development. bankruptnot lose any tears over that. could lose two seats because of the way in which it has treated us in this matter. Another important point is that the establishment of a shipbuilding yard in Tasmania would make a great contribution to decentralisation. The wider the spread of shipbuilding yards the better it is for Australia, employment position in Tasmania. I would especially in time of war. I believe that, for the reasons given by the honourable member for Bass and by myself, and for those which will be stated shortly by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), a strong case can be made for establishing this industry in Tasmania. The Hobart"" Mercury"" printed a scathing leading article yesterday morning about this Government and its refusal to help in this matter. It printed another article this morning in stronger language. In the articles the "" Mercury"" sets out what it thinks of this Government for selling Tasmania down the drain and for treating the State as though it did not count. In this morning's article it suggests that the Government's attitude is one of "" To hell with Tasmania "". 1 hope that public pressure will cause the Government to reconsider the matter before 1969, for that is too long to have to wait for it to be placed on the drafting board again or to be taken to the Cabinet room. honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) woulJ like to have the Tasmanian public believe that the Labour candidate's campaign committee in Denison, all four members of which wrote fine letters to the "" Mercury "", reflects public opinion. I think that his hopes are as uninspiring as his speech was. As a Tasmanian, I am naturally concerned by the long record of high unemployment in my State and by the latest report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which indicates that the Tasmanian Government, as opposed to the Western Australian Government, is becoming more and more dependent upon Commonwealth payments. I therefore ask: Is the acquisition of a foreign owned shipbuilding company, which apparently will only operate in Tasmania if subsidised, in the interests of the Tasmanian people? Will it reduce unemployment? People in the engineering industry in Hobart will tell you-the State Minister, Mr Fagan, knows this-that it is almost impossible to get skilled men. In today's "" Mercury"" a spokesman for the Dutch company concerned talks about bringing in skilled migrants. Even if Verolme United Shipyards was able to attract skilled labour from the mainland, this would not ease the ask Mr Fagan to request the Hobart Trades Hall to give its views about importing foreign labour into a State which, due to his Government's failure to do anything about it. has had a regrettably high rate of unemployment, forcing many young Tasmanian people to go to the mainland to obtain employment. I note also from today's "" Mercury"" that the Dutch company's plan involves the selling of a large floating dock to the Tasmanian Government, or, as the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) said, to the Hobart Marine Board. I should like to hear the views of the Hobart Marine Board on the purchase of a S3 million dry dock, which, as has been pointed out by the",27,Shipbuilding

Examples include blast furnaces, steel mills, I was interested to note that at question time yesterday the honourable member for Wilmot expressed surprise that the Commonwealth Government had not helped Tasmania with a thermal power station. Is this really surprising in a State which is renowned for its hydro-electric power? The honourable member well knows that his State Labour Party colleagues do not support him on this. His has been a voice crying in the wilderness on this question. I suggest that he go to the capital of Tasmania, place his views before the Premier and the Hydroelectric Commission, which gets the lion's share of the Tasmanian budget, and see just how much support he gets for a proposal to establish a thermal power station. While I am talking about people coming engineering works, let us cut out the political to my electorate, let me say that it is double talk and get on with the action. significant that the Deputy Leader of the If the company considers that there is a Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and not the marvellous opportunity, and if the Labour Leader came to Hobart recently and stated Government in Tasmania agrees with this, as that the Federal Government had not given its spokesman, the Minister for Industrial the Tasmanian Government any assistance Development, says, let that Government on specific projects, except for the grant stop talking and get on with the job of for the Gordon River project.

These activities serve as a buffer to cushion the effect of fluctuations in demand for shipbuilding as well as being important sources of revenue in their own right. As the Minister pointed out to me in reply to a question I asked of him on Fridaythis, of course, did not rate a single line in the ""Mercury"", despite the fact that pages 1, 2 and 3 of that newspaper were devoted to this story-ther e is nothing to stop the Tasmanian Government from encouraging this company to go ahead with the engineering side.

F.127S3/66 -R -[81 1 The final point that I would like to make is that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), in his policy speech for the 1963 Federal general election campaign, saidLabour is vitally concerned lest the control of key assets and industries falls completely into non-Australian hands. . . .

The"" Mercury"" quoted the recent statement by a motor car manufacturer in Australia that it cost 30 per cent, more to send motor cars from Australia to Britain than it cost to send comparable models from Britain to Australia. We on this side of the Parliament have said for some time, quoting tbe Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. in this respect, that it costs more to send Australian steel or manufactured goods to Singapore or Hong Kong than it costs to send comparable goods from Britain or Western Europe to Singapore or Hong Kong, three times the distance. The disparity between freight costs on Australian exports and on Western European exports is notorious. The honourable member for Denison was good enough to mention me in relation to the Gordon River project. It is true that I said during a recent visit to his electorate I have no doubt that I shall have to repeat it since he apologises for the fact that the only specific project which the Commonwealth has financed in Tasmania has been this project. Since the general election for the House of Representatives in 1963, the Commonwealth has tapered off all its funds for specific development projects in the whole continent. The Gordon River project was the only one from which Tasmania benefited. ber can learn the facts just by reading the Budget papers or the answers in "" Hansard"" to questions put on the notice paper by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson), Tasmanian members and me. The honourable member also dwelt on the fact that the shipbuilding company in question was a foreign company. He belittled its intention to bring to Tasmania skilled migrant tradesmen. That State has not been able to attract as high a percentage of skilled migrant tradesmen as the other States have been able at attract. The reason is that Tasmania is the only State in which there has been no hostel for the accommodation of British migrants and skilled migrants from the Continent. I now want to deal with thc arguments advanced by the Minister for Shipping and Transport, which I would think carried more weight and less spleen than those of the honourable member for Denison. The Minister relied on Tariff Board reports. Another Tariff Board report on the shipbuilding industry is now overdue. In my time in the Parliament, there have been three reports by the Board on this industry. There was a reference of the subject to the Board on 24th March 1954. The report on that reference was signed by the Board on 16th June 1955 and was presented in the Parliament by the then Minister for Shipping and Transport on 12th April 1956. The corresponding dates for the subsequent reports were llth December 1957, 30th June 1959 and 25th November 1959; and 14th September 1962, 4th October 1963 and 20th May 1964. out. about four year intervals. between presentations of reports. about four years apart. The dates of signing of the reports were about four years apart. The interval between the dates of presentation of the second and third reports was rather longer than the interval between the dates of presentation of the first and second reports. Tbe difference was in the speed with which the reports were presented to the Parliament. The intervals between the dates of reference and between the dates of signing were approximately four years. It is time there was another reference. I turn now to the attitude of the Australian Labour Party to foreign companies. We believe that where there is an opportunity for an industry in Australia but no industry in existence here, it is primarily the Government's job to pioneer the industry. This was done in Tasmania with the aluminium industry. It was an example of co-operative initiative by Commonwealth and State Labour Governments. The second priority would be an Australian company setting up a new industry. The third priority would be a foreign company setting up the new industry. Never do we accept the",31,Shipbuilding

75,Mr Freeth,There were five years,32,Shipbuilding
76,Mr Whitlam,"The references werefourth choice that there should be no industry at all. Because of the Commonwealth's attitude to Tasmania in recent years, both as regards developmental projects and new industries, it is clear that we cannot expect Government initiative; we cannot expect Government assistance for Australian companies. We are then confronted with the choice between a foreign company setting up a new industry and no new industry at all. In those circumstances the Labour Party comes down unequivocably in favour of the new industry, albeit a foreign one. Migrants, like the Alcorso family, have brought great benefits to Tasmania. The Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) avoids the crux of the problem: Is there enough potential for another shipyard in Australia? This matter comes down to the difference of opinion between the Labour Party and, now belatedly, the Country Party on the one hand and the Liberal Party on the other concerning an Australian overseas shipping line. Several questions have been asked on this subject. It has been raised not only by the Labour Party, although it is true that my colleagues who have spoken today asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport and the Acting Prime Minister questions on this subject. Also the honourable member for Denison( Mr Gibson) last Friday bowled a very sympathetic question on this matter to the Minister. But not such sympathetic questions were put to the Minister yesterday by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Sir John Cramer) and by the retiring honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder). These were accepted by the Minister as being hostile questions. There are Government supporters who see the politics in this matter and they have been just as hostile about it as have been members of the Labour Party. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister in industry are due to over capacity. Shipbuildanswer to a question asked by me referred, ing must be a large scale performance if it if not to his proposals, although he had is to be economic. Under those circumused that word a month earlier in answerstances it is essential that we have a limited ing a question he was asked, to his hopes number of yards and that they be fairly that there should be a viable Australian fully employed. If this is not the case, costs overseas shipping line transporting bulk get right out of hand. The proper growth commodities in large bulk carriers. A few of the Australian shipbuilding industrymlnates later, answering a question asked we all hope it will continue to growby the honourable member for Franklin, the Minister for Shipping and Transport saidIf the revival of interest in the coastal trade continues we may have an assurance of a long term continuity of shipbuilding. . . . His horizons are limited to the coastal trade. That is because the Liberal Party's policy refers merely to coastal shipping. The Labour Party's policy refers to overseas shipping as well. Only this week the Acting Prime Minister unveiled the Country Party's policy which, in somewhat guarded terms, pursues the same line. The company wishing to enter the shipbuilding industry in Tasmania is not asking for special consideration, as the honourable member for Denison asserted. It is asking only for equal treatment. Tasmania knows how its trade with the mainland has been transformed by Commonwealth initiative. The Australian shipbuilding industry could well supply ships for the archipelagos near us-Indonesia , the Philippines and all the Pacific Islands-and , as the Tariff Board recommended in its 1959 report, for New Zealand shipping interests. We should build naval ships. Over the next 20 years we should build sufficient shipping in Australia to carry half our imports and half our exports. To achieve that objective we need another shipyard; why not in Tasmania? -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. -The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) has evaded the point at issue almost entirely. The point at issue is this: Is recognition of this yard in the interests of the Australian shipbuilding industry? Obviously it is not. Obviously the Australian shipbuilding industry has a cost structure which is a great deal higher than those of overseas industries. It is obvious also, at least to anybody who looks at the facts, that the high costs in the Australian shipbuilding",32,Shipbuilding
77,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Drury).,,33,Shipbuilding
78,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [4.24].,"depends upon keeping its costs within reasonable bounds. This is not in accordance with the proposition put forward today by the Opposition. The circumstances in which the Opposition's proposition is advanced are remarkable. Tbe proceedings of the House are not being broadcast today. The Opposition has chosen to initiate this debate when we are not on the air. Why? Let me tell the House why. The Opposition has done this because the debate is a sectional one. It is meant to get publicity in Tasmania but to be ignored in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. The Opposition does not want its arguments to be heard outside Tasmania. It is engaging in good old parish pump politics, hoping to bring forward these sectional matters and to ignore, by suppression, their effect on other States. Only last Friday the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Jones) who, I understand, is a member of the Opposition, agreed with the Acting Prime Minister that it would be sheer folly at this stage to recognise an additional shipyard. The honourable member is not present today. It is characteristic of members of the Opposition that they try to make sectional appeals, hoping that the pluses will go to one place and that the minuses will never be heard. What is their attitude, for example, to the Ord River Scheme in this connection? It is well known that the technical advisers in the Department of National Development, including at the time the present honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson), wanted to grow sugar on the Ord. When the honourable member for Dawson was elected to represent a sugar growing area, what did he say? He said nothing about the proposal to grow sugar on the Ord. The House will see how it goes. The Government made a very wise decision not to grow sugar on the Ord. Perhaps the honourable member for Dawson would have preferred the decision to be otherwise when he was in the Department, but now that he represents a sugar growing area, he says nothing about the proposal to grow sugar on the Ord. This kind of thing is characteristic of this parochial about this? Should we try to dice debate. The Opposition wants the publicity to go out to some places but not to others. It is Temarkable that the Labour Party is now advocating the interests of a foreign owned firm. I thought it was opposed to foreign capital. What about the seven Australian firms that have already applied for and been refused a subsidy for shipbuilding? Is the foreign owned firm to have precedence over Carrington Slipways and Watson Pty. Ltd., both of New South Wales; Dillingham Shipyards of Western Australia, Ray and Co. of New South Wales, Bundeng Ltd. of Queensland, Princes Launch Service of Western Australia, and Hornibrook of Queensland? These seven Australian companies stand in the queue ahead of the foreign owned company. Are their interests to be diced? Why is it that the Labour Party suddenly finds this sympathy for overseas capital? What is the use of saying that this is a new industry? It is not a new industry. There is already over capacity in the indusiry. Everything done here will displace Australian firms in favour of a foreign owned firm. It would be a different matter if the industry were one in which there is insufficient capacity in Australia today, but this is not the situation at all. The position is that there is over capacity in the industry at present. Seven additional Australian firms are waiting in the queue to get in on the subsidy as soon as new capacity becomes available. But my friends from the Australian Labour Party come out and advocate the interests of a foreign owned firm in priority to the seven Australian firms that are already waiting in the queue to be recognised. Why should the Dutch firm have preference over them? firms not recognised? honoiable member why they are not being recognised. It is for the very good reason given by the Minister, that there is over capacity in the industry at the present moment. The Governnient has a plan that is working. Under it, the tonnage of ships being built Ln Australia is increasing, the amount of work in Australian shipbuilding yards is increasing and opportunities will be provided for new firms to come in. But good Australian firms are in the queue ahead of the Dutch firm. Can we be the interests of Australia to get a little political advantage?

The main purpose of this Bill is to vary the legislative provisions in relation to the emforce survey in the six capital cities gives ployment of married women as permanent officers in the Commonwealth Public Service. For the future, permanent female officers in the Commonwealth Public Service will not, on marriage, automatically lose their permanent status. Also, married women will be eligible for appointment to the Service. This Bill should have the approval of the Parliament. Judged by public responses to date, it will have the endorsement of the community at large, and certainly that of the various women's organisations. The Bill removes an element of discrimination against one section of our work force, or potential work force-a n element deriving from social attitudes of another era. It must not be thought that, when the Bill becomes law, married women will for the first time be eligible for employment in the Commonwealth Public Service. Nothing could be further from the truth. Married women are employed in the Public Service now. In fact they presently comprise about one-third of all temporary female employees. crimination against married women only to But henceforth the Commonwealth will be permitted to retain on its permanent staff trained and experienced female officers who marry, and to recruit qualified married women. Thus, this group of women will not be denied the opportunity to pursue a full Public Service. The increasing tendency for Australian married women to work has received considerable publicity in recent years. The tremendous contribution which married women in the work force have made in emphasis. The same sort of thing has been happening in other developed countriesindeed in some like Britain, Canada and the United States of America the trend has been even more evident than in Australia. Between 1954 and 1961 the number of married women in the work force in AustraJia increased by 148,000 or 57 per centwhile the total female work force increased by 214,000 or 25.3 per cent. The male work force increased in the same period by 10.8 per cent. I have no doubt that the recent census will show that married women are continuing to enter the work force in large numbers. The Statistician's sample work us some indication of the trend. The latest figures, for May 1966, show that 37.3 per cent, of all married women aged between 20 and 44 and 26.7 per cent, of those aged between 45 and 64 were in the work force. The comparable figures in May 1961 were 30.9 per cent, and 23.8 per cent, respectively. I believe we can expect these trends to continue. However that may be. provisions which deny to the Commonwealth Public Service the services of women, highly skilled women, women often trained witb Commonwealth funds, are no longer tenable. Other employers have not been subject to this sort of restriction. This does not seem to be a case when it is necessary to persuade the Parliament of the good sense of, and justification for, a measure. So let me pass to explain the Bill's provisions. The principle we are following is to treat married women officers and married women recruits similarly to other officers and recruits. We are not removing the disreplace it with discriminatory provisions in their favour. So, married women will be treated on an equal footing with their",35,Victoria
89,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forcolleagues so far as status, recruitment, prosions for absence in relation to childbirth. motion, transfer, discipline and so on are concerned. Married women officers will be subject to all the provisions of the Public Service Act and other relevant rules. Consequently, their recruitment will be subject to the normal selection processes. Their continued employment will be on the basis of efficiency and be dependent upon their observing the same conditions and code of conduct as all other officers. I am stating only the obvious, having regard to what I have already said, when I say that they will be liable to the normal disciplinary procedures, which may result in dismissal if they fail to observe the relevant provisions -for example, if they do not attend regularly and assiduously to their duties. This is the normal rule where married women are employed, and there can be no exception in the case of the Commonwealth Public Service. Married women, particularly those with young children, may feel the burden of domestic responsibilities more than other officers of the Service. But this is equally the case in other areas of employprovision is in general accord with those ment. And if they cannot meet normal conditions they cannot expect to be carried on the permanent staff. I have no doubt that married women in the Public Service will fully understand this. It is, of course, a matter for decision by the woman at any time whether she desires to continue in the Public Service as a permanent officer. Although there are many married women temporaries in the Commonwealth Public Service now, it is rather difficult to predict the use of sick leave and other entitlements the sorts of problems that could be presented employed in some sectors. I am thinking of areas of employment such as those where odd hours of duty or conditions of service apply, which might result in special problems for the employment of married women. We gave a deal of thought to this and decided to make provisions so that, if experience shows a need for some special provisions relating to the employment of married women in particular areas of the Service in order to safeguard the efficient running of the Public Service, this can be done by regulation. The inclusion of this regulation-making power is no more than a necessary precaution, The decision to permit married women to be permanent officers necessitates proviPublic Service Act which provides that any Of course, the circumstances of confinement differ from case to case, but it is universally accepted that women should cease to be actively employed some time before childbirth and not be permitted to resume for some time after confinement. For example, the relevant International Labour Organisation Convention provides for a period of absence of not less than 12 weeks of which not less than 6 weeks is after the birth. The Government proposes that any officer who is to have a child shall absent herself from duty for a minimum period of 12 weeks. Provision is contained in the Bill for an absence of up to six months, at the option of the officer. It will be for the woman to decide whether she uses any sick 1/save, recreation leave or furlough entitlements which she may have, to cover her absence or some of it. Otherwise, the absence will be without pay. Although conditions vary in the different countries, it can be said that this in the public services of the United States of America, Britain and New Zealand. The whole idea behind these proposals is to allow women who wish to continue in employment to be granted the necessary leave without jeopardising their career. I think there will be general agreement that what is proposed in no way conflicts with the principle of equality of treatment; rather it recognises, in a reasonable way, the needs of these female officers. I again stress that to cover absence for childbirth is entirely were permanent officers at the option of the officer. Incidentally, experience in countries with similar social attitudes to our own suggests that the majority of women terminate their employment when they are to have children. It is not anticipated that a different situation will prevail here. However, the proposed provisions will enable those women who anticipate returning to employment after their confinement, to do so with full retention of their employment rights. Those officers who cease, upon marriage or later, may, if they desire, subsequently apply for reinstatement to the permanent staff, subject to the normal conditions applied to other former officers of the Service. I turn now to an existing provision in the female officer with 5 but less than 15 years' permanent service who retires upon marriage shall receive a payment based on her years of service. This is commonly known as the marriage allowance. It is proposed that those women already in the Public Service should continue to beeligible for this allowance if they retire on marriage, since it can be argued that the marriage allowance was part of their original contract of employment. But, as the 'marriage allowance was introduced as a form of compensation for the loss of career-unde r the marriage bar embodied in existing legislation-it is logical to eliminate it now that of the Commonwealth who are married this bar is being removed. A corollary to the decision to permit and will equally apply to married women married women to be employed in a perwho may be employed by approved authorimanent capacity in the Commonwealth Pubties of the Commonwealth under the conlic Service is the provision for them of ditions applicable to other employees of pension and like rights.

92,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Treasurer ) tributors the existing benefit provisions that the next question was whether the existing rates of contribution prescribed for females would be adequate in the future. This question was put to the Commonwealth Actuary but he has advised that it will not be possible to determine the adequacy or otherwise of the existing contribution rates until he has some knowledge of the numbers of married women who will become contributors and of the experience of this group as regards invalidity, mortality, &c. He has therefore recommended that the existing rates of contribution should continue to apply for the time being and this Bill makes no variation in those rates. However, the rates of contribution for females will be reviewed by the Actuary in conjunction with the next quinquennial investigation of the Superannuation Fund as at 30th June 1967. The admission of married women to the Commonwealth Public Service and as contributors for superannuation presents a new possibility-that a husband and wife may both be permanent officers and may both be contributors. This raises the further question of the amount of pension to be paid when both the married woman and her husband have retired. A case could be made for some restriction upon dual benefits, especially where the husband predeceases the wife who would otherwise, upon his death, be entitled to a widow's pension in respect of his contributions in addition to the full pension in respect of her own contributions; there is a precedent for such a restriction in an existing provision of the Act which limits the total pension payable to the widow of a former contributor who, as a widow, and therefore a single woman, subsequently becomes a contributor in her own right. On the other hand, there are strong arguments for treating each contributor as an individual who has paid the full cost of contributions during service and therefore for paying both pensions in full. The Government has decided in favour of the latter course, and the Bill therefore provides no restriction upon dual benefits where a husband and wife have both contributed. Moreover, the Bill repeals the existing limitations upon widows who become contributors in their own right. Any widows who were contributors and who have retired and are now receiving pensions in respect of both their husbands' and their own contributions will therefore receive an increase in pension when the Bill becomes law. Honourable members will appreciate that this Bill makes some rather progressive changes. Many schemes that presently admit married women as contributors for superannuation confine their participation to personal benefits or provide for them to receive only a lump sum benefit on retirement. The only distinction between benefits for male and female contributors that will exist after this Bill is passed is that the widower of a deceased female contributor will only qualify for pension if he is wholly or substantially dependent on her at the time of her death. This is believed to be a reasonable requirement in our society and one that will minimise any increase in rates of contribution for females that might later prove to be necessary. It is necessary to make some further benefits incidental changes. For example, because they could not be reappointed to the Service, the Act now makes special provision in relation to a female who is retired on the ground of invalidity, marries whilst in receipt of pension and subsequently becomes restored to health. This provision is repealed by the Bill to place married women in the same position as other invalidity pensioners and a number of other consequential amendments is made. However, owing to the extreme pressure of work upon the Parliamentary Draftsman and his staff at this stage of the parliamentary session, it has not been possible to attend to all the minor consequential changes which are seen to be necessary such as to provide for the disposition of her pension upon a married woman pensioner being detained as a patient in a hospital for the insane or committed to prison. Clearly, such matters are not urgent and it is proposed to attend to them in a further bill early next year. But I can assure honourable members that the Bill now before the House contains all the provisions necessary for the admission of married women as contributors and for the payment of benefits to them or to their dependants upon their retirement or death. I regard this Bill as an important measure and I commend it to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron) adjourned. (No. 2) 1966. Bill presented by Mr Howson, and read a first time.

95,Mr Connor (Cunningham) [5.1],"Th eit were functioning fully, have an enrolment of about 1,700. On present indications its enrolment will scarcely reach 1,000. The reason for this is simply that the University College is in tutelage, in vassalage; it is dependent upon and under the control of the parent body. As a result of certain happenings within my constituency, and certain negotiations or discussions between the Universities Commission and the Council of the University of New South Wales, there is a very substantial and growing demand for complete autonomy for a distinct Wollongong University, and J propose to address my remarks specifically to this subject. At the present time about 50 per cent, of the students are emploj'ed in local industries. To gain tertiary education they must sacrifice their leisure time by attending either on specified days or at night. In the School of Metallurgy, as an example, at Wollongong University College there are no fewer than 150 students. It is the largest such school in Australia. But, typifying the treatment we have received, there are only six senior instructors, senior lecturers or senior tutors to meet the needs of these 150 students, while at the University of New South Wales itself, where only 75 students are enrolled in the School of Metallurgy, there are 18 senior instructors. There is, of course, a professor at the University of New South Wales; there is none at Wollongong. I may say that the present agitation a fully documented case both to the commenced with the raw deal we were being Minister and to the Universities Commishanded by the Council of the University sion, with a request that wit-iin their of New Soulh Wales following thc decision functions as defined by statute they should of the present Government to impose an institute the fullest possible inquiry into the overall cut of the order of 20 per cent, present situation and the relationships on the recommendations of the Universities between Wollongong University College and Commission.

In fact, at one stage it was in full, but it contains full documentation reported on the most reliable authority of the association's proposals for an autothat we were to lose the arts, science and nomous university. The association goes so commerce building which the Government, far as to suggest that in particular there to its credit, has restored to the list in the should be an interim council replacing the Second Schedule to the Bill. This has present advisory council of the University highlighted public interest in the University College at Wollongong for that purpose, beCollege. It is not that such interest has ever cause in its present form there is a majority been lacking, but it is at fever heat at the moment. There is strong resentment of the treatment we have been receiving from Sydney, and this has directed particular attention to the present deficiencies at Wollongong. These deficiencies are concerned with staffing and with the type and variety of courses available. I might at this point refer the House to a report, published in the "" Australian "" newspaper of 15th October, cf an address by Senator Gorton, Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research, at the opening of additions to the University of New South Wales. He said that we may have to build more universities. He said that many university campuses were already overcrowded and that their enrolment should be restricted. He said that if this occurs it will require as a corollary the establishment of some new universities such as we are seeing in Macquarie, Newcastle, Latrobe and Monash. He went on to say that there should be a rationalisation of faculties amongst the universities so that they eould concentrate on developing a high standard in certain fields, lt might be fairly contended that the senator should have had in contemplation the particular needs of an autonomous university at Wollongong. I speak with the authority of both the academic staff association ot ihe college and also of the students' union when I put these facts before the House. I propose to present I have here a letter from the president of Kensington men on that University and empire building being what it is, whether amongst academics, businessmen, in commerce or anywhere else, Kensington does not intend to let Wollongong go. Nor do the empire builders there want to see any part of their domain diminished by the establishment of a separate university. Conconfining its growth within a narrow conversely, Wollongong is being tolerated and barely tolerated. The College there is a necessary evil. It will be curbed and kept under restraint but not eliminated. It has been receiving the most shabby and contumelious treatment from University of New South Wales Council. I say this with due respect for the minimal representation we have there in the person of Dr. Matthews, who has had the welfare of Wollongong University College at heart right since its inception. These are some of the facts: Wollongong. of course, is a unique area. Its University College is a separate individuality. It is an between the professional staff at Kensington individuality which is being nullified by the fact that the College and the courses it offers cannot adequately reflect or serve the needs of the region in which it is situated. It cannot reflect or serve those needs because it is tied academically and administratively to the University of New South Wales. In contradistinction, the University of New South Wales is a large open university set up to meet the needs of a diverse metropolitan area. The University College at Wollongong on the other hand is in the centre of tertiary industry for an area which comprises not only the industrial complex of Port Kembla but also extensive coal mining and primary producing districts. It is therefore situated in an area of highly specialised regional needs and fits self of the terms of the Act-to have such precisely within the context of Senator Gorton's remarks. We are mindful, of course, of the particular problems of our sister steel city of Newcastle which had a similar struggle for autonomy-whic h it ultimately achieved. Wollongong is going through precisely the same cycle that Newcastle passed through. The victory Newcastle achieved will, we hope and intend, be achieved by Wollongong in the fullness of time. As I already pointed out, Sir, the College is at present prevented from adequately serving the needs of the Wollongong district because the University of New South Wales has made it a policy to refuse to allow Wollongong to introduce subjects or courses in which it does not intend to offer similar courses. The University of New South Wales has consistently regarded local interests and has hampered the college by scription. The result for Wollongong has been fragmentation-fragmentatio n of existing courses of a large university, where neither the pattern of development of that university nor the fragmentation of its pattern of development could be considered appropriate or relevant to Wollongong's situation. Even the examination papers are drawn up at the University of New South Wales. They are based on syllabi drawn up in that university. Given this framework the role assigned to the academic staff at Wollongong University College is one of insignificance. It must be stated, of course, that relations are by no means inharmonious and their counterparts, or the senior lecturers, at the Wollongong University College. But I think this is the nub of the whole problem: The attitude of the University of New South Wales towards the Wollongong University College has prevented that college from introducing in their due order courses in Geography 11, Geology II .

The report laid this down as a guiding principleThe development of Wollongong University College should be continued at a rate sufficient the future development and expansion of these to meet regional needs with due regard to the resources of the technical college serving the area. Development in fact is not proceeding at a rate sufficient to meet those developmental needs. As I have said, by the early 197G's, instead of an enrolment of 1,700 we will be lucky to achieve an enrolment of 1,000. That is due to the fact that we are being deliberately stifled. So far as the University of New South Wales is concerned it is not a case of spreading scarcity evenly; it will take what it needs and, if anything is left, Wollongong might get some consideration. But the situation is so bad that in many cases vacancies in lectureships and tutorships, both full time and part time, have been left unfilled for months and even for close on a year. In many cases the requirements which have been imposed by the University of New South Wales in deciding on the successful applicants have been so high that persons have been discouraged from pressing their applications. What1 am about to say may give in closer detail the disadvantage being suffered by some groups of students. In first year Arts there are 120 students; in second year Arts there are 50; in third year Arts there are 12 only because they can major in History and nothing else. Some 15 have already gone to Kensington to study English III. ln English III there are 20 students who would, if it were possible and if facilities were available to them, complete their course at Wollongong University College. For Economics If l 40 students are offering. For Psychology II 80 students are offering. But none of these courses is available. For Geography II 100 students are offering but no course is available. For Economics II 50 students are offering. I refer now to the local reaction. A letter from Mr M. J. Syer, the County Clerk of Illawarra County Council, is typical of the many letters of protest that 1 have received. He expresses on behalf of his Council the gravest concern at the present situation at Wollongong University College. In a letter dated 18th October, he statesAt present Council is one of the largest employers of tertiary education level staff in the district, having approximately 25 per cent, of its staff actively engaged on courses at university and technical college level. Any attempt to restrict facilities would have a serious impact on the Council's requirements and, subsequently, on the commumty as a whole. It is obviously impossible with the present relationship between the two institutions ever to achieve some harmonious balance. Within the next triennium it is the objective of the academic staff, of the students union and of the citizens of the city of Wollongong and adjoining districts to achieve autonomy. 1 have burdened the House at some length with the gravamen of their complaints. Time will not permit me to deal in detail with the next point, but 1 add that I have received from Mr Chegwidden, the president of thc students union, a mass of letters of protest from individual students who had stated their particular needs and the hardships under which they are placed because of their inability to complete their full course in most subjects at the Wollongong University College. But I say in conclusion that this battle in an industrial district will be waged in a traditional manner. It will be waged by the academics and by the working men alike because there are plenty of people within my constituency who have not had the opportunity in earlier life of achieving tertiary education, and who would undoubtedly avail themselves of the opportunities if full courses were available in the various faculties. There is an urgent need for autonomy. I repeat that it is my intention to place the full facts before the Minister and the Australian Universities Commission with a request for an immediate and urgent full time inquiry. The House is debating a number of measures dealing with thefinancesof universities and of advanced educational institutions. What the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) has said is indicative that in at least one relatively small universityI do not say this disrespectfullythere are inadequacies in the provision of funds. In the sort of world in which we live and in the light of a number of statements which have been made about how",42,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966
98,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [5.27],"much the Government has at heart the future of this country, I think one should be concerned that anywhere in Australia any student is deprived of the opportunity to receive university education if he has the competence to take it. Unfortunately, that is the situation in Australia and it is the situation in Wollongong. It is the situation in the great and older universities of Melbourne and Sydney where quotas have been applied in order to limit the number of students attending a university and to keep out of a university people who, because of their talent, should be going to a university. I suggest that this is a very serious circumstance in Australia in 1966. 1 have said before that the Government contemplates the future as though the year was 1066 rather than 1966. Whereas it should be looking 10 or IS years ahead, it seems to have a hand to mouth approach. Surely in this year the tragedy of university educationI know that it is easy enough to shift the blame-is that the recommendations of the Australian Universities Commission, a body set up by the Government to recommend to the States and the Commonwealth what the expenditure ought to be in three year periods, have not been accepted and that what it has recommended for this triennium has been cut back, not only in respect of what are called annual and recurrent items but also in respect of capital items. I want to show in a moment what the nature of expansion ought to be in Australia in the next 10 years or so. Some of the larger universities, and even the smaller one referred to by my where they may even have to reduce staff or certainly will be unable to take on the additional staff that they require. It is a little difficult to find out from these measures what is the Commonwealth's expenditure in this field of education. Large sums are mentioned, but no attempt is made to equate them with other expenditures. UntilI went to a rather handsome document published by the Commonwealth and entitled "" The Commonwealth Government in Education "" I found it difficult to ascertain national product devoted to education will the expenditure by the Commonwealth on universities. In an appendix that was inserted in order to include the 1966-67 estimated figure, I discovered that this year the Commonweallh will make grants to the States for universities totalling 554,500,000, in round figures. In addition, it will pay to its own university-the Australian National University-the sum of SI9.6 million. Further, it wili give assistance to Australian students-the y are not all university students-amountin g to about S26 million. Sums of about $74 million for university education and about $26 million for assistance lo Australian students seem to represent an impressive contribution by the Commonwealth, but when we come to relate them, as we ought to do, to what it is estimated will bc spent not only on university education but on the whole of education in Australia this year and in the foreseeable future, we quickly see how inadequate the contribution is. I should like to refer to some very interesting figures, some of which have been cited by one or two of my colleagues. The figures were given in a lecture delivered at the Tenth Theodore Fink Memorial Seminar in the University of Melbourne on 4lh October 1966-onl y a few weeks ago-by Professor Peter Karmel, ViceChancellor of the Flinders University, South Australia. He entitled his lecture "" Some Arithmetic on Education"". He showed that for the year 1965-66, the last complete year for which figures arc available, thc total expenditure on education at all levels by both private and public sectors was $A788 million, to which the Commonwealth had made a contribution of $94 million. The figure will be higher this year. The expenditure on universities alone in the year 1965-66 was $155 million, of colleague, face the situation which the Commonwealth contributed in the region of $65 million. So the major part of university finance in Australia is still provided by the States, not by the Commonwealth. Professor Karmel estimated that thc proportion of the gross national product now being spent on education in Australia was 3.8 per cent. He anticipates that if the full fruits of education are to be available to all Australians who will require them, within 10 years the proportion of the gross have to be between 4 i per cent, and 5 per cent. Let us see what this really means. It is a reasonable assumption that by 1975 the gross national product of Australia will be at least $30,000 million, assuming there are no variations in price levels. If we take the figure of 5 per cent, that has been mentioned, by 197S the annua] expenditure on education should be $1,500 million, as against the projected expenditure of about $800 million for this financial year. Even if we take the lower figure of 4} per cent, mentioned by Professor Karmel, the amount required will be $1,350 million-a n increase of something like $550 million over a period of less than 10 years. This means that the amount to be devoted to education in Australia every year should be increased by a minimum of approximately $60 million. After all, what we strive for in education and to say that for every $1.85 that the is to educate more children. We have relatively more children to our foial populato contribute another $1. But the Comtion than ever before, and our population is rising. We aim to keep those children at school longer. We aim to educate them in smaller classes and with much more sophisticated equipment. More of them go on to the secondary and tertiary levels, and we demand that they should be educated by teachers with higher qualifications. These are the kind of things tha' lead to a rapid acceleration of expenditure on education. Unfortunately, you can put very simple thumb screws upon the natural expansion of education. You can cut down in two relatively simple places. You can cut down the rate at which you train teachers and you can cut down the provision of capital facilities for education. These seem to me to be the methods by which this Government is retarding the proper progress of education in Australia. There is inadequate provision for teacher training and there is inadequate provision for capital expansion. Therefore, the Government is able to say, unfortunately, that we can only spend such and such a sum on education this year because it is no good sending children to schools that are not there or sending them for higher education to places where there is not the stafl to teach them. These are the limiting factors-the sort of things that the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) spoke about. He pointed out that in the Wollongong area people who want to go to universities and who, if they did go, could be used subsequently as teachers or could be employed in industry, are not being put through the institutions at all. This seems to me to be an appalling sort of situation; but the Government seems to be very complacent about what it has done. I suggest that there are other figures which are worthy of contemplation here. I refer in particular to a table which Professor Karmel submitted with his lecture and which deals with the proportions of their budget-, which State Governments and local authorities devote to education. There again is one ot the rather simple little thumb screws that the Commonwealth is able to put upon the natural expansion of education. It is very easy to talk about matching grants States spend the Commonwealth is prepared monwealth exercises the major financial control in Australia. The other day I spoke about how the University of Tasmania tried to resist increasing its fees because it believes, rightly, that owing to the nature of economic development in that State, thc per capita standard is some $200 less, on the average, tban in mainland Australia. Surely we do not regard education as something just for an elite group. We are a democratic community that believes that everybody who has talent should be given an opportunity to develop his talent. The Tasmanian Government believed that the talent of that State could best get to tbe universities if fees were kept low. Because it kept the fees low, the Commonwealth, through the machinery of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which operates under the terms of section 96 of the Australian Constitution, penalised the State by reducing the grant that would otherwise have been made to it. I suggest that the honourable member for Denison( Mr Gibson), who comes from Tasmania, should think about that and consider whether it is a reasonable kind of approach. ber suggest that this was a Government decision? ber believe that it was a Government decision? able member suggested that it was. ment decision?",44,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966

Does the honourable member intend to shelter behind the subterfuge that it is not a Government body? control its decisions. act of this Parliament to enable certain States to function at the same level in a Federal system as that at which the other States function. The decision was a Government decision. This Government, through its Treasury, was happy to back it. I suggest that the honourable member for Denison listen to me while I read paragraph 129 of the Thirty-third Report of the Commission. It statesTbe Commonwealth Treasury agreed with the general principle of the Commission's treatment of University finance. The Treasury suggested thai face up to the aggregate expenditure that the Commission should make an adverse adjustment in lhe case of each claimant State equal in amount to the burden of the budget on any abovestandard contribution to its University. The above standard contribution was the contribution by the Tasmanian Government of more of the revenue of the Government of Tasmania instead of the people of the State being asked to pay higher fees. If the honourable member, after listening to the terms of paragraph 129 of the report, does not believe that the Commonwealth Treasury made the decision, all I can say is that English must have been taught in Tasmania slightly differently from the way in which it was taught in Melbourne when I went to school. mission apply this reasoning to other fields apart from universities? Does it not apply its reasoning on university fees also to railway freights and fees? am trying to make is that in the matter of university finance this Government appears to be falling back on the subterfuge that the responsibility is solely a State one. I want to get back to the figures given by Professor Karmel in his lecture with respect to expenditure on education as a proportion of the total expenditure on goods and services by Australian State and local government authorities. In 1948-49-the first year given-recurren t expenditure on education was 30.2 per cent, of State and local government authority Budgets. By 196S-66, the proportion bad risen to 41.9 per cent. The figure for capital expenditure rose from 2.6 per cent, in 1948-49 to 9.6 per cent, in 1965-66. So, in 1965-66, State and local government authorities spent on education alone more than half their total revenuesa considerably higher proportion than 17 years earlier. Yet honourable members opposite seem to be satisfied that the principle of matching grants is equitable. In my view, the principle of matching grants, applied in the way proposed here, makes impossible the satisfactory functioning of education in Australia. The Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research (Senator Gorton), in a statement made in another place, has put on the shoulders of the States responsibility for the failure to the Australian Universities Commission recommended for tbe triennium from 1967 to 1969 inclusive. Tbat is a convenient device for the Commonwealth to adopt. But it is one that is intolerant of the real financial problems of the States and indifferent to the proper understanding of education in Australia. 1 believe that Professor Karmel's figures are not exaggerated. They represent careful projections made in the light of the number of children already born. Apart from a few young people who may migrate here in thc next few years, almost every child who will attend a university in Australia in the next 20 years has already been born, for one does not get to a university until one is 17 or 18 years of age. The Government knows now what the projections will be as far ahead as 1975 and 1985. Yet, in the face of an expanding child population, this financial year it proposes to reduce expenditure by some of the most firmly established Australian universities. Any government that seeks to justify that kind of approach seems to me to have vacated its responsibilities altogether. What the Government does not seem to realise also is the increasing proportion of expenditure on education that is now devoted to capital items. It seems to me that this trend will continue for a long",46,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966

108,Mr Crean,"It docs. The point that Itime. For many years yet, we shall have an expanding child population and we shall face the need for more schools. This imposes a crippling burden on State services. I was interested to note that the Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia adopted an objective which is stated by saying that it did not believe that the entry of students into various courses should be restricted by forecasts of future needs. It meant the demands of industry rather than the needs of a population for education. The Committee went on to say that these would circumscribe educational opportunity and involve the risk of grave error. I agree with that diagnosis. I do not believe that a democratic community can say that only a certain percentage of the people is capable of university education and that the rest should somehow be directed elsewhere. Yet, in many ways, that seems to be implicit in the kind of approach adopted by this Government. At present, many people capable of university education are being denied it because there are not enough scholarships and because too many parents cannot afford to educate their children at universities. One of the difficulties in Tasmania was that unless a prospective student lived in Hobart he had to go there to board, and the facilities for boarding were inadequate. This sort of thing was mentioned by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie). All these problems are problems that are not being grappled with. I do not go all the way with some of my Government has to double its expenditure colleagues in the idea that the institutions in this field in the next 10 years or so it that represent an alternative to the univerwill have to match its financial provision sities are not quite as good as the univerwith the needs of students. In my opinion sities. I believe that idea is bad. In my the measures are inadequate in terms of curview, at present some people are going to rent need. For convenience three measures universities simply because there is no other are being debated together. They give us an place for them to go. That seems a fair opportunity to ponder upon our fundaenough comment. Because there are no mental problems. alternative institutions, there is nowhere else to go. Broadly speaking, if a student has matriculated a university is the only place Deputy Speaker, would this be a convenient for him to go to continue his education. The time to suspend the sitting? facts are not satisfactory in my view. The new tertiary institutions that are now proposed may alleviate the university problem, but they will not alleviate the total problem, have been in this place I have often, when because the expenditure per student in those requested, made concessions to people on institutions will not be much less than in the other side, but I have rarely received the universities. You will still require staff equal courtesy from them. But it does not for a long time-probabl y university trained. You will still require advanced and sophisticated capital equipment. But surely in a democratic community our whole emphasis on education should not be that it is necessary for industrial purposes or some other reason. To my mind education has a purpose in a democratic society independent of the fact that it is necessary in order to earn your daily bread. There should be time to pick lilies as well as time to eat bread. Surely our cultural needs as well as our economic needs should be satisfied. At least it was gratifying to see that observation made by tbe Wark Committee. If you like you can say that we need only a certain percentage of engineers or other categories of skilled people. One thing of which you cannot always be sure is that if you obtain your required percentage, they all will see the course through. Some may be excluded from other faculties, as happened in Wollongong to people who want to study economics. In many respects that is an arid course to follow, but if people choose it it is their free choice to make. In terms of this country's needs in an approaching age of abundance, if we systematically maintain our economy, it is a tragedy that anybody should be denied the opportunity of higher education at any level. So whatever government is here in a few weeks' time, it will have to spend considerably more on education than has hitherto been spent. I will not argue at this stage whether this money should be found in this way rather than in that way but if the",47,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966

This examination should be made in the light of needs rather than allow the situation to drift as at present. I again remind the House of the tremendous wastage of female talent in this country. Last year there were 50,000 or 60,000 young men in our universities but only 20,000 or 21,000 young women. Somewhere along the line 40,000 young Australians with equal talent, equal social background and, apparently, equal opportunity as far as their parents were concerned, dropped out of the academic race. Everybody associated with teaching or education will admit that the talent was there but that it was some social disability which removed these people from the academic field principally on the basis of their sex. This is not something that can be challenged on the basis of finance nor even of supplying new facilities. It is something which the nation should students and probably the cost would be tackle. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the sitting, I was dealing with some of the problems that still remain unresolved and in fact have not so far been tackled by the Australian Universities Commission or found their place in general Government planning for education. 1 briefly mentioned the wastage of female talent in the community. A tremendous amount of talent lies equally in the female section of the community as in the male section, yet the figures show there is a tremendous wastage of female talent. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Chaney) was sitting at the table when I said this before the sitting was suspended. He said by interjection that perhaps the young women did not want to go on to universities. This may well be so; but their lack of desire to obtain a higher education is part of the social pattern. In other counmore readily available. tries, women play a much more effectual part in the top branches of administration, science, law and government, for that matter. Australia is lagging behind in recognition of the talents of womenfolk. Last year the universities held some 40,000 more young men than young women, yet at every level of education the academic effort of the young women is equal to that of the young men. Therefore, the only reason for their falling out of the higher levels of the educational system is a social one. Somewhere along tbe line someone does not want to keep them in the education system. They may feel inhibited about going on to the higher levels, or their parents may feel some incapacity about it or do not feel the pressure necessary to help them to continue. Perhaps it is some element in society itself that is lacking. But I believe that this is one aspect of tertiary education that so far has not been examined thoroughly or tackled adequately. There is a tragic human waste. The other point I was making related to the failure to face the problem of university accommodation throughout Australia. 1 believe that expansion of accommodation for students at the smaller universities and university colleges throughout Australia would make a substantial contribution to improving the capacity of universities generally to take lower than the cost of any other method of achieving this result. For 1966, the University of New England has 4,310 students and Newcastle 1,990. The projection shows that in 1969 New England will have 4,420 and Newcastle 2,260. It seems to me that the general facilities around these university colleges could be easily expanded to cope with perhaps twice these numbers. This may not be so with New England now, but perhaps another couple of thousand students would not impose a tremendous strain on the established capital resources there. The community must accept the probability and the possibility, and I think the desirability in many ways, of students shifting from State to State. Australia will be advantaged when people move around it freely. I understand that this is a regular feature of life in other countries. At many American universities, it is almost obligatory for students to live in. It is the custom in a good many British universities. In the older British university cities civilian accommodation is probably Accommodation for students is a problem we must meet in Australia; we must erect adequate accommodation.

112,Mr Bryant,"Before the suspension ofplan effectively for the accommodation of thousands more students by simply putting up adequate buildings. The accommodation does not need to be of the rather luxurious type that is sometimes provided for university students. Sometimes the cost of accommodation for an individual student is almost as much as the cost of housing provided by the State Housing Commissions for families. The type of accommodation that could be provided and is desirable for students is worth a close study. The present accommodation is much too expensive. Perhaps this is so with the service blocks that are being erected. The average family cannot afford to pay £7 or £8 a week-o r $14 or $15for the accommodation of a student child. When fees and other expenses are added, university education becomes an impossibility. I suggest that the Australian Universities Commission, the present Government while it remains in office and the incoming Labour Government must tackle these problems. I want to deal now with some of the principles that lie behind other matters that we are considering now. The Government appointed the Australian Universities Commission to examine the structure of universities in Australia and to make recommendations to the Government. There is no doubt that the Commission carries out its task very thoroughly. But we have created a system of filters. First, the universities determine their needs, perhaps after discussions between the departments within their own structures, and I presume that the universities submit a statement of their requirements to the Commission. Then the Commission undertakes a rationalisation of all these requests. If honourable members turn to page 193 of the recent report of the Commisison, they will see the way in which Monash University has been treated. I do not know whether this procedure is correct. I do not know whether the requests of Monash were reasonable or extravagant, but this shows the process of filtering that goes on before the requests of universities reach the Government. Even when they reach the Government, the process of filtering continues. Many of the principles adopted by the Government in education have not been explained. The Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research (Senator Gorton) has asserted quite often that universities are not necessarily open to everybody who has matriculated. In other words, the Government does not believe that university doors are open to all qualified people. There is still a tendency to regard university education as the education of the elite. Somewhere along the line, we ought to decide what proportion of the population we should expect to reach the universities. Why should it be 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, or whatever the percentage is at the moment? Not only does the process of filtering exist in the financial field; it exists also in the academic area. Sometimes students are excluded from universities in an arbitrary way. I believe that this has happened in the Victorian matriculation examinations, and I am pleased to know that the authoriites in Victoria will examine the whole system. We should decide that our universities and the senior tertiary system of education of Australia will be capable of accommodating perhaps 25 per cent, of the population. I am not convinced that the projections we have before us from the Australian Universities Commission, and before that from the Murray Committee, are based upon a rational examination of the social factors at work. I represent an industrial area. There has been a substantial and almost dramatic rise in the number of people who have matriculated in my area. The pressure being exerted on universities to provide places for students is increasing. In the past four or five years in one part of my electorate the number of young people intending to matriculate has risen from 30 or 40 to 160 or 170. The number has gone up fivefold. member. they are inspired to greater effort. But the fact is that this is evidence of social change. Statisticians and demographers can say how many people were born at a given time and how many people will be in Australia in perhaps 15 years time. But this does not give a true guide to the number of students who will seek admission to universities. A dramatic change has taken place, particularly in working class areas, and parents are now willing to pay large sums for the",50,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966

I did much the same sort of arithmetic at school as the honourable member for Robertson did. But simple arithmetic does not allow for the social changes that are taking place. I believe that the projections are based on an inaccurate evaluation of the rights of citizens to enjoy the benefits of higher education. I will not go through a statistical analysis now, but, if the honourable member is fortunate enough to be returned after the election, we will show him what we mean to do about education. At some stage we can have a statistical argument. I am giving the facts of Hfe as I find them in one of the vital and most politically perceptive areas of Australia third report of the Universities Commission. -the area that returns me to the Parliament. Some principles must be established. 1 believe that access to the universities is an important one, but it is not recognised by the Government and nothing has been done about it. In Victoria, more so than in New South Wales, the academic principles applied are more restrictive than they ought to be. I believe the geographic aspect deprives many people in Australia from the opportunity of undertaking university education. Difficulties imposed by geography have an effect. This brings me back to the question of accommodation, which I raised earlier. Then there are the resources inside. It is time we had a national attitude to university education and to tertiary education in general. As one of the wealthiest countries in the world it is not necessary or valid for us to compare ourselves with another country. It is time we established principles of our own. This evening I want lo refer lo university libraries. Probably the most important part of a university is its library. In the third report of the Australian Universities Commission the following appearsThe Commission has always placed great stress upon the crucial role of the library in a university. The library has to serve teachers and studentshumanists and scientists-and while it must offer a first-class general coUection, it should also provide sufficient specialised material to enable the highest possible level of research to be carried out in a variety of chosenfields,l l is at this point particularly that most, if not all, of the university libraries of Australia show a decided weakness. While substantial sums are being made available to the universities in the measures before the House, they are still not adequate nor do they seem to face the real problems lying in university libraries. The Universities Commission said alsoThe Commission is strongly of the opmion that positive steps to remedy this deficiency are urgently required. I believe it will take more than the measures now before us to remedy this deficiency. There are substantial differences between the universities in Australia. Sydney University is the most richly endowed, particularly with books, but Melbourne University, which is in one of the wealthiest parts of Australia, lags seriously behind. Honourable members will find interesting figures relating to university libraries on page 113 of the It is interesting to refer to principles that have been established in other parts of tbe world. The American Libraries Association, for instance, recommends a library budget of not less than 5 per cent, of the total education and general budget of an institution. An examination of the university libraries in Australia reveals that university libraries are what might be described as the students' sore spot, particularly in Melbourne University. Melbourne is in a parlous position with its library. There are about 600,000 volumes in the Melbourne University library, and that university has 13,000 students with seating accommodation for 1,100. Sydney University, on the other hand, although it has 16,000 students, has about 1,300,000 volumes. The seating accommodation in our university libraries is completely inadequate, and even with the additional accommodation for 700 to be",51,States Grants Advanced Education Bill 1966

After referring to comparison between Sydney and Oxford the article statesWithout commenting on this, let us consider the publishers who bind too expensively, who library position of a Sydney student relative say print for specialised overseas markets and to a student at University College, London. The latter has not only the College library of 520,000 who pile up on the cost of printing and volumes to draw on but also, practically side by publication various distribution charges. side with it. the central university library. This By publishing the necessary books locally latter is itself equal in size to the University of Sydney library.

Honourable members may be interhappens. Our grouch from this side of the accommodation. Adequate library accommodation and facilities represent a serious lack in Australian universities at the moment. However, it is not one of the most difficult problems to tackle.

Research work is not a matter of cases, specialised equipment must be Unfortunately the universities are again Government department that comes under notice of that Committee makes the enough highly trained administrators and there is a dearth of high grade professional this part of the programme from S5 million to $3 million. It is reducing its half share of the programme by SI million a year, or £500,000 in our old currency. This is something to be very much regretted. Under the new procedure introduced only las. year a committee known as the Australian Research Grants Committee was established. It is led by Professor Robertson, an eminent and very capable man, and he was surrounded on the committee by a very solid body of members. The Committee was established to make awards for research projects carried out by individuals or by groups of individuals. They do not have to be people attached to universities, but as it has turned out so far almost all these projects are being carried out within universities or with the use of university facilities. It is interesting to see just what received 1,151 applications from individuals has happened in the period of a little more than 12 months in which this Committee has been in existence. It has been given a pretty free hand in making its grants. It is allowed to make grants for projects without any regard to a balance between States or between universities or between different disciplines of academic study and research. It merely takes each application on its merits. If it decided that all the most worthy ones came from Victoria, or even, to narrow it down further, from Melbourne University, they would be the ones accepted, and the grants would be made in respect of them. Naturally enough, it just does not work out that way. However, the Committee has been given a quite free hand in making this kind of arrangement. But there is provision in the legislation covering the Australian Research Grants Committee that if the research to be engaged in by the individual or group of individuals is carried out within a State university or with the use of State university facilities, then the particular State has to match the Commonwealth's grant. One can readily see where this could lead. It might happen in any year or any succession of years that one State would incur a disproportionately large part of the research burden, which is really carried out on behalf of the whole of Australia. It could happen under this kind of arrangement that Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales or any other State involved itself in an unduly large programme. The question that springs to my mind straight away is: How can any State prepare its budget in anticipation of this kind of arrangement? How can a State know, when it is planning its annual budget, what the Research Grants Committee is going to approve for that State? It is all very well for the Commonwealth; it can simply say: "" We are going to provide $5.5 million over the three year period and we expect the States, whoever they may be and in whatever proportion is required of them, to be able to match these grants once the Committee decides which projects are to be supported "". ln the short time in which thc Australian Research Grants Committee has been in existence it has received a great number of applications. I remind the House that it came into operation some time in 1965I think it was August-and in 1965-66 it or groups of individuals. All of these people, of course, must be graduates; only postgraduate research is involved. With the amount of money that was made available by the Commonwealth and the States, only 406 of these applications, not much more than one-third of the total, could be catered for, despite the fact that the Committee said that all but about 40 or 50 of these applications involved projects of distinct merit. In other words, something like 750 applications of distinct merit had to be rejected because there was not sufficient finance available. The Commonwealth and the States between them in this period that we are just concluding provided about S4 million, and that amount was sufficient to cover roughly one-third of all the applications. If the total number of applications that were made had been approved thc Commonwealth and the States between them would have had to provide $16.3 million, but all that was available was just under S4 million. This is what happened in one year only. 1 can only wonder how the Commonwealth can expect anything like a reasonable number of these applications to be satisfied in the three years ahead if all we are going to provide is S l l million, half of it to be matched by the States if they can do so. I remind the House that a number of the States are already indicating that they will have very considerable difficulty in matching the Commonwealth dollar for dollar in respect of the projects that are approved. The heavy-handed way in which the Minister has dealt with this situation, the crude, dominating and dictatorial attitude displayed in his speech-and this apparently represents the Government's attitude-quit e amazed me. The Commonwealth is saying that to the extent that a State fails to match, It means that governments will largely dedollar for dollar, the grants by the Commonwealth for these individual research projects, the Commonwealth will make a deduction from the $3 million which represents its share of the money to be provided for university research on recommendations of the Universities Commission. If these are not standover tactics I do not know what are. In other words, the Commonwealth is prepared to wield the big stick to the extent of saying to the States: "" If you do not go along with us and provide an amount to match our grants for these individual projects that are approved, we will cut off from your State university programme an amount equivalent to the amount by which you fail to match our grants for individual projects."" I do not know whether all members of the so-called Liberal Party of this Parliament realise just what the Government is doing to the States under this so-called Federal system under which we exist. It is dictating not only to the States but also to the universities. Where are all the cries for academic freedom in the universities? Where are all the cries of protest against the intrusion of the Government into the running of our universities? I do not hear them. They certainly do not come from the Government's ranks. Here the Universities Commission recommends a programme of $10 million but the Government comes along and, without giving us one notion of why it rejects this programme, says: "" We reject this and instead of giving $10 million to the universities-the Commonwealth and the States contributing-for them to decide what research projects they want to carry out we are going to cut it back to $6 million "". The Government is saying it will decide for the most part which projects are to be carried out in Australia through the operations of this special committee which it set up. The Government says that most of the universities research will be dealt with on an individual research basis. There will be individual programmes or group programmes as approved by the outside committee and on advice of the Commonwealth Minister. This is an intrusion of the first order into the . running of an important part of the university programme. It means that governments are going to intrude, apparently, and this is the thing that the universities have always been worried about. cide what sort of research programmes are to be carried out in Australia. This is in line with the general tendency that has been going on in this place in the last two or three years. The Government wants to carry out research programmes which are of immediate consequence mainly to the economic welfare of the community. I can see that we are going to have less and less devotion in education to research in the pure sciences and more and more demands by governments on universities to carry out practical, immediate, utilitarian forms of research. There can be no other explanation of the Government's attitude. If there is, I would like to hear it. Why is there rhis denial to the universities who, traditionally, over the years have united their research work with their teaching work? The universities no longer are to be given this privilege. Universities often say that research, especially so far as their staff is concerned, must go hand in hand with teaching. If you seek a good lecturer at a university you find it is generally rhe man who is also associated with research. His teaching ability is enriched by his continuing interest in furthering the bounds of knowledge. The research enriches the teaching. I will agree that just because a man is a research man he does not necessarily make a good teacher. I found that out to my own pain in days past. But generally it is true that there ought to be this integration of research and teaching. This will be denied to the universities. The Government's decision will have a lot of other consequences which I am not going to label tonight. But it could have serious consequences regarding the staffing of the universities. The first thing that a person usually asks when coming to an Australian university from overseas is: "" What opportunities exist within the university for me to run a research programme?"" Such programmes, in many cases, are oriented and initiated by the lecturer himself. Here in Australia he will have to run the gauntlet not so much of the university where he is working and from which he seeks employment but the gauntlet of this outside body which advises the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth in turn dictates to the States and intrudes on their rights in this whole programme, lf the States only realised it, today they are vassals of the Commonwealth. They are the clerks around the place. They are just the administrators in a petty way. AU the decisions are being made at the behest of the Commonwealth. These committees have been set up at the behest of the Commonwealth and their members are chosen by the Commonwealth. The States get only some kind of passing inquiry as to whether they approve. Generally the only inquiry made to the States is: "" Will you be able to match this programme?"" This year. 1 think for the first time, the States were, invited to say whether they would be able to divert enough money from other parts of their programme to match the grant by the Commonwealth. SoI launch my protest here tonight. If it is good enough for the Universities Commission-agai n set up by the Commonwealth-to make a recommendation that a minimum, an absolute niinimum, of $10 million should be made available to the universities for research, earmarked for research, and the Commonwealth only conies up with 60 per cent, of that $10 million, then I think it is about time the Government gave us some explanation of its policy. It should explain its change of policy in taking out of the hands of our universities most of the decision about what kind of research programmes are to go on within the universities and to be serviced by the universities. Why should some outside committee be given this task? As I have indicated, Mr Speaker, this decision could well have repercussions on the staffing of many of our universities. I know that the universities have been rather sore about the dislocation in the programmes that they set in motion only a couple of years ago. The universities received a sudden jolt a little over 12 months ago when they were told that the $5 million they expected to get in that triennial period was to be cut back by $2 million. A sum of $2 million was taken away from the universities and put in the hands of this committee which was to make recommendations and awards to individuals and groups of individuals rather than to universities themselves. I can see the case for making grants to individuals. I can see a case for co-ordination of research in Australia. 1 can see a case for obviating the duplication that has gone on in different universities in Australia. There has not been enough co-ordination and, as the Universities Commission says, there is still not enough. But this is not to deny, surely, the necessary requirements of the universities to have at least the level of research that they have been carrying on for years. The Government should give the universities their money. If it wants to do this extra thing I am quite happy to subscribe to it so long as it does not mean taking anything away from the universities, or mean intruding into the proper sphere of university study and academic freedom or mean the pursuit of only the immediately valuable kind research programme. If that is so 1 am quite happy to support thc kind of body that has been set up. I do not think I need say much more than that, Mr Speaker. I think somebody ought to make a protest about it, because there is no explanation in the Minister's speech for the 40 per cent, reduction of the Universities Commission's recommendation for the universities. There is no explanation of why the general capital grant to the universities for research programmes should be cut. I finalise my remarks by saying that Australia needs all the first class men it can get for postgraduate study. This must be the destiny of Australia. If it has not got a large number of people then it is going to need to cultivate the best brains it can locate and identify in order to progress. I do not think that the Government is going the right way to achieve this in this Bill. [8.48] -The honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) has made a series of rather extraordinary charges under the heading of what he has called a protest. To begin with, he says that the Government, in consultation with the States-althoug h he did not mention that specifically-cu t down by 40 per cent, the sum recommended by the Australian Universities Commission for research. He spoke on this at great length. He also spoke about the Australian",54,States Grants Research Bill
121,Mr Bridges,"MAXWELL (Robertson)Research Grants Committee. But at no stage did he mention the total funds being granted for research in the next triennium. He merely said that there would be a 40 per cent. cut. The truth of the matter is that there is to be a 50 per cent, increase over what the Commission recommended. The Government has cut the Commission's recommendation to $6 million but it has given an additional $11 million for research through the Australian Research Grants Commission. The honourable member went on to draw a whole series of conclusions from this about academic freedom, the problem of staffing universities, and other matters. The honourable member is one of several spokesmen for this Party who have advocated continuously over this last 12 months the setting up of a national science foundation. Yet when they get a body which is what they have referred to and which operates in the same way as the Minister has regarded as a miniature national science foundation, a body which is giving to the universities the very academic freedom which the honourable member for Barton is accusing us of taking away, the Government is criticised.

The honourable there will be any difficulty in getting staff member said that the research work that from overseas for the universities. There was to be undertaken in the universities is every indication still in Australia that would, because of this government interthere is no brain drain and that we are a ference that he said came in, be more net importer of higher degree men. not practical and utilitarian and that the basic research would not be undertaken. I defy him to pick out of the list of the Robertson Committee grants made yesterday for the next 12 months any research other than basic research. Consider the $8,000 which is to go to Professor Robinson of the Department of Animal Husbandry or the $4,000 which is to go to Professor Emmens. This is basic research of a fundamental nature. There is no foundation for this charge that the honourable member made in which he said that the research work to be undertaken in universities, because of the set-up of the Robertson Committee ber talked with the universities about this? have discussed this with the universities. I happened to work as an administrative officer in a research department of the University of Sydney for five years before I came here. Amazing. things should amaze one occasionally. The honourable member for Barton having sought a national science foundation approach for Australian research, when he gets it takes a totally wrong attitude to it.

Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Freeth) read a third time. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 2Isi October (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. measure basically is of substantial importance to the people of Australia. Perhaps many people in this country have no direct interest in the question of thc payment of a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, but it is the function of the Parliament to ensure that it enacts legislation which will assist the Australian economy by permitting the maximum production of agricultural and pastoral commodities. Whether we like it or not, it is indisputable that our agricultural and pastoral lands are deficient in various elements, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen. In those circumstances, those who have the responsibility for guiding the economic destiny of this continent must appreciate that if it is to have the maximum production of primary commodities artificial fertilisers must be available in adequate quantities at reasonable prices to the farming community. On2 Ist October 1966 the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), in introducing this Bill, indicated to the Parliaclover, red clover and other types of clovers ment that a subsidy would be payable to the primary producers in respect of fertilisers with a nitrogen content. He said that this would enable the application of fertiliser to their lands and wou'd increase substantially the production of agricultural and pastoral commodities. He said that nitrogenous fertilisers had a particular significance in the production of sugar and fruit. He went further and said that experiments now being undertaken in Australia by research students showed that we could expect a substantial increase in the production of cereals such as barley, oats and wheat, and that with the application of nitrogenous fertilisers we could expect increased production of other agricultural commodities. In speaking of nitrogenous fertilisers, we refer particularly to sulphate of ammonia and urea. It wili bc appreciated that the nitrogen content of urea is substantially higher than that of sulphate of ammonia. Those agriculturists who purchase urea will have the advantage of a bounty that has a relation to the nitrogenous content of urea. The same applies to sulphate of ammonia. In 1961 and again in 1963, when measures relating to the payment of a superphosphate bounty were before the Parliament, the Labour Opposition' indicated that if it became the government of this country it would subsidise artificial fertilisers with a nitrogen content to an extent relative to the subsidisation of superphosphate. Unfortunately, the Opposition did not become the government of the country, but we feel that our attitude was justified. Tonight we see the results of our pressurisation of the Government reflected in the measure that is now before the Parliament for approval or otherwise. We have no doubt whatsoever that it will be approved. Those honourable members who have some knowledge of primary production are aware that one of the best methods of introducing nitrogen to the soil is by the cultivation of clovers and other nitrogen producing plants. Subterranean clover, white clover and other members of the clover family, as well as some other plants, impregnate the soil with nitrogen. But although primary producers may sow subterranean clover, white clover, Dutch which impregnate the soil with nitrogen through the nodules which form on their roots and which extract the nitrogen from the atmosphere, there are certain circumstances and certain environments in which nitrogen cannot be introduced into the soil satisfactorily by this method. In those cases,",59,States Grants Research Bill

129,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [8.55],"Thisthe only alternative is to use the artificial cent, of what primary producers are now fertilisers which are available, such as sulphate of ammonia and urea. The Minister for Primary Industry, quite rightly and prompted by the Labour Party in this Parliament-the Minister smiles, but that is a fact-ha s introduced this measure to provide for the payment of a subsidy to encourage the utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers. For a long period now we have been very fortunate in Australia in that we have been able to produce substantial quantities of nitrogenous fertilisers from the by-products of the gas making industry, the electrolytic zinc industry and the chemical industries, but we have not been able to produce enough to meet all the needs of Australia's primary producers. Therefore, we have been confronted with the necessity to import as much as 44,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia a year from overseas countries. That is a most undesirable state of affairs. Fortunately, we are beginning to snap out of that particular disadvantage because, with the discovery of natural gas fields, we shall, if the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government are sufficiently alert, be able to put on the market for utilisation by the primary producers of Australia, as a derivative of natural gas, a nitrogenous fertiliser which will cost approximately one-half of what they are paying for the nitrogenous fertilisers they are using today. My researches reveal that the average cost of nitrogenous fertilisers in Australia is now about S31 a ton. The most dependable estimates available indicate that, with the use of natural gas, we shall be able to produce nitrogenous fertilisers at less than one-half of what they cost today. I do not think that even my friend the Minister for Primary Industry will deny that. able to start production shortly in Brisbane with the use of gas from the Moonee field. Primary Industry indicates that he hopes that production of nitrogenous fertilisers from gas discovered in the Moonee area will begin shortly in Brisbane. Does he admit that it will be produced for SO per paying for nitrogenous fertilisers? We know only too well that one of the greatest users of nitrogenous fertilisers is the sugar industry. Another great user of sulphate of ammonia and urea is the fruit industry. A third great user of these fertilisers is the vegetable growing industry. We know, too, that if we could reduce the price of nitrogenous fertilisers to half their present price, the wheat grower, the oat grower, the barley grower and the pasture grower would be stimulated to increase production by at least 100 per cent. In other words, the production of primary products for home consumption and export could be increased by 100 per cent. I admit that research into the utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers is not yet complete. For that matter, research into the utilisation of any fertiliser for primary production purposes is not yet complete. But I make so bold as to predict that if, within a reasonable period of time, the Governments of Victoria and Western Australia, who have control over the offshore production of natural gas in their respective States, together with the Commonwealth Government, are courageous enough to take control of the production of natural gas on behalf of the people of those States, and indeed of the Commonwealth, it will be possible to market nitrogenous fertilisers in Australia at half the cost today. It will be possible to export to the markets of the world a substantial volume of primary products at prices which today would be unprofitable but which in the future will return substantial dividends to the Australian economy. In these circumstances, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition supports this measure because it provides for a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers used by the primary producers of Australia. I am sure that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly), who has just made an interjection that I could not hear, is as one with me in condemning this Government for standing idle for more than 12 months, though it has sovereign control over offshore gas and oil discoveries, while the Governments of Western Australia and Victoria indolently ignore the need to determine promptly what authority, Commonwealth or State, shall be allowed to",60,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966

They are in a position to exerDevelopment ( Mr Fairbairn) what the cise vital control over the volume of Commonwealth Government is doing about primary production not only in those two the offshore deposits of natural gas. My States but also in every other State. Some efforts have been without result. We are months ago, in company with my friend, told that conferences with the respective the honourable member for Melbourne Ports States are proceeding. But they do not ( Mr Crean), I had an opportunity to consult one of the most eminent experts on natural gas in Australia. I asked him whether it was reasonable to say that natural gas could be used to produce nitrogenous fertilisers at a cost at least SO per cent, below the present cost. I shall not name this gentleman. I shall give you his name privately afterwards, if you wish, Mr Deputy Speaker. He answered: "" That is correct"". At the time at which I discussed the matter with him, nitrogenous fertilisers were selling in Victoria at £31 a ton. My friend from Melbourne Ports will confirm that this expert agreed that these fertilisers could be produced from natural gas to sell at £15 a ton. Yet we witness the disgraceful spectacle of the Commonwealth Government, which exercises sovereign rights over offshore deposits of natural gas, fiddling about while tbe State authorities argue with the Esso Exploration Australia Incorporated and Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd interests about who shall distribute the natural gas. In the interim, primary production is retarded and producers are denied the opportunity to benefit by the use of nitrogenous fertilisers purchased at £15 a ton instead of £31 a ton.

137,Mr Pollard,"There is no richer gas for the extraction of nitrogenous fertiliget anywhere. Within the last week, a conference between representatives of the Victorian Government and the Federal Government has been held in Canberra, but the outcome has been absolutely nothing. The wrangle between the Esso-BHP. interests and the Victorian Government goes on. Yet the Commonwealth Government, which is at complete liberty to exercise its inalienable rights, is content, as it were, to fiddle while Rome burns and to allow the primary producers and the consumers of industrial gas to be deprived of the heritage represented by these rich natural deposits. Jf ever there was a case for condemnation of a government, this is it. The discovery of natural gas offshore in Victoria is the most revolutionary discovery of the era. But the Bolte Government and the Holt Government have allowed an unholy dispute to arise between the Victorian Government and the Esso-BHP. organisation. In November 1965 the Minister for National Development announced that early in 1966 legislation would bc introduced to deal with this problem. It is now October 1966 and we still do not have the legislation. Australia's deposits of natural gas remain untapped offshore in Victoria. Not only industrial enterprises but also primary producers in this country are deprived access to these deposits. This will go down in history as one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of our industrial development. Do honourable members opposite deny my assertions? The Commonwealth has sovereign rights. I have no particular objection to the Commonwealth's entering into agreements with the States, but the present evasiveness on the Commonwealth's part is due to the fact thai it is the creature of private enterprise and is not prepared to face up to its responsibilities and take control of this God given natural resource. After all, the GovernmentI see the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) paying rapt attention-is deeply involved in this matter. If the States, particularly Victoria, arc not able to obtain agreement about the development of these resources, why do they not come back to the Commonwealth? Why does the Commonwealth not say to the Esso-BHP. combine: "" If you are not prepared to make this vast and rich deposit available to the people, the F. 12753/66 -R [82] Commonwealth will ensure that it is made available on sensible terms?"". But the Commonwealth does not do that. It is dead from the feet up. It is the creature of vested interests. There can be no question of that. The situation surrounding the offshore gas deposits is a scandal of the first water. After the Victorian Gas and Fuel Corporation has spent 12 months in negotiations, the Victorian Government has announced that no agreement has yet been reached. Now the Victorian Government says that it will create a piping authority which will construct pipelines to convey the essential elements to the manufacturers of nitrogenous fertilisers. The Victorian Government says that it will not place development of these resources in the hands of the Gas and Fuel Corporation but will itself create a piping authority. But lo and behold, when the composition of the piping authority is announced we find that its members are those persons directly concerned with the payment of dividends and profits to private enterprise in Victoria and other parts of Australia. These people will be vested with the power to determine the price paid for natural gas. Can anybody opposite deny this? Of course not. If what I say is wrong why has the Victorian Government refused to allow the Gas and Fuel Corporation to develop these deposits? Why does the Victorian Government want a separate authority to control the pipeline and the prices paid for the product? This is the greatest racket ever known in Australia and history will justify my remarks. In 1962 the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and I visited a semi-public instrumentality in Rome. There we were furnished with details of the activities of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi -a n instrumentality created by the Italian Parliament and known as E.N.I. The E.N.I, organisation controls the entire gas deposits of the Po Valley, the entire petroleum distribution of Italy, the right to acquire foreign concessions in the Middle East, North Africa and Egypt suggest that the honourable member get back to nitrogenous fertilisers.",62,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
138,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order! IThe E.N.I, organisation produces and controls the distribution of gas for industrial purposes. It controls and distributes petroleum in every segment of the Italian economy, lt builds its own boats for the distribution of fuels. It controls engineering works that construct drills used on gas and fuel deposits. It controls the seeking of concessions in the Middle East, Egypt, North Africa and Morocco. In addition it controls the vast petro-chemical instrumentalities that function in Italy producing petro-chemicals for the ultimate production of rubber. The basic element of petrochemicals is butadene. The organisation controls the vast fertiliser complexes at Ravenna and elsewhere in Italy which produce fertilisers for the Italian farmer. It produces nitrogenous fertilisers from natural gas. Overall it sets an example for the people of the world to follow. It constructs its own pipelines, retails the quarrelling Governments of Western its own products and provides amenities for its employees equal to any in the world. It employs a greater percentage of academic personnel with university qualifications than does any other instrumentality in the world. It sets an example in tbe exploitation of natural gas and petroleum that should be followed by every country. It would do Government supporters good to go to the Parliamentary Library, do some research, and discover what this instrumentality has achieved for the Italian economy. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very tolerant. Lest you think that I have strayed somewhat from the subject matter of the debate, might I suggest that what has happened in Italy, which has a population far greater than Australia's, might be the model for what we do here in the future. Por more than 12 months we have had full knowledge of the wealth and the potential of the deposits of gas and petroleum in offshore Gippsland. But within the last fortnight the Minister for National Development has had the effrontery to say that, owing to a shortage of parliamentary draftsmen, the Government has been unable to draft the essential legislation required to handle this discovery in Victoria and, for that matter, offshore from Barrow Island. It has been my experience in 30 years of parliamentary life that whenever the Government is tardy in introducing essential legislation it lays the blame on the shortage of parliamentary draftsmen. The fact is that the Government is the creature of vested interests in Australia. It is the creature of Broken Hill Pry. Co. Ltd., of the great oil and petroleum interests and of the petrochemical industry in Australia. It is completely deaf to the needs of the primary producers. The petro-chemical extraction of nitrogenous fertilisers would reduce by 50 per cent, the cost of this valuable item for primary producers. If the fertilisers were retailed at half the present price, the cost of production in primary industries would be considerably reduced. This would enable us to compete on equal terms with other primary producers in the world's markets. I do not think my friend the honourable member for Wakefield would disagree with me. Although this sessional period has only a couple of days to run, I make a plea to the Government to get busy and to say to Australia and Victoria that this National Parliament wili itself handle the distribution of natural gas and petroleum for the benefit of the nation. I have no more to say. The Australian Labour Party supports the proposal to pay a subsidy on the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. [9.32] -The Parliament has been very fortunate to hear the two speeches already delivered on this Bill. The first was delivered by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann'), who introduced the Bill. He set out our needs for nitrogenous fertilisers. The second was delivered by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). He explained how we should be able to gain nitrogenous fertilisers from natural gas. However, I would like to raise several other points. The Minister in his second reading speech explained the vast importance of nitrogen to Australia and to the world. He said that, if we are to be able to maintain both our present rate of development and our standards of living, we will need healthy and developing rural industries. He also saidThe increasingly competitive nature of world markets, with severely depressed prices for some of our products, notably sugar, requires that we not only increase agricultural output but also achieve this without undue increases in cost. By the application of improved techniques, including",63,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
139,Mr Pollard,] will come to that.,64,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
140,Mr Bridges,"MAXWELL (Robertson)adequate fertilisation of the soil, we must strive for maximum economic production from all our lands. The introduction of a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers will mean that use of the two major plant nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous, to promote the production of bigger crops, more wool, meat, milk and butter, fruit and vegetables and other products of the land, will be directly encouraged by thc Government meeting a significant part of the cost of fertilisers containing these plan! nutrients. Later on he said that the nitrogen subsidy will give some relief from increasing costs for the fruit and vegetable growing industries. He then saidI should add that these sugar, fruit and vegetable industries did not benefit from the Government's superphosphate subsidy to anything like the same extent as the pastoral and grain growing industries which are the main users of superphosphate. The Minister explained the importance of nitrogen in plant growth. If I may say so, he gave a very good explanation. He then explained the development of the use of nitrogen in other countries and showed that Australia is a relatively small user of nitrogen fertilisers. He saidIn Australia the main users of nitrogenous fertilisers in thc past have been the sugar, fruit and vegetable industries, where the use of nitrogenous fertilisers is essential for efficient crop production, the improved techniques that may well folln these intensive industries the high cost of fertilisers is an inescapable and major item in the cost of production. I have no knowledge of the sugar industry and cannot speak about it. The fruit and vegetable industries, however, must use these high cost fertilisers. They must use nitrogen, but they have difficulty in using legumes as a rotation crop or to build up nitrogen in the soil. The pastoral industries, of course, are able to plant clovers and get nitrogen in that way. However, the Minister said in his speech that one of the main objectives of the Bill is to encourage the increased use of nitrogen for the growing of grass and consequently the development of our meat and wool industries. He said that the other purpose is to improve the sugar, fruit and vegetable industries and also to improve cereal production as a result of research work that has been undertaken in these fields. I agree completely with all the contentions of the Minister. I believe that this is a most important measure. The case for the use of nitrogen has been extraordinarily well put to the Parliament and the Bill undoubtedly deserves the support of all honourable members. The Minister referred specifically to the fruit and vegetable industries. He said that they have been major users of nitrogenous fertilisers. He addedThe fruit industries, especially, contribute signicantly to export earnings but export markets are highly competitive and price-conscious and there is need to reduce costs or to produce more wilh no greater cash outlay on fertilisers. I have referred to the fruit industry. In particular, I refer to the citrus industry centred on Gosford in my electorate. The orange industry will face big difficulties in the next five or ten years with a tremendous increase in plantings, particularly in the areas covered by the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The Bill will be of benefit to the fruit industries. The quantity of oranges exported from the central coast of New South Wales is not large. The oranges go mainly to the Sydney market. But as a part of a national industry it will face quite a few problems. I agree that the encouragement given by this subsidy is needed. There is a need to improve productivity for a whole range of our primary industries and this will come from the use of nitrogen and low. This will undoubtedly result in a saving on imports of fruits and vegetables and will also improve our competitive position with the products we export. The cost of the subsidy is shown in the figures that the Minister gave in his second reading speech. He said that the total usage of nitrogen in Australia is about 70,000 tons a year. The subsidy is $80 a ton of nitrogen. The cost of the subsidy for a full year on these ngures will be approximately $5.6 million, but the value to the Australian economy will undoubtedly be many times this figure. This Bill, significantly, eliminates one form of nitrogenous fertiliser-bloo d and bone-whic h is a by-product of the meat industry. It is, of course, the main organic fertiliser. The fertilisers specifically covered by the subsidy are inorganic or manufactured nitrogenous fertilisers. Blood and bone is a fertiliser that is primarily used for fruit and vegetable industries. It js an expensive fertiliser on a per unit basis of nitrogen, but it does have special application, particularly on sandy soils and soils where there is a heavy rainfall and where inorganic fertilisers are liable to be leached out. Blood application of 1 lb. of nitrogen a year and bone fertiliser, when put on to such soils, is slowly released into the soil and made available to the plants. It has special application in an area like the fruit and vegetable growing districts in the mountains behind Gosford, where these conditions are apparent-wher e there is a relatively high rainfall, where there is sandy soil and where inorganic fertilisers are liable to be leached out of the soil. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture recommends the use of blood and bone manure if the economics and price are right. About 30,000 tons of blood and bone fertiliser are produced annually in Australia as a by-product of the meat industry. In 1961, 28,889 tons were produced; in 1962, 33,064 tons; in 1963, 30,821 tons; in 1964, 27,559 tons and in 1965, 31,942 tons. Figures have not yet been produced for this year. There is a fluctuation in the annual production. It depends on the number of beef and sheep slaughtered, but production averages about 30,000 tons annually. Blood and bone is a registered fertiliser under State legislation. Its nitrogen and phosphorus contents vary between abattoirs. I have been advised by the New South Wales Metropolitan Meat Board that, for instance, an analysis of the blood and bone fertiliser produced at the State abattoirs at Homebush indicates that it has an 8 per cent, nitrogen content and a 6.5 per cent, phosphoric acid content of which I think 4 per cent, is citric acid soluble and 2.5 per cent, insoluble. However, there is a variation in the blood and bone fertilisers sold in quantity of blood and bone fertiliser used Gosford today. I checked with a couple of companies and was informed that the nitrogen content varied from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent. There is also a difference in price. the Commonwealth Statistician because he It seems that we can expect an average nitrogen content of 8 per cent. Blood and bone is a registered fertiliser and the abattoirs have to adhere to certain standards because the fertiliser is checked by State departments, and the producers are liable to befinedfor any deficiencies. Blood and bone can be described as a because it smells somewhat. dual purpose fertiliser in that it provides both nitrogen and phosphorus to the soil in almost equal quantities. Where the been left out of this legislation because of State department recommends, for an orange tree producing about four or five bushels a year in the Gosford district, the and approximately the same quantity of phosphate, this can be achieved by applying 121 lb. to 15 lb. of 8 per cent, blood and bone manure. This fertiliser does not provide potash, which may be needed. However, I have been advised by the State department that in the Gosford district at present there bas possibly been an over use of potash. Blood and bone fertiliser is an expensive proposition, but where young trees are growing on sandy soils its application can be of great benefit. The total production in Australia each year averages about 30,000 tons. If this is reduced in terms of nitrogen, it represents 2,400 tons annually, so there is not a vast quantity of nitrogen produced as .compared with the richer nitrogenous fertilisers of an inorganic nature-for instance, urea, which has a 46 per cent, nitrogen content. Blood and bone manure is applicable dependent on the economics and the price. It will be placed at a considerable disadvantage by this legislation. Why has it been left out of the subsidy? It cannot have been left out because of the cost factor. The quantity of blood and bone fertiliser produced each year would not increase substantially, because it is a by-product of tbe meat industry. However, if it is placed at a disadvantage this could have some effect on the meat industry, because that industry will have to stand the cost if other fertilisers become more popular than or replace blood and bone manure. I am informed that the in home gardens is small. I think this can be confirmed in same ways, although I have not been able to get actual statistics from does not keep such records, nor do the abattoirs keep records of what quantity of this fertiliser is distributed in small packs. But one has only to vis't a produce store and look at the stocks of fertiliser tbere to realise that blcod and bone manure is not quite so popular as other fertilisers, either for the retailers or the householders, Blood and bone fertiliser cannot have the cost factor. AI said, it represents only 2,400 tons of nitrogen annually. If this attracted the subsidy of $80 a ton, this would cost $192,000 each yiar. In this legislation assistance is given to the use of inorganic nitrogenous fertilisers as a food supplement. In the Minister's second reading speech he said that 2,000 tons would be used for this purpose and this would cost $160,000. I ask: Why has blood and bone manure been left out? I have written to the Minister about this, but he has not supplied the reason for its omission He has advised me that blood and bone manure has been rejected. 1 make a plea that it be included, because it is a valuable fertiliser in certain parts of Australia, and I speak for my own particular district. I have received representations from citrus growers and vegetable growers who use this fertiliser, and I have forwarded them to the Minister. The cost would not be great when compared with the total cost. It would add approximately $200,000 a year, and this legislation provides for an expenditure of $5.6 million. If a subsidy were applied to blood and bone manure, its production would not be increased, because it is a by-product of another industry. If blood and bone does not attract the subsidy, it will be placed at a considerable disadvantage in relation to other fertilisers. I support the measure and i ask that blood and bone and organic manures be included in the subsidy. The only other organic manure I know of is vegetable meal, and although I have not heard of its being used as a fertiliser the Stale Department of Agriculture advises me that it is so used. The Minister has said that the fruit and vegetable industries are important and need encouragement, but, as I have said, certain parts of Australia, because of climatic conditions, are ideally suited to the use of this valuable fertiliser, substantial surplus slocks. At the end of the year, blood and bone. Australian Labour Party is known throughout the Commonwealth as being prepared readily to make available its support to any project that will assist our primary producers. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has given ample proof of the support that the Australian Labour Party has always given over the years to propositions such as those contained in the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill now before the House. On many occasions, I have heard the honourable gentleman speak of the great assistance that he gave to the wheat industry in order to stabilise it when it was in the doldrums. We now have a highly prosperous wheat industry, thanks to the launching of the bounty system by the honourable member for Lalor when he was a Minister in the former Labour Government. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann), in his second reading speech, has said that the proposal before us is to give some consideration to the sugar industry as the sugar industry is the principal user of nitrogenous fertilisers. While anything that can be done to reduce the cost of production of our primary producers, particularly those that have to be heavily subsidised, is very desirable, it is worthwhile bearing in mind that some people feel thai the difficulties which the sugar industry is encountering will be with us for a long time. I wish (o quote from the latest report of ihe Queensland Department of Primary Industries, which deals with this important matter. At page 11 the report readsHarvesting of the 1966 crop is estimated to produce a record 15,000.000 tons of cane and 2,100.000 tons of raw sugar. The market outlook is chequered. On the one hand thc industry benefits from the protected domestic market to the extent of about 600,000 tons while the UK./Commonwealth Sugar Agreement provides an assured market for 325,000 tons at satisfactory prices. In addition, sales to the United States of America account for a further 150,000 ions at comparable prices. On the other hand, almost two-thirds of Australian exports are sold on the basis of free market prices. These were severely depressed throughout the year, faUing to £16 15s. stg. per ton in early June, the lowest since World War II. The lower price was a direct result of lack of demand and the sale of a large parcel of sugar by Brazil from prospects were not bright for any immediate improvement in the free market price. The proposal to subsidise nitrogenous fertilisers will be of considerable assistance to the sugar industry which is going through this shocking period. Nitrogenous fertilisers are very necessary to enable the sugar industry to produce a higher rate of growth in the cane. The Minister for Primary Industry who is noted for a remarkable flow of the English language has given a graphic description of the way",64,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
141,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [9.50],"Th ein which nitrogen acts in certain respects. The Minister has described the operation where it is possible to use plants for fertilising by way of nitrogen. I think that his remarks bear repetition as I am afraid that, whilst he was speaking last Friday when presenting the second reading of this Bill, not a great number of members displayed any great interest in what he said. For that matter, there are not many more members in the House tonight. would chase anybody out. able member for Gippsland is staying. The Minister said thisLeguminous plants, such as clovers, arc host plants for nitrogen fixing bacteria which live in nodules on the roots of the legumes and have the ability to extract nitrogen from the air. This means that the clovers can obtain nitrogen free by extracting it from the air. The Minister continuedThis nitrogen then becomes available to the host facing. plain and ultimately to non-legumes in the same soil. Where legumes can be grown in association with oilier plants, or in a crop rotation, they are responsible for a substantial accretion to the nitrogen status of the soil and may go a long way towards meeting, the nitrogen needs of nonleguminous plants. However, there are many regions of Australia, where the role of legumes in nitrogen fixation is limited by climatic or other factors. This would apply to the sugar fields in north Queensland. The Minister states furtherDespite the tremendous importance of legumes to our agriculture and thc enormous quantities of nitrogen added to our soil annually by reason of the growth of leguminous plants, there is undoubtedly scope for much greater use of applied nitrogen in our cropping and pastoral industries. This is where we are proposing to use nitrogenous fertilisers as it is impossible to use the rotation method because of the high cost of the lands engaged in sugar production. I wish to refer to the disaster that has taken place in the sugar industry and also the representations that have been made by the Queensland Cane Growers' Council regarding the need for some assistance to the industry relating to fertilisers. If it is possible to reduce the cost of fertilisers to the sugar grower, this should assist him through the difficult days through which he is passing at the present time, and the days may become years, I am afraid. 1 wish to quote for the information of honourable members the prices that the industry is receiving for sugar in its overseas markets. The total amount of the value of sugar exports during the year 1965-66 was $100 million. Reliable authorities estimate that the cost of production of sugar is $93 per ton. Australia received from Canada for the sale of 111,364 tons of sugar, $54.24 per ton. Australia sold 402,355 tons of sugar to Japan for which member it received $45 per ton. From Malaysia, Australia received $64.76 per ton and it exported to that country 51,497 tons of sugar. We exported 44,983 tons of sugar to New Zealand and received from that country $41.28 per ton. Exports of sugar during the last financial year totalled 1,252.572 tons. The average price that we received was $74.09. As I have pointed out already, the estimated cost of sugar is $93 per ton. So, honourable mcmbers can see Ihe difficulties that the sugar industry is Some lime ago the Queensland Cane Growers' Council wrote to the Treasurer be done to assist the industry by way of a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers. It was pointed out in this letter that the recent bounty on superphosphate was really of not much value to the sugar industry because Queensland uses less than 2 per cent, of the total consumption of superphosphate in Australia. However, concerning nitrogenous fertilisers, the total usage in Queensland is 50,869 tons of which the sugar industry uses 43,642 tons. Those figures lend colour to the statement that I have made to thc effect that nitrogenous fertilisers are an essential part of the sugar industry. They will be of considerable benefit to the growers when this Bill becomes operative. We understand that the average cost of this fertiliser to individual sugar growers is about $900 a year, but the fertiliser is of considerable value to the industry. When the curfew tolls the knell of parting day and the ploughman homeward plods his weary way the nitrogenous fertiliser really gets stuck into the cane with gusto, and the cane grows and grows. That is why the sugar content of cane grown in North Queensland is about the highest in the world.",67,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966

144,( Mr Mcmahon) And Asked That Something,"The proposal in this legislation will be of great value to this important industry. It is true, as the Minister has said, that the fertiliser could be of value in the production of wheat and oats. He hus said that if it were applied to about 2 million acres of wheat it would give an increased production of about 15 million bushels. I am sure that this will give a great deal of comfort to the members of the Country Party because with this additional production they would be able to sell more wheat to Communist China at a price less than thc present cost of production. But1 am not as concerned at present about wheat as I am about sugar. Anything thut can be done to assist the sugar industry will be well worthwhile, because this is the industry's hour of trial. There are members of the Country Party in the Queensland Parliament who have openly advocated an increase in the domestic price or sugar from 9c per lb. to something higher. I hope that the domestic price does not rise because it would place a really heavy burden on the Australian housewife. I agree with the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson) who has said in previous debates that any assistance needed by the sugar industry should be borne by the taxpayers of Australia as a whole; in other words, it should be by way of a grant from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. However, I do warn the Australian people that there is a very strong body of opinion in the Queensland Parliament amongst Government supporters, particularly those belonging to the Country Party, which is the majority Party in the coalition government in Queensland, that there should be an increase in the domestic price of sugar. No doubt the proposal in the Bill to pay a subsidy of $80 a ton on nitrogen fertiliser will give some boost to the proposal to construct a fertiliser plant at the mouth of the Brisbane River. My colleague, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has spoken in a most explanatory and informative way about the use of natural gas in the production of fertilisers. Queenscan be produced for $30 a ton, and this is land has proven natural gas fields which it is unable to develop at present because of some reluctance on the part of industry and the gas companies in Brisbane to make use of natural gas. However, I have been informed, I hope reliably, that there is a proposal-to be financed unfortunately by imported capital only, from the United States and Japan-to erect a fertiliser works, using natural gas, at the mouth of the Brisbane River. This has been talked about for some considerable time. The suggestion was extensively canvassed during the last State election campaign, but nothing has been said about it since except when the Premier was in London. I feel that it will be talked about again a good deal between now and 26th November. But whether the proposal is used for political purposes or not, I do hope that this industry will eventually be established in Brisbane ancl that it will use natural gas from the Roma field. I was particularly interested in the statement of the honourable member for Lalor that it will be possible to produce nitrogenous fertiliser with natural gas at a price of about $30 a ton. would be halved, bringing it down to about $30 a ton. This demonstrates the value to Australia of the natural gas proposition, it is in my view God's greatest gift to Australia, because it is a source of untold wealth and power. We are proposing in this Bill to provide a subsidy of $80 a ton on nitrogenous fertiliser, and the experts say that it is posible to produce this material with natural gas for $30 a ton. This shows that every assistance should be given by this Government and by State Governments to develop and use our natural gas resources as soon as possible. We are proposing in this measure to make available for the subsidy for nitrogenous fertiliser $5.6 million for one year. The subsidy would not be required if we were producing this fertiliser with natural gas. The honourable member for Lalor quoted an eminent authority who cannot be doubted. The honourable member did not mention his name, but it can readily be ascertained. He estimated that the fertiliser something that should spur the members of the Country Party to urge the Commonwealth Government to give every assistance towards the construction of pipe lines for natural gas. It should do this either on its own initiative or in co-operation with State",68,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
145,Mr Pollard,Half the present price.,69,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
146,Mr Coutts,"Yes, the present priceGovernments, in which case the pipelines would be owned by both the States and the Commonwealth and we could ensure that natural gas would be brought into use as soon as possible, and this in turn would reduce the costs of primary producers and enable them to reduce the prices of the commodities they produce. As the Minister has said, the Bill is designed mainly to assist the sugar industry, which is Queensland's principal primary industry. It is an industry that needs all possible assistance at the present time. It is going through a very bad period of depressed prices, and from observations in all parts of the world I can see no immediate prospect of an increase in the free price of sugar. If the free price of sugar continues to fall there will be a very grave danger that the price of sugar in the protected markets covered by agreements will also fall when the agreements come up for renewal. So any assistance we can give to this valuable Queensland industry will be well worthwhile. 1 believe that the greatest possible assistance will be provided by the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth co-operating in the construction of pipelines to bring natural gas into use. The pipelines will then remain under Government ownership and we will be able to ensure that the gas is piped to the places of manufacture of the nitrogenous fertiliser. This, as I say, would be one of the greatest benefits that the Government could convey on Australian industry generally and On a great primary industry in particular. for the Interior) [10.10] I would like to associate myself with the Bill before the House which is to give a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers. I believe that we are dealing with a Bill which is going to promote agricultural productivity in this counclover has been tried in these areas, but try to an extent at least equal to, if not more than, what the subsidy on superphosphate brought about. Superphosphate sparked off the development of tremendous stretches of country in the temperate areas of Australia. I refer to those areas of Ausgrowing types of legumes. The principal tralia comprising southern New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, large parts of South Australia and the southern part of Western Australia. Here were areas where there was quite a degree of variation in agricultural productivity. There were pockets of lush, rich country but, overall, until about 1940 there was a rather mixed type of agricultural activity. About the time of the late 1930's we saw the advent, through science and research, of certain types of legumes which could be grown only with the assistance of phosphate. This was principally in the form of superphosphate. The miracle legume was subterranean clover. This clover, with the assistance of superphosphate and, in some areas, certain trace elements, sparked off the development of intensive pastoral activities. It sparked off intensive agricultural activities principally in the growing of grains such as wheat, barley and oats. In addition we saw greater use of irrigation in portions of Victoria and in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in New South Wales. Today, with the combination of superphosphate, subterranean clovers, other types of clovers and irrigation, we have in those areas some of the most agriculturally productive parts of Australia. This sort of thing can happen in other regions through the use of chemical nitrogen. Tbe success in the southern areas through the use of superphosphate is due almost entirely to the fact that this superphosphate is the catalyst which starts a series of events which enables atmospheric nitrogen to be fixed in the soil for plant use. Once having established legumes you have a plant which has a capacity through the use of rhizomian bacteria to absorb nitrogen out of the air and fix it into nitrates which can be taken up by other types of crops or pastures. In the tropical and semi-tropical areas of Australia there has been a problem in establishing legumes. This problem has principally been due to bacterial and insect factors. Subterranean because of disease, insects and climatic conditions it has not succeeded. Nor have other types of legumes succeeded until more recent years. Then we obtained a degree of success with what are known as summer successful legume today in the tropical area is Townsville lucerne. This is showing enormous prospects in the northern regions of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the northern parts of Queensland.",69,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
147,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rMr Clyde Cameron -I s brigalow a legume? capacity for fixing nitrogen. But brigalow is a perennial type of shrub. The ground having once been cleared, the nitrogen is immediately available in the soil, but, that nitrogen once being exhausted, there is nothing with which to replace it. There is this fertilisers somewhere into line with the price area in Australia today-the semi-tropical area between the area where subterranean clover will grow and the area where the Townsville lucerne appears likely to succeed-in which there is great difficulty in getting cheap and readily available supplies of nitrogen. This area was one of the most fertile areas in Australia over the past half considerable reduction. The people who will century. It was fertile because there had been a natural build up of nitrogen such as, as 1 explained to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, is provided by the use of brigalow. In many of these regions, as in my electorate for instance, there were enorvalue. I believe that within a period of 5 mous rain forests. Over the centuries the leafage formed a mulch on the ground and through bacterial activity and the breaking down of this mulch there was a build up of nitrogen. This land was enormously rich when it was first cleared by the pioneers. They started farming it for various purposes, duction of the grains could be doubled in such as for cropping and for pastures. It had tremendous fertility; it was as rich as any country in the world and pastures grew to the top rail of the fences. Cabbages, lettuces and tomatoes were enormous. But over a period of time the nitrogen was used up and exhausted and there was a decline in the fertility of the soil. We have recognised this problem and have done a great deal of work to counter it by putting a theory to work; that is, by growing legumes. But there has been a problem in growing legumes, and this attempt has not really succeeded although, as I mentioned, there has been partial success recently with new types of legumes. If we can find an economic way of overcoming the necessity for legumes, such as the use of chemical nitrogen, we can achieve all we want. We can then grow crops readily and well. In the case of pastures in my region, which were of low nutritional value, we have discovered in the last year or two that by the use of sulphate of ammonia, calcium nitrate, aqua ammonia and anhydrous ammonia we are able to build up the productivity twofold, threefold or even more. But the profitability of building it up depends upon the price of chemical fertiliser. This Bill is designed to provide producers with nitrogenous fertiliser at a reasonable price. It will bring the price of nitrogenous that producers have to pay in other countries with whose producers we have to compete. In England sulphate of ammonia costs about S50 a ton. In the United States of America it is $30 a ton. In New South Wales, without the subsidy, it has been about $68 per ton. The subsidy will reduce this price by 28 per cent. That is a very get the principal benefit from the subsidy immediately are the cane growers, the fruit growers, the vegetable growers, the cotton growers and those people in the pastoral industries who have just discovered its years, or perhaps within 10 years, we shall witness the almost universal use of nitrogen throughout Australia. Chemical nitrogen will be used not only for the crops such as cane to which I have referred but also for wheat, barley and oats. The overall proa very short period if nitrogen could be obtained at a sufficiently economical price for the growers to use. I believe that the price at which nitrogen is now offered in Australia is one that enables them to use it economically. The point is that growers have not become adapted to using it and have not got into tbe habit of using it. I know that there has been research into the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, but it has not been used or experimented with sufficiently for peoplo to have become aware of its great value. In parts of the Darling Downs in Queensland where a fertiliser of any type has seldom been used some growers are discovering now that their yields can be almost doubled by the use of sulphate of ammonia or urea. One of the inhibiting factors in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers in the past has been that we have not made sufficient advance with the type of equipment which is necessary to apply fertilisers to the soil. Today we have the most up to date equipment which is needed to handle such things as",70,Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1966
148,Mr Anthony,"It is, and it has aaqueous ammonia and anhydrous ammonia, which are compressed gases in the form of liquids which have to be injected into the soil to get the maximum benefit from them. Some years ago I had the pleasure of travelling through the United States of America. Being a farmer I was very conscious of the activities in that country in the use of fertilisers. Enormous use was being made of nitrogen, because the price was at a level that enabled farmers to use it economically. In addition producers had been educated in its use. They were aware of it and they had the proper equipment and appliances to enable them lo use it. The same sort of thing will happen in Australia. America's enormous agricultural productivity is due largely to the high use of nitrogenous fertilisers and the trend in the use of nitrogen there is on an escalating scale, ln the year 1900 the world used very little nitrogen, other than in the form of organic fertiliser which was mainly animal manure. It has been estimated that in 1900 only .34 million tons of organic fertiliser were used, whereas in 1964-65 the quantity had increased to 17.4 million tons. Its use is still escalating at an ever increasing rate. But this will be necessary if we are to keep pace with the increasing world population. One of the mos: pleasing types of overseas aid which has been given to India, Pakistan and Ceylon has been in the form of fertiliser factories. Two years ago, with a parliamentary delegation, I visited a nitrothroughout the world in order to obtain gen factory at Nangla in the province of Punjab. This factory was built with the aid of American and British technicians. It cost the Indian Government $50 million, but 1 could see clearly that the factory would do more to increase food production in India than possibly any other single factor. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr mean by "" we""? It was the Labour Adermann) mentioned that the subsidy is to be given for two reasons. First, it would create a new trend in farming, lt would encourage farmers to use nitrogen in the same way as they have been encouraged to use superphosphate. The superphosphate bounty has rewarded the nation in many different directions. It has built up the wealth of the country and has enabled enormous areas to be opened up which would never have been developed otherwise. Nitrogen can do exactly the same thing. Nitrogen has provided a great benefit to the cane industry which is particularly in need of help at the moment. In his second reading speech the Minister calculated that the average sugar producer spends between $800 and $900 per annum on nitrogen. The subsidy will reduce that cost by 28 per cent., which is a very substantial reduction in the cost of his farm operations. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) introduced into his speech the suggestion that natural gas be used for the production of nitrogen. This is probably the most economical means of producing nitrogen in the United States. Like him, I believe that there could be an enormous potential if we could fully tap and utilise our natural gases for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. I hope that this is done because if we train people to use nitrogen the demand for it will increase. We want to be sure that we have the capacity to meet the demands without relying on overseas sources. There are two reasons why we do not want to rely on overseas sources of nitrogen. The first reason is that this would make a considerable drain on our overseas reserves, and the second reason is that the reliability of supplies from overseas is doubtful. We had experience before, particularly in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, when there was an acute shortage of nitrogen throughout the world. Australia had almost to beg enough nitrogen to keep the sugar and fruit industries going, and it had to pay an extremely high price for the product. It was for this reason that we encouraged companies such as the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd., which set up a plant at Risdon in Tasmania. Government. ment. ment which actually did the work. There was an extreme shortage of nitrogen when this Government took over. 1 imagine that the shortage was brought about by a lack of foresight.

Australian Gas Light Co., and the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. Those three companies were the basis of ammonia in Australia. Tonight we shall have before us two Bills, one proposing to pay a bounty on the production of sulphate of ammonia, and the other providing for a bounty on the production of urea by Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Ltd. The latter is a new bounty. This is good. 1 am quite sure that, as the companies' throughput increases with thc increased usage that I have been predicting-and I am sure I am right-the y will be able to produce without any bounty. But they must be given help at this stage to enable them to operate o:i a low unit throughput. But we are not only concerned with the production of urea as a by-product of the synthetic rubber industry, or with the production of sulphate of ammonia as a by-product of zinc smelting, of steel making or of the gas industry. We would like to see other types of nitrogenous fertilisers manufactured, but the only means by which they can be manufactured economically is by thc use of natural gas. 1 refer to calcium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia, each of which has its own specialised function in agriculture. If we are to be a great agricultural nation, we need to have available adequate supplies of each of these types of nitrogen for their specialised functions. 1 have spoken longer than I intended to to increasing it at some time in the very do. I believe that this Bill will do great near future. These fertilisers are of vital things for Ihis country. We are basically importance, especially in view of a recent a primary producing country.

I believe that this Bill will do as much ment with the claims that so m a c of us as, if not more than, the superphosphate bounty has done for Australia. want to go over the ground that was traversed by the honourable member for Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony). This proposal to pay a subsidy on nitrothe production of sulphate of genous fertilisers is. as the Minister has said, further evidence of the Government's policy to promote increased primary production. The House may recall that last week I asked a question of the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) about making further finance available to the Development Bank because of the world shortage of food. With our natural resources and our potential for primary production, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to assist in this way. AsT have said, this Bill is further evidence of the Government's policy of promoting increased primary production in this country. Thc Government's record in relation to assisting primary producers is one of which thc mcmbers of the Government can justly be proud. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) saidThe introduction of a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers will mean that use of the two major plant nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous, to promole thc production of bigger crops, more wool, meat, milk and butter, fruit and vegetables and other products of the land, will bc directly encouraged by the Government meeting a significant part of the cost of fertilisers containing these plant nutrients. 1 do not need to refer here to the role which the Government's bounty on phosphate has had in increasing rural production over the past three years.

An interesting fact is that long before the announcement of the proposed introduction of the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, the consumption of these fertilisers on the north coast of New South Wales rose quite steeply. The farmers saw the own initiative began to use them in large quantities. They welcomed the Government's announcement that this special subsidy would be introduced. Thc sugar indusiry will benefit considerably, as we have just been told so ably. The banana growing industry also will benefit, though there is one section of that industry that would like to see the subsidy proposal carried a little further.

Events overseas show that wherever fertiliser plants are established they provide a ready supply of a wide range of fertilisers. This has a direct impact tilisers would not be eligible for bounty. on the efficiency of agriculture and farming generally. This sort of thing has been a big factor in the development of the Tennessee Valley area in the United States of America. Munition factories established there during the First World War were subsequently converted into fertiliser plants. Research conducted there over a long period has proved conclusively the value of modern fertilisers. In more recent times, Japan, Germany and numerous other countries have shown very clearly that the prudent development of fertiliser plants greatly benefits a nation's economy. Australia, I believe, is on the threshold of vast expansion in this field. This will have twofold effects, lt will improve the status of primary nearly all cases the nitrogen content is low industry generally and bring about a vast improvement in our overall economic structure. 1 am glad to have an opportunity to supprocessing.

Although the annual few months any slight impediments that output of blood and bone meal is between may arise in the implementation of the 25,000 tons and 30,000 tons, the nitrogen scheme will quickly be ironed out. It is content does not exceed 1,400 tons. The pleasing to find that the departments conhonorable member for Robertson gave a cerned have shown a very practical figure in excess of that, but this is my approach to the minor problems that have information.

Honourable members are unanimously in favour of the payment of a bounty on the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. I greatly enjoyed the speech made by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony), who displayed substantial technical knowledge of the production of nitrogenous fertilisers. He touched lightly but sensibly on the production of nitrogenous fertilisers from natural gas. Generally speaking, speakers from the Government side were fulsome in their praise of the Government for introducing this legislation. I am not mean; 1 congratulate the Government for belatedly giving effect to a proposition which the Labour Party submitted to the electors in 1961. By 1963 the Government had become convinced, so far as the subsidy on superphosphate was concerned, that the Labour Opposition was on the right track. Prior to the 1963 election the Government promised to introduce a subsidy on the production of superphosphate. Now, just before another election, the Government has belatedly introduced legislation providing for a bounty on nitrogenous fertilisers. But as far back as 1961 Labour said that it would provide a subsidy for the production of superphosphate and related fertilisers if it became the government. As ever, we blazed the trail and induced the Government to recognise that it is essential to agriculture in Australia that fertilisers be available at a reasonappointed in Victoria to control the pipeable price. I was intrigued tonight to hear the Minister for the Interior confirm my prognostications that nitrogenous fertilisers could be produced from natural gas at half the price of similar fertilisers produced from other sources. I was intrigued also to hear the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) sa;. that he hoped that the natural gas deposits off-shore in Gippsland would be treated at the Altona refineries in my electorate. to what was likely to happen. likely to happen. He said that these off-shore deposits were likely to bc treattd in the great Altona petro-chemical complex in my electorate. I am not a parish pump politician. I hope that nitrogenous fertilisers will be produced in the vicinity of Sale from the natural gas deposits in off-shore Gippsland. not a parish pump politician. I hope that nitrogenous fertilisers are produced in vast quantities in Gippsland in close proximity to the source of the natural gas. I am sure that the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) will agree with me. This will be to the detriment of my electorate, but I am an Australian, not a parish pump politician. MightI express the hope that these fertilisers will be produced under the supervision of a national authority, as is the case in Italy, and not a private enterprise complex? 1 am disgusted that the negotiations between the Esso-BHP. combine and the Victorian Gas and Fuel Corporation to fix the price of the gas should have been so prolonged. No doubt the Premier of Victoria has connived in the delay and perhaps even encouraged it. The latest development is that a separate authority wiil be established to build and control pipelines. Did honourable member ever hear of such a proposition? The authority will enter into negotiations with thc Esso-BHP. combine to fix the price of gas to consumers in Victoria and elsewhere. What will be the personnel of this pipeline authority? I am something of a prophet tonight. Thc personnel of this authority, which wili be line, will be conservative. It will negotiate a price with Esso-BHP. that wiil be to the detriment of the industrial and domestic users of the gas in Victoria and in other parts of Australia.

You work it out for yourself. I listened today to compliments being flung around the Parliament. From 1942 or late in 1941, the Labour Administration paid a subsidy on superphosphate. In 1952, the present Government abolished it. It was not until 1963 that the Government restored it, and it did so then only because of election pressures. Now it unctuously advocates the payment of a subsidy on the production of nitrogenous fertilisers, whatever the source may be. Honourable members on the other side of the House have never raised a voice against thc apathy, the indifference and the indolence of the Victorian Government in not taking prompt action to make available the natural gas from which the nitrogenous fertilisers can be produced at half the eost of the present fertilisers. I have been conscious for a long time of the fact that the supply of nitrogen to the soil from legumes is extremely limited in some circumstances and can be considerably accelerated by the application of artificial fertilisers. But the Government has not taken action to ensure the use of a source from which nitrogenous fertilisers can be readily obtained. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time.

Speaker, and I are probably among the few members of the Parliament who have lived long enough to see the transition from the horse to the tractor. I should think that, apart from the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), the Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes) and the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King), no one else in the Parliament could break a horse to saddle or to harness. ber for Gippsland, in conversation with me earlier in the evening, intimated that he can still break a horse to saddle or to harness. harness. for Territories could break in a Clydesdale or could break a horse to the saddle and maybe the honourable member for Wimmera could do so. -Order! It may be wise to stick to the tractors and leave the horses alone. stantially in agreement with you. ber mean the honourable member for Mallee? orable member for Mallee could break in a horse to do anything. He might be able to sell one. He would sell poor old Nugget cheaply, as long as he had his commission. I know the honourable member for Mallee able member for Hunter? despite his weight he could ride a pony. However, let us return to the question of tractors. It has been my interest throughout my lifetime to watch the development of the agricultural tractor. I recollect being employed on a job which involved the use of one of the first agricultural tractors imported from the United States of America. It was a huge contraption with wheels about six feet in diameter. It had a one cylinder motor power. It was not From that day in 1911 I have watched the evolution of the agricultural internal combustion tractor. The engineering capacity involved in developing the modern tractor has been altogether admirable. It has produced a remarkable instrument for increasing agricultural production. I doubt whether more than 10 per cent, of the rural holdings in Australia today have any horsepower other than the horsepower generated by the farm tractor. Early in the history of the internal combustion tractor some Australian engineering firms produced fairly good tractors, but ultimately manufacturers in Great Britain, Europe and the United States of America overran the Australian manufacturers, who at that stage had very few orders to fill. Today the Australian market is for 18,000 tractors annually, but only about 6,000 are produced in Australian engineering works. This Bill is designed to encourage Australian engineering works to manufacture tractors and, if possible, to make Australia self sufficient in tractor production. For many years this House has regularly enacted legislation to provide a bounty to the producers of Australian manufactured tractors, but so far our annual production has not exceeded 6,000. I believe that the Australian engineering industry could produce a tractor as good and as efficient as any tractor that could be produced elsewhere. The Opposition will support this Bill, which provides for the payment of substantial bounties. For instance, a bounty of' $800 will be paid on a tractor of up to 80 horsepower. This represents a considerable encouragement to Australian engineering industries. I believe this is justified. This country cannot view with equanimity the possibility of some future international conflagration cutting off our overseas source of supply of tractors, thus severely restricting our capacity to produce food for our own use and for the use of our allies and friends. We support the general principle of paying a bounty to encourage the production of tractors in Australia. The Bill provides that the full bounty shall not be payable unless the Australian content of the tractor is equivalent to 90 per cent, of the total content, and the bounty reduces until no bounty is payable if the local content is less than 55 per c°nt.",78,Agricultural Tractors Bounty

189,Mr Pollard,"They tell me thatThis is fair enough. I note, too, that the bounty is to be payable until 1971. This is encouraging to the Australian producers. Incidentally, there are only two at present -Chamberlai n Industries Pty. Ltd. and the International Harvester Co. of Australia Pty. Ltd. I wish that Massey-Ferguson (Aust.) Ltd. in my electorate would produce tractors as, indeed, I wish other Australian engineering works would undertake such work. A market of 18,000 tractors annually is not a bad market. I have watched the evolution of the internal combustion tractor and while I am a supporter of the Australian industries I wish that the Australian engineering industry would devote more attention to ensuring that the components it manufactures are of a much higher grade than they have been in the past. It is indisputable quality of the steel used in components in that some of the steel and metal parts of tractors and other agricultural implements have not been as good as imported metal parts. Clause 11 of the Bill provides for the payment of a bounty on tractors produced on registered premises. The Minister is not to register premises unless he is satisfied that such conditions as may be prescribed are complied with. The clause provides also for the cancellation of registration. The clause seems adequate, but what conditions will the Minister lay down for such premises? Does the Minister know? Is this a question of the provision of sanitation, light, shade or air space for the employees? Or have these conditions something to do with the quality of the parts of the tractor to be manufactured? In my opinion, this is the all important question confronting the Australian engineering industry and Australian primary producers today. What is the use of buying an Australian tractor or a tractor from any other country unless the steel and cast iron components are of very high quality. Anybody who understands anything about tractors or any other agricultural implement knows that there is a vast difference between the quality of the steel and cast iron used in the manufacture of Australian machinesI regret to say this-and the quality of the materials in some cases, but not all cases, used in imported machines. I want the Minister to assure me that the conditions of the registration of a factory will include provision giving the Minister the rightI think the Minister tor Territories ( Mr Barnes) will agree with me on this point-to place technicians in, or to have them visit occasionally, these Australian factories in order to take tests of the steel used on the parts of tractors and also to test the quality of the components of other Australian manufactured machines. Unless and until the Government does so, it will find that despite its tariff protections and its favorable bounties Australian farmers will purchase in ever increasing quantities what they consider to be implements of superior quality produced in other parts of the world. As one who knows something about the matter, I can tell the House of tests carried out on imported manufactured parts of tractors. These tests revealed from my point of view, unfortunately, the superiority in comparison with that used in the local product. I want the Minister to say tonight in this Parliament that one of the conditions of registration of a factory of any manufacturer of Australian tractors-and we make some mighty good tractors-wil l be that a qualified technician will take tests according to standards laid down by the defence standards laboratories at Maribyrnong. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Stokes) knows the organisation to which 1 refer. Such tests will ensure that the materials are okay in comparison with the materials used in the manufacture of imported tractors. Until the Minister does so it will not matter whether he grants bounties or imposes duties because the Australian farming community will continue to buy imported tractors come what will. I speak as one who is an ardent Australian, in favour of the Australian article, first, last, and all the time. But I do require the Australian article to live up to the standards to be found in the imported article. Sometimes these standards are much better in the imported article than they are in the Australian article. But the Australian manufacturer can achieve quality in his implements and machinery. If any honourable member wants confirmation that Australian manufacturers can do this, I refer him to what is a nationalised industry, the munition works or armament works at Maribyrnong. The defence standards laboratories there turn out for defence purposes articles that are better in every respect than anything made anywhere else in the world. If the Government can apply to Australian engineering works the same standard of quality as it insists upon within the confines of its own nationalised armament production works, it will obtain a standard of tractor manufacture second to none in the world. The Opposition has indicated its viewpoint regarding this measure. 1 hope that the Minister will be gracious enough, not only because of his natural graciousness but also by virtue of his conviction that what I have said is right, to tell this Parliathe demand for the tractor produced by ment tonight, and also the tractor producing manufacturers of Australia, that he will insist on an investigation into the quality of tractors that will make Australian produced tractors beyond a shadow of a doubt the best in the world. The Opposition supports the measure. We hope that it will achieve the objective that it sets out to achieve. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Howson) proposedThat the Bill be now read a third time. had no indication from the Minister for Air( Mr Howson) that he has taken the slightest notice of my remarks regarding thc necessity to insist on quality in the production of tractors in Australia. This is imperative. It is no good treating this matter as facetious. 1 repeat: It is imperative. What1 have suggested could be easily done. We have at Werribee in my constituency a tractor testing station. It is the function of this station to check all types, makes and quality of tractors and to ascertain whether they come up to production standards regarding horsepower. As everybody who has any knowledge of tractors knows, horsepower is tested by measurement of cylinder capacity and so on. Jt would be the easiest thing in the world for the defence standards laboratories to arrange that, every time a tractor is sent to the Werribee tractor testing station for power rating or general performance study, tests will be taken also of the tensile or other strength of the steel in that tractor. Other tests could be conducted also to determine the lasting qualities of the steel, cast iron or whatever may be used in the production of those tractors. The Minister, after all the requests that have been made in this debate, has not replied to them. I have not opposed the Government's measure. It continues a measure that has been in existence for many years. Despite such measures and bounties, no substantial increase has taken place in Australian engineering works. I ask why this is so. 1 think I am justified in asking this question. Is it due to lack of quality? Is it due to lack of certification of the quality of the tractors? Are they not as good as the imported machines? If the reason is not any of those that I have put forward, will the Minister tell me what it is? Is the Minister taking any notice of what the Opposition is saying in regard to this matter or is he just passing by our queries as being entirely facetious? I expect the Minister to give us some indication of whether he proposes to deal with the suggestion that I have put forward on behalf of the Opposition, or whether he is prepared to let the matter go. If the Minister is lucky enough to be returned after the forthcoming Federal election to the position that he now holdsI doubt it-wil l the Minister say to the House at the end of the period for which this protection has been given-that is 1971, which is a long period of protection, if I might say so-that he has another tractor bounty bill to present because Australian manufacturers have not yet obtained the output of tractors that is desired?

Bearing in mind the short time that will elapse between the tabling of the Proposals and the presentation of the Bill to validate the tariff should be taken by the application of a changes I have thought it desirable to enlarge on my comments of yesterday. In order to facilitate further useful debate on these matters honourable members have requested that I should produce also some facts concerning the method of administration of these new measures, particularly those dealing with this novel concept of support prices. Honourable members will recall that I said be an overall review of the whole question that the Government had accepted the in 1969. The report then deals with the second alternative recommendation of the question of substitute chemicals which are Tariff Board; that is, that protection should to be dutiable at the rates set out in PartI be mainly through tariffs with continuation of Appendix P; this means that the of existing bounties.

The final recomThese three bounties are to be payable until mendation dealt with a by-law system to 31st December 1969, with maximum amounts of bounty in respect of sulphate of ammonia and urea payable in any one year, but without profit limitations. Then we come to a recommendation that duty be payable on a range of chemicals set out in Schedule III to AppendixN to the Board's report. Those are essentially the main changes that are the subject of these proposals, and they are to be found in that Schedule. Then we come to the next matter. Special duties shall be collected when the duty paid cost of certain chemicals named in the Schedule falls below a price nominated in the report for those goods; such special duty to be at the rate of 90 per cent, of the amount by which the duty paid cost is below the support value. I will explain that in detail in a moment. Further allegations of disruptive low pricing are to be dealt with by some reasonably fast moving machinery for the application of support values in future cases where it can be established that normal protection is being rendered ineffective and the local industry is suffering detriment from disruptive low pricing. If local industry can establish a prima facie case to that effect, the question whether urgent action support value will be referred under section 18A of the Tariff Board Act to a Special Advisory Authority who will inquire into the question and report within 30 days. The next point is that a review of goods subject to these special duties is to be undertaken by the Board once every year in order to determine the need for and the level of support values, and there is to",81,Agricultural Tractors Bounty

196,Mr Howson (Fawkner,"Minister forreplace the drawback system in relation to goods for export. Let me deal with these matters now in greater detail. This is a case where the Tariff Board has reported on all products of an industry, rather than on specific commodities, and the recommendations of the Board are designed to solve the broad problems of the industry. The Tariff Board found that chemicals can be divided into two broad groups, one requiring protection at rates of 40 per cent. (General) and 30 per cent. (Preferential) and another at rates of 25 per cent. (General) and 15 per cent. (Preferential). For certain chemicals of fundamental importance and for which economies of scale of the Australian industry demand higher protection, a General rate of 60 per cent, has been recommended. These industry rates were set after an examination of 80 key chemicals, and are set to meet thc needs of the production complex involved. Certain products which do not form part of a production complex do not have these industry rates applied to them. Citric and tartaric acids, and pigments and colour lakes, recently the subject of a Tariff Board Report, are examples of these. One of the main problems of the chemical industry is that substitution of one substance for another is relatively easy, although there are few chemicals which are completely interchangeable in all applications. The Board's recommendations cover thc problem of substitution as it affects the Australian chemical industry at present. However, new chemicals are continually being developed and undoubtedly new problems of substitution will follow. Furthermore, new uses may be found for imported chemicals resulting from changes in technical qualities, and these, too, could lead to substitution for local chemicals. The Board is of thc opinion that action in line with that now recommended should be taken in cases of future substitution as they arise. This action will be implemented, both in the specific cases covered in this report and in future cases, by applying a protective duty through a change in thc relevant legislation-that is. by amending the Customs Tariff Schedule. In one important aspect, the Board recommended a substantial change in practice to cope with disruptive low pricing. Due to the size of chemical plants overseas, further additions to such complexes often result in excess capacity, which may be used in export markets. This has, at times, resulted in prices for imports, which, while not breaching the present anti-dumping legislation, has had serious consequences for local industry. The Tariff Board has therefore recommended that for certain chemicals which have been subject to disruptive pricing, special prices should be established, and that any imports which fail to reach this special price when their cost, transport and insurance charges and ordinary duties arc totalled, should be subject to a further duty to bring their landed cost up to that special price. To allow an element of competition, the extra duty will be imposed on only 90 per cent, of the differential. The special price, to be known as the support price, has been determined by comparison with imports under normal conditions during the period of the Tariff Board's inquiry. The prices will be subject to annual review and in any future instance thc support price will be established only after an inquiry conducted under the provisions of the Tariff Board Act. To elaborate: Price support duty is the name given to a duty payable on a restricted range of goods, principally chemicals and synthetic rubbers, whenever their landed cost falls below a predetermined level called the support price for those goods. Landed cost is ascertained by adding together the free on board price of the goods, thc overseas freight and insurance and thc duty ordinarily payable on the goods. If the landed cost is less than the support price then price support duty will be ordinarily payable. The application of price support duty means that an amount equal to nine tenths of the amount by which the landed cost is less than the support price will be payable, unless the goods are admissible under customs by-law or other concessional items in the Second Schedule. I want to emphasise this next point. The method by which this duty is imposed can be expected to be substantially changed when legislation is brought forward in the autumn period to amend the Customs Tariff, and specific sections will need to be inserted in that Act to impose the duties. However, before we do this there wiil be. a period of three months in order to allow the present system to be put into operation and this will give honourable members the opportunity to examine this new machinery. We will have the opportunity, on the occasion that the full Bill comes before us, to examine the whole of this new method.

198,Mr Howson,"I thought the honorableUREA BOUNTY BILL 1966. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 25th October (vide T hai the Bill be now read a second time. measure provides for a bounty on ihe production at registered premises of urea which is sold in Australia. Thc period of operation of the bounty is until Deceniber 1969. The annual payment is not to exceed 5500,000. Provision is made for averaging of bounty claims, where claims exceed amounts available for payment. The bounty payable in respect of urea which is not of good and merchantable quality is dealt with. The Bill also deals with bounly not being payable unless this Bill and certain regulations are complied with. The Opposition supports the provision of this bounty. The rate of the bounty is $16 a ton and the bounty overall will not exceed an amount of $500,000 a year. Mosl honourable members know that urea is a superior type of nitrogenous fertiliser as compared wilh sulphate of ammonia, ll is more easily dealt with so far as transport, storage and utilisation are concerned than is sulphate ot ammonia. I suggest and, indeed, suspect, that the bounty payment on urea will result inevitably in a greater demand for it than for sulphate of ammonia. I am not loo sure whether or not producers of sulphate of ammonia who have been provided with bounties in the past, and are to be provided with a continuation of bounty payments, will not be placed at a very substantial disadvantage as compared with the producers of urea. We know that urea has been produced since 1964 on the shores of Botany Bay in New South Wales by, J think. Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand. This Bill will encourage the producers of sulphate of ammonia who supply Australian agriculturalists-and who have received a bounty in the past-to do more to meet Australia's demand. Production of sulphate of ammonia, so far as I can recollect-and I speak subject to correction-ha s never been sufficient to meet Australia's requirements, and it has been necessary to import about 44,000 tons a year. I am not sure whether that figure is right, but I think it is somewhere near the mark. However the Opposition does not oppose the payment of this bounty on the produetion of a desirable type of nitrogenous fertiliser. What we again emphasise, of course, is the vital need for the production of nitrogenous fertiliser from natural gas. if only this Government would do something to galvanise into activity the Bolte Government to make this plain to the BHP -Esso group which owns the productive wells off the Victorian coait near Gippsland. Those companies should bc told thut the nation is not going to tolerate interminable d^lay in making this gas available. When it is available we will have some prospect of getting a nitrogenous fertiliser at substantially below the price at which it can be bought now, despite the bounty provided in this Bill for urea. I thmk, Mr Speaker, that you would agree that 1 have spoken for long enough on that strangely termed fertiliser, urea. What the derivation of this name is, whether it is Latin or Greek, I do not know, but we can discuss that later. The measure is to operate until the end of 1969-lon g enough-and by that time. I hope that our primary producers will be using nitrogenous fertiliser produced from natural gas, purchased at half the price that they now have to pay for that very desirable substance. I want to make two rather plaintive comments on this Bill. One, in particular, is on the way it has been handled. I have certainly no objections to the Government assisting this industry by way of bounty instead of tariff. It would have been unthinkable to put a tariff on such important raw materials. However, there arc two things which should be mentioned. One is that this measure springs from a Tariff Board report which was signed on 30th April and which was brought into this House only yesterday. That means that the Government has had six months to work on it whereas honourable members have had only one day. It seems a little unreasonable to expect us to handle the subject now when the report has been in our hands for such a short period. This is why I , being a rather slow witted person, cannot give the matter the attention I should have liked to give it. I should like to make another complaint and to criticise the original explanation",84,Table No 13

However, I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister for the information which he has since given. I hope that this will be taken as a standard for the introduction of tariff matters in future. I appreciate, probably more than he realises, his courtesy and kindness in giving the House a much fuller explanation of the chemical industry report and the action which the Governmeni took on which this matter is based. However, the Parliament should look at these things with care. I am making it quite clear again that I am glad that the Government is not imposing a tariff and that the industry is to be assisted by a bounty so that the price should not increase. But one cannot help wondering about the recipient of the bounty. The Minister said that only one company was making urea, and that was Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Ltd. one company will get the bounty. get the benefit of the bounty? benefit of the subsidy under the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy BiU. this Bill. brought in specifically, as I know the Minister will agree, to protect the industry production of sulphate of ammonia, which by bounty and not by tariff. Consequently, the benefit does not go to the user of the fertiliser. The I.C.I, company made a profit of $9 million last year after paying §5.1 million in tax and allowing $11.5 million for depreciation. Obviously that company will receive protection worth $ i million because the urea usage last year in Australia the case. The direct beneficiaries have was 45,000 tons. Let us assume that thc local manufacturer gets most of the market. If he sold 40,000 and received $60 per ton, which is the rate of bounty, he would get $640,000. However, the limitation of the bounty is $500,000, so it is quite clear that I.C.I, will receive $500,000. I am not saying that this is wrong, but I am saying that it is a pity that the House did not have the opportunity to examine this kind of generous treatment in greater detail. Air) [11.54] -in replyI am glad that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) has drawn attention to the fact that this is a bounty for the manufacturer and is not to be confused with a subsidy for the user, a subject which is dealt with in the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill which was discussed earlier tonight.

Thursday, 27th October 1966. Air) [12.1 a.m.] -in reply-The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), as he foreshadowed yesterday, has referred to the question of profit limitation. I am glad that he has had the opportunity since then to read the annual report of the Tariff Board on this matter. I think I should emphasise again the reasons why the Governmeni has accepted the Tariff Board's recommendation. The view taken by the Tariff Board in its annual report was that a limitation of the Tate of return on funds employed often frustrated the purposes underlying the grant of a bounty. The manufacturers involved, and the administering Department, are faced with clerical and administrative costs, and there may be a lack of incentive to increase production and sales once the specified rate of profit is achieved, ln effect, The"" Age "", in its issue of 24th February, it can act as a disincentive towards increased efficiency, reduced costs, technological development and cost control improvements. The incentive to export can also be reduced as a profit limitation becomes a disincentive when the profitability of export is less than the reduction in bounty. It will also be noted that the alternative to bounty assistance, which is tariff assistance, is not subject to any profit limitation, and there seems little justification for bounty assistance to be discriminated against. It is for these reasons that the Government has decided not to insert a provision relating to profit limitation as such in this Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Howson) proposedThat thc Bill be now read a third time. indicated some doubt about the justification for the abandonment of the 10 per cent, limitation. I. think I should give the Committee some indication of the reason for my doubt. Take these facts regarding some of thc people in the fertiliser industry. Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Ltd. has British and Australian assets totalling $1,400 million. Since 1959 it has acquired the entire capital of Commonwealth Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. Commonwealth Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. consisted of a merger of Cuming Smith and Co. Ltd., Mount Lyell Chemical Co. Ltd. and Wischer and Co. This was a multi million pound deal in 1961. I.C.I.A.N.Z. has a 53 per cent, interest in Australian Fertilizers Ltd. and operates mainly in New Soulh Wales. A.C.F. and Shirleys Fertilisers Ltd. in Queensland is in turn 50 per cent, owned by Australian Fertilizers Ltd. The"" Age"" of lst October reportedI.C.I.A.N.Z. has strengthened its position in the fertilizer industry by acquiring the interests of E.Z. industries, Mt. Lyell investments and Cuming Smith interests in Australian Fertilizers Ltd. These three companies hold 268,533 £1 ordinary shares in Australian Fertilizers Ltd. reportedCuming Smith and Co. reports a record year in 1964 and has increased dividend to 14-J per cent., equal to an improved earning rate of 15.7 per cent., the highest dividend yet paid by Cuming Smith. Thc Company's principal is its holding of 235,801 £1 shares in I.C.I.A.N.Z. Another holding is a large holding in Cuming Smith-Mi. Lyell Farmers Fertilisers Ltd. In Western Australia, Cuming Smith and Co. Ltd. and Westralian Farmers Superphosphates Ltd. had a net earning for the year of £1,020,000, a return of 23 per cent.'on an issued capital of £4.45 million. Recently, Mount Lyell Investments Ltd., which is owned by Boral Ltd. and which has a one third holding in Cuming Smith-Westralian Farmers Superphosphates Ltd., sold its holdings to the British Petroleum Co. of Australia Ltd. at a book profit of £2,263.712.

213,Mr Howson (Fawkner,Minister foi,88,Sulphate Of Ammonia Bounty
214,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [12.4 A.m.],"IPress reports that investments in C.S.B.P. will reach £12 million. Mr Cuming is Chairman of Australian Fertilisers Ltd., which has an earning rate calculated on an annual basis of 14.3 per cent. Its earning rate in 1963-64 was 17.7 per cent. So we have I.C.I.A.N.Z., Australian Fertilisers Ltd., A.C.F. and Shirleys Fertilisers Ltd., Cuming Smith, Mount Lyell and British Petroleum all well linked, as well as the earlier merged Commonwealth Fertilisers and Chemicals Ltd. On 27th October 1965, the Press reportedI.C.I.A.N.Z. yesterday announced plans lor a £12 million nitrogenous fertilisers project with Conzinc Riotinto at Newcastle to counter the strong challenge from Esso and W. R. Grace for a major foothold in the rapidly growing nitrogenous fertilisers Reid. Thc new plant will be adjacent to Greenleaf Fertilisers at Newcastle. Mr Deputy Speaker, I could go on ad infinitum demonstrating how profitable this fertiliser is and how every day these mergers are taking place. I do not deny that in some circumstances mergers reduce overhead costs and may be desirable. If we consider the increased profits that have resulted from almost every merger that I have mentioned, we can see that the primary producers and the people of this country are not getting much in return. Let us consider just one case. A particular firm-1 think it was Boral Ltd -sol d out to another firm in Western Australia at a net profit of £2i million. One need not wonder why the prices of fertilisers to the primary producers have been increased if one considers the fact that W. R. Grace and Co., the largest fertiliser and chemical producer in the United States of America, boosted the shares of Cresco Fertilisers Ltd., a fertiliser company based in South Australia and Victoria, from 50s. to 90s. each. When that sort of thing happens, one does not wonder why the prices of fertilisers are increased. If one examines every merger that has occurred in the last 12 months, one will find that high prices are always paid to those who are bought out. But who is paying for all this? Those who agree to pay the high prices to those who are being bought out do not pay. In the ultimate, the primary producers of this country pay. I have supported every bounty measure that has been before the House this evening, Mr Deputy Speaker. But I am rather doubtful about the justification for such measures sometimes. The Government at some time in the future should act to ensure that the people of Australia are not detrimentally affected by the activities of these private fertiliser enterprises. I am not averse to a reasonable return on any investment but just imagine one company buying out the interests of another company and raking off a net return of £ 2 i million. Is it any wonder the primary producers are beginning o wail about how they are being treated? r hey are gradually being pushed beyond the point of no return in their operations on behalf of the nation. I leave it at that. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 25th October (vide That the Bill be now read a second lime. This Bill provides for lhe continuation of the existing bounty of, I think, 6d. Ib. on the production of acetate flake.

Its last report indicated that it considered a bounty was justified. In those circumstances, witnout further comment, because this particular subject is perhaps less debatable than have been certain other bills relating to bounties, the Opposition is prepared to approve the continuation of the existing subsidy on acetate flake.

It is to be transferred from South Melbourne. I and some of my colleagues-the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin) and the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) for instanceare disappointed that the Government has not been able to see its way clear to construct the new clothing factory in a country area, as a practical example of decentralisation. 1 have been handed a statement by the Minister which explains why the Commonwealth believes that the factory cannot be transferred to the country. I would like lo examine the reasons that have been given. The explanation begins by saying that Sir John Allison and Mr Brewster, two specialists in the subject, examined the possibilities of locating the factory in a country area. They rejected the proposition. I do not know what are the particular skills of those two gentlemen, but I believe that the information given to me by the Minister does not bear the light of examination. It states, in partThe sole purpose of building a new clothing factory is to rehouse existing facilities at present in use in the old factory. As I said, they are not going to rebuild at South Melbourne but at Coburg. This will mean that those persons who are employed in South Melbourne, which is south of the River Yarra, will have to travel to work at Coburg, which is on the north side of the Yarra. should get his facts straight.

No survey has been made of where these people do, in fact, live. I ascertained this from the Minister. The honourable member for Maribyrnong who is interjecting apparently knows more about where these people live than does the Minister. Of the 792 employees, 20 are supervisors. I am informed that these employees are the key to the functioning of this factory. It is the belief of the Department that these 20 supervisors cannot be expected to transfer their employment from South Melbourne to, say, the Latrobe Valley, Ballarat or Wangaratta. going to argue about this, or am I going to speak to the House? In normal businessin banks, for instance-employee s are transferred to the Latrobe Valley, Wangaratta, Ballarat and such places. teachers, too. I believe that if a survey were taken it might well reveal that these 20 supervisors would prefer to live in a country area. It would be better for their health if they were able to do so. I have been informed that 33 expert embroiderers are involved. I submit that these employees, if they do not want to live in a country area, could well remain in Melbourne. Only 33 are involved.

Here again, I submit that these people could well transfer their employment. To my knowledge no attempt was made to find out whether they would be happy to transfer. I believe that the Government could have made an approach to each of these individuals to find out whether they would be interested in transferring. A total of 65 storemen is involved, but they should not come into consideration as they are not skilled employees, nor are the 18 pressers skilled workers. Pressers can be taught their (Aust.) Ltd. at Wangaratta get on? It is trade also. So we come back to what seems to be the real issue, namely, the 559 seamstresses at present employed. It has been suggested that 559 seamstresses would not be available in country areas like the Latrobe Valley, Gippsland, and the other places I have mentioned. The Department has not made a survey to determine whether the seamstresses would be happy to transfer to country areas. It is quite obvious that many of these seamstresses would be married women whose husbands are employed elsewhere and, therefore, it would not be practicable for them to transfer to the country. Despite this, a six months' period will be involved in transferring from one factory to the other, so plenty of time is available in which to train new seamstresses. The honourable member for McMillan honourable member for Maribyrnong will be ( Mr Buchanan) will agree with me that the pleased with the next reason, which is that Advance Latrobe Valley Association is a because of additional movement of materials responsible organisation.

Added to this, we Government to have another look at this have the schools which have already been matter. There are several country areas in built in the area. Housing would not be a Victoria where something like this could problem. Many of these girls who could be done, but I am plugging for Traralgon be seamstresses and who are already in the Latrobe Valley are having trouble in finding jobs. Let me return to the statement as time is running out. One of the reasons given for not establishing a clothing factory in the country areas was that if the new factory were located outside the metropolitan area, liaison with design, inspection and ordering facilities would be made more difficult. I ask: How does the Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. get on? How does the State Electricity Commission of Victoria get on? How does Bruck Mills nonsense to talk like this. Another reason given was that it is important that the factory should be in close contact with the textile and clothing industries already established in the metropolitan area. The Postmaster-General is in the House. He provides these people with the most modern facilities in the world. They can ring up and have a chat over the telephone at any time. Another reason given for not establishing a new clothing factory was that maintenance of specialised plant, carried out by contractors, would be much more difficult if the factory were to be located outside the Melbourne metropolitan area. AgainI ask: How does any factory get on that is already established in the country areas? This has some bearing on the matter. TheI submit that there is a good case for the where I know there is an employable work force and there are facilities available. If the Government were to do something about this matter, it would be a practical demonstration of the Government's interest in decentralisation. It could save itself $335,000, which is the cost of the land alone. 1 ask the Government to have another look al this matter. want to raise a matter tonight which I consider will be of vital importance to every decent thinking Australian.

Br. Forbes -The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsEver since the Model Radioactive Substances Act was recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council in May 1954, and the Model Regulations were recommended by it in November 1957, the model legislation has been under more or less constant review. The Radiation Technical Sub-Committee of the Council, in particular, is specifically undertaking a detailed review. In this detailed review, consideration is being given not only to International Labour Convention 115 and Recommendation 114, but also to the recommendations and surveys of other international and national bodies such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the International Atomic Energy Commission and the World Health Organization. The National Health and Medical Research Council will in due course recommend the technical basis for a new Model Radioactive Substances Act and Regulations which will take account of changes in circumstances brought about through international and national experience and recommendations. Apart from the revision of the Model Act and Regulations, the Council and my department in other ways take action to improve the standards and practices of those using radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus. Between October 1962 and May 1966, the council adopted six codes of practice and nine recommendations or statements prepared by its committees. Currently, three further codes of practice are in preliminary draft form and others are at the planning stage. These codes, recommendations and statements have been widely distributed and have proved very valuable not only to the authorities administering radioactive substances legislation but also to the persons actually working with radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus. Therapeutic Substances. (Question No. 2167.) Dr. J. F. Cairns asked the Minister for Health, upon notice1. Are the samples which are examined under (a) the Therapeutic Substances Act or (b) the national health scheme new products or products currently available to the public on the prescription of a medical practitioner? 2. If these samples are from products currently available to the public, does the high failure rate of these products constitute a danger to public health? 3. Where products available under the national health scheme fail to meet the requirements of such examination, what action is taken by his Department? 4. Which manufacturers and their products have failed to meet the requirements of examination during the year 1965-667 Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. Both new products and products currently available are subjected to examination. Comprehensive sampling programmes are conducted under the National Health Act, in regard to pharmaceutical benefits, and the Therapeutic Substances Act, in regard to therapeutic substances that come within thc control of the Commonwealth. Products are tested before consideration is given to listing them as pharmaceutical benefits under the National Health Act and, in addition, all products listed as pharmaceutical benefits are subjected to a continuing sampling and testing programme. 2. No. The majority of failures are for minor deficiencies. In the event of a failure of a serious nature, urgent steps are taken to have the product withdrawn from the market. 3. Thc action taken where products listed as pharmaceutical benefits fail to meet the required standards depends on the seriousness of the failure. Products which fail as regards potency, absorbability or sterility arc usually removed from thc list of pharmaceutical benefits. Failures to conform to the standards which do not impair the efficacy of the products are brought to the notice of manufacturers for correction. 4. Because many failures are for minor deficiencies, for example in regard to labelling, which do not constitute a risk to puhlic health, and because most manufacturers undertake measures to comply with the required standards when the deficiencies are brought under notice, it is not the practice to make public the names of the products or the manufacturers. Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. (Question No. 2168.) MrL . R. .Tohnson asked the Minister for Health, upon notice1. How many members of the medical profession have been the subject of (a) inquiry and (b) dis iplinary actions with respect to the incidence of pensioner patients treated? 2. Has this procedure caused great concern among pensioner patients and members of the medical profession? 3. Do the findings of the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry justify a continuation of this practice? Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. (a) During the period lst July 1961 to 30th June 1966, there were 204 references to the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to inquire whether there had been excessive attendance on pensioner patients by medical practitioners enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Servi -e. These figures include references in respect of partnerships of two or more medical practitioners and individual medical practitioners whose claims have heen the subject of more than one reference. (b) As a result of the inquiries carried out by the committees of inquiry during this period the Pensioner Medical Service Agreement with four doctors was terminated and reprimands were made in 37 cases. Disallowance of a portion of the doctor's claims was made in a further 109 cases. 2. This procedure has the full support of the Australian Medical Association. It is believed, on the case and (b) pay outstanding amounts? the whole, it has the support of the medical profession. I have seen little evidence that it has caused concern at all among pensioner patients generally. 3. As the Pensioner Medical Service now costs the Commonwealth approximately $14.75 million per annum for medical services alone, it is considered that the continuation of the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry is justified. Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. (Question No. 2178.) Mr Daly asked the Minister for Health, upon notice1. Has he investigated the case of Dr. R. Perkins, Cambridge Street, Enmore, to whi.h I referred on llth October 1966? 2. If so, what action is proposed to (a) finalise Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. I have received and considered the report of the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry in respect of Drs. R. G. and G. P. Perkins. 2. (a) 1 have given my decision on the report and this has been conveyed to the medical practitioners concerned, (b) Arrangements have been made for the early payment of amounts outstanding up to 30th September 1965. Claims in respect of the period October 1965 to August 1966 are currently being examined.",99,Catholic Secondary Schools
