Prior to last year, I had at my disposal no further information or opinions on this subject than those which were available to the ordinary newspaper reader. But last year, as a member of this House, I heard the debate on the subject w i th which this bill proposes to deal. The provisions of the measure, in my opinion, should not be considered from either the party viewpoint or that of the States. Last year's debate was notable for a good deal of acrimonious discussion in which some very unpleasant terms, such as "" mendicant States"" and "" coming cap in hand to the Government"" were used. Such terms are most objectionable. Members representing the three States which were then dealt with had some difficulty in repressing their State feelings. This bill is intituled "" A b ill for an act relating to a commission to deal with the matter of grants by the Commonwealth of financial assistance to the States "". . It does not specify what States are to receive grants, and it w ill not dispel the unpleasant feeling that has arisen during the last few years respecting Commonwealth grants to States, because when this commission, if it is appointed, makes its report, Parliament w ill have to consider it , and the previous arguments and recriminations w ill again be heard. The disabilities which the bill purports to remove have nothing whatever to do with the States as such. This is purely an accident of boundaries. The industries of the smaller States, being chiefly primary, are bringing upon the Governments of those States financial embarrassment; but the like embarrassment is also present in the larger Statesi n respect of certain of their areas. This difficulty is not mentioned in , and w ill not be removed by this measure. It is the duty of this Parliament to ascertain the cause of the disabilities of the smaller States, and that cause is not dealt with in the bill. The proposed commission is to inquire into many things in respect of which the House has already f u l l information. It w ill be a costly body, although the cost in proportion to the amount of money involved would not be great, provided that the results were satisfactory. I cannot see the necessity for appointing this commission for a period of five years.",15,Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Bill

36,Mr Mcnicoll (Werriwa) [2.58],"Surelyi f it is to inquire into all the circumstances of the States concerned, it should be able to recommend to the Parliament some formula or policy which could be put into operation u n t i l the position of those States changed. It is not within the bounds of human nature to imagine that this commission w ill l i m it concerned w ill be of much benefit to the its sittings, if it is free to meet when the chairman thinks necessary and to draw sitting fees during a period of not less than five years. This Parliament should make some effort to solve the difficulties of the State instead of appointing a commission to inquire into matters of which we already have f u l l knowledge. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in his policyspeech, saidThe present subdivision of Australia into States cannot be regarded as permanent. There are areas in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, which are demanding fuller recognition of the principle of local self government. The provisions of the Constitution with respect to the creation of new States are vague and ambiguous. We consider that these provisions should be amended and clarified. The creation of new federal units in New South Wales is in no sense in line with the policy of unification, but it would certainly involve the granting of in creased powers to the Federal Parliament, and a different allocation of duties to new and existing units. The granting of such additional powers would undoubtedly tend towards the solution of many of the difficulties with which this bill proposes to deal. This question is not a new one. In 1891, Sir Henry Parkes said, almost propheticallyAg a matter of reason and logical forecast, it cannot be doubted that if the union-the federation-were inaugurated with double the number of present colonies, the growth and prosperity of all would be more absolutely assured. He further remarkedThe division of the existing colonies into with the States proposed to be helped by smaller areas to equalize the distribution of political power will be the next great conthis bill. stitutional reform. We have for 43 years been waiting for that division contains 94,000,000 acres, and constitutional reform. A t the first new the Riverina division 57,000,000 acres. States convention, held at Armidalei n The population of the New England 1921, SirW ill i a m Cullen saidI am of the opinion that the new State of South Australia 585,000. Therefore, movement is as national as federation itself, this division has practically the same and its natural corollary. I am aware that a number of honourable -members of conservative opinions hold that whatever is is best; but I ask honourable members generally to discuss this matter in a deliberative spirit, and to consider whether a careful inquiry into the position of the States Commonwealth as a whole. Recently, the people of Western Australia carried a referendum in favour of secession from the federation. I certainly deplore that vote. In New South Wales a country movement has arisen in favour of the subdivision of States, and that movement is not restricted to that State. It is gaining much ground in the large cities, particularly Sydney. I know that the Young Nationalists of Victoria are supporting the movement. The Supreme Court of the United States of America has made the following important announcement:Experience has shown that, in a country of great territorial extent and varied interest, peace and lasting prosperity can rest with the civilized people only when local affairs are controlled by local authority. The difficulties of the three States concerned are not difficulties confined within their boundaries, and if the b ill purports to remove some of those difficulties, it must also take cognizance of the fact that their causes are .to be found in other States as well. It was at one time suggested that New South Wales-the State w i th which I am most familiar-shoul d be divided into three new States, and, as a result of the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister, and later by the Premier and Deputy Premier of New South Wales, a State boundary commission was appointed, and is at present inquiring into this matter from the view-point, not of party or class, but of the benefit to the country as a whole. It is of interest to compare the suggested divisions in New South Wales The area of the proposed division of New England consists of 42,000,000 acres; the proposed central division is 547,000, and that of the State",16,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading
37,Mr Mcnicoll.,"population as South Australia. The population of the proposed central division is 1,600,000, and of Victoria 1,800,000. The population of the Riverina division is 326,000, and of Tasmania 224,000. So that the population of the Riverina is considerably more than that of Tasmania. The unimproved capital values of rateable property in these divisions are-Ne w England, Â£80,000,000; Central division, Â£233,000,000, and the Riverina division Â£66,000,000. I ask those who have a knowledge of federal history to consider how small were the population and the wealth of Victoria and Queensland at the time when those States separated from New South Wales, compared with the wealth and the population of these three divisions. that those two States assumed control of their own destinies, they began to progress. We do not find either of them approaching the Commonwealth for support as, unfortunately, other States have had to do. It is admitted that very grave difficulties are involved in this matter, and that a solution of them cannot be found by New South Wales alone; although the Constitution contains a provision which enables the Government of that State, of its own volition, to subdivide its area. Since the establishment of federation, the control of the Commonwealth has .become more and more involved. Under the Financial Agreement of 1927, the affairs of the Commonwealth and the States in relation to commitments abroad, have been interwoven. There is also the allocation of federal and state powers, the creation of new provincial constitutions, and the necessity for endeavouring to reduce governmental expenditure. These matters are worthy of the closest consideration and inquiry by constitutional lawyers, as well as by those politicians who aim at being considered statesmen. As Australia comprises 3,000,000 square miles of territory, it is a matter for wonder that we have been able to carry on with only six State administrations. Every large country in the world aims at decentralization. Canada has nine provinces and two Territories. The United States of America consists at present of 48 States and two Territories, compared with only thirteen States 150 years ago, since when, there has been continuous extension. In that country, it is considered that from 50,000 to 60,000 square miles is an ideal area for a state. The Argentine has fourteen States and ten Territories; while Austrafjja, with an area practically equal to that of the United States of America and"" the Argentine, has but six States. I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). The bill may be regarded as an honest endeavour by the Government to avoid the unpleasantness that has characterized the treatment of this subject in the past, and to deal with it in a fitting manner. I am sorry, however, that I cannot give the measure wholehearted support, beBut from the moment cause I consider that it falls short of what the Government could do. The honourable member for Wakefield .( Mr Hawker) referred to the proposed commissioners as Fathers Confessor, and said that the Commonwealth was merely paying conscience money, the implication being that there is something sinful in the plea of unfortunate States for assistance. The analogy that I would apply is that there is something wrong with Australia, that the body politic is sick, and that the Govrnment is attempting to restore it to health by administering morphia. As a sedative, that may alleviate the difficulty temporarily; but, as everyone knows, the taking of morphia causes a craving for more frequent and larger doses, until the subject becomes a drug addict, who loses not only all self respect, but also the esteem of his .fellows. This case calls for skilled surgery, and the Ministry is well qualified to perform the operation. There may have to be a period of convalescence, but ultimately the federation must have a strong and a healthy constitution. In view of the excellent diagnosis of the position which the Prime Minister made in his policy speech, I trust that he will deal with the matter in a broad, non-party, non-State, and purely federal spirit; that he will take the action necessary to get to the root of our constitutional difficulties and, by meeting the growing needs for the further subdivision of this young country, will so greatly enhance his reputation that his name will stand alongside those -of the all too few statesmen of Australia's past who have done great things for the federation. quite a long time many recommendations have been'made in different quarters in favour of the appointment of a body such as the proposed commission, which would inquire into and recommend what grants should be made to different States. Those recommendations came, I think, mainly from the States which had received grants from the Commonwealth. I am not prepared to join with the representatives of those States who are disposed to reject this proposal. I am not in entire agreement with my colleagues in that respect. ""Western Australia can expect to obtain a good deal of advantage from the appointment of this commission, which, I believe, will give fairer and more sympathetic consideration to the claims of the needy States than they have received from any government or from the members of this House. Western Australia has pronounced 'very definitely in favour of secession from the federation. I , however, shall approach the consideration of this measure from what I regard as the practical point of view; that is to say, that Western Australia still is, in fact, paratively prosperous. It is true that, within the federation, and that, so long as she remains there, we should endeavour to make the best of whatever position may arise. This commission, I believe, can do most useful work. It will have to report upon all applications for grants that are made to the Government. Those grants may be made under two heads; first, on account of necessitous circumstances in a State; and secondly, because of disabilities caused to a State. It would seem that the commission will be obliged to inquire into those disabilities, if it is properly to perform its functions. Many of these grants will be in the nature of compensation for disabilities arising from the federal connection. In order to ascertain the extent of the disabilities, it will be necessary for the commission to inquire into federal laws, and to find out how these bring about the disabilities. Unless an inquiry is made, I fail to see how the commission can make a reasonable assessment of the disabilities. for that 'be made in the bill? able member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the bill is unnecessarily restrictive in its terms. I am inclined to think that the draftsman who drew up the measure was meticulous to see that its terms limited the commission to the special powers set out in section 96 of the Constitution, which authorizes the making of grants to the States. I notice that that section is quoted-unnecessarily , it seems to me-the e times in the effective clause of the bill. It may be inferred, presumably, that that is an intimation to the commission that its inquiry is to be strictly limited, in accordance with the terms of section 96; that it is not to yield to any temptation to inquire into federal laws, or their consequences. If the provisions of that clause were strictly carried ' out by the commission, its efforts would be hampered, and it would be unable to ascertain what grants should be made. Of course, the needy States have good cause for complaint, in that no grant of money which is likely to be made by this Parliament will adequately compensate them. When Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia entered the federation, they were all comsince federation, Western Australia has increased its population; but that was inevitable. In so far as that State has advanced, it has done so, not on account of federation, but in spite of it. The history of South Australia and Tasmania, from the time of federation, is one of languishment. I have not heard anybody suggest any other cause for this retrogression than the adverse effect upon these States of Commonwealth legislation. Western Australia will be glad to receive compensation; but, rather than a monetary grant, it desires the removal of the causes of the trouble. What would stifle the complaint of that State against federation would be the granting to it of the right to control its own tariff. It enjoyed that right under the Constitution for five years, at the outset of federation, and, therefore, there is a .precedent for giving the State fiscal autonomy. That was recommended after inquiry by an independent body composed of men, not from Western Australia, but from the eastern States.",17,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

40,Mr Nairn,"I agree with the honorthe granting to Western Australia of the right to operate its own tariff. be amended, if the eastern States are prepared to concede that right. High protection is the accepted policy of the eastern States, which contain the majority of the people of Australia; but I fail to see how that policy can be operated so as to make it compatible with the interests of Western Australia. Under the present tariff system, the exporting industries of that State are at a great disadvantage. Australia are obliged to trade with the eastern States, but get scarcely any trade in return. Their trade interests lie, not with the eastern States, but with the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Malay and Great Britain. Being obliged to buy their goods from the eastern States, Western Australians are debarred, to that extent, from dealing with Eastern countries in return for the trade which those countries do with them. This bill seems to assume that there will be a continuation of the fiscal policy which has proved injurious to Western Australia in the past. references to section 96 of the Constitution indicate, I think, that the commission must not enter the political field in making its inquiries. Yet the Constitution imposes a positive duty on the government of the day to appoint an interstate commission, because it states, "" There shall be an interstate commission."" I do not agree with the Attorney-General( Mr give consideration to trade and commerce Latham), that the effect of the High Court decision was to paralyse that commission. As the right honourable gentleman pointed out, it was merely a decision that the interstate commission was not a court, and, therefore, could not issue an injunction, or take positive steps to enforce its decisions. But that left untouched the altogether wider field which was open to the commission to make the inquiries that it had formerly conducted into trade and commerce, and the effect of the tariff, and Commonwealth laws generally, upon the States. interstate inquiries, and they were untouched by the decisions of the High Court. The Attorney-General has told us that the tariff functions of the commission have been transferred to the Tariff Board. I have read many reports of that board, and I appreciate its work; but I am not aware that it has ever given special consideration to a duty as it affects any particular State. Apparently, the principle on which the Tariff Board acts is that the interests of the majority shall be protected. This means, of course, that the interests of the eastern States, and particularly those The people of Western of the two large cities, Sydney and Melbourne, must be the paramount consideration. The adoption of such a policy makes it impossible for the board to give special consideration to the smaller States. act only on that principle. Mr N^AlRN -That may .be so. But it is a regrettable effect of the transference to the Tariff Board of part of the work which should have been done by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission was charged with the duty, among others, of inquiring into the effect of the tariff upon all the States, including The repeated the smaller States. The Tariff Board, however, has concerned itself chiefly with the interests of the large centres of population which are, obviously, incompatible with those of the smaller States. I regret that the Interstate Commission should have been allowed to fall into disuse. It would be quite easy for the Government to provide that this commission should generally, and particularly to our customs and excise duties. If it were disposed to extend the usefulness of the commission in this way, it should recite in the bill the trade and commerce and tariff sections of the Constitution. That would make it clear that the commission would not be confined to the narrow subject of State grants, but could make the widest investigation into the principles which, should govern the making of such grants. We have been told frequently that the smaller States voted in favour of federation, but the proposed Federal ConThe old stitution seemed, at that time, to be a commission made those very different instrument from what it has turned out to be in actual experience.",19,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

43,Mr Maxwell,"Surely the board canAt the 'time federation was being discussed, we were told that the Commonwealth would cost an amount equivalent to only 2s. 6d. per head of the population. that statement. doubtedly was made by one man originally, but it received wide publication from both press and platform, and I feel sure that it was repeated by many more than one man. We were also told that the Constitution provided for the return of surplus Commonwealth revenue to the States. That provision was apparently expressed in unmistakable language, but -the High Court subsequently held that the Commonwealth Government was entitled to arrange its expenditure in such a way that there would be no surplus revenue to return to the States. It was also provided in the Constitution that the Commonwealth should retain 25 per cent, of the Customs revenue, and return the remaining 75 per cent, of it to the States. The trouble was that all these provisions were interpreted to tbe disadvantage of the States. The early members of the High Court Bench were strong federalists, and the effect of their interpretation of the Constitution, together with the taxation policy adopted by successive Commonwealth Governments, was such that the financial resources of the States were so depleted that they had ultimately to accept a new scheme of finance in substitution of the provision of the Constitumunities living in the country districts of tion that 75 per cent, of the Customs revenue should be returned to them. The Financial Agreement was made in 1927. I believed at the time it was ratified that it was justifiable from the point of view of the smaller States; but actually, the States were forced into it because the Commonwealth had invaded their fields of taxation to such an extent that it had exhausted their sources of revenue. The States had either to accept the financial agreement or become bankrupt. I believe that if a vote on federation were to be taken throughout the Commonwealth to-day, the result would be very different in the smaller States from what it was years ago. I wish to make a few observations But such a method would lead to the regarding the character of the appointappointment of too cumbersome and ments to be made under this bill. I hope expensive a body. that the Government in making these appointments will not attempt to select men whose associations might pledge them to a continuance of the easternStates, qr eastern-cities, policy. It is extremely important that men of broad outlook should be appointed. It is undeniable that previous commissions which have inquired into the disabilities of certain States have given their claims much more sympathetic consideration than this Parliament has given them. As a matter of fact, the claims of the smaller States have been given short shrift in this Parliament. When the interests of the smaller States have clashed with those of the big cities of Australia, they have received scant consideration. I am a federalist, and I hope that the past policy of this Parliament in that connection will be reviewed. In the past, governments of every political complexion have undoubtedly given their chief attention to the interests of the eastern States and the big cities to the serious detriment of the other States and the small cities. If this policy is continued, a secession movement will undoubtedly develop in South Australia. I utter a warning, particularly to the Labour party, which, in the past, has, to an even greater extent than the parties on this side of the chamber, promoted the interests of the large centres of population, that if they desire the federation to be preserved, they must be prepared to give fairer play to the comthe eastern States, and to those States which are dependent mainly upon rural industries. As regards the bill itself, I agree with several other honourable members, that we do not need a commission of the size indicated, nor should its members heappointed for a period of five years. In my opinion, three men would be quite sufficient to discharge the duties required of them. There are alternative methods for the appointment of such a body. For example, the bill might provide for State representation, in which case there would be on it a representative of each of the States, with a Commonwealth appointee as chairman to hold the balance of power.",20,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

In any case, a period of two years would be sufficient provided the commission had authority to continue its inquiries if necessary. My fear is that members of the commission will be appointed for the maximum period, and, as a consequence, this country will be saddled with another expensive public body. I thought that this Government had sufficient experience of costly commissions not to make this mistake. Certainly the people of this country are tired of them, and, moreover, this is not the time for unnecessary expenditure of public money on such bodies. I accept the principles of the bill. I believe that the people in the smaller iStates will have a better chance of making their views known through the medium of this proposed inquiry. I , therefore, hope that the proceedings of the commission will be open to the general public, and that the fullest publicity will be given to its investigations. I consider that the Government is right as regards the principles of the measure, and I intend to support its second reading. [3.45j -Some diplomat or high oflicial is credited with having, while in a generous mood, coined the phrase "" State disabilities "". It would have been more to the point if , in his observations concerning the position of the smaller States under federation, he had spoken of the States inefficiency. In my opinion, the precarious position in which many of the States now find themselves is due to the fact that, for a long time, they have been propounding and giving legislative effect to economically unsound schemes. are in difficulties, they are endeavouring by constant appeals to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance to justify proposals which have been defiI repeat that three men nitely proved to be uneconomic. In the discussion of this bill, we have to face the facts, and we should attempt to trace to their source the uneconomic proposals of State Governments which have been responsible for their present financial troubles. There is no need to stress the uneconomic nature of land settlement proposals initiated by State Governments. The disastrous results of I agree with the honorthose schemes are too well known to need recapitulation, so we must consider to what extent we are justified in extending further financial assistance in connection with them. It should be remembered that the people of the various States entered the federation with their eyes open. They knew, or should have known, to what they were committing themselves when they joined the union. Under the constitutional provision known as the Braddon blot, the Commonwealth undertook for a definite period, to return to the several States a certain proportion of the revenue from customs and excise duties, to assist to maintain State finances in a condition of reasonable stability. ' Subsequently, the Commonwealth made an arrangement for the per capita payments, the effect of which was to bolster up the many uneconomic and expensive State schemes which were responsible for the deficits in State Government accounts. ""With the progress of time, the States became so accustomed to successful appeals to the Commonwealth Government to make good these deficits, that now they claim this assistance as a right. The slogan at the inauguration of the federation was, "" one people, one flag, one destiny."" To what extent has that slogan been translated into the activities of the various States? Is it not a fact that to-day States are fighting one against the other with a view to securing political advantages ? Erom whatever angle we view the bill we must be forced to the conclusion that the "" dole"" payments to be made under it to the States will be determinedby political instead of national considerations.

52,Mr Nelson,"Now, because theyadopted the slogan of ""Australia first,"" not "" party first"", which, to the outsider, appears now to be the general policy of governments and parties. No one can deny that a great deal of work of a national character lies ahead of us. Consequently, wo must realize our responsibilities if we should like our names to be revered, instead of despised, by those who come after us, as will surely be the case if we continue to administer the affairs of this country in the interests of party instead of the nation. Our apathy in regard to affairs of national significance is imperilling the future of this country. If we do not shake off this apathy, we cannot expect to see the materialization of those national aspirations which were so much in evidence at the inauguration I wish my children to think that I have done something to consolidate Australia's future, and I am sure that every other honourable member is actuated by a similar desire. I make no apologies for placing before honourable members figures that are startling, in an endeavour to compel the Government to do something that will effect national stability rather than play with the problem as if is doing with this bill. Speaking in Adelaide recently, Senator Sir George Pearce made an alarming, but true, statement. He pointed to the danger of leaving a huge portion of Australia unpopulated, and, therefore, undefended and undeveloped. Senator Sir George. Pearce said that if we did not populate that area, some other country would do it for us-and it would not be Great Britain. Those words are significant, particularly when we remember that an island lying to the north-west of Australia has an area of only 140,000 square miles and a population of 64,000,000, which is increasing at the rate of 750,000 per annum. It is estimated that in 24 years' time the population of that island will be 90,000,000. Those figures convey a warning to all who are willing to listen. Two eminent Hessel Tiltman honourable member indicate in what way his remarks are connected with the bill? sir, that I am not to be given the same a commission to consider the alleged disable members' abilities of the States, and I am endeavouring to show that the word "" disabilities "" is a misnomer; that' the term used should be "" inefficiency "". I am trying to demonstrate that the money that it is proposed to grant to the States could be more profitably expended in areas where the expenditure would permanently benefit the people of Australia. I submit that I am in order in suggesting an alternative proposal, and in urging that the stability of Australia as a nation should be our first consideration. I was pointing out that two well-known authors, Mr P. T. Hetherton and Mr Hessel Tiltman, have analysed the problems to which I have referred, and have embodied their opinions in a volume that has just been issued in London, entitled, Japan, Misof federation. tress of the Pacific.

Our outlook would then be truly Australian, instead of parochial. As there is urgent necessity to conclude the consideration of this bill so that we may have an opportunity to debate other important matters, my remarks shall be brief. I strongly support the measure, as I believe it to incorporate a desirable reform, and to give effect to a promise that was made in the Treasurer's last budget speech. There is no need for honourable members to debate the merits or demerits of the claims of the various States. Indeed, a discussion at this stage of the disabilities of the individual State* is undesirable; that is entirely a matter for judicial investigation by the proposed' commission, whose main purpose will be; to hear and analyse the evidence tendered! by the States and make a recommendation/ for the guidance of this Parliament. At present, grants to the States are fixed more or less by rule of thumb; they are not based on any accepted principle or formula. Mr ""WARD -I s any formula provided in this bill ? the commission will be able to devise a better system for the making of these grants than has operated in the past. Tbe Government is proposing the appointment of an independent body, the personnel of which will be absolutely impartial, owing allegiance to neither Commonwealth nor States, and free to give a judicial report for the guidance of Parliament. In the past several tribunals have considered applications by the States to the Commonwealth for financial assistance, and each report has deprecated the interminable, inquiries and limitation of the periods for which grants have been made. All recommended that a permanent body should be appointed to advise Parliament in this regard. The yearly review of applications for assistance is fair neither to the States nor to the Commonwealth. Stable government and a long range policy of economic rehabilitation is possible for the States only if their governments know approximately what, their financial position will be for a few years ahead. The frequent inquiries into the grounds upon which the claims for assistance are based have been irritating.",23,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

68,Mr Guy,"No, but it is hoped thaiand, to some extent, futile. The principle of a central federal government making financial grants to the component States or provinces is by no means new. It has been adopted in the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, Germany, and Switzerland. The Canadian maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are in much the same relation to the central dominion government as is Tasmania to the Commonwealth, and, following the investigations by a royal commission, the maritime provinces were generously treated by the dominion Parliament. member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), and other honourable members, have complained that this bill contains no proposal for the removal of State disabilities. mendations calling for action by the As has been rightly said, State disabilities State Parliament were contingent upon are a constitutional problem to be dealt with on a more appropriate occasion. But what are State disabilities? Does the honourable member for Hindmarsh agree that the tariff is one of the disabilities of South Australia? In the case submitted by the South Australian Government in support of its claim for financial assistance from the Commonwealth, the tariff was declared to be the greatest disability of the State, costing it over Â£3,000,000 a year. that inquired into South Australia's case said that the State had advantages as well five years for payment to the credit of the as disadvantages under federation. The small States claim that the tariff is liability. their greatest disability; and it is one of the federal influences which some such honourable members have suggested, by Sentinel-Cammell steam driven rail-cars. Such inference, should be removed. Commonwealth Arbitration Act and Australia should be admitted duty free. the Navigation Act also, are referred to That recommendation also called for as grave disabilities. Do honourable memfederal action. bers wish those statutes to be repealed?

The only suggestion made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh to rectify the defects of the present constitutional position was unification, but would the people of South Australia approve of that? I believe that they would regard such a remedy as worse than the present disease. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) complained that Tasmania had not carried out the recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee, following its investigations into the The honourable finances and disabilities of that State. That committee reported to the Commonwealth Government, not to the Tasmanian Government. In any case certain recomaction by this Parliament.

That requires action by this Parliament. Other recommendations included an investigation by the Commonwealth development branch of the fruit industry of Tasmania, and a federal grant of Â£3,000 a year for five years to the State Forestry Department. The committee also proposedThat a permanent body be appointed to make a continuous study of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. This bill is designed to give effect to that. The proposal that an effort be made to bring about uniformity in the preparation of Commonwealth and State financial statements placed a responsibility upon both the Commonwealth and the State. The final recommendation was that the Commonwealth should make certain refunds of customs duty paid on plant imported by the Hydro-Electric' Department of Tasmania. The honourable member for Dalley will see that, of the thirteen recommendations by the Public Accounts Committee, nine are definitely directed to the Commonwealth, and one called for the co-operation of the Commonwealth and the 'State. I hope that the honourable member, before again criticizing Tasmania, will make a closer study of the facts. several features of the bill I take strong exception, but other provisions will receive my support. The title, "" A bill for an act relating to a commission to deal with the matter of grants by the Commonwealth of financial. assistance to the States,"" is a clear indication that there are many difficulties and problems which must be thoroughly investigated before this Parliament will be justified in the State Government carefully making further large grants to the various the Government admits the existence of average. State disabilities, and the need for investigating them systematically before comgrants. By proposing to appoint to the commission five men with special qualifications, the Government declares, in effect, that the problems to be investigated are complex. The Government has stated, also, that the existing difficulties are largely the outcome of the constitutional relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and it proposes a national convention to consider the remodelling of the Constitution. In other words, a commission is to be appointed to assess the grants to be made to the States as compensation for disabilities arising out of the present constitutional relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and simultaneously a convention is to report on the Constitution with a view to removing the disabilities which are the reasons for the grants. If a commission is necessary, I cannot understand why the Government thinks that it should be composed of five members. A commission of three would be more workable and more expeditious, and would be fully equal to its responsible task; in addition, the cost of the inquiry would be considerably reduced. The Government having admitted that the States suffer disabilities, and having decided to recommend the calling of a constitutional convention to remove, at any rate, some of the causes of those disabilities, why does it propose that this commission shall be appointed for five years? Is it contended that the disabilities will exist for all time, and that year after year the position will have to be investigated, and fresh recommendations made? Surely it is feasible for the Government to appoint a lesser number of men for a shorter time to investigate the immediate difficulties, and leave other matters for the consideration of the constitutional commission which will be appointed later. Under this bill power is given to the commission to investigate any",25,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading
73,Mr Thobby (Calare) [4.12],"T omatter which a State may place before it . Clause9 of the bill states9. The commission shall inquire into and report to the Governor General upon(a) applications made by any State to the Commonwealth for the grant by the Parliament of financial assistance in pursuance of section ninetysix of the Constitution. When we examine section 96, we find that it covers anything and everything. The wording is as follows:96. During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. Therefore, the bill provides that any State may make application to the commission for assistance in respect to a financial disability, no matter to what that disability may be attributed. This w ill apply also, no doubt, to the Northern Territory, which has many real difficulties of its own, and to the Federal Capital Territory as well. obtain certain State powers, and are granted electoral rights which they do not now possess, difficulties, no doubt, w ill arise which, under this bill, may be submitted to the commission for investigation. ber w ill notice that the bill also gave power for the commission to inquire into the manner in which a grant has been used by a State. does not provide for attaching conditions to the grant. Our experience has taught us that States are sometimes brought face to face with financial difficulties, largely through their own fault y administration. There is nothing in the bill to say that the matters to be considered by the commission shall be those arising directly out of federation, or out of the acts of the Federal Government. There should be some safeguard to provide that a State which runs off at a political tangent, as it were, and dissipates its revenues on extravagant or mischievous undertakings, shall not be able to come back after a year or two, and beg, cap in hand, for the consideration of its difficulties by this commission with a view to receiving .assistance from the Commonwealth. I readily admit that there should be some authority to carry out investigations into State disabilities. W it h in the States themselves, we find certain districts i u practically the same position in relation to the whole State as certain States now are in relation to the whole Commonwealth, and the State Parliaments have power to endow various local governments to compensate them for disabilities suffered as a result of the establishment, perhaps, of other local governing bodies. One district may suffer serious disabilities through the development of a neighbouring district, while certain sections of a State may suffer disabilities on account of the concentration of population in a capital city. Such disabilities can be satisfactorily investigated and removed only by a decentralized authority; no government sitting in Canberra can deal effectively with them. State and Federal powers should be clearly defined, and the Commonwealth should not dabble in many of the matters with which it now concerns itself. There As these territories is a great deal of duplication of Federal and State efforts, particularly in regard to taxation. The Federal Government takes a large sum of money every year from the pockets of the taxpayers, who are also State taxpayers, and then appoints expensive commissions to deterT h e honourable memmine how some of that money shall be handed back to the States. Not only is the duplication itself costly in the first place, but the machinery for handing back the taxes gathered by the Commonwealth is also expensive to operate. The sooner we get a clear line of demarcation between State and Federal powers, the better off we shall be. There has been no lack of investigation of State disabilities. Apartf r o m the Interstate Commission set up under section 101 of the Constitution, which came into existence in 1913, and was terminated in 1920, we find that, in 1925, a royal commission, known as the Higgs Commission, was appointed to inquire into the disabilities of Western Australia under federation. In 1926, the Lockyer Commission Avas appointed to inquire into the financial position of Tasmania, and in 1929 the Cook Royal Commission conducted an investigation into the finances of South Australia as they were affected by federation. In",26,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading
74,Mr Maxwell,,27,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading
75,Mr Thorby,"T h a t is so, but i t1929, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts also investigated the position of South Australia as affected by federation, and in the same year the committee inquired into the general question of Tasmania's disabilities. In 1930, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made a further investigation into the position of South Australia under federation, -while in 192S-29 the Development and Migration Commission carried out an investigation into the internal position of Tasmania. All these authorities inquired into exactly the same matters as it is proposed that this commission shall investigate. The Government would be well advised to hasten the calling together of the Constitutional Convention, whose duty it would be to endeavour to discover reasons for the financial disabilities under which the States suffer. The convention ought to be able to lay down a formula which would be acceptable to the Commonwealth Government, and known to the States, so that they might use it as a basis for arranging their finances. As the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Guy) pointed out, it is essential that a State Government should know, as far ahead as possible, what grants it may look for from the Commonwealth Government, so that it may budget accordingly. The commission to be appointed under this bill will have no power to investigate the effect of the Commonwealth Constitution on the affairs of the States, and there is no suggestion that the Government will take action to overcome the disabilities which have arisen under the Constitution. Something should be done to clarify the position, so that the States would know over a period of ten or twenty years what financial assistance they might expect from the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth Government would know what liability it would have to shoulder on behalf of the States. The financial position of the States seeking assistance is controlled by the export value of their products. States which are largely exporters of primary produce are suffering serious financial difficulties, not through federation alone, but because the value of their products is below the cost of production. They are making no profit on the export of their produce, yet the manufactured goods which they require have to be bought at high prices in a protected market from the more prosperous States where the secondary industries have been established. It was this situation which brought about the secession movement in Western Australia. The people of that State are clamouring for something which is practically impossible of attainment, but they are seeking in that way to overcome a disability which is directly traceable to our present tariff policy. The tariff operates for the benefit of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland at the expense of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. The three lastmentioned States purchase practically the whole of their requirements of manufactured goods from the other three States, which share almost' the whole of the benefits arising from our fiscal policy, and they sell their primary produce in the world's markets, and receive for it world's prices. Little, if any, of those primary products is disposed of in the eastern States. Australia's fiscal policy places a heavy burden on three States, while conferring benefits on the remaining three States. The Government proposes to appoint a commission of five members, notwithstanding that three would be sufficient, and to continue it in office for five years, when one year would be ample were action taken to hold a constitutional convention. Already, the Constitution is 35 years old; since it was drafted, many things have happened to justify its being remodelled. I ' hope that when this bill reaches the committee stage the Government will accept amendments designed to. save both time and money. The Government should recognize that a solution of the difficulties caused by the Constitution are beyond the ability of the commission proposed to be appointed. opinion of some honourable members who have spoken, this bill has a very wide scope, for they have discussed such questions as secession and the new States Those movement. I shall not follow them by departing from the subject-matter of the bill, but shall endeavour to confine myself to its provisions. Tho measure before us seeks to set up a commission to inquire into and report oh the measure of financial assistance which should be given by the Commonwealth to needy States.

76,Mr Price (Boothby) [4.32],"In thetake it that the commission, if appointed, South Australia has suffered because of will be empowered to investigate the finances of the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. regard the Government's proposal as a real step forward. where we were. disabilities of South Australia have been investigated; first, by the Cook Com-' mission, and later by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As a result of the reports submitted by those investigations, South Australia received certain grants from the Commonwealth, but, unfortunately, they were less than that State had asked for. Consequently, successive State treasurers have experienced great difficulty in balancing the State budgets year after year. The appointment of this commission should enable the Commonwealth to know the true financial position of the States. That should be of benefit to both the States and to the Commonwealth. AlthoughI am of the opinion that some of the clauses ought to be amended in committee, I am prepared to give the Government's proposal a trial, and to allow the commission to function. On numerous occasions since 1928, I have referred to the disabilities of South Australia as a result of federation; but I assure honourable members that it has been no pleasure to do so. No honourable member takes any pride in coming cap in hand to the Federal Government for assistance to his State. when the determination of the financial assistance which should be granted to necessitous States should be placed on a more satisfactory basis. Some honourable members have asked what disabilities Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania suffer by reason of federation. I am not fully acquainted with the position in Western Australia and Tasmania; but I know how federation has affected South Australia, and I shall confine myself to putting the case for that State. The disabilities of South Australia can be placed under a number of headings. First, there are those which are the direct result of federation. These disabilities are so many that I shall not attempt to enumerate them now. Secondly, the war; thirdly, through over-borrowing; and fourthly, by a continuation of I deficits. ment. of that sweeping statement. Fifthly, South Australia has had a succession of bad seasons. member contend that the Commonwealth should pay for them? of one State affect all the other States in the federation. In the sixth place, there has been a shrinkage of South Australia's national income because of the fall in the prices of export commodities. AlthoughI have stressed these several points on many occasions, South Australia has not been granted the assistance for which that State has asked. For what it has received South Australia is thankf u l ; but it needs more. In June, 1931, all the governments of Australia agreed to adopt the Premiers plan, which was designed to bring about a gradual recovery of the nation's finances. South Australia carried out that plan to the letter; it decreased its adjustable expenditure to a greater extent than did any other government, and reduced its loan expenditure to the minimum. In doing so, it placed a heavy burden on the people of that State. gentleman suggest that this Parliament should subsidize the Premiers plan? Australia is exceedingly heavy; and with federal taxation superimposed on it, the burden placed on the citizens of that State is almost insupportable. The tremendous fall in the prices received overseas for the State's exportable products has meant a serious decline in the State's total income, with a corresponding restriction of the taxable field. The reduced national income has resulted in a considerable falling off in the volume of ordinary business transacted within the State. rupt the honourable member; but he is not confining his remarks to the subject matter of the hill.",28,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

87,Mr Speaker,"I am sorry to interwork which the commission will be called upon to do. I was pointing out that the heroic attempts of South Australia to comply with the Premiers plan, together with the fall in the prices of that State's exportable products, had reduced the purchasing power of the community and increased unemployment, with the result that the State had had to come to the relief of its necessitous citizens, thereby incurring heavy deficits. Both the Cook Commission and the Public Accounts Committee which investigated the difficulties of South Australia emphasized the necessity for setting up a commission to deal with the granting of assistance to that State. There should be some impartial body appointed to investigate the claims of the weaker States. The bill is a step in the right direction, because it aims at alleviating their position. I do not agree with all its provisions, and at the committee stage I shall endeavour to improve some of them. -There is no necessity for the appointment of this proposed 'commission, because sufficient investigation has already been made of the financial position of the States concerned. From what we can gather from the records of the proceedings of this and other Parliaments, it is evident that many commissions and boards, instead of being of benefit, have led to disaster. I estimate that the cost of travelling expenses and fees to be paid to a commission composed of five members will be at least Â£4,500. that. servatiA'e one. If this commission is appointed it will probably become a subdepartment, with an office and staff, consisting of a secretary, typist and clerks. As it is probable that considerable evidence will be taken from those competent to give information respecting the financial position of some of the States, stenographers may also be required. Surely we have awakened to the fact that at this time of lamentable financial stress not only every pound, but also every penny counts. This Government is embarking lightheartedly upon this expenditure. The peregrinations of this commission must be undertaken at considerable expense. any necessity for a commission of this kind to peregrinate?

I estimate that the expense of this commission during a period of five years will be from Â£30,000 to Â£40,000, and those who are prepared to justify that expenditure for the purpose indicated in the bill will find some difficulty in explaining their action to the electors, particularly as many in this time of stress have been cut, not only to the bone, but even to the marrow. I am opposed to the appointment of a commission which must recommend to this Parliament additional avenues of expenditure. In the past our treatment of the States has been generous. I cannot for one moment support the claims of ""Western Australia for the entire control of its customs revenue. That claim can never be recognized by this Parliament, whose duty it is to act in the interests of Australia as a whole. In considering the claims of the smaller States, we must take into account their previous conduct. One of our greatest handicaps is our annual interest bill. The Federal Parliament has frequently been accused by .State members of extravagant expenditure of loan moneys. I admit that this Parliament has expended money in many directions that were not justified, including the appointment of 'boards and. commissions. I have ascertained from the Statistician's figures that, from 1920 to 1930, the Commonwealth borrowed, on its own behalf, Â£17,000,000, and for and on behalf of the States, Â£302,000,000.

102,The Ex,"Commissioner of RailMr MAXWELL -But the commissionalso in the recent past. But for the Great War, Australia to-day would be in an extremely happy position, and there would have been no need for the Commonwealth to entrench upon some of the fields of taxation that it has exploited. But, from 1914 onwards, it has been found necessary to incur an expenditure of Â£800,000,000, largely out of borrowed money, and the interest on that sum has to be met every year. To-day, with the responsibility that rests on this National Parliament in regard to repatriation, pensions, interest, and many other commitments, there is no possibility of our being as liberal as we could have been had we wot passed through the awful ordeal of war. I admit that South Australia and other States have been, and are, affected; but the financial responsibility rests mostly on this Parliament. I hope and pray that this country will never suffer from adverse seasons. If it does, the effect will be severely felt, not only by the Commonwealth Government, but also by every other government in Australia. The Commonwealth has rendered material assistance to South Australia. It took over the Northern Territory, with all the liabilities that attached to it. As every one knows, one of the greatest leaders that Western Australia has hadthe late Lord Forrest-insiste d upon railway between the eastern and the western portion of the continent. . That work was carried out by the Commonwealth at a cost of millions of pounds. The Oodnadatta line was taken over from South Australia, and lines running into the Northern Territory from Central and North Australia have been constructed by the federal authority at an expenditure totalling about Â£11,000,000. A great deal has been done for the States, and we shall be forced to do more for them. Any justifiable proposition that is placed before this House will receive my support. Whatever may be the result of the investigation by this commission, the final judgment will rest with this and another place. We can either amend or reject any proposal advanced by the commission, or adopt one of our own making. I can readily conceive of a position arising, leading to the complete rejection of the recommendation of the commission and the adoption of our own proposals. We have done this work fairly satisfactorily in the past, and there is no need to incur this expense to have it done in the future. . Metaphorically, I take off my hat to the 70,000 true Australians who voted to keep Western Australia part and parcel of the Commonwealth. Other threats are now being made, .and if there is any truth in them, I trust that the federal authorites will take steps to see that the leaders of the secessionists are not permitted to carry out their devious designs. Recently, the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) uttered a great tirade against Melbourne. Speaking by and large, I believe that many of our cities are over-populated. Adelaide is about the worse instance in that regard, because, proportionately to the population of the State, its citizens are numerically stronger than those of any other capital city. I believe that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson) will bear me out when I say that Melbourne in particular, and Victoria generally, have done more than any other portion of Australia to develop Western Australia by way of capital, management, and labour. Therefore, the charge that their assistance has communication being provided been negligible does not weigh very heavily with me, especially coming from the honourable member for Forrest. Western Australia is bound to apply to the Commonwealth for a grant; yet it has recently appointed an Agent-General, who is not needed. In regard to Tasmania of that delightful little island has made a statement concerning it in which I believe some of us concur. He intimated that before long two alternatives would face Tasmania, one that of becoming a federal territory, and the other that of joining up with another State. I know that neither would be palatable to Tasmania. I have as much regard and respect for Tasmania as for any other part of the Commonwealth, and I am not disloyal when I object to its proposal to appoint a governor from the Old Country. The previous Government conducted that office on the cheapest",31,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

I am reliably informed that the Chief Justice of the State is disthis Parliament concessions as great as charging the duties of the office at a cost those that have been granted to them in of Â£800 a year. It is about time that we put in the peg. We cannot continue this kind of expenditure. asking why money is being spent on this, that, and the other thing. Even though each involves only a few thousand pounds, they are extravagances in our present financial position. The Commonwealth is branded as the most extravagant partner in the federation, yet, as I have said, the amount borrowed on its behalf from 1920 to 1930 was only Â£17,000,000 compared with Â£302,000,000 on behalf of or by the States. at the present time have the backing of the whole of the assets of the Commonwealth, security than the assets of any one State. Imagine Western Australia seceding, when its proportion of the public debt amounts to Â£73,000,000! It is unthinkable! If it went out of the federation it would be absolutely insolvent within two years. The public debts of the States to which grants will probably be made by the Commonwealth are-South tralia, Â£95,000,000; Western Australia, Â£73,000,000; and Tasmania, Â£23,000,000. Those figures total Â£191,000,000, upon which Â£11,000,000 has to be found for interest every year. I want to remain a federalist. But there must be some reduction of expenditure. I am not wedded to any particular system. I have no quarrel with those who say that New South Wales should be subdivided into a greater number of States. That, however, would be a piecemeal method of dealing with the question. If we are to do things, let us do them as a Commonwealth. I pay no regard to existing State boundaries. Wherever there is population with a community of interest, let the people band together for their own government. There is too much complexity in the world today; what we want is simplicity in our legislation, our administration, our finance, and all our other activities. If the States combine with the Commonwealth in action designed to advance the welfare of the whole of the people, they :will reap the benefit. I warn them, howi f r .

If they are prepared to mend their ways and to cheapen the cost of The people are government, thus benefiting a heavilytaxed people, I shall be with them to the uttermost. [5.15] -Judging by their speeches, honourable members recognize that the people are tired of commissions and committees of inquiry, and I am disappointed to find that neither the bill nor the amendment makes an attempt to get at the root of the trouble experienced by several of the States. Everybody agrees, I think, that Loans raised the statesmen who founded federation had in mind, and mentioned in their speeches, that it would be necessary to remodel the and that is better Constitution from time to time, as anomalies became apparent and called for rectification. We have had instances, in the last eight or ten years, of the necessity for the amendment of the Constitution. During that period, members of the present and previous Parliaments have joined in an appeal, to the people to give the Parliament the right to amend the AusConstitution in certain directions. Constitutional commissions have made various recommendations, other committees have been appointed to deal with the disabilities between Â£10,000,000 and of the States under federation, and these bodies have directed attention to the fact that the Constitution needed remodelling in several directions. Yet, by this bill, no suggestion whatever is made for an alteration of the present policy, which causes the State governments to come cap in hand to the Commonwealth authorities, and ask for grants of money to enable them to discharge their governmental responsibilities. It is provided in the bill that the proposed commission shall deal only with applications made to it by the States. Therefore, it seems to me that the measure will merely perpetuate the old policy of granting doles to the States, thus imposing indignities upon them. What should be aimed at is an allotment of fields of taxation, as between the Commonwealth and the States, in such a way as to give the States sufficient revenue to meet their local requirements. It was intended by the founders of fede-",32,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading
105,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"ration that the Constitution should be so modelled that no hardship would be imposed upon any State; but experience has shown that the Constitution has not operated as was hoped and intended at the outset. Eight or ten years ago, grants were made to the States as emergency measures; but it was never thought that the special grants given to South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia would be continued year by year. The amendment before the House appeals to me more than does the bill itself, because the bill certainly does not go to the root of the trouble. pressed that opinion. If the proposed commission merely collaborates with government' officials that work could be done by the States themselves, because they have access to the same records as would be available to the members of the commission. The practice of appointing commissions to inquire into the effect of legislation passed in this country is abhorrent to the public. These inquiries have cost enormous sums in the past, and vast numbers of reports are stacked in parliamentary archives throughout the Commonwealth. It would shock the public to see the great piles of reports that have accumulated. Many of us have been called as witnesses before royal commissions, and although elaborate reports have been presented by those bodies, generally speaking, not a line of their recommendations has been given effect. Yet we are invited this afternoon to perpetuate this useless policy. I desire to help the people of States that are in difficulty, and if I vote against this measure, I run the risk of doing an injury to those States; but I am not satisfied to vote for the bill either as it stands, or as it is proposed to be amended. The logical way to deal with the disabilities of the States has become more and more apparent eveTy year. Special grants are being made to the States more frequently than in the past, and the amounts are increasing year by year. The Constitution gives this Parliament the absolute and exclusive right of taxation in certain fields. It also confers absolute freedom to encroach upon all the other fields of taxation which the States now enjoy. Nominally, it says to the States: "" There are certain fields which are left to you to exploit"". But the Commonwealth Parliament, because of its own necessities, has steadily encroached further upon those fields, and has increased the taxation imposed upon the people, making it more and more difficult for the States to obtain revenue in the fields reserved te them. The Constitution should be remodelled so as to remove the anomalies which are apparent, and equitably re^ allot the fields of taxation as between the Commonwealth and the States. Surely the States should not be deprived of their means of raising revenue for their own services, if they must continue to discharge their present responsibilities. Under the present arrangement, Australia is not making satisfactory progress. I differ from the honourable member who said to-day that this measure marks a real reform. It is not a reform at' all; it practically provides merely for a change in the personnel of an old commission, which is to be asked to inquire into the disabilities of the States. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) showed, by his remarks, that his thoughts run along lines similar to those of my own. He expressed the hope that this bill would be followed by a convention for the purpose of considering the alteration of the Constitution in order that anomalies might be rectified. I do not share the honourable member's expectation. Nothing definite has been said, either by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), or by any other member of the Government, during the present or previous sessions, to lead us to believe that such a convention will take place in the near future. The first thing necessary to prevent the present waste of money and effort through the overlapping of Commonwealth and State services, and to rectify the lopsided budgets of this country, is an overhauling of the Constitution, so as to give this Parliament greater responsibilities, and thus reduce the legislative functions of the States. If , however, the States are to retain their present powers, it will be necessary to provide them with fields of revenue to enable them to finance the services that they are expected to render. Surelyi t should be possible fairly to allocate fields",33,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

107,Mr Holloway,"I have already exof revenue so that the States will be able to discharge their functions without having to ask the Commonwealth for doles from year to year. We have had the undignified spectacle of the States perpetuating the system of granting doles to individuals, and the Commonwealth regularly handing doles to the States. The Constitution should be immediately altered to make that practice unnecessary. I desire to move, at the proper timeThat the following words be added to the motion:""And that before any appointments are made to the commission, the question of grants by the Commonwealth of financial assistance to the States be referred to a convention arranged by the Commonwealth and the States for a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth Constitution, to include a re-adjustment of Commonwealth and State finances."" That suggestion seems to me to offer the only hope of escape from the unsatisfactory, unsavoury, and undignified practice of repeatedly making doles to the States to help them in balancing their budgets. The overlapping of Commonwealth and State services must result in great financial loss to the people. A commission appointed by a previous government inquired as to how the Constitution could be tightened up in order to obviate the envy and discord occasioned by the overlapping of governmental services. might mention, for instance, the duplication of industrial and social laws, such as those relating to hours and conditions of labour. member believe that the States would agree to hand over to the Commonwealth their powers in that regard? be prepared to adopt a sensible line of action, in order to prevent the waste now occasioned by the duplication of many services. There are also the matters of governmental further the matters of unemployment and and transport by air, land, and sea. As recently as last week, reference was made in the press to cut-throat competition between State railway systems, and surely the overlapping of transport services must result in great financial waste. The numerous railway gauges in Australia cause much financial loss to the public, and the duplication of Federal and State forestry activities should not be permitted. The overlapping of the powers of the States and the Commonwealth may make it impossible to give effect to international conventions, such as those of the League of Nations. If both the Commonwealth and the States, owing to their conflicting powers, are unable to give effect to such conventions, Australia may be blamed for not observing them. A great deal of money is wasted in the collection and tabulation of statistics by the Commonwealth as well as by the State authorities. Probably half a dozen decisions of the High Court have been given with regard to disputes between the Commonwealth and a State, or between a State and a company, and these decisions have been reversed from time to time as the personnel of the court has been changed. This Parliament should not be dependent upon the recommendations of commissions, but it should go straight to the root of the trouble of the States, and eliminate the cause of anomalies, which constantly become evident, by having a convention as soon as possible, and at the least possible expense, with a view to the alteration of the Constitution. There is a danger of the political freeOne dom of the States being taken from them if we continue the practice of handing over to boards and commissions functions which should be performed by this Parliament. We know that on previous occasions when committees or commisthe honourable sions have inquired into the subject of grants in aid to the States they have recommended that the States should spend the money voted to them in certain ways. They have even demanded, in some cases, that certain kinds of roads should be constructed, and that the work should be done by the contract system in preference to the day-labour system. I am acquainted services. There are with many chairmen of roads boards in two or three States who hold the opinion accident insurance, taxation, that roads can be constructed more cheaply by day labour than by contract. We also know that certain State governments favour the day-labour system in preference to the contract system. Is it right that boards or commissions of inquiry should be able to require such",34,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

109,Mr Holloway,"The States mustgovernments to depart from the policy which they consider to be the best for the State? I agree with those honourable members who have suggested that the best men available should be appointed to this commission if it is set up. I consider, also, that the suggestion that is continually being made in this House, that we cannot find honest men to appoint to such bodies is unworthy of this Parliament, and lowers the tone of its debates. I do not hold such views; but I believe that men who are perfectly honest may be also consciously, or unconsciously, biased in their political opinions. I am a politician,/ and bear in mind the criticism of Abraham Lincoln of politicians. I am compelled to admit, on examination of my own mind, that I am biased in favour of certain principles. This will be true, also, of the persons appointed to this commission. Such persons may be favorable, or unfavorable, to the policy of State governments applying for grants in aid, but it is not desirable that they should be able to force their views upon such governments. I realize that men of integrity and honesty, who are members of this commission, may feel strongly that it is wise that the policy which they believe to be right should be followed by the States which receive grants from the Commonwealth. They might feel that the money would be unwisely spent if the policies of certain democratic governments were adhered to, and wisely spent if the policies of more reactionary governments were followed. But it would be dangerous to allow the members of such a commission to obtrude their political views upon State governments. bers of a constitution convention be actuated by the same prejudices? be the same danger in that case, because a convention would make recommendations for the alteration of the Constitution which would apply to all States, and would not be able to impose their particular political views upon any one State.

I intend later to move an amendment to the bill to ensure that this will not be done. In the last analysis I shall be compelled to vote for the bill, though I hope that it will be amended. I shall vote for it because, if it is not passed, certain States may be subjected to an injustice, because they may not obtain the grant which they deserve. I shall vote for the bill with reluctance, for I feel that it perpetuates a wrong policy, and does not touch the basic principles of the subject with which it deals. of the bill adversely affect a State? grants being withheld for some time from necessitous States. I regret that there appears to be nothing in the bill to provide that the commission shall do any more than investigate and report upon the claims made by States. This is not a measure of reform. I am afraid that if we continue to pursue this policy we shall bring certain State Governments to the point at which they will openly resent being put in the position of having to come cap in hand to the Commonwealth Government for money to discharge administrative duties which the constitution of their State places upon them. If such States have, like Oliver Twist, repeatedly to ask for more they will sooner or later resent the indignity that is put upon them, or, what will be worse, they will tamely submit to it. We know .that hundreds of thousands of people in different States of the Commonwealth are to-day accepting sustenance doles, whereas a few years ago they would have resented as an indignity the mere suggestion that they should do so. Unfortunately, many people in this new land are accepting poverty like some of the people of London accept' it. In the old world people believe that, having been born in a state of poverty, they must remain in it all their lives. The perpetuation of the system of paying doles is ruining the character of many of our people, and I am afraid that the perpetuation of the system of making grants to State Governments will ruin the morale of such governments.",35,Commonwealt H Grants Commission Bill Second Reading

113,Mr Holloway,"It might result inpleased that the Government has introduced this bill for the appointment of a commission to inquire into the disabilities of necessitous States, and that it desires to remove the commission as far as possible from political interference. I do not agree with all the provisions of this bill. It is provided, in clause 3, that tralia's disabilities under federation was the commission shall be appointed for a period of five years. In my opinion, this period is too long. Such a commission should have ample time in two years to make all the inquiries that are necessary, and to submit its recommendations to the Government. If it found that two years is too short a period in which to do the work, the commission could be reappointed. Such work should not take five years to perform. It is proposed in clause 15 of the bill that retaining feesfor that is what they amount to-shal l be paid the chairman and members of commission. The chairman is to receive Â£300 a year and the other members Â£200 a year. I have no objection to those payments. But I consider that the proposed sitting fee of Â£5 5s. a day is too high. The commission may sit for five or six days a week for the whole five years. I do not say that that will be done; but it could be done, because the chairman is empowered to call meetings of the commission when he thinks fit. If the commission were to sit several days every week for the f u l l term of its appointment, it would be very expensive to the country. I should like an explanation to be given of the provision relating to travelling fees. Will members of the commission draw travelling fees and sitting fees at the same time? There is no doubt that South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania have suffered disabilities in consequence of federation. vides, in section 87, that ""during a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides"" 75 per cent, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from customs and excise shall be paid to the various States. We know that on the expiration of the ten year term the Commonwealth Parliament decided that a per capita grant of 25s. per head of the population should be paid to the States. yielded was very much below the amount received by the States from the customs and excise duties. Subsequently the per capita payment was also reviewed, and under the financial agreement the States received smaller payments than ever from the Commonwealth. The last investigation of South Ausmade by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which gave careful consideration to the "" Case for South Australia "", prepared by State treasury and otiher officials, who, in their report to the Government of South Australia, statedSouth Australia's claim was duly presented . . . in a comprehensive survev entitled "" Case for South Australia, 1930 "". "" The committee examined a large number of witnesses in connection w it h the case and finally recommended that South Australia had a reasonable claim for a grant of Â£1,000,000 for 1931-32. The committee also recommended the establishment of a permanent body to make a continuous and intensive study of Commonwealth and State finances. That South Australia suffers substantial disabilities arising from federation has been well established by the investigations of the royal commission in 1928-29 and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts 1930-31; and also by independent and competent critics. After exhaustive inquiry by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the "" Case for South Australia 1930"" was .found to bo substantially sound and the findings of the committee may be briefly summarized as follows:1. Special disabilities arising out of federation-South Australia does suffer special disabilities to a substantially greater extent than the majority of other States. 2. Special advantages arising out of federation-South Australia undoubtedly derives substantial special benefits from federation. 3. Financial position-South Australia is in a serious position financially, and it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to render assistance in the form of a grant to enable the Government to carry out its contractual obligations. The Constitution proThe committee referred also to the difficulties due to high taxation, and pointed out that expenditure on essential services in that State was well below the average of the six States. As to the financial position of my State,, I may remind honourable members that before federation South Australia was almost free of debt, and now our public debt stands at Â£103,118,476, or Â£175* 18s. l i d . per head of population.

Yet there is just as much lucerne flea in New South Wales as in South Australia. That definitely is a disability suffered by South Australia owing to action by another State, and I feel sure that the proposed commission will, after investigating the various other difficulties that have arisen, offer suggestions for remedying them.

The additional cost of that railway as compared with the tender price of the private contractor, is a definite financial burden on the several States. Governments are not solely to blame for many of their present difficulties; the Commonwealth must accept its share of of South Australia, I shall never be satisfied until the Commonwealth does justice to the smaller States. I intend to support the second reading of the bill, because I feel sure that an investigation by the proposed commission w ill disclose disabilities which should be righted by the Commonwealth. I propose to have much more to say on this matter when the State GrantsB ill comes before the House and when we are dealing with the budget later in the year. am opposed to the bill for many reasons. One is that I commission furnish ment does not already possess. We have listened to many speeches on various occasions setting out the disabilities which, it is alleged, the smaller States are suffering as the result of federation. We have to consider the probable expense of this proposed commission. I noted, with interest, that members of the legal profession are in favour of the proposal, believing, apparently, that an inquiry such as is indicated w ill offer scope for the employment of legal talent. Consequently, they support the measure. Professor Giblin, with whom I do not always agree, gave this evidence before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which reported on the finances of South Australia as affected by federationI t is not possible to determine special grants obtain evidence. to States by assessing directly the net economic disadvantage on account of federation. At first view this procedure seems simple and attractive. appears that it is practically impossible, how > desirable it may be . . . Tlie economic position is in a state of rapid flux and the future is uncertain. It is therefore impossible to make any assessment of a special grant which may not become inequitable a year hence, and impossible even to make an equitable assessment for the present year on the information that is available, which must, in general, refer to a previous financial year. Honourable members who contend that the proposed commission should hear evidence and make recommendations to Parliament regarding a basis for the permanent allotState ment of grants to States, should realize that those recommendations would be based on evidence which might not accurately describe conditions a year or the responsibility. As a representative so hence. I suggest that' the commission would only be in a position to make a recommendation for a particular year. It may be necessary to have some sort of an inquiry into the effects of the operation of the Premiers plan. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) and other honourable members who represent South Australia have declared that that State has endeavoured to give effect to the strict letter of the provisions of the Premiers plan. They admit that their State is the most heavily taxed, and that I the wages paid in South Australia are the lowest in the Commonwealth. It was believe that the claimed that if tbe Premiers plan were will not be able to given effect by the different State Governinformation which Parliaments all would attain budget equilibrium. Now the Commonwealth Government is asked to make up South Australia's unfavorable balance-the result of adherence to that plan. Honourable members should be honest, and admit that the Premiers plan has not done what its supporters claimed it would do. Only about a fortnight ago, the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) related his experiences as a member of the Navigation Commission. If that is the way in which these commissions set about their work no good can be achieved by the establishment of another. The honourable member said that the Navigation Commission perambulated Australia from one end to the other, allegedly to But, curiously, its itinerary conveniently enabled the commission to take evidence in Tasmaniai n On examination, however, it summer, and in the north of Queensland in winter; incidently, at great cost to the taxpayers of Australia.

120,Mr War D (East Sydney) [ 5 . 5 8 ],"sitting day. Judging from the experience of past commissions, honourable members who vote for the bill have no conception of the expenditure to which they are pledging the taxpayers of Australia. Even the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) was discreet enough not to venture the opinion as to the probable cost of this commission. Honourable members know that the revenue to be used for this purpose and for any grants that are made is supplied by the taxpayers generally, while the benefits are confined to sections of the community. It is essential that the Commonwealth should maintain certain social services for all, and we should ask ourselves why those States which have incurred an adverse balance should receive preference over others. Honourable members who support the payment of these recurring grants to chosen States apparently assume that the Commonwealth has an inexhaustible purse, and will always be in a position to make available the relief that is sought. It is true that at the moment the Commonwealth Government has a surplus obtained, largely, by reducing old-age and invalid pensions. I am not prepared to consent to give to mendicant State governments that which has been wrongfully taken from a most deserving section of the community, and other honourable members would do well to view the matter from that angle. How do honourable members justify the Commonwealth Government effecting economies at the expense of a section, to provide a surplus to be given to mendicant State governments? order. I submit that it is unparliamentary to describe, as mendicants, the States which it is proposed to assist by that' are to be benefited by this bill. Â£ South Australia Western Australia Tasmania. .

If the honourable member claims that it is offensive his protest may be justified. offensive term, sir. ber will, perhaps, substitute another word for "" mendicant"". hope to evade honest criticism of the actions of their State Governments by adopting obstructive methods in this House. Had the honourable member listened attentively to my remarks he would know that I referred to mendicant State Governments, not to mendicant States, which is a vastly different matter. Practically every honourable member who has supported the measure has claimed that he desires to assist the Commonwealth as a whole, and then has directed his remarks to an argument in favour of special assistance being granted to the State which he represents. If honourable members are genuine in the desire to render assistance to deserving sections, let them insist that the Government shall relieve the community of some of the heavy burden of taxation which is due to overseas interest and exchange. The Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce) has failed dismally in the work that he was sent overseas to do, and has made specious excuses for his failure.

129,I T Is Mr Ward,"I was replying to the Labour party, whose policy is unification. The people of Western Australia could not vote for secession and at the same time place in office a party pledged to extend the powers of the federation. In those circumstances, the vote must have been an expression of want of confidence in the present Commonwealth Government. In regard to the cost of the proposed commission, honourable members have said that, although in addition to the retaining fees of Â£300 a year for the chairman and Â£200 for each other member, tbe commissioners are to receive an allowance of Â£5 5s. a sitting, plus travelling expenses, it does not follow that the commissioners will sit on five or six days a week. There is nothing in the bill to prevent them from doing so. The scope of the inquiry is unlimited and if we may judge by what the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) told us recently of earlier commissions, if witnesses are not available, the Commonwealth will be combed to discover them. If evidence is not forthcoming it will probably be invented by the commission, as has been' done by other commissions, in order to provide an excuse for meeting five or six days a week throughout the five years of its tenure. Apparently, even so distinguished a body as the League of Nations is not above these weaknesses, for the right honourable member for North Sydney told us last night how committees of the Assembly wasted time, one committee occupying seventeen sittings in discussing whether the staff of the League should suffer a 10 per cent, reduction of salaries. With such an example before us, we can estimate what may be expected of commissions. Instead of listening to the statements of honourable members who complain that their States have suffered by their inclusion in the Commonwealth, more real advantage can be conferred on both Commonwealth and States by demanding the recall of the Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce), and the appointment in his stead of a man with an Australian outlook and sentiment, who will grapple seriously with the financial problems that require solution on the other side of the world, in order that the people of Australia may get some relief from the burden of taxation. Because this bill is merely a sop offered by the Government to those who supported the no-confidence motion in Western Australia, because, like other similar proposals, it will provide an opportunity for the Government to appoint, to highly remunerative positions, supporters and friends, thus paying them for services rendered to the Nationalist party in political contests, the party to which I belong is not prepared to support it. We believe that at this period in the history of Australia the proposed expenditure is unwarranted. All the information that the commission might gather is already known to members of this House, or is available in government departments. Moreover, the committee might report in favour of granting enormous sums to various States-sum s that could not be paid out of Commonwealth revenues, unless the already curtailed social services were further reduced. We believe that no good purpose would be served by the creation of the proposed commission, and we shall vote against the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr E. J. (1932-33) (Nos. i TO 4.)

131,Mr Riley (Cook) [8.10],"Unlesspresent time of every 6d. expended on beer, approximately 3d. is paid to the Commonwealth revenue. labourers, coal-miners, and other men following strenuous occupations, who feel that after a solid day's work they are entitled to a pint of beer, should not be required to pay for it 7d. or 8d., of which nearly half is taxation. A study of the excise duties on beer shows that since federation, and particularly since the war, they have risen very rapidly. As wages and salaries have been reduced, I support the movement on the coal-fields and elsewhere for a reduction in the cost of beer in accordance with reductions of other forms of taxation. We cannot by taxation force the workers to become teetotallers. Whilst during the wai and the years immediately following an increase of excise duties for revenue purposes was justified, the time has come for a reconsideration of this unjust impost on the workers. A reduction of the excise duty from 2s. to Is. 6d. taxation, there are other classes of taxa gallon would enable beer to be bought for payers more worthy of consideration 3d. a glass, a privilege which the workers have not enjoyed since pre-war day3. When we realize that for every pint of beer that a working man drinks he contributes 3d. to the Commonwealth revenue, honourable members, irrespective of their opinions on the liquor question, will agree that the workers are being taxed far too heavily in this regard. The consumers of beer have, during the last few years, contributed approximately Â£500,000 a month to Commonwealth revenue. Even those working men who still have jobs are now receiving substantially reduced wages, so that there is a good case for the proposal that the Government should consider, when preparing its budget for next year, the reduction of the excise duty on beer. HadI remained silent the Government might have believed that the committee was satisfied with the existing rates. I urge the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the proposal for a reduction in excise duties. Trade and Customs) [8.17] -The excise duty on beer undoubtedly provides a considerable part of Commonwealth revenue. In fact, it provides a little over half of of beer. the revenue derived from excise duties. 1 point out, however, that the Commonwealth has every year to find Â£67,300,000 The wharf to meet the following commitments:f Invalid and old-age pensions .. 10,500,000 War pensions and Repatriation Services .. .. .. 7,800,000 Payments to States (interest grants, Sinking Funds, rates, &c.) .. .. .. 12,500,000 Salaries and wages to Public Service .. .. .. 10,000,000 Interest, Sinking Fund and Exchange .. .. 20,000,000 Other expenditure .. .. 0,500,000 67,300,000 It is evident, therefore, that excise revenue must be collected if the Commonwealth is to pay its way. The Government will give consideration to the point raised by the honourable member when framing its budget proposals, but most honourable members will agree that, when it comes to a matter of remitting than those who pay the excise duty on beer. The present excise duty is 2s. a gallon, which is only 3d. a gallon more than in 1921. The honourable member asked for a reduction of the rate by 6d. a gallon, which, on the present rate of consumption, would lead to a loss of revenue equal to Â£1,191,691. reduced more beer would be drunk. cation is made for a reduction of duty on any item we are told that, if it were granted, more of the commodity would be consumed. Those who have asked for a reduction of the excise duty on beer point out that conditions are bad in the industry; but are they not bad in every industry? They state that, because of the falling off in the consumption of beer, the allied industries, such as the bottlemaking industry and the sugar industry, are suffering, and they say that the excise duty represents 70 per cent, of the brewers' price to the hotel keepers. Other points are that the consumption of beer fell from 39.9 gallons per head in 1929 to 7.28 gallons in 1931-32, and that unemployment is being increased because of the constantly contracting consumption The Government has heard deputations on the subject, and has asked",42,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

That information is essential if the Government is to consider seriously any reduction of the excise duty. It has not yet been forthcoming, and, in its absence, the Government finds it difficult to make a decision. In the absence of this information, the following comment is offered: In the first place, the large contraction in consumption cannot be dissociated from the depressed conditions obtaining to-day. Tbe reduction of revenue receipts is common to most of the lines on which revenue duties are imposed, and is noticeable in regard to both customs and excise revenue items. quantity of beer on which excise has been paid in any year was 71,160,000 gallons in 1928-29, and the revenue received was Â£6,191,276, the rate then being Is. 9d. a gallon. The quantity cleared in 1931-32 was 47,668,000 gallons, on which excise amounting to Â£4,770,000 was paid. Compared with the peak period, 1928-29, consumption has fallen by 33 per cent., and revenue returns by 23 per cent. The excise duty operating last year was 2s. a gallon. As it is claimed that a reduced excise and selling price would increase both consumption and revenue returns, the question should he looked at from the point of view of what increase in consumption would be necessary at the various reduced rates suggested by the applicants, even to maintain the present revenue. If the excise rate were reduced to Is. 8d. a gallon, consumption would have to be increased by 9,536,000 gallons, or 20 per cent, if the excise rate were Is. 6d. a gallon, 15,892,000 gallons more beer, or 33-J ner cent., would have to be consumed; and with the excise rate of Is. 4d., the inbrandy for medicinal purposes, but the creased consumption would need to be 23,838,000 gallons, or a 50 per cent, increase. At a rate of Is. 4d. a gallon, consumption would have to approximate that of the peak year of 1928-29 in order to return the same revenue as last year. be overlooked, and, as the Government must obtain revenue, a stronger case will have to be made out in favour of a reduced excise duty on beer than has so far been advanced. support the request of the honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) that the Government should, when considering its budget for 1933-34, consider reducing the excise duty on beer. ""When other forms of taxation were remitted, we were told that their remission would bring about increased purchasing power, and greater employment. In Queensland, it is generally understood among medical men that beer drinking tends to preserve the health of men employed in dusty work such as mining. In the Mount Morgan district, I have been told that beer drinking has reduced the tendency of miners to contract phthisis. If that is so, the proposal of the honourable member for The greatest Cook is worthy of consideration by the Government. Item agreed to.

Hospitals use a considerable amount of excise duty is now so high that they find it difficult to obtain as much brandy as they need. I appeal to the Government to reduce the excise duty in order to help the hospitals.

Mr Harden made it clear that the Queensland rum interests, most of whom had ceased operations, had no desire to alter the arrangement under the Ottawa agreement whereby the duties on imported rum were reduced. . . . This is more than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has admitted. According duties have been fixed with a view to forcing Victorian whisky on an unwilling public. The pamphlet continuesI t appears that Queensland industries never receive fair treatment when our interests conflict with Victorian interests. Ottawa agreement, they reduced the duty on imported rum, and gave the Australian distillers protection of Os. a gallon, whereas Victorian whisky has protection of 17s. a gallon. made at Ottawa must be carried out, and we do not ask now that it should be altered or varied in any way. Neither does the Government wish the Ottawa agreement to be varied or altered in any way. One great reason for the disparity 'between the excise duty on rum and that on whisky is that rum is produced from a by-product of sugar, and is, therefore, produced at a lower cost. In 1906, a royal commission on customs and excise tariffs made the following remarks respecting the disparity in the excise duties:That cheaply-produced spirits should pay a higher excise duty than more expensive spirits; that spirits produced from molasses at 9d. and Is. a gallon should not be allowed to kill out the distillation of whisky from barley malt, which costs from 3s. 6d. to 4s. per gallon; and that the consumption of cheap and inferior spirits should not'be encouraged at the expense and sacrifice of spirits of higher grade, quality, and price. During the last fiscal year, 283,000 gallons of Australian rum were cleared from bond, as against only 142,000 gallons of Australian whisky. Honourable members do not seem to be aware of that fact. It has been argued that rum is becoming too expensive for the consumer; but I would point out that the sales of rum, as in the case of .beer, have fallen because of the depression and the lower purchasing power of the community. When the customs and excise clearances for 1928-29 are taken as a basis of comparison, it is found that the consumption of whisky has declined 57.2 per cent., whereas the decrease in the consumption of rum is only 48.3 per cent. It is also interesting to note that 71 per cent, of the whisky consumed was imported whisky, which carried customs duties ranging from 45s. to 53s. a gallon. On the other hand, almost the whole of the rum which went into consumption was of Australian origin, dutiable at 30s. a gallon, the to Mr Harden, these varying imports contributing less than 9,000 gallons out of a total consumption of 292,000 gallons. Evidently the Queensland distillers, who are doing very well, want the whole of the Australian trade for themselves. They have frequently Under the corresponded with the department and myself, and have been extended a cordial invitation to submit their case to the Tariff Board. They have refused to The arrangementthe Government avail themselves of that opportunity; it may be that they are afraid to disclose their production costs. As they are not willin g to place their case before the T a r if f ' Board, and as they cannot prove that the consumption of rum has declined to any extraordinary extent, I submit that the committee should not alter the present rate of excise duty. [8.49] -Notwithstandin g what the M in ister has said, I am more convinced than ever that the rum industry has suffered a grave injustice ever since the royal commission which was appointed in 1906, inquired into it . Honourable members w ill understand that, since then, conditions have changed. That commission recommendedThat .the consumption of cheap and inferior spirit, e.g., rum, should not be encouraged at the expense and sacrifice of spirits of higher grade, quality, and price, 6uch as whisky. That recommendation has proved to be absolutely erroneous, since it has been shown beyond doubt that rum is now a universal drink. It is consumed in practically every part of Australia in as large a quantity of whisky or any other spirit. The commission, in its report, endeavoured to show that rum was not so pure and wholesome as whisky. I am satisfied that it is the purest drink produced,",47,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages
158,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"and the industry should, therefore, receive greater consideration from this Government. As a matter of fact, rum is chiefly a working man's drink. If the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), for a reduction of the excise duty were carried, this product could be sold more cheaply, and larger quantities would be consumed. The excise duties-o n brandy 28s., on gin 30s., on rum 30s., and on whisky 28s -provid e the following margins for imported:-Brandy, whisky, 17s.; rum, 6s. rum should have at least the same margin of protection as whisky. The high excise duty prevents the rum distillers from lowering the price of rum. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the bulk of the Australian rum is distilled in Queensland. There are three distilleries in that State, and another in New South ""Wales. The three distilleries .in Queensland are producing rum from molasses, which is a by-product of one of the greatest Australian primary industries. The molasses from which Australian rum is distilled is produced in Australia by white labour, whereas the molasses from which West Indian rum is distilled isproduced by black labour. The Bundaberg distillery is in a precarious position. The management, in its correspondence, statesWe have stored in our spirit bonds at the present time, 360,000 liquid gallons of rum, equivalent to nearly 500 proof gallons, varying in age from one and a half to five years, which, partly on account of the high excise duty, and partly to the distressing economic conditions, is going into consumption at a very slow rate. In fact, notwithstanding our enormous storage capacity, wo have not distilled any rum for over twelve months. That distillery has been closed down for over twelve months, and I understand that the company will not distil any further rum for another twelve months. That will mean a loss of revenue in many directions. It will mean a reduction of employees, a loss of wages, and a loss of revenue to the Queensland Government by way of railway freights. The Beenleigh distillery is in a similar position. During the last twelve months of its operations it paid no less than Â£1,260 in wages, and Â£2,374 in railway freights. I am satisfied that if the industry is not Mr George Lawson. assisted by a reduction of the excise duty, it will receive a severe setback, many men will be thrown out of employment, and the revenue of the Queensland Government will suffer. I hope that the committee will accept the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. .

Queensland in this chamber have not only heard about this vendetta, but have also been experiencing it since the people of that State saw fit at the last elections to return to this Parliament a large number of Labour representatives and three Labour senators. The Government's action in respect of this item is another instance of this particular vendetta. The superficial argument of the Minister is not sufficient to answer the charge which we have made against this Government, that for no particular reason at all it has imposed upon rum an excise duty of 30s., whereas the excise duty on whisky is only 2Ss. Prior to the Ottawa Conference, and consequent upon the action of the Scullin Government, Australian rum enjoyed a protective margin of l is . per proof gallon against West Indian rum, but since the ratification of the remarkably unsuccessful Ottawa agreement it has enjoyed a protection of only 6s. a gallon. The Government, in making this differentiation in the margin of protection, relies upon the report of a royal commission which inquired into the Australian rum industry over a quarter of a century ago, whereas in dealing with important tariff items it has become practically the established practice if this Parliament, where tbe report or"" the Tariff Board on any particular item is",48,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

This is an important amendment. The Government is alive to the difficulties in the wine industry. In this, as in many other industries, there has been overproduction, in addition to whicli there has been a conflict of interests as between the grape-growers and the wine-makers. Although the export of wine has been increasing, the domestic market has been smaller than was expected. There is a big surplus of wine in the cellars of the wine-makers, and the grape-growers have had considerable difficulty in selling their crops. The proposed reduction of the excise duty does not go as far as the Federal Viticultural Council desires. Frequent conferences have been held between the wine interests and the Government, and, as honourable members are aware, the Government called for a report by an authority on the wine industryMr Leo. Buring. That report is now in the hands of the Government, and, as a result of it, action has been taken in certain directions; for example, in the prevention of the artificial sweetening of wine by the addition of dried fruits and glycerine. It is hoped that, in consequence, a considerable loss of Commonwealth revenue will be avoided. Action has also been taken in the matter of the differentiation between the prices of grapes for the domestic market and grapes for the exported wine, the Government insisting that the fixed price be paid for grapes used in the making of wine for export, but allowing the buyers of grapes to be used in the making of wine for the domestic market to pay any price they choose. The Government could not enforce the payment of a fixed price in connection with wine used locally, that matter being within the province of the States. The amendment gtoes a little further. Althoughi f is not believed that it will right the many troubles in the wine industryI do not think that any one can suggest how that may be done-it will be at least a palliative, and will assist the industry The Federal Viticultural Council wanted a reduction to 6s. 6d. a proof gallon, in addition to a reduction of the bounty to Is. a gallon. The Government intends to allow the bounty to remain as at present for the time being. affect the payments into the trust fund, or only the revenue portion of the excise ? ments into the trust fund, because it will come out of the total excise. the bounty, by decreasing the trust fund ? shortage in that,fund will be made up from Consolidated Revenue, as at present. The matter is so important that I have prepared a statement on it, which, with the indulgence of honourable members, I shall place before them. The bounty has already been altered on five occasions, and the Government does not propose to alter it again, at any rate during the present vintage. These alterations have undoubtedly upset trade, and have taken from the exporter what the act at present gives him. The present rates'of 10s. and l is . do little more than pay the bounty. This year, the excess of revenue over expenditure will probably be only about Â£14,000. There is, therefore, little justification for reducing the excise duty. The Government, however, recognizes that the industry is confronted with very serious difficulties, and, as an earnest of its desire to help it, has decided to reduce the excise duty to 9s. a proof gallon. The trust fund contribution will remain at 5s. To the extent that this <may be insufficient to pay the bounty, the Government will give further aid to the industry. It must be remembered that the Government could reasonably expect to receive a substantial revenue from spirit for fortifying wine. All other intoxicants contribute heavily to the revenue. The old duty of 5s. and 6s. was imposed as a revenue duty, and the extra 5s. was intended to finance the bounty. A heavy falling off in local consumption, and an increase of exports, have defeated that object; and practically the whole of the collections are now devoted to the",50,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

171,Mr White,"No, because anypayment of the bounty. Thus the Government is already sacrificing revenue to assist the industry. It is now prepared to do more by reducing the excise duty; but it is not willing to go to the lengths asked for by the industry, as it believes that, by having more than surrendered its revenue from the spirit, its sacrifice is sufficiently great. I shall deal now with the differentiation between doradillo and other fortifying spirit. For some years prior to 1924, all spirit used for the fortification of wine was subject to duty at the rate of 6s. a proof gallon. In that year there was over-production of doradillo grapes, caused through large areas having been planted with that variety for occupation by returned soldiers. It was at this time that the Federal Government, as a measure of relief, assisted the growers of doradillo grapes by granting a bounty on the 1924 production. The Government also decided further to assist these growers by lowering to 5s. a proof gallon the duty on spirit made from doradillo grapes, spirit made fromother kinds of grapes still being liable to a duty of 6s. a gallon. For a time this relief to the doradillo growers was appreciable; but the full benefit intended has not been realized. Members of co-operative distilleries and wineries have, as a consequence, received a little more for doradillo grapes; but the benefit has been negligible, more especially since the rates of duty were raised from 5s. and 6s. to 10s. and l is . a proof gallon. ""When the differential rates were imposed, it was thought that it would be a sufficient inducement for distillers to make most of their fortifying spirit from doradillo grapes. That hope has not been fulfilled, the greater quantity of fortifying spirit used during the last five years having been made from other than doradillo grapes. That the higher average yield of doradillo compared with non-doradillo grapes in the irrigation, as well as in the dry areas, will be a set off against having now a flat rate of duty on fortifying spirit, is borne out in the report that the Government has received from the authority on the wine industry, to which I have already referred. Doradillo grapes are produced largely in South Australia; but in tbe Murrumbidgee area there is an excess production of shiraz grapes, and no special consideration has been given to these as is given in the case of the preferential duty on doradillo spirit. The Federal Viticultural Council is opposed to the tariff differentiation which favours spirit distilled from wine made from doradillo grapes, and has brought the question under notice in the following terms:No adequate or substantial reason appears to exist for the maintenance of differential rates of excise duty upon fortifying spirit derived from mixed grapes and doradillo grapes respectively, and this council, therefore, urges that steps should be taken to remove this anomaly by subjecting mixed spirit and doradillo spirit to the same rate of excise duty. penalize the returned soldiers who are engaged in grape growing? Mr ""WHITE -No. The Government would be averse to taking any preference away from returned soldiers on this matter or any other. Inquiries have shown that there is little or no benefit in the preferential rate in favour of doradillo spirit, and a return to the flat rate of duty for fortifying spirit is desirable. At the present time, regulations governing the processing of doradillo grapes necessitate the separate storage of the spirit, and the keeping of separate accounts. The expense incurred in supervision does not appear justifiable, considering the small benefit to doradillo grape-growers. Wine-makers and distillers find it irksome to keep the two kinds of spirit separate and distinct from each other. A number of reasons have actuated the Government in adopting this course, and it has acted on expert advice. I understand that in those areas where there is a surplus of doradillo spirit, a grafting of vines is taking place, so that grapes suitable for drying purposes may be grown. At a meeting of the Grape Prices Fixation Committee held in Melbourne on the 19th January last, it was unanimously agreed that there should be a flat rate of duty on doradillo and other fortifying spirits. This committee was composed of representatives from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia of grape-growers, and of both cooperative and proprietary wine-makers. This proposal is made by the Government",51,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages
172,Mr Lane,"""Will this action not in order to provide material help to the wine industry, which, under the present adverse conditions, is in need of assistance, and I confidently submit the proposal for the acceptance of the committee. I think that the immediate result will be some movement of the surplus stocks at present held, and the proposal will, undoubtedly, in small measure; help the growers, next vintage. of the reduction? considerable revenue has been picked up by the action of the Government in preventing the fortifying of wine with sugar, dried fruits and glycerine. been interesting to hear the remarks of the Minister with regard to the proposed alteration of the excise duty. I do not think that any section of the primary producers have suffered so much through changes in excise duties and bounties as have the grape-growers throughout the Commonwealth. When in New South Wales, as a member of the Government, I was administering the affairs of this section of agriculturist's in that State, I witnessed the spectacle of wineries being closed down through the actions-ill advised as they were-of the Federal Government of the day. Only after considerable effort were the difficulties overbounties. The crops required for the procome, and the growers partially re-established in their industry. The New South Wales Government had to send out expert officers to advise the growers to remove hundreds of acres of grape vines, simply because their industry was threatened with disaster, largely through federal legislative action. The Minister has drawn attention to what is commonly referred to as the overproduction of wine in this country. I venture to say that it is not a matter of overproduction; but it must be realized that a considerable falling off has occurred in the consumption of various classes of wine in this and other countries, with the result that our most valuable outlet for wines-the British market-ha s been taken from us, to a great extent, by the dumping of Continental wine upon that market at greatly reduced prices. I wish to emphasize the point referred Australian wine in this country. Every to by the Minister when he said that the section of the grape-growing and winebounty had been altered five times. The making industries, from the grower to great difference between the wine industry and the manufacture of whisky, brandy, gin, rum, or any other alcoholic spirit, is that the grape-growers have spent large sums of money in establishing their vineyards over a long period of years, to enable them to produce the grapes which are the basis of the wine industry. A fair amount of capital and a lot of hard work are necessary in establishing a vineyard. The growers are dependent on the sale of their grapes, and the varieties of grapes which they grow cannot be altered overnight, whereas excise duties and bounties have been altered overnight, and, on many occasions, the growers have been faced with ruin, because of changes made by federal legislation. I compliment the Minister upon the action that he now proposes to take. It will go a long way towards stabilizing the wine section of the viticultural industry of Australia. Although, on many occasions, growers have gone to the expense of endeavouring to graft their grapes over to other varieties, so as to preserve the value of their root stock, and meet the altered conditions, it is a slow and expensive operation, and does not yield the results that some persons imagine. The viticultural industry is unable to meet the sudden changes which have been experienced in excise duties and duction of other alcoholic beverages are annual, and can be produced in a few months. For instance, those who grow barley and other cereals necessary for the production of spirits, can curtail or extend the areas under cultivation at a few months' notice, or they can use their land for other crops, which often prove just as remunerative, if not more so; but, as I have pointed out, it is a very slow process which viticulturalists have to adopt, in order to meet the altered conditions with respect to their industry, brought about by the actions of this Parliament. There are two points in regard to this amendment upon which I desire to comment. In the first place, it provides for a reduction of taxation on the wine drinker, and through that reduction it will do something to help the .sale of",52,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

176,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [9.22],"the final vendor, will welcome the reduction of the excise duty. It is not a large reduction, but it will give some relief. I do not think that there will be any difference of opinion in that regard. The other point to which I direct the attention of the committee is that part of the reduction is made by removing the differentiation between the tax upon spirit made from doradillo grapes and that upon spirit made from other grapes. Undoubtedly, this amounts to a repeal of the preference which, was given to the returned soldier growers who are mainly doradillo growers. The Minister says that the preference is now valueless, and that, therefore, putting an end to it does not amount to the repeal of a preference given to returned soldiers; but I am quite certain that the removal of this differentiation will give rise to a whole series of fresh anomalies and new difficulties, with which the Minister will be faced within the next few weeks. I hope that he will give the committee au assurance that he will restore to the doradillo growers the same chance of marketing their spirit, in competition with the spirit made from other grapes, as they had prior to this repeal of the differentiation. I shall now give some account of tbe history of this differentiation in order to make plain to the committee what its value was. Originally, as the Minister' has told us, the whole question of the bounty was raised through the overplanting of doradillo grapes, largely for the purpose of settling returned soldiers on the land. In order to encourage the use of doradillo spirit, the excise on such spirit was reduced by Is. a gallon, and when the prices were fixed for grapes and for spirits, that differentiation in the vintages two or three years ago, and say excise was taken into account, a slightly higher fixed price being established for doradillo spirit. In the early days of the bounty an exported wine that differentiation was sufficient to create a brisk demand for doradillo spirit, and there was almost a boom in tbe doradillo grape industry in the irrigated areas. Later, plantings took place of other grapes, mainly in other areas. A certain number, of course, were on the holdings of returned soldiers, but' the main new plantshow that they are selling at' a price ings following the boom were on lands other than those devoted to soldier settlement. There is no doubt that the price fixed originally for doradillo grapes made it more attractive to wine-makers to distil wine from other grapes, and in doing so pay a higher excise duty rather than buy spirit distilled from doradillo grapes from the main soldier settlements. The result was a tremendous accumulation of doradillo spirit, mainly in the irrigated areas, and chiefly on account of the co-operative wine distilleries, a very large proportion of whose members are returned soldiers. About eighteen months ago, in order to liquidate that big accumulation, which was a menace to the whole of the wine-making industry, because there was always the danger of it being unloaded on the market at sacrifice rates, the fixed price of the spirit was made the flat rate for both doradillo and other spirits. Since then, there has been some movement in the consumption of doradillo spirit. This removal of the differentiation will: do something to tip the attractiveness the other way-to grapes other than doradillos, which, generally speaking, are grown in more convenient localities. I am not prepared to ask the committee, even in those circumstances, to continue the differentiation, provided that any fresh anomaly which is created is removed. There is little prospect of finding an outlet for the enormous accumlations of doradillo spirit in the distilleries on the irrigation areas, excepting by their purchase for wine for export as well as for local sale. If they are purchased for export, the distillers must pay the full fixed price for the grapes from which the spirit is distilled; that is, for the whole of the vintage of the year, because it is now impossible to earmark the spirit of "" These were for export, and these were for local consumption"". This removal of the differentiation practically makes it, very unlikely that any of these stocks of spirit's will be sold in competition with spirit made from other grapes for use in the production of wine for local consumption at a figure which will return the price fixed for doradillo grapes some years ago. If the wineries which are holding these large stocks of spirit are not able to which will return fixed prices to the growers, the makers of wine who use their spirit will be ineligible to collect bounty with respect to the wine which is exported, and which, in that way, would be providing an outlet for these large accumulations of spirit. If the Minister will give the committee an undertaking that he will see that any anomalies of this nature will be prevented, and that this most unfortunate section of a very unfortunate industry will not be stuck with over 1,000,000 gallons of spirit-becaus e the attractiveness of its sale has been lessened by the removal of the differentiation-and if he will also assure it that some arrangement will be made by which this wine may be released on the home market in a manner that will retain its eligibility for the bounty, the committee may safely agree to the Government's proposal to eliminate the differentiation. There are, of course, many good reasons why the differentiation should be eliminated. The imposing of different rates of duty on wine fortified by spirit distilled from different kinds of grapes enormously complicates the work of administration and the expenses of the wine-makers who handle the wine. creases the work of watching every particular hogshead, to ascertain,^ not only the quantity of wine which it contains, but also the quantity of wine which it contains of each particular blend. This differentiation is a complicated, and, in many ways, an artificial, handicap to the industry, which the industry itself will be very glad to be relieved of if the obtaining 'of such relief does not inflict injustice upon that section which is holding large stocks of spirit under the circumstances that I have mentioned. If the preference is removed from these stocks, the price of the spirit should be reduced accordingly. If , however, some of the wine fortified with this spirit can be released for local consumption without rendering the rest ineligible for the bounty it will be safeguarded. I have referred in some detail to the complicated set of circumstances which surround this complicated industry, because I desire to obtain from the Minister an assurance that a serious injustice will not be done. If this assurance is given, the committee may safely support the Government's proposal. Mr Hawker. time that this Government, and every other government interested in the wine industry, set before the grape-growers a fact which they themselves should face because of the difficulties which they are brought up against every year. If we maintain the system of paying bounties out of the general revenue of the country to this particular industry, it will never overcome its difficulties. It seems to me to be a common practice for a primary industry which encounters trouble to come at once to the Commonwealth Government and ask it for relief. I remember, in 1923, while I was a member of the State Parliament, directing the attention of the Minister of Agriculture of New South Wales to the difficulties of this industry, and that gentleman assured me, on that occasion, that the reason why the Government had dealt leniently with the growers of doradillo grapes was that they had declared publicly that they intended to cut their vines down and graft other kinds of grapes on to the stock rather than continue to suffer a loss, because the wine-makers would not pay them a reasonable price for It also greatly intheir product. In 1923, I visited certain doradillo grape-growing areas with a parliamentary party and learned something of the difficulties of the situation. But that was ten years ago. Is it fair to the Commonwealth that money should be taken from the general revenue every year in order to maintain the doradillo grape-growers in this industry? The fact of the matter is, of course, that an endeavour is being made to convert Australia into a wine-drinking country. It is thought by some people that if the price of wine can be cheapened our people will make it a common beverage. I know some honourable members are fond of referring to the able bodied men of Erance as wine-drinkers; but, with due deference to the French nation, I hope that Australia will never reach the same position as France. Neither this nor any other government should respond to the appeals of a few honourable members of this Parliament who represent wine-growing constituencies to encourage our people to drink wine. The Government should make a definite stand in regard to the payment of a bounty to the wine industry.",53,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

This industry was not helped by the State Governments in years gone by. Until 1920 the viticultural industry of Australia was being conducted on a sound economic basis. The whole of the grapes produced were bought by the local winemakers for the manufacture of wine for sale on the Australian market. about 800,000 gallons of the white dry, or Burgundy type of wine found a market in Great Britain. But after the war when the various State Governments were looking for opportunities to settle returned soldiers on the land they spent millions of pounds on closer settlement irrigation schemes in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and advised the returned soldiers who were settled on these areas to plant vines. The men took the advice that was offered to them. that they planted came into bearing in 1923-24, the quantity of grapes produced was largely in excess of local requirements, and the Commonwealth Government then in oflice was appealed to for assistance. It seems that whenever the States get into difficulties they appeal to the Commonwealth Government for assistance. The Government proposed to relieve the position by reducing the duty on spirit used for fortifying wine, but this was opposed by the Viticultural Council, because such a reduction would disorganize the winemakers' business by reducing tbe value of The consequence of this the stocks held by the amount of the proposed reduction. their minds, and are supporting it. conditions to-day are different. The council suggested that a bounty be paid on the export of fortified wines. That suggestion was adopted by the Commonwealth Government, but the amount of the bounty has been altered from time to time. It was as much as 4s. a gallon, and later was reduced to Is. The Scullin Administration increased it to Is. 9d. This has, undoubtedly, had a really equivalent to Is. 9d., because it included the excise. the previous Government increased the bounty from Is. to Is. 9d. a gallon, and called upon the industry to pay the whole of the cost by increasing the excise duty of 5s., on spirit wholly distilled from doradillo grapes, and 6s. on spirit n.e.i., to 10s. and l is . respectively. .The Minister has given us an assurance that there will be no reduction of the export bounty, which will be kept at the present Only figure-Is. 4.8d. per gallon. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the industry gives employment to 12,500 persons, while 15,000 other persons are dependent upon it, making in all a total of 27,500 directly or indirectly interested in its continued development. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) appeared to regret that we were trying to expand our export trade in wine with Great Britain; but, seeing that the Mother. Country consumes annually When the vines 15,000,000 gallons of wine, including 10,000,000 gallons of sweet wines which can be supplied by Australia, surely we have every reason to expect a greater measure of preference in the British market than we have been getting hitherto. We now supply one-fifteenth of Great Britain's requirements in this class of wine, the balance being imported from Portugal and Spain.

All manner of uneconomic proposals have been adopted by State governments from time to time to extend tbe industry far beyond Australia's requirements, and, unless we can find a profitable market overseas for tbe surplus product, there will be absolute chaos and ruin in the industry. I hope that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the representations that have been made to him from time to time by those engaged in it. Thousands of grape-growers are now reduced to a standard bordering on poverty owing to the decline in tbe price for their grapes by at least 50 per cent. 8,000 tons of grapes were sold in South Australia for Â£2 a ton, Â£1 a ton, and 15s. a ton, whereas two years ago some of the best qualities realized Â£8 15s. a ton, and other qualities Â£5 and Â£4 10s. a ton. The extraordinary drop in prices will give honourable members some idea of the terrible plight of thousands of grapegrowers in the various States. partly due to over-planting. nately, for some years there was a tendency to overplant, due, of course, to lack of foresight on the part of State governments and to the encouraging outlook at that time. I offer no objection to the proposed reduction of the duty; but I realize the perilous position of those engaged in the industry, and I hope that the Minister will soon be able to give it some additional assistance. Mr ""WHITE (Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.50] I hope that the alteration of the excise duty will not react in the way suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr present difficulties being due to the Hawker), and do any harm to returned soldier grape-growers. The reduction of the duty applies to the product of the doradillo grapes, as well as the other variehope that it will help the growers. Its ties. The Government can only watch the whole situation. This is a most difficult and complex industry. In the short time that I have held office as Minister, I have {riven a great deal of my time to its study, with a view to finding a solution of the difficulties confronting our growers, and have sought the views of a number of persons qualified to express an opinion, with a view to putting the industry on a better footing. tion of the operation of the law of supply and demand. allowed to work inexorably, there would be a great deal of misery in this industry. State governments have assisted returned soldier growers in many ways, and at Renmark and White Cliffs, growers -a t all events the growers of sultanasare prospering. I understand that the problem of grafting doradillo stocks witb types of dried fruit grapes is receiving attention. Members of the Viticultural Quite recently, Council and the experts whose opinion was sought by the Government, have suggested a flat rate for all spirit. The Government would very much regret if any hardship were imposed upon returned soldier growers, and will give careful attention to any representations that may be made on their behalf. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson), who represents a large number of grapegrowers and wineries, has, on many occasions, advocated their interests in this Parliament, and I am sure they will appreciate the flattening out of the two rates. Apparently the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) was under a misapprehension when he said that this was another primary industry to whicli the Government was paying out bounties. It is true that the Government is providing a bounty, but I remind him that it is really paid by the wine industry itself, because the estimated revenue from fortified spirit this year is Â£207,000, and the probable amount of the bounty is Â£193,000, though, of course, part of this is provided from revenue. This is one of the problem industries, its catastrophic fall that has taken place in world prices. The Government is making this gesture to the industry in the action is not, as was suggested by the honourable member for Barton, prompted by a desire to make Australians wine drinkers, but to give aid to a deserving section of primary producers.

Od. per lb of manufactured tobacco shall be made for each pound weight of Australian-grown leaf tobacco used in the manufacture of tobacco classifiable under this sub-item. As we had a f u l l debate on the tobacco duties a couple of weeks ago, I do not intend to deal in detail w it h the subject to-night. one-half of the members of this chamber is that the protection given by the Scullin' Government to the Australian tobacco-growing industry has been very considerably whittled away by the present Government. This amendment is equivalent to a reduction of the excise on tobacco made from Australian-grown leaf to 3s. per lb., leaving the excise on tobacco made from imported leaf at 4s. 6d. per lb. It is, in essence, the proposal submitted to the Minister last Friday afternoon by a deputation of tobacco-growers. On a consumption of 5,000,000 lb. of Australian-grown leaf, the revenue on the excisable portion, approximately 4,000,000 lb., would be reduced by Is. 6d. per lb., that is, by Â£300,000, which could be made up by a readjustment of excise and import duties on the imported leaf. This reduction would enable the companies to pass on the concession to consumers of tobacco, and, in the main, it would benefit the working-class section of our community. The reduction would be highly appreciated at a time like this, when individual incomes have been so seriously depleted. It would provide the consumers with Australian tobacco at' 10s. per lb. instead of l is . 6d., thus reducing the living expenses of the community generally, and it would increase the demand for tobacco made from Australian leaf. The reduction by this Government of the margin of protection of 5s. 2d. per lb. granted by the Scullin Government to 3s. per lb. brought the price of Australian tobacco up to within one penny, and, the imported article, and, with the usual prejudice that exists against the locallymade article, the public has consumed imported tobacco in preference to our own product. If my amendment is accepted, tbe margin of preference w ill be increased from 3s. per lb. to 4s. 6d. I per lb. Naturally, I should prefer to have continued, if only for a time, the margin of preference that was granted by the Scullin Government. I realize that, as the Australian tobacco industry expands, re-adjustment w ill have to be made in excise and import duties. U p to the 30th June, 1932, the industry contributed Â£7,200,000 in taxation to the Treasury, and this year it w ill pay about an equivalent amount. When commenting on the revenue derived from the The consensus of at least tobacco industry, the Tariff Board stated in its reportHaving regard to all the circumstances, the Tariff Board is of opinion that it would be unwise during the period in which the Australian leaf-growing industry is becoming",58,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages
194,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [ 9 . 5 7 ],"established to seek to increase the net revenue from tobacco beyond the amount raised during 1920-30, namely, approximately Â£6,500,000. So that even if this concession of Â£300,000 is made to the smokers of tobacco made from Australian leaf to popularize our product, tbe amount of revenue which the Tariff Board specified as reasonable would still go to the Treasury from this industry. I hope that the committee will support my amendment. Before the alteration was made last year in the rates of Australian duties, there was a wide margin between the retail prices of Australian and American tobacco, running to as high as 6d. for a 2-oz. packet. incentive to the smoker to purchase Australian rather than American tobacco. Witb the alterations that have been made in the past twelve months in the duties on tobacco, that difference has largely disappeared, and, with it, to a large extent, the incentive to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco. As a result, the Minister is worried as to how he will arrange with manufacturers to ensure that, so far as possible, the whole of the Australian crop shall be purchased, and growers fear that the demand for Australian tobacco will not increase in the same ratio as its production. Members of the Country party realize that it is vital for the Government to obtain revenue, and they do not propose to advance any suggestion that would entail a loss of revenue to the Government from this source. I recognize that the amendment which has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would involve a substantial loss of revenue, for the honourable gentleman has not suggested that the loss resulting from a lower rate of excise on Australian tobacco should be made up by an increase in the duty on American tobacco. desires, the Government can make up the Â£300,000 that is involved by a re-adjustment of the excise duties on imported leaf. cient additional revenue to compensate for a drop of Is. 6d. per lb. in the excise duty on Australian tobacco, taking the basis of consumption to be two parts American and one part Australian, it would be necessary to increase by 9d. per lb. the rate of imported tobacco, which would give a range of total protection slightly in excess of the amount which was enjoyed by the industry when the Scullin Government was in office. The question is: How can a cheaper smoke be provided for the man who has been hit by the depression without loss of revenue to the Government; and how can a price incentive be given to the use of Australian tobacco, again without loss of revenue? My colleagues and I believe that this can be done, and we have submitted to the Minister a proposal that has been worked out That provided an by the secretary to the Victorian Tobacco Growers Association, which would permit of Australian tobacco being sold for Id. less than to-day's prices for a 2-oz. packet, while blended tobacco would be sold at rates ranging from those now charged, to prices which would be just a little cheaper. The small retail price difference that now exists in favour of Australian as compared with imported tobacco, would be increased under the proposal by at least 1-^d. for a 2-oz. packet, which would give a considerable incentive to smokers to buy and acquire a taste for Australian tobacco, and the problem of the absorption of all the suitable Australian leaf would present less difficulty. I hope, therefore, that the Government will agree to the proposal, either wholly or substantially. Briefly put, it is that instead of having a flat rate of excise of 4s. 6d. per lb. on both Australian and imported tobacco, for the first year there should be an increase in the excise on imported leaf of 4d., and a reduction on Australian leaf of 8d. per lb., making a differentiation of Is. per lb., that is, 3s. lOd. on Australian and 4s. lOd. on imported leaf. Throughout these calculations, the Australian consumption of finecut and plug tobacco is estimated at 14,000,000 lb. per annum, the proposal excluding entirely consideration of cigarettes and cigars, for they are not yet affected by the production of Australian leaf. For the first year the basis is taken on a consumption of 4,000,000 lb. of Australian, and 10,000,000 lb. of imported leaf, which would leave the Government a little better off from a revenue",59,Division 1 Ales Spirits And Beverages

It is suggested that for the next year, there should be a difference of l i d . in the rate of excise duty on the two tobaccoes, that is, 3s. l i d . per lb. on Australian leaf, and 4s. lOd. per lb. on imported leaf. On the basis of a consumption of 5,000,000 lb. of Australian leaf and 9,000,000 lb. of imported leaf, the revenue would then be Â£4,500,000 anticipated under present conditions. Eor the third year, the basis taken is 6,000,000 lb. of Australian leaf and 8,000,000 lb. of imported leaf, the rates of excise being respectively 4s. I d . and 4s. lOd.

Australian and 4,000,000 lb. imported, the rate of excise being 4s. 5d. and 4s. lOd. respectively. The scheme also works out the amount that the Government would need to add both on Australian and imported leaf.if it desired to maintain a revenue of Â£4,500,00 on plug and fine-cut tobacco as the imports decreased; in the third year it would be necessary to add 3d. per lb. to both varieties of leaf, in the fourth year 5d., in the fifth year 8d., and in the sixth year Is. per lb. In such circumstances, the excise would then be 5s. 5d. on Australian leaf, and 5s. lOd. per lb. on imported leaf. Sir HENRYGULLETT W h a t about the poor smoker then? gentleman w ill realize that as the amount factured tobacco n.e.i., made either from of imported tobacco diminishes and our imported leaf or Australian-grown leaf own increases, there must be an increase or an admixture of bothin the rate of excise. The scheme provides for such a contingency, which would have to be provided for in the same way manufactured even if the Government adhered to its tobacco leaf upon which import duty at the present proposals. honourable member's sympathy with the been made from sueh imported tobacco leaf smoker is only for a year or two. is apparently no escape from that position which the honourable getnleman himself, in his speeches, has admitted. I am endeavouring to demonstrate that a means can be provided which would make possible a differentiation of Is. per lb. between the rate of excise on Australian and imported tobacco to begin with, which would decrease as the volume of the consumption of Australian tobacco increased. From the Government's point Â£4,504,166 as compared with of view, the revenue would be safeguarded, whilst the smoker, who alike w i th the non-smoker, has been hit by the depression, could buy a cheaper smoke if he cared to make use of the lower-priced ranges which would be available under these proposals.

I repeat that the growers are not seeking any price advantage. The proposal that I am submitting will help to widen the demand for Australian tobacco without injury to the excise revenue. Therefore, I urge the Minister to adopt it. As a private member, I cannot move to increase the foreign rate by 4d. per lb., but I give notice of my intention to adopt the only course open to me, namely, to move that the duties on Australian leaf be reduced by Sd. per lb., leaving it to the Government to impose an additional 4d. on American Jeaf in order to implement this proposal and yet safeguard the revenue. If that amendment be agreed to, tlie rate on the imported tobacco, hand-made strand, would be increased from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 7d. per lb., and on imported manufactured tobacco from 4s. G'd. to 4s. lOd. per lb. Sir [10.20] I hope that the committee will not agree to either the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) or that foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr dustry which already has protection rangPaterson). A year ago, after full examination of the tobacco industry, this committee decided to reduce from 5s. 2d. to 3s. per lb. the protection afforded to Australian-grown leaf. We have had a year's experience of the reduced rate, and we know that the Government's forecasts have been fulfilled. There was sold during the year, at the extraordinarily profitable pries of 2s. 3d. per lb., four times as much tobacco leaf as had been sold in Australia in any previous year. That should demonstrate conclusively that the duty of 3s. was ample protection for this little primary industry. I do not suppose that any other protective duty has ever been so completely vindicated. What is the meaning of the two amendments that are being submitted to the committee? The purpose of that of the Deputy Leader of tlie Opposition is to reverse lastgrower of poor tobacco. I am surprised year's vote by allowing a rebate of Is. 6d. per lb. on Australian leaf, thus increasing the protection from 3s. to 4s. 6d. This would be almost a restoration of the Scullin protective duty. 5s. 2d. ing Leader of the Country party, having a few days ago voted that an import duty of 3s. per lb. was ample to protect the Australian industry, now proposes by some complicated scheme of raising and lowering excise duties to increase the protection from 3s. to 4s. The honourable gentleman is not doing justice to himself. His proposal panders to the growers of inferior leaf. The 3s. duty has been proved ample protection for the growers of anything approaching good leaf. It is true that last year approximately 1,000,000 lb. of rubbish such as was exhibited in this chamber last weektobacco that would menace the health of the smoker, and half of which was grown by Chinese labourers working from dawn till dusk on seven days a week-wa s not sold. It is in aid of growers of this class and tobacco of this quality that these amendments are proposed. All the bright sold at prices in excess of 3s. per lb., and I predict that when the sales open next week that result will be repeated. Yet we are asked further to pamper an ining from 300 to 500 per cent. I marvel at this proposal emanating from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am surprised that we should be asked by the apostles of reduced duties to increase the rate on tobacco from 3s. to 4s. per lb. It is the most inconsistent tariff action taken by any party in the history of this Parliament. There is country in Australia capable of growing, hot only our total annual requirement of 20,000,000 lb. of first-class leaf, but probably hundreds of millions of pounds of leaf equal to the best Virginian. Beyond question the 3s. duty will sell high-grade leaf to Australian manufacturers at satisfactory prices, although similar tobacco can be landed in Australia at about Is. per lb.

No one can compare it with the tax of 4d. a lb. on tea, or the 4d. per lb. on raw rubber, or the tax of 7d. a gallon on petrol, which seriously affects the industry of the country. Thi3 tax satisfies many of the most important canons of taxation: It is fairly constant in its return, and is relatively easy and inexpensive to collect. I appeal to the committee to pass the excise duty as it stands, just as, a few nights ago, it agreed ment we have received from 'the Governto the import duties. [10.36] -It is a strange thing that the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) can never speak on the subject of the Australian tobacco industry without displaying a considerable amount of heat, and a great deal of venom. I am satisfied that his protests of friendliness towards the industry are not sincere, because they are belied by his own utterances, and he takes every opportunity of throwing mud at the majority of the growers. He did so again to-night. As I have said before, the tobacco combine has no better advocate in this Parliament than the honourable member, and, while he is here to represent its interests, it has nothing much to worry about. honourable member made several misstatements on the subject of tobacco. He misrepresented the honorable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), the Acting Leader of the Country party, in the most reprehensible manner. I do not know whether he was in the chamber the other night when the honourable member for Gippsland spoke on tobacco. He hardly ever seems to be here when honourable members of this party are stating their opinions; but, had he been here the other night, he would recollect that the honourable member for Gippsland made it clear that he, and the other members of this party, were supporting the Government's proposal to maintain the duty at 3s. per lb. only on the understanding that the Government would give serious consideration to a proposal for the modification of the excise duty. There was no undertaking given, I admit. undertaking. on the Minister, and he said that our representations would' be given serious consideration. Apparently, if the honourable member knows what has happened, our representations were given serious consideration. about it. the Minister told us, and, while we were not foolish enough, in view of the treatment in regard to this matter, to accept it as a promise, or even as a suggestion that our wishes would be met, we believed that we were entitled to give the Minister a chance to put the matter before the Government, and the majority of the members of our party decided not to oppose the confirmation of the 3s. duty. ^The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) made it clear that, if the Government did not accept our proposals regarding excise, we should take steps in committee to translate our wishes into action. That is what we are doing now. There has been nothing inconsistent in the attitude of the Acting Leader of tbe Country party. The honourable member for Henty stated that our proposal to reduce the The excise duty is put forward in the interests of the growers of the worse kinds of tobacco; that it is a scheme designed to protect the producers of what he calls black tobacco, and the honourable member spoke of what he described as the filthy rubbish displayed on the table by the Minister the other night. If he knew anything at all about tobacco, he must know that what the Minister exhibited was not filthy rubbish, but only a poor quality of tobacco deliberately picked out, in my opinion, by an officer of the department,",62,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was

212,Mr Thompson,"Well, that is whatand shown in contrast' with one of the best samples that Australia produces. If the honourable member had heard my criticism of the officer's report, he would know that there is nothing in the suggestion that our proposal is designed to provide a market for the worse kind of rubbish grown by Chinese in the Tamworth district. As a matter of fact, the Minister himself admitted that only one-half of the tobacco of that district' which remained unsold was grown by Chinese. more than half. that more than half the Chinese tobacco in the district was unsold, which is a very different thing. to me and the district I represent, I remind honourable members that Tamworth is only one of the tobacco-growing districts in New England. There are at least half a dozen others. In this muchdespised district, 600 tons of tobacco were sold at an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb., which the honourable member says is a magnificent price for the best class of tobacco in Australia. If I had the opportunity, I could prove that there is just as good tobacco being grown in the Tamworth district, as the sample exhibited here the other night by the Minister. The proposal put forward by the Acting Leader of the Country party would, if accepted, be of great benefit to the producers of good tobacco, the majority of whom are in the area I represent. If any further evidence is required that some such scheme is necessary to assist the tobacco-growers to obtain a market for their leaf, it is provided by the fact that, since tbe alteration of the duties by this Government, the market for Australian tobacco has contracted by 40 per cent. The manufacturers themselves tell us that the demand for Australian tobacco, as such, has fallen off in a remarkable manner, simply because the heavy increase in the excise duty has made it necessary to raise the price of Australian brands practically to the level of American and other imported tobaccoes. Australian tobacco has been called upon to provide 93 per cent, of the extra revenue which the Government demanded, and this practically in the first year of the industry's establishment on its present footing. Just as the industry was becoming .established, the Government dealt it this sledge-hammer blow. Never before has such a burden been placed on an Australian industry in the early stages of its development. The honourable member for Henty is a past master at omissions. He says many things, but he generally omits to tell us those things which, if revealed, would completely alter the complexion of a matter. He spoke of thefulfilment of the Government's expectations regarding revenue, and also of the general success of tbe Government's policy for establishing the tobacco-growing industry. He said that the Government, as the result of an agreement with the manufacturers, In justice had found a market for 10,000,000 lb. of Australian-grown tobacco at the magnificent price of 2s. 3d. per lb. To begin with, his figures were incorrect. According to the manufacturers, the growers sold only 8,500,000 lb. of tobacco at an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb., tbe rest being sold at a lower price. He did not mention that about 2,000,000 lb. of tobacco was left on the growers' hands, nor did he say that in that period, when the local industry was producing about half the Australian tobacco requirements, the present Government opened the door to the entry of tobacco from other countries, with the result that 10,500,000 lb. of leaf was imported from * the United States of America. importation. there is no scope for the Australian industry; all that we grow here is surplus. Is it any wonder that the manufacturers are complaining that they are compelled to pay high prices for Australian tobacco when they can get American tobacco at much lower prices? tobacco be cheaper if it is subject to a duty of 3s. per lb? should know that the duty of 3s. per lb. is not the real margin of protection, because 20 per cent, of that 3s. is handed back to the manufacturers in respect of the stems. That makes the duty 3s. per lb. less 20 per cent. Another 20 per cent, must be deducted because of the great amount of wastage of Australian leaf due to a lack of proper maturation.",64,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was

The committee stated that manufacturers or 3s. per lb. for the Australian leaf, and still sell American leaf at $ of a Id. per lb. less than the price of Australian leaf. Owing to the lack of maturation, and the consequent wastage, Australian, leaf is cheaper than the prices indicated. So long as there is no proper system of maturation it is unfair to say that the Australian industry enjoys a protection of 300 per cent. Manufacturers are able to place American tobacco on the market at prices less than Australian tobacco can be sold for. importation of 21,000,000 lb. of tobacco leaf, aud the industry is protected by means of the excise duty, it will be useless to try to grow tobacco in Australia. A high excise duty on Australian leaf will enable manufacturers to import as much American tobacco as before, and it will be hopeless for Australian growers to continue in the industry. Australian tobacco needs popularizing, and the best way to do that is to reduce its price. The tobacco manufacturers told the select committee to which I have referred that the price was the all important factor in the sale of tobacco. They said that if a brand of tobacco were reduced in price, its sales immediately increased. Especially in times of depression, the working man looks for cheap tobacco. He will buy tobacco which is not so palatable as that sold under other brands if he can get it for 4d., 5d. or 6d. a tin less. Under the old tariff, when the import duty was 5s. 2d. per lb., and the excise duty 2s. 4d. per lb., the demand for Australian brands of tobacco could not the country were inundated with requests for supplies of Australian tobacco, particularly of the cheaper brands. Ultimately, the manufacturers had to admit that they had used up all their stocks of Australian leaf, including the "" filthy rubbish"" mentioned by the honourable member for Henty. As the manufacturers paid the Chinese growers of that tobacco only 3d. or 4d. per lb. for it, and sold it at top prices, they lost nothing on the deal. argument for high duties! manufacturers will do. an excessive duty will do. ment will not alter its policy, and keep out imported leaf, at least until the Australian industry gets on its feet-and , in spite of what the honourable member for Henty, when Minister for Trade and Customs, promised, the Government has apparently no intention of doing so-the only course left is to try to cheapen the Australian product until smokers have acquired a taste for it. That can be done If we maintain an annual only through the excise. If we keep the excise duty at 4s. 6d. per lb., and the import duty at 3s, per lb., the Australian industry will be. left without hope. I have received from the Mareeba Chamber of Commerce a telegram urging me to support any proposal for an alteration of the excise duty on tobacco. Even in Queensland, where, according to the honourable member for Henty, so much bright tobacco is now being grown, the growers do not hold out any hope for the future of the industry unless the duties' are altered. If the Minister adopts the proposal of the Acting Leader of the Country party, there will be an increased demand for Australian tobacco, provided the price is reduced-and in its own interests, the industry will reduce the price-and also a revival of a number of small manufacturing concerns which deal wholly in Australian tobacco. Before the present Government altered the duties, as many as seven buyers representing the big manufacturing companies would visit one dis. trict-eve n the despised Tamworth district. The year before last, seven buyers, representing firms in competition, visited be met. ' Retailers throughout the tobacco-growing areas; but when the duties were altered by the present Government, a number of the smaller manufacturers were forced out of business. Tamworth tobacco, which the combine refused to buy, was sold at 9d. per lb. in Brisbane, and, later, was disposed of to smokers as high grade American tobacco. That tobacco was sold, not as an Australian product, but as Special No. 1, Special No. 2, and Special No. 3, and the smokers of Brisbane bought it, not because it was",65,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was

The manufacturer of that tobacco told me that he could not afford to pay more than 9d. per lb. for it because the excise duty was so high, but that if the excise duty were reduced by 2s. per lb., he could pay the growers as much as Is. 9d. per lb. Australian tobacco is not properly matured, and, conthat the honourable gentleman sent for sequently, manufacturers lose at least 25 per cent, of it in manufacture. They have to allow for that loss when buying Australian tobacco. By maintaining the excise duty at the present high level, we are actually robbing the tobacco-growers, because we are preventing them from marketing even a comparatively inferior type of tobacco. Other than as a means of protecting the revenue, there is no excuse for that. Acting Leader of the Country party produced figures which have been checked by the Customs Department officials to show that if his proposal were adopted the Government would actually gain revenue. Por a definite period we would work on a sliding scale, and would guarantee a revenue of Â£750,000 in excess of what the Tariff Board said was a fair thing. If , however, the Government will not accept the solid arguments of the honourable member for Gippsland, but chooses instead the nonsensical advice of the honourable member for Henty, who all along has been a biased witness against this Australian industry, those of us who, without any reward whatever, represent the tobacco-growing industry, will have to take other steps to bring the industry out of the position in which the policy of the present Government has placed it. dustry. member for Henty spoke of the magnifiblindly, allowing the position to revert to cent position which the industry has built what it was previously.

One manufacturer told me him and almost bullied him into paying so much per lb. for tobacco. How different the position to-day! The manufacturers have told the present Minister that they will not make an agreement with the growers of tobacco this year, and will not put a price on this year's crop. Last year the growers received 2s. 3d. per lb. for their leaf, but they are not likely to get paid at that rate this year. The Probably they will not sell more than about 40 per cent, of the total crop, and the average price is not likely to exceed 2s. per lb. It is rather strange that a government, which says that it has the interests of this industry at heart, should be applauding the manufacturers for their alleged generosity in being prepared to buy only bright mahogany leaf, which represents about 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, of the crop. We are also given to understand that the price to the growers may he 2s. per lb. if the price is only 2s. per lb. for half of the crop, the average price for the whole crop will be Is. per lb.

225,Mr Thompson,"The honorableto delude ourselves. This industry has provided employment during the depression, and, unless we do something to assist it, unless we stand up to this combine more courageously than we are doing at present, no tobacco will be grown at all in Australia, from 4,000 to 5,000 growers will be ruined, from 15,000 to 20,000 workers in the industry will be deprived of remunerative employment, and the smokers of Australia will have to pay Is. lOd. or 2s. for a 2-oz. tin of tobacco. The combine has made huge profits. For the last 30 years its declared profit, taken out of the pockets of the smokers of Australia, has been about Â£500,000 per annum. For at least five or six years its profits have averaged Â£1,000,000. Last year, which was a year of depression, the combine had the audacity to publish a declared dividend of Â£500,000, and the year before it gave a bonus of 40 per cent, to the shareholders, and, in addition, watered its capital to an alarming extent. This Government, by its present policy, is protecting that monopoly, and I warn the members of the Ministry that, if they do not accept the suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr able member for Henty went still Paterson), their blood will be upon their own heads. I regret that the Government did not see its way clear to debate the customs and excise duties at the one time, so that one vote only would have been needed on this item. gone. I should not have risen to speak had it not been for the fact that the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) endeavoured to attach to the members of the Country party statements which are incorrect. It is unfortunate that he displayed a certain amount of heat iu making his'speech, because no other honourable member knows as much as he of the position of the tobacco industry. He said that the members of the Country party had set themselves up as champions of low-quality black tobacco. That statement is incorrect. We have never suggested that, nor have we suggested that low-grade tobacco should be purchased at all. for New England( Mr Thompson) has suggested that. growers of tobacco produce an unsaleable leaf, they must do what the producers of other unsaleable products do, and that is, scrap it. By accepting the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), the Government would not only assist the industry, but would also safeguard its revenue, because that honourable member has clearly shown that, in every one of the years to which he has referred, the amount of revenue received by the Government would be greater than it is receiving this year. If that were not so, I should be prepared to support other proposals which would give the Government the amount of revenue that it is seeking. As it is not possible for the Acting Leader of the Country party to move for an increase of the excise duty on tobacco manufactured from imported leaf, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), in order to overcome that difficulty, has moved for the reduction of the excise by Is. 6d. per lb. on tobacco manufactured from Australian leaf. That amendment I do not propose to support. But the honorfurther, and said that our proposal, if given effect, would deprive the Government of revenue. It would do nothing of the kind, because the Government would receive more revenue than it has received in the past. The object of our proposal is not to give more money to the grower, However, that opportunity has but to give some advantage to the smoker. The amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition aims at an increased consumption of Australian tobacco; but the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland aims at a decrease in the price of that tobacco. To-day the margin is so small between ,the price of Australian tobacco and that of imported tobacco, that people prefer to buy the imported article. It is really a matter of taste. Eveni f the Australian tobacco were better than the imported tobacco, acquired taste would impel smokers to buy the more expensive tobacco. Only those who are prepared to buy a cheap article smoke Australian tobacco, and when they acquire a taste for it, they prefer it to the imported article.

The honourable member for Henty has attributed to us the statement that we are supporting a duty which provides a protection of something like 500 per cent, or 600 per cent. We should like the Government to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland, in the belief that sooner or later Australia will grow a first-class leaf for which there will be a ready sale, and when that time arrives the Government will have to alter the excise duty to meet the greater demand for Australian tobacco, and the consequent smaller demand for imported tobacco. I hope that the Government will see its way clear to make some concessions to the growers so that a greater demand may be created for Australian tobacco.

The acceptance of the amendment foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Country party who, as he has stated, cannot move for au increased duty, would mean a loss of something like Â£125,000, although I admit that he proposes a system of equalization which, would provide the Government with the revenue that it requires. I shall later deal with the faults of that system. We know that the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) is enthusiastic about the Australian tobacco industry, and that by any means he would make honourable members to believe that Tamworth tobacco is what it should be. at all. ber has attacked the Government expert who went to Tamworth and made an impartial report, a man in whom the representatives of Queensland in this chamber have great faith, and whose judgment they are prepared to accept. I have with me an extract from the Tamworth Leader, a newspaper which, I think, is edited by the honourable member for New England. newspaper from Canberra? Referring to grading, Mr Gilbert declared that 80 per cent, of the leaf in the Tamworth district was got up in a very unsatisfactory manner, and in a lot of cases everything that could be done was done to cheat the buyer. That statement was published in the honourable member's own newspaper. to that statement at the meeting? ber can tell the committee what the answer was, because I cannot. The honourable made into the industry, and an investigation took place. I shall not traverse the whole of the ground again, because this subject has already been thoroughly threshed out, but the committee will agree that the inquiry showed that there was a great deal of inferior tobacco in the district of Tamworth. Any productwhether butter, wool, or wheat-unles s up to standard, is not likely to be sold. I remind the honourable member for NewI admit that; but we England that it is not the Government's business to find a sale for primary products. Although the Government has in the past done its best to assist the tobacco industry, it rests with the growers themselves to produce a class of leaf that will find a ready market. Last year the growers sold all their good leaf, and, as I have told honourable members previously, this year the manufacturers have undertaken to buy all that class of leaf. Our estimate of the quantity that the two largest companies will purchase is something like 6,000,000 lb. of good leaf, and the ordinary usage of inferior grades of tobacco.

256,Mr White,"Let us assume that theof the Country party if , in common with the Labour party, it frankly admitted that it wants prohibitive protection in this case. Instead of saying that, it wants no duty on wire netting, barbed wire and fencing wire, and is dissatisfied generally with all that the Government has done, and, besides, has shown no gratitude whatever for the relief that has been afforded by the Government to the man on the land. It now finds that it is somewhat inconsistent, and hopes that its present scheme will be more favourably received. I shall point to some of the fundamental faults in that scheme, which show that it would not work. estimated that for the forthcoming financial year the net quantity of imported stemmed leaf tobacco will be 8,240,000 lb., and of Australian stemmed leaf tobacco 3,680,000 lb., a total excisable quantity of tobacco of 13,946,400 lb. Although 4,600,000 lb. of Australian leaf will be used next year, that represents only 3,680,000 lb. of stripped leaf. The statement ""13"" circulated by the representatives of the tobacco-growers, which has been put forward by tbe Country party, gives details of the effects of various changes by raising the foreign and lowering the Australian excise duty. to raise the foreign excise duty after the first year; it then remains constant. mittee must see that, as the imported leaf was displaced and the Australian demand became greater-as it naturally must become in any case-so the Australian excise duty would have to be raised. I put that forward as a reason why the reduction of the Australian excise should not be asked for, because it is definitely known that, in the future, importations will be less. But the figures quoted have been based upon faulty premises. excisable manufactured tobacco is fairly differential rate in the excise tariff is to accurate, being out to the extent of only increase the consumption of Australian 53,600 lb. in a calculation involving leaf. A difference of approximately Is. 14,000,000 lb.

The Minister should not try to mislead the committee. the committee. The quantity of excisable tobacco leaf made from that 10,000,000 lb. of stemmed leaf is said to be 10,000,000 lb.; but that is not so. An average loading of 17 per cent, is added to the stemmed leaf to make the manufactured tobacco. This loading consists of various ingredients. It must be appreciated that considerably less than 10,000,000 lb. of imported stemmed leaf is needed to make 10,000,000 lb. of It is tobacco. In fact, the figure should be 8,547,000 lb. affect the comparison. mated revenue in the first table in statement "" B "" is inaccurate to the extent of Â£218,000. difference between 8,547,000 lb. and 10,000,000 lb. The error is such a fundamental one that it is not possible to reconcile the figures given with the departmental estimate. But in order to try out the scheme, I shall take the quantities of Australian and imported leaf and manufactured tobacco which the department estimates will be used during the next financial year, and apply the rates se.t out in statement "" B "". Adopting the excise rate of 3s. lOd. per lb. on tobacco made from Australian leaf, and of 4s. lOd. per lb. on tobacco made from imported leaf, the net effect on the -revenue, if the proportions of imported and Australian leaf did not vary, would appear to be a gain of Â£17,160 on what is estimated to be the revenue for next year, calculated on existing rates. supports my proposal.

I do not think the committee should debate the question much longer. This is the fourth debate that we have bad upon it. The same ground has been covered on each occasion, and the effort has been made to prove that in some way the Government has been harsh to the growers. The growers should be thankful to the Government that it has, to some extent, protected them from themselves, by encouraging them to adopt the best cultural methods, and grow only leaf that is saleable at a good price. The Minister has stated that this is the fourth time on which the committee has debated the subject of the tobacco duties, and I may add that it is the fourth occasion on which the Country party has had its "" leg pulled "". It is evident that a tobacco that Australians can smoke. that party is again engaged in a sham fight. The question to be decided now is not whether tbe figures presented by the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) are right or wrong. The Country party asks from what source the Government is to get its revenue. The ex-Minister for Trade and Customs( Sir Henry Gullett), tbe present Minister( Mr White), and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) stated definitely, in reply to every deputation that waited on them with regard to the tobacco duties, that the United Australia Party had no intention to reduce the duties, and it threw the responsibility for any reduction upon the Country and the Labour parties. If honourable members are desirous of bringing relief to the tobacco-growers, that result can be achieved only by a vote in this chamber; but the Country party has not had sufficient courage to support the Opposition. Apparently, it does not wish to embarrass the Government, and the Government evidently does not intend to embarrass the Country party. the honourable member to deal with the than in Australia. Britain gives a prefersubject before the Chair. great inconvenience to the Ministeri f he handed on to the consumers. All that had the import duty on tobacco reconsidered, with a view to increasing it by I produced a couple Is. 6d. per lb., as suggested under the amendment submitted by the Opposition. The Acting Leader of the Country party has declared that his party has no intention to support the amendment tabled by the Opposition. The Labour party proposes to adhere to its amendment; but, if defeated, it will support-the amendment to be proposed by the Country party. That amendment would result in a reduction of the excise duty to the extent of Is. per lb., which would enable the Queensland growers to market their leaf at Is. per lb. less than the price of the imported leaf. The problem with which the growers of tobacco in Australia have been faced, has been the initial difficulty of capturing the local market, and to do that it has been necessary to reduce the price of tobacco to a figure that Australian smokers can afford to pay, having regard to the reduction of their incomes. several good brands of Australian tobacco on the market, and I commend them to the notice of the honourable member. I contend that tobacco equal to the imported article is now produced from Australian leaf; but, unfortunately, the action of the present Government in increasing the excise duty has caused an increase of the price of the locally-produced article, and has forced the Australian grown tobacco into competition with tobacco produced by negro labour in the United States of America. Can anybody imagine that country purchasing Australian butter, wool, or meat? The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) declared that the tobacco industry receives protection amounting to 300 per cent.; but, having regard to the average price of 2s. 3d. per lb. which was obtained for last year's crop, the protection amounts to only about 50 per cent.

There arethe Opposition asks for is a reduction of Is. 6d. per lb. in the excise duty, and that reduction would, undoubtedly, be passed on by the local manufacturers to the consumers. tobacco have entered the market in Australia, and the smokers are acquiring a liking for the tobacco that is now being produced from locally-grown leaf. In 1930, only a few brands of Australian tobacco, such as "" ""Waratah "", were put on the market, and were being sold at about Is. 6d. a 2-oz. packet."" But, to-day, "" Waratah"" has practically disappeared from the market, and other brands of a better quality have taken its place. The Minister said that difficulty would arise if differential excise rates were adopted. I point out, however, that in 1922 and 1927, the excise duties showed a variation of 6d. per lb. When the tobacco duties were under discussion last year, the then Minister for Trade and Customs said that if the proposal put forward by a deputation was adopted, the revenue would suffer to the extent of from Â£2,000,000 to Â£3,000,000, and he anticipated a loss in that year of Â£1,000,000; but there was no loss of revenue. Those honourable members who are anxious for the success of the Australian tobacco industry should dismiss party considerations on this occasion, and take action to assist this industry, which pro. vides a great deal of employment, and is capable of considerable development. It is not a sound argument to say that a reduction of the excise duty will encourage the production of an inferior class of leaf, because it must be admitted that the manufacturers will buy only such leaf as suits their purposes. Two hands of tobacco were recently displayed in this chamber by the Minister, who said that one was from Mareeba and the other from the Tamworth district. I remind honourable members that it would be possible in any district, including Mareeba, to select two hands of tobacco of totally different qualities. One might be first class leaf, and the other an inferior grade. If half the leaf grown in the Tamworth district last year happened to be of a certain quality, that fact would not justify the destruction of this industry. If the amendment of tbe Deputy Leader of the Opposition is agreed to, the Government will have to take steps to protect the revenue to ensure that no loss will be sustained. New manufacturers of not prepared to support the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), but I think that something more might be done by the Government to assist the tobacco-growers to dispose of the leaf that they produce. I do not believe that it is the responsibility of the Government to make any industry profitable. It is not the duty of the Government to make the production of wheat and wool pay, or to make manufacturing enterprises successful; that is the responsibility of the people who put their money into such enterprises. But in certain circumstances a responsibility rests upon the Government which it should not lightly throw off. The Tariff Board has stated that such circumstances exist in connection with the glass industry, and I submit that it also exists in connection with the tobacco industry. The Tariff Board, in its report on the glass industry, stated thatThe industry based on so high a cost would be of doubtful value on economic grounds, but the board is actuated in recommending itthat is, the high tariffby the fact tliat the deferred duty encouraged the installation of the factory. I submit that the provision of a duty of 5s. 2d. per lb. encouraged people to engage in the tobacco industry. Following upon the provision of this duty, an immense development occurred in tobacco production. Large amounts of new capital were invested in the industry, and heavy commitments in the nature of hire purchase instalments were made by the tobacco-growers. In these circumstances, the Country party considers that an obligation rests on the Government to see that the tobacco-growers are not left stranded by the sudden chopping off of the tariff. This Government made a 40 per cent, chop in the duties with one stroke of the pen. Such a bad knock to the growers will prevent the industry from being carried on profitably. It has been stated by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) that the price of 2s. 3d. per lb. obtained for leaf last year was extraordinarily profitable. The honourable gentleman added that this showed",73,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was

Let us now consider the position of the for the industry. Such a policy would growers. inability to dispose of a large portion of that are unsuitable, and to produce their production. Mr Nock. In the tobacco companies last year for the It must be suggest that it is an obligation of the ments, principally in the signing of hire purchase agreements for the equipment of We should not forget that this industry provided a large amount of The adjustment of the excise duty can be increased. The growers are principally concerned about the disposal of But the proposal which the it would be possible under his proposal I do not desire, nor do I think it is tobacco leaf will be encouraged on unstable lines, which will not be good Their chief trouble is their cause the growers to use lands I am prepared to large quantities of inferior leaf; there would be cut-throat competition to quit it, and this would ultimately ruin the industry. The proposal of tbe Acting Leader of the Country party would not have that effect, for it is not intended that it shall remain in force indefinitely. Last year when we were discussing the . tobacco industry the Country party made an effort to get the Government to adjust the excise duties on a sliding scale for two years, to cover the period of extreme difficulty of those engaged in this industry who had committed themselves to heavy liabilities for capital outlay. The Government made a satisfactory sale arrangement for last year, but it is necessary that some arrangement shall also 'be made for this year, if the growers are to be given a reasonable chance to meet their commitments. ""We hope, therefore, that the proposal of the Country party will be accepted, for it would give very little room for complaint by the growers, the Government, or the users of tobacco. growers would be able to sell their leaf; the Government would be able to obtain the revenue it needs; and the users of tobacco would be able to obtain their requirements at a lower price than would otherwise obtain. In these circumstances I intend to support the proposal of the Acting Leader of the Country party, and I hope that the Government will accept it. I have already expressed my views on the tobacco industry on several occasions this session, and I shall not delay the committee long at this stage. I was not surprised to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) say that the Government would not amend its excise proposal. Like certain honourable members of the Country party, I attended the deputation of tobacco-growers which waited upon the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Sir Henry Gullett) last year. Then, as always, we were told the same story"" This matter will receive the earnest consideration of the Government"". It is still receiving this consideration, and, I presume, will continue to receive it until the Government gets to the end of its tether. The Minister has told us to-night that he received word to-day that the tobacco companies would buy all the good leaf for 3s. 2d. per lb. I hope that that information is correct. The advice that I received from North Queensland a fortnight ago was that there was plenty of leaf available in that area similar in quality to that which the companies bought last year, but there were no buyers for it. My authority for that statement is Mr Hunter, the president of the Mareeba Chamber of Commerce. When we asked the Minister for the name of his informant on the North Queensland position he told us that his information came from a reputable firm, but that he could not divulge the name. We do not wish to keep secret the authorities for the information that we use in discussing this subject. I consider that the president of the Mareeba Chamber of Commerce is just as reliable an authority as that on which the Minister is relying. There is a representative of the Commonwealth in that district, but, apparently, his advice has not been sought. The teleThe gram which I received from Mr HunterI admit that it is a fortnight old, but the position has not changed-read s as follows:The tobacco-growers of North Queensland would appreciate your support and influence in getting a reduction of the tobacco excise, and expedite same as much as possible. Unless this reduction is made tlie industry will be greatly retarded in this State. Large quantity of tobacco leaf now ready for sale but buyers not operating. I have received similar telegrams from the Chambers of Commerce at Townsville, Bowen, and other places in my own electorate. Mareeba, of course, is in the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan). It appears that an effort is being made to pit the North Queensland to'bacco-growers against the growers of other districts, because the statement has been made that North Queensland is the only district that can produce good tobacco. That opinion has been exploded by the sworn testimony given before the select committee on the tobacco industry, and also by the returns furnished to growers in many districts by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. We know very well that the tobacco grown at Pomonal, in Victoria, and at Tumut, in New South Wales, is as good as that grown in other parts of Australia. Tbat good tobacco",74,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was
290,Mr Martens (Herbert) [11.50],"is also grown at Tamworth, notwithstanding what has been said about the Chinese there having grown inferior tobacco, is proved by the returns of the BritishAustralasian TobaccoCompany to the growers in that area. Good quality tobacco can be grown in many parts of the Commonwealth. The amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr tion, and should be protected. I wish it Eorde) should be acceptable to every one who desires to give the tobacco industry the support that it really needs. But, as the honourable member for Kennedy has said, if it is not carried by the committee, trade. Unless producers and manufacwe shall support the amendment of the Country party. We shall not refuse to support honourable members of that party because they will not support us. the Acting Leader of the Country party will give the tobacco-growers some relief. I must say that I cannot follow the reasoning of the Minister for Trade and Customs. This Government has, for the last twelve or eighteen months, been giving "" earnest consideration"" to the representations of the tobacco-growers. Last year, a deputation of 41 representatives of the tobacco industry which waited on the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Sir Henry Gullett), was told that the Government was then giving earnest consideration to the industry. The same statement has been made twice or thrice since then. statement of the Minister that if our proposal were agreed to, the revenue would be adversely affected. It should be an easy matter for the Government to protect the revenue. amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be accepted. Sitting 12.80 a.m. (Thursday). Thursday, 25 May, 1933. [Quorum formed.] I do not wish the debate on these duties to close without expressing my views concerning this very important industry of tobacco-growing. I intend to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), because I am convinced that, if carried, it will give some measure of protection to Australian tobacco growers, and perhaps enable them to recover from the blow dealt to them last year when they were brought into competition with outside growers. They have been put to considerable expenditure to arrange finance for this year's producto be clearly understood, however, that I am not in favour of excessive duties on the product of any industry, because I realize that competition is the soul of turers are in reasonable competition, they may not produce the quality of goods expected of them. Excessive protection leads to the establishment of monopolies, We believe that the proposal of and destroys that competitive spirit which is essential to the economic expansion of a nation's activities in primary and secondary producton. The measure of protection which the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland would give the industry is necessary to tide Australian growers over their present difficulties. I have nothing to say about the manner in which last year's crop was sold as a result of the arrangement made by the Government with tbe manufacturers, but I note that much has been said in criticism of the quality of leaf grown in some areas. This we must deplore, because it is desirable that Australian smokers be provided with a high quality, I cannot understand the local product. The amendment, I repeat', would give our growers an opportunity to find their feet, and, as tbe industry develops, we may expect them to give their attention to the production of a I trust that the better quality tobacco. Excellent leaf is being produced in many localities, including Mareeba, Wagga, Tumut, and Tamworth. Some of the leaf is exceptionally suspended from 11.59 p.m. to good, and as our growers have demonstrated their ability to supply the requirements of this country, they should be given the necessary protection to enable them to extend their activities, and, later, give attention to an export trade. An alteration of the excise as suggested would give a much needed incentive to the industry, the expansion of which would permit prices for Australian tobacco to be reduced consequent on an increase of sales. I appeal to the committee to accept the amendment forecast by the honourable member for Gippsland, so that this",76,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was
291,Mr Collins (Hume) [12.30 A.m.],"important industry may be put upon its feet. The figures used by the honourable gentleman were those upon which excise revenue was based last year. I was much surprised at the statements made this evening by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett). His speech was notable for. its inaccuracies, and the insults which he hurled at members of the Country party. The honourable gentleman deliberately misquoted figures used by the honourable member for Gippsland. Obviously, he was not in the House, otherwise he would have known that the Acting Leader of the Country party did not make the statements attributed to him. ""We all know that the honourable member for Henty has been absent from the House for some considerable time owing to illness, and I , as well out that his amendment would mean a as other honourable members of this chamber, extend to him a full measure of sympathy. unfair criticism of Country party members. It is outrageous for him to come into this chamber periodically, as some honourable members do, and hurl insults at the party to which I have the honour to belong. Men who indulge in this kind of criticism merely display the weakness of their case, and, because of the privileges which they enjoy as members of this Parliament, it is they who really indulge in sham-fighting. If , outside this chamber, they repeated the insults which the Country party in Parliament, they would find us ready, at all times, to stand nor, I think, to other Queensland memup and justify ourselves. times other honourable members protest loudly on behalf of unfortunate widows and children who have suffered some disability through the administration of our pension laws. But we all know that they are not so deeply concerned as they would have the people believe they are; that the "" sob stuff "" which they indulge iu, and the crocodile tears which they shed, are merely so much political propaganda. The honorable gentleman must discuss the item before the committee. Mr Chai rman, but I was determined to say something, by way of reply to the insulting remarks made, not only in this.

I again appeal to honourable members to give f u ll consideration to the amendment foreshadowed by the Acting Leader of the Country party. Downs) [12.41 a.m.] I intend to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). I do not favour the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). If carried, it would seriously affect the revenue. The Minister( Mr White), in reply to the honourable member for Gippsland, pointed loss in revenue of Â£206,000 in the last But I strongly resent his year. An ex-Minister( Sir Henry Gullett) on introducing these proposed duties, expressed the fear lest there should be a much more serious loss of revenue. Assuming that the figures quoted by the honourable member for Gippsland were not 'quite correct, the necessary revenue could be secured by a very slight adjustment of the rates. Queensland members have been urged to support the Government's proposal, because that State produces the best quality of tobacco leaf and would be they hurl at benefited considerably. Such a suggestion does not appeal to me, At various bers in this chamber. I prefer to regard tobacco-growing as an Australian industry, and to consider the effect of excise duties from that point of view. It has been urged that, as the general debate on these duties was concluded on the import duties on tobacco, an amendment of the excise duties should not now he discussed. I listened very carefully to the general debate, and my clear impression was that the Minister had implied with respect to import duties that the discussion of customs duties would not in any way, interfere with our discretion when considering the excise duties; that we were free, to deal with them in a manner calculated to give protection to the industry as a whole. During these debates I have urged that there should be differentiation between the local and",77,Henry Gullett Henty Lemon Leaf Produced In Australia Was

Sir LITTLET ON GROOM I admit that the Government is doing what it believes will help the industry, but I conhonorable member for Darling Downs, sider that it would be better assisted if the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland were accepted. Some comments have been made* about the alleged production of inferior tobacco last season. It must be remembered that that was the first big year of production in Australia; roughly speaking, about 12,500,000 lb. of tobacco was produced, of which 10,000,000 lb. was purchased by the manufacturers, and will go into consumption. Those results compare favourably with the record of the wheat, fruit growing, or any other industry, considering that so many people undertook tobacco-growing for the first time. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) said that if the protection given to the Australian industry were Government was too increased, encouragement would be given to a greater production of inferior tobacco such as was shown in this chamber. The answer is that the manufacturers know what they want, and will not purchase unsuitable leaf.

But these additions would be just as necessary under the rate of 4s. 6d. as under the rates which have been suggested, and do not affect the comparison at all. These figures were mentioned merely to present a fuller case, but there was no need to take them into consideration. The scheme I have suggested tobacco to be sold to the consumer at a slightly cheaper rate even at the end of six years, but my amendment deals only with one year. The figures relating to the quantities of Australian and American leaf going into consumption in future years were necessarily only estimates, indicating the lines on which the Government, if it were willing to adopt this proposal, could obtain the same amount of excise as under the 4s. 6d. rate. The Minister admitted that if the figures for the ' first year, namely, 10,000,000 lb. of imported leaf and 4,000,000 lb. of local leaf, proved to be substantially correct, the revenue would be better off than under the present rate. Even on the department's figures for the year, namely, 8,240,000 lb. and 3,860,000 lb. respectively, the Government would be better off under this scheme than under its own proposal. I am not suggesting that the system I am submitting would guarantee to the Government in future years the same revenue as it is getting to-day. one could guarantee that it would enable the Government , to obtain the same amount of revenue in future as it would obtain from the 4s. 6d. rate. have already explained that my reason for moving a reduction of 8d. in respect of the Australian leaf without a compensating increase of 4d. in respect of the imported leaf, is that a private memsmoker.

I seldom trouble the patience of honourable members, and I intend to have my say until I am stopped by the Chairman, or am gagged. If we carefully analyse the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Country party, we find that it scrupulously safeguards the revenue by means of a sliding scale which can be amended or altered to suit the requirements of the Government, so long as the general principle is preserved, namely, the margin between the excise rates on Australian and imported tobacco. We are prepared to accept a scale worked out by the Government or its officers that will achieve the same financial results as the present rates of duty. The principle involved is that we should give preference to this Australian product, and we have put forward a proposal that, while not interfering with the revenue, will give to the industry a greater share of the Australian market, so that it will be able to expand and absorb a greater number of people. The acceptance of our proposal would be a definite move in the direction of reducbecause we have had. tbe courage to state ing the cost of Australian-grown tobacco to the consumers. No one can object to that. Every time we suggest a reduction of the tariff we are told that to do so would interfere with an Australian industry. Here we have an opportunity to reduce the excise duty on an Australian proharm whatever. The same difficulty does not arise in this case as when we were discussing the duties on glass. We were then dealing with the product of a nation which is an especially good customer of Australia, and with which we have a favorable trade balance of between Â£6,000,000 and Â£7,000,000 a year. Belgium is a country we cannot afford to offend. In the'case of tobacco, however, we have an opportunity seldom presented to us. We may do something to assist an Australian primary industry without suffering any loss of revenue, and do so at the expense of a country with which we have every year a heavy adverse trade balance. The United States of America is one of the few foreign countries with which we trade that sells to us more than we buy from her, our adverse trade balance running into several millions of pounds.

If a choice must be made, I should prefer tobacco grown by Chinese or black labour in Australia to that grown by such labour iu America. I also object to the action of the Minister in exhibiting in this chamber inferior samples of tobacco, the implication being that they furnished an idea of what the whole Australian crop was like. There is no primary industry that does not produce a fairly large proportion of inferior commodities. It would be possible for any Minister or member of this Parliament to produce a bad sample of any crop grown in Australia, and, using it as an argument, mislead the public and members of this committee. I do not believe, in view of the attitude taken up by honourable members opposite, that the amendment will be carried, but it represents an ""honest attempt on the part of the Country party to put before the committee a proposal which is not based on party considerations. It has been put forward with one object in view, namely, to give increased preference to an Australian product, with a view to developing the industry at the expense of a foreign country with which we have had, year after year, an adverse trade balance.

[1.37 a.m.] -I'move That the item be amended by adding the following new sub-item: ""And on and after 25th May, 1933(BA) Tobacco manufactured wholly from Australian leaf, per lb., 3s. Gd."". The effect of the amendment, if agreed to, would be to exclude from any reduction of excise duty all brands of tobacco which are not made solely of Australian leaf. The previous amendments with which the committee has dealt referred to all the Australian tobacco on the market to-day; my amendment is in tended to apply only to those brands of tobacco which are 100 per cent, of Australian leaf. There are not many such brands on the market; probably the only purely Australian tobacco now offered for sale is the Mareeba'brand. r brands.

It does not, however, go f a r enough: it does not grant the industry the assistance it needs immediately. From my conversations w i th officers of the Customs Department, I feel confident that a way could be found to meet the difficulties which have been mentioned during this debate. If accepted, the amendment would not have any immediate or great effect on the revenue. Later, when the manufacturers of tobacco were producing brands containing . 100 per cent.

Anything that we can do to popularize Australian tobacco will be of benefit to the industry. assist the industry slowly but surely. Its great advantages are its simplicity, and the fact that there would be no immediate loss of revenue. By accepting the amendment, the Government would give evidence of its desire to help this important Australian industry. ""With those who conlend lhat it is not practicable to put on the market tobacco and cigarettes made wholly of Australian leaf, I disagree, for 1 have seen excellent cigarettes made solely of Texas tobacco. Australia can produce its own requirements of both tobacco and cigarettes. I appeal to the Minister to accept this, my last proposal, to the Government. There is no bite in it. WhatI ask for is little in itself, but its acceptance by the Government would be some evidence of a desire to assist this Australian industry. I do not know what objection the Minister can raise to my amendment, but I daresay that he will oppose it. He referred to my previous remarks concerning Tamworth tobacco, and even went to the trouble of obtaining samples to disprove my statement that one particular sample had been selected. One sample was certainly bad, and it seemed as though it had been chosen on that account. The other samples, although not good, were not bad tobacco. One sample was certainly green, but it might surprise honourable members to know that if that tobacco were left in the barn for twelve months it would change to a different colour altogether. The manufacturers buy green tobacco and store it until it changes colour; there is no need for some honourable members to be shocked just because one particular sample looks green. I have seen infinitely worse samples of tobacco in all the tobacco-growing districts of Australia, tralasian Tobacco Company, and Messrs. including those in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. The samples produced convey absolutely nothing. As the Minister has questioned my motive in attacking Mr Marks' report, I should like to remind him that I stated in my speech that I questioned, not the bona fides of that gentleman, but the methods adopted by him in compiling the report which he presented to Parliament, and which contained a damning indictment of the tobacco grown in the Tamworth district. Mr Marks did not mention in his report that out of 1,000 tons of leaf My proposal would grown in the district 600 tons produced by white labour were sold last year at an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb., and tliat for the past 40 years the manufacturers have been buying that class of leaf and manufacturing it into tobacco for consumption in Australia. It is only now that some honourable members have become horror-stricken because of the emplpyment in the industry of Chinese, many of whom have been living in this country for 50 years. The proportion of Chinese to white people employed in the industry throughout Australia is only one per cent. The Minister has been caustic in his remarks concerning my attitude on this matter, but I have received from a tobacep-grower at Scone a letter in which he informs me that the inspector who made an analysis of the tobacco grown in that district did not inspect the tobacco at all, although the growers invited him to do so. He merely took samples and presented to this Parliament a report to the effect that he had made a careful analysis of 52 tons of tobacco grown in that district. That surely is conclusive proof that he did not carry out his work properly. Trade and Customs) [1.50 a.m.] -The honourable member's amendment is based on mere guess work, because be cannot state what .revenue would be lost if it were accepted, although he has had time to collect some figures on the subject. He 'has said that he had this proposal in mind yearsago and that not much tobacco wholly of Australian leaf is manufactured in this country."" Let me inform him that, in addition to Mareeba tobacco, the British-AusDudgeon and Arnell are manufacturing an entirely Australian product. The honourable member admitted that the amendment, if accepted, would not be of much assistance to the Australian industry, but he suggested that it might serve as a gesture. We cannot make too many gestures when each involves a considerable loss of revenue. I have no wish to refer further to the tobacco grown in the Tamworth district. The expert made a complete list of the growers whom",85,Pairs
338,Mr White (Balaclava,"Minister forlie visited in the Scone district. He obtained samples of 95 per cent, of the tobacco grown, and I am .^prepared to accept his statement. In conclusion let me say that the Government is aware that splendid tobacco is being produced by Australian growers in spite of hardships, pests and little instruction, and ditions. duced not only in Queensland, but also in other parts of the Commonwealth, particularly in Victoria, and if the growers w ill study cultivation methods there is no doubt that they w ill obtain good crops and be able to sell it .

352,"Ward, E. J. "" Mr Thorby (Calare)' [2.20 A.m.]","ter and Treasurer) [2.21 a.m.] I hope that the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) will not press his amendment. Three carefully selected men could probably do the work of the commission as wall as five could do it ; but if the personnel were limited to three, the field for the selection of commissioners would be unduly restricted. It is not intended to appoint the memhors of the commission as representatives of particular States. I am sure, however, that the smaller States will expect to be represented on the commission, and the appointment of five members would enable satisfactory representation to be given to both the small and the large States. The Cabinet gave careful consideration to the question of whether there should be three or five members, and, for the reason that I have stated, decided upon five. hope that the amendment will be accepted. A number of members have expressed objection to. the appointment of a commission consisting of five members, and I shall be much surprised if they do not record a vote consistent with their speeches on the second reading of the bill. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in his speech on the second reading of the measure, remarked that if the members of the commission were chosen from the smaller States, they would have their State prejudices, and now he suggests that those States will be directly represented. I pointed out that, no matter from what State the members of the commission came, they would have prejudices. One honourable member stated that the three States that were appealing for assistance from the Commonwealth were mendicant States. that I moved to the second reading of the bill had been carried, the commission would have consisted of three members, and the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts was that three men could do the work. The present Government seems to imagine that the payment of Â£5 5s. a day to each member of the commission, for as many days as the members choose -to sit, is a matter of no concern to the people generally. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has admitted that three men can do the work that has to be done.

I support the amendment. The reasons given by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) in favour of the appointment of five members were not convincing. The right honourable gentleman admitted that three members could make the investigation, but he added that a wider representation was desirable. It would be a grave mistake for us to agree to the appointment of members of this commission on the understanding that they would represent certain sections or interests. One argument that was stressed by the Government in introducing the bill for the appointment of this commission-and , in passing, may I say that I am not enamoured of the proposal, and hope that it is not merely the first of a number of proposals for the appointment of commissions and boards-wa s that it was desired to make the commission as nearly as possible a judicial body which would be independent of Parliament and political influence. It was desired, we were told, that the commission should examine the facts, sift the evidence, and bring an unprejudiced leport to Parliament. This will not be possible if the members of the commission are appointed to represent certain interests. Three men can make the necessary inquiries probably better than five men can make them.

If Ave had a committee of three, comprising a Supreme Court Judge, an expert accountant, and an economist, we could expect an impartial recommendation within a reasonable space of time. There have been numerous inquiries into the disabilities of the States under federation; Tasmania, South Australia and ""Western Australia have all had their inquiries, and I assume the proposed inquiry w ill resolve itself into a verification and tabulation of information already available. In the circumstances, it would be an excessive expenditure to appoint a commission of five members, the chairman of which would receive a salary of Â£300 a year and other members would get Â£200 a year, as well as Â£5 5s. a day sitting fees, and travelling allowances. and Treasurer) [2.37 a.m.] -The desire ensure continuity of service in the of the Government is to ensure the appointinterests of the States.

We shall have another general election in about eighteen months time, and one never knows what changes may take place. If the period of five years were accepted, it would cover the greater portiou of the next government's term of office. I suggest that it would be advisable to appoint the commission for three years. If a constitutional convention were established, and it dealt with some of the problems of State disabilities, it might not be necessary to have the Commonwealth Grants Commission functioning for five years. If the Fenton) altered his amendment to read "" three "" instead of "" five "" years, it would have my wholehearted support, and would probably be acceptable to the Government. no likelihood of my amendment being accepted by the Government, I am prepared to withdraw it, and substitute another providing for a period of three years. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [2.48 a.m.] I am pleased that the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has signified his readiness to withdraw his amendment, and substitute another which will make the life of the commission three years. I do not think that it will take that body three years to come to a determnation, but it is desirable that that period should be specified, in order to give the commission security of tenure. After reviewing the many reports that have been submitted by commissions, the Public Accounts Committee, and other bodies, as to the disabilities suffered by certain States as a result of federation, I have formed the opinion that the subject has been exhaustively dealt with, and that it would not take five years for another commission to arrive at a determination. The chief task of the commission would be to knit together the loose ends left by other bodies, and deal particularly with disabilities resulting from the operations of the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act and of the tariff. I would support an amendment providing for a three-year period, because that would give security of .tenure to the commissioners. the committee that the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) shall have leave to amend his amendment?

407,Mr Lyons,"The position isup a commission that will enjoy the confidence and respect, not only of the States, but of the Commonwealth as well. I ask the committee to allow the fees to stand as they are, so that the Government may appoint men who will not travel merely for the sake of collecting fees, and who will sit just long enough to carry out the work as it should be done. We have heard some remarkable arguments regarding the terms and conditions of appointment of the members of this commission. We have been accused of cheese paring because we have sought to cut down the fees payable to these men, but it is not the first time this Parliament has practised cheese paring, and in matters of greater importance than this. Then we have been told that the appointees must have security of tenure. The honourable member who expressed this view told us that the work of the commission may be completed in twelve months, yet they are to be given security of tenure for three years. If they are given a tenure of three years, they will be paid for that period. While human nature remains what it is, we may be as careful as we like about whom we appoint to the commission, but once appointed, the members will take their own time about the job and tbe Government will have no power over them or their expenses. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said that the provisions of the Financial .Emergency Act will apply to their remuneration and travelling expenses, but there may be difficulties in that regard. At any rate, any deductions made under that act can easily be compensated for by the commission itself in the manner in which it does its work. In my opinion, the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) provides for the payment of ample compensation. General) [3.8 a.m.] -The honourable member who has just spoken is under a misapprehension with regard to what is meant by security of tenure. This proposal has. been introduced very largely to meet the desires of the Governments of the States. Those Governments desire the appointment of a body of real standing and capacity which will have security iu this sense-that it will continue to hold office independent of the Government of the day. The States have asked for what they have described as a permanent body, which will not be removable even if it brings in a report that does not meet with the approval of the Federal Government of the day. The subsequent clauses of the bill provide that security of tenure. On the subject of the amount of the fees, I am somewhat afraid that if the proposal outlined in the amendment is adopted, the commission will become almost a thing of contempt. We do want it to have a standing in the community, and we hope that we shall be able to find men who have special qualifications for the task. We can hardly ask them to do highly responsible work dealing witb sums of great magnitude, and with issues of profound importance, for fees smaller than those proposed. a.m.] I heartily support the bill as it stands, and I believe that members of the commission should receive sitting fees of Â£5 5s. a day. The smaller States have been looking forward to the appointment of this commission for years, and they expect most important results from it. If the fees are cut down, so that men of real worth cannot be induced to serve on the commission, we may as well send a couple of navvies to Western Australia to inquire into its disabilities. This commission is going to have power over governments which apply to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance. Tbe commission will be authorized to inquire into the financial position of States; applying for assistance, and the methods of their administration. Ef the States are to receive a fair deal, letus appoint a real commission to do the work. support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway). The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) said that the bill proposed to provide security of tenure for the members of the commissiion.

Therefore, the matter of security of tenure is of no importance, would do so; but this bill empowers them because the incoming Parliament can dissolve the commission, and appoint whom it likes. The bill provides for the payment of a retainer of Â£300 to the chairman, and retainers of Â£200 each to the other members of the commission. the correct one in the circumstances, because, even if the commission does not sit for one hour during the whole period of its existence the retainers are to be paid to the chairman and the members for three years. That such payments might be limited to a period of three years is not clue to the Government, which desired the term to be for five years, even though, during that time, no service whatever need necessarily be rening fee, free fares and travelling expenses, dered. As I have said, the chairman is to receive Â£300 a year, and the other members of the commission Â£200 a year, and whether the sitting fees be Â£3 3s. or Â£5 5s. a day members of the commission will receive full expenses. In this case, ment would go into the market and pick expenses are not restricted merely to steamer and train fares, for which tickets or vouchers are issued by tbe Government. The term "" expenses"" covers amounts which are to be paid to the members of the commission so long as they hold office. appointment to this commission would be Clause 15 empowers the Governor General to make regulations prescribing all matters which by this measure are required or permitted to be prescribed, so that it will he seen that this Parliament has no control over the amounts which may be paid to the members of the commission. I do not suggest that their expenses will amount to a huge sum; they will probably be similar to the expenses paid to high public officials in Australia-betwee n Â£2 2s. and Â£3 3s. a day. The position therefore is that, in addition to retaining fees of Â£300 or Â£200 per annum, the members of the commission will have their fares paid, and will be paid between Â£2 2s. and Â£3 3s. a day for expenses, and Â£5 5s. a day for each sitting of the commission which they attend. Por these positions the Government should naturally endeavour to select tbe best persons available, but once it appoints them, it will have no control over them. The members of the commission could, if they so desired, sit 365 clays each year, and draw fees for each sitting day. I do not suggest that they to do so. Only their good conscience would stand in the way. The principle underlying all legislation is restrictive, and in these matters some limit should be fixed. We should not make it open to the members of the commission to draw The word "" retainer"" is Â£5 5s. a day for 365 days a year. emoluments of the members of the commission are to be subject to reduction under the financial emergency legislation passed by this Parliament; nevertheless, wide powers are to be conferred on the commission.

We can take it for granted that the men who would be selected for men of substance, earning their own living, to whom the acceptance of this task would mean a sacrifice. They would have to give up some of the time which otherwise would be devoted to their business or profession, and therefore it is not likely that suitable-men would undertake this work unless assured of reasonable treatment. Even supposing that the commission sat 300 days a year, which they would never do, and drew fees for each sit'ting day, the chairman would receive only Â£1,500, and each of the other two members Â£1,400 a year. Having regard to the judicial nature of the work which they will be called upon to perform, such remuneration would not equal that which many business men receive for less onerous duties. Such salaries, moreover, are low compared with those paid to some public servants carrying out less important duties. Even if they worked full time, the members",95,Speaker Hon.

The honourable member for Denison( Mr ment to the commission.

As a member of the Navigation Commission, I found that the number of sitting days compared with the number of travelling days was relatively small. I had the same experience as a member of the Iron Bounties Commission. appoint to this commission men of wide experience and knowledge, who, as the honourable member for Denison has suggested, will be prepared to make some sacrifices in respect of their own business who are members .of them wisely meet in order to serve their country. What would be the position of a leading accounmuch as possible the interruption of their tant of Australia if he were appointed to the commission? largely of a personal nature, there would, -during periods of travelling, be every likelihood of loss of business, say, in connection with large estates, for which his remuneration as a member of the commission would not by any means compensate. The same thing applies to professional men. If this commission is to posed of men of considerable attainment and experience, and in whom the comThe members munity has confidence. In view of the fact that last year we voted Â£1,830,000 for the relief of the smaller States, any investigation into such large expenditure should be undertaken by men of ability so as to ensure that justice is done both to the Commonwealth and to the States concerned. In view "" of the services required from the members of the commission, I consider that the allowance is modest. [3.33 a.m.] -The committee has largely misunderstood the reasons which actuated me in moving the amendment. I agree to a large extent with the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom). It is essential that we should appoint to the commission the best men available-me n who are imbued with a spirit of patriotism and are prepared, at personal inconvenience, to investigate this difficult problem. The retaining fee should not be the incentive for appointto appoint men who were in need of work, I should not contend that the remuneration provided in the bill was excessive. I understood that the Government wished to appoint to the commission public spirited men who would gladly give their services because of their patriotism, and not because of the remuneration offering. Any one who accepts a position on the We should commission should not be out of pocket because of the work he performs as a member of it. I know something about public committees of different descriptions. Those one another's convenience and avoid as private business affairs.

I am certain that they will not sit anything like 300 days in a year; probably the number will not exceed 50; but. no matter how _ few it may be, they will be paid the retainer provided. Three guineas a day, with reasonable travelling expenses, will be sufficient to make possible the securing of the best men. I do not fear, as the Prime Minister does, that the best men will not be secured unless the fee is five guineas a day. Those who accept the positions will be public-spirited men, and they may expect to derive some personal advantage from the fact that they have received the appointment. Many legislative councillors in Victoria and other States do not receive Â£300 a year or expenses. They are public-spirited men who want to take a part in the country's affairs.

441,Mr Latham,"That must be left to the-This clause and the two which follow relate to the procedure to be adopted by the commission. Isi t intended that'the commission shall take evidence only on oath? It seems to me that in inquiries of this kind a discretion should lie in the commission to inform its mind by other means if it so desires. I suggest that a'power of discretion should be pro. vided in the clause. I have had some experience of commissions of this description, and I know that whilst formal evidence is valuable, informal inquiry is often quite as valuable. The members of such commissions are' able to get to closer grip with the subject-matter of their inquiry if they can inform their minds by informal means. Arbitration tribunals frequently have the power to take evidence on oath, but they also have power to make inquiries by any other means they think fit. The members of this commission will need to consult State officials informally. By so doing they will doubtless get to the bottom of certain available, but heart-to-heart talks with aspects of their inquiry much more rapidly than by any other means. The commission will also need to make contact with business men, and business men are, as a rule, reluctant to go into the witness box. Unless the commission is able to approach them by some other means, it may not obtain a good deal of information that it is desirable that it shall obtain. Contact will also need to be made with public bodies, such as chambers of commerce, chambers of manufacture, and primary producers' organizations of one sort or another. I feel, therefore, that it would be wise to give the commission discretionary power to take evidence by other means than .sworn testimony. I hope that the Government will see the wisdom of accepting this suggestion, and that it will not insist that all evidence must be submitted in a strictly formal manner. General) [3.58 a.m.] -The history of penalty for refusing to be sworn or to give past inquiries of this nature shows that evidence shall be Â£500; but it is not a good deal of the so-called evidence has indicated whether that is to be the maxiconsisted, of political speeches. The Gomum or the minimum. vernment feels that this kind of evidence should be excluded. Parliament is the penalty shall not exceed Â£500. This is proper place for the expression of covered by the Acts Interpretation Act. opinions of that nature. All evidence should be submitted to this commission with a full sense of responsibility and a due regard to accuracy. It is not provided that the strict laws of evidence, whicli apply in.a court of justice, shall apply to the proceedings of this commission. Evidence which would be inadmissible in a court of justice will be admissible before this commission. It is felt, however, that all evidence should be given on oath or affirmation. There will, of course, be opportunity for advocacy as well as for evidence. A distinction is drawn between advocacy and evidence in arbitration court proceedings, though sometimes it is not drawn as strictly as I think it should be drawn. The intention of the Government is that the evidence on which the recommendations of this commission is based shall be available to the Parliament and Government, to guide them in dealing with any legislation which may arise out of the reports of the commission. Sworn evidence will be members of chambers of manufacture and chambers of commerce would not be available. the bill preclude the commission from obtaining information in the m'anner I have indicated? commission will naturally, as ordinary human beings, inform their minds by reading articles, budget papers, and the like, but all evidence will be taken on oath or affirmation. There is something to be said for both methods, of course; -but the Government considers that the wiser method has been adopted in the bill Clause agreed to. Clause 11 agreed to.

447,Mr Latham,"It means that theto toe gained by fixing a penalty if there drafted by me. But I would point out is no alternative? I can visualize people being fined under this provision, and having no money to pay the fine. will see that the next clause provides a penalty of imprisonment for five years for the giving of false testimony. It is thought that a pecuniary penalty is appropriate for the offences dealt with under clause 12, but that a penalty of imprisonment is desirable as an alternative in respect of persons who give false testimony. take the same point that was raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), namely, that the penalty of Â£500 provided in this clause is unnecessarily severe. The Crimes Act provides, in certain sections, for maximum penalties, and I understand there is similar provision in acts passed by most of the State Parliaments, as well as in the Queensland criminal code. I , therefore, suggest the advisability of stipulating in this, and in all future acts provided, there may be a pecuniary passed by this Parliament, the maximum penalty provided foi any offence against 1 the law. I realize that the Attorney General's answer will be that the penalty fixed is in practice, the maximum penalty; but I would remind him that, Justices of the Peace who are not always well informed of the law, may not be aware of this. This difficulty will not arise to. such a degree in Queensland, because in the larger towns of that State Justices of the Peace arc not allowed to sit on the bench, cases which, in other States are determined by Justices of the Peace being decided by police magistrates. Unless we state definitely what is to be the maximum penalty, I fear there will be risk of injustice being done. I consider also that a penalty of Â£100 would be ample. General) [4.9 a.m.] -If we were engaged .in a general consolidation of the acts of this Parliament, which I should very much like to see undertaken, I should 'be inclined to adopt the suggestion of the honourable .member for Oxley( Mr Baker) because I have often been subjected to criticism in respect of the penalties provided in measures that, if an alteration were made in this bill, and if the other acts that have been passed in the 33 years of the life of the Commonwealth Parliament were left in their present form, the risk of misunderstanding, to which the honourable member has alluded, would be very much greater. The matter to which he has referred could only be dealt with in a general consolidation of Commonwealth acts. As to the penalty, it is entirely within the discretion of the court what amount shall be imposed. If there is evidence of an aggravated offence the punishment ought to be severe. This matter may safely be left to the discretion of the court. It is conceivable that cases might arise in which the offence would warrant a heavier penalty than Â£100 as suggested by the honourable member. to a pecuniary penalty? tive, but in cases where imprisonment is penalty in.lieu thereof, as the court thinks proper.

I suggest that when the Government receives a report from these commissioners to whom high salaries will be paid, Parliament should have the advantage of seeing it . Surely that is not too much to ask? If the Government insists upon rejecting my proposal I can only conclude that it has a reason for concealing reports. General) [4.20' a.m.] -Certain bodies report to Parliament; others to the Governor General: this commission comes within the latter category. Actually few reports are submitted to Parliament, that of the Auditor -General being one. to-day from the Royal Commission on Performing Rights was laid on the table as soon as it was printed. There are some reports which are very important to the public interest, and should not be tabled and become public knowledge unti l the Government has a practical proposal to submit in relation to them. Honourable members who have had experience in a government know that no useful purpose can be served by having reports of acute interest to individuals presented within a limited time, as a matter of course. I admit that, when in Opposition, one naturally has a tendency to claim that everything should be laid on tbe table; but when the matter is regarded from the point of view of the responsibility of the Government of the country, other considerations have to be taken into account. Supj>ose, for example, that a voluminous far-reaching report had been presented within the last 30 sitting days of this Parliament. Though the honourable member might not believe it , I assure h i m that it would have been absolutely impossible for the Treasurer or any other Minister to give it his attention, and no useful purpose would have been served by tabling it. Indeed, had such a report been tabled before the Government had an opportunity to develop its Otherwise, though, it proposals it would have led to trouble in : all directions. Of course such a practice would afford opportunity for political agitation, but from the practical point of view of assisting the Government of the country, the proposals embodied in the bill are the wisest.

Green) in regard to office expenses and rental costs of the Australian Broadcasting Company and the Australian Broadeasting Commission. Mr. FRANCIS -Inquiries will be made and a reply will be furnished as soon as possible to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) in regard to the quantity of surplus or disused m i l i tary or naval clothing made available to State Governments for the use of the unemployed. On the :19th .'May, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) asked that portion of the available surplus naval clothing be issued to the exnaval members group in Williamstown, Victoria, where families of ex-naval men are in difficult circumstances. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that the stocks of naval and military clothing or material held by the Defence Department and regarded as surplus to its requirements were made available, and distributed for the relief of those in distressed circumstances some time ago. The only clothing which w i ll he available for issue from the Defenco Department in future, will be condemned part-worn articles no longer serviceable for service purposes, but the quantities aro small. As regards unserviceable naval clothing, it has been found most convenient to deliver it to the Premier's Department in each Statef o r distribution to persons in need of relief. It is suggested that application by ex-naval men at Williamstown be made to the Premier's Department, Melbourne.",106,Summary
