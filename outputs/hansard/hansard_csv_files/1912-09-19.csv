FROM * OF Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply-pro posed. gret that, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, the exigencies of public business were such that it became necessary, so early in the session, to pass a motion which practically placed business in the names of private members on the shelf. It was because of that action I realized that I should not have the opportunity of dealing wi*h a motion which had appeared in my name on the paper for a considerable time; and, therefore, I take thi$ opportunity of bringing its subject-matter under the notice of honourable members. It was my intention to have moved, on the 3rd OctoberThat, as the Honourable Josiah Thomas (then Postmaster-General) on 15th December, 1910, promised the officers to submit certain questions relating to the rights of South Australian transferred officers for settlement by arbitration on the grounds of equity only, and as, subsequently, the Attorney-General discovered that the then state of the law compelled the Government to withdraw such promise, and also, in view of tbe heavy costs of actions before the Arbitration Court and the grave doubt as to its untrammelled jurisdiction in matters of the accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers, this House directs that the three quesmasters' "" emoluments,"" "" increments,"" and "" age retirement,"" be referred for settlement on the merits to a representative of the Government and representatives of the officers of tlie South Australian Post and Telegraph Service. Although, presumably, there is no chance of my obtaining a vote on this important motion, I do hope that the Government will see their way to meet tbe wishes of a large body of men and women in South Australia who unanimously consider that an injustice has been done to them. This (Formal). is not a question which merely affects* this Government. It is one whicli involves the honour of this Parliament I am going to ask the House whether it is practically a contract entered into in the name of the people of Australia with the remarks will apply equally to officers of FOR NON-ATTENDANCE AT stance, as the Department of Trade and had their rights preserved; but, for the POST OFFICE : sake of convenience and conciseness, I shall confine°myself this afternoon to a statement of the case, as I understand it, on behalf of the Post and Telegraph Association of South Australia. I shall endeavour to show that, intentionally or not, by accident or design, something approaching a confidence trick has been perpetrated on a large body of men and women who, under State control, gave enthusiastic and loyal service to the Crown, as the result of which, an undertaking was given that their positions would not be worse, but rather better, when they came under the control of the Federal",16,Independent Cable Service

39,That That Was Not Ina Mr Mccay,"I s not this provision practicallySir William Lyne, however, desired to emphasize the provision, and he saidI t will show to the public servants that we are not unmindful of their rights, and of the way we are directed by the Commonwealth Act to deal with them. That pledge made in this Chamber imposes an obligation on this Parliament to-day. I do not know what public servants in other States were promised when the public were invited to vote "" Yes"" for Federation, but I do know that in South Australia from the public platform, as well as in the press, State servants who were likely to be taken over by the Federation were distinctly promised that their existing position would be improved in the Federal Service. On 18th May, 1899, Messrs. C. C. Kingston, then Premier, and Holder, then Treasurer, of South Australia, addressed a meeting convened by the South Australian Public Service Association for the purpose of giving civil servants an opportunity of hearing their views on the Commonwealth Bill. They said that public servants would lose nothing by Federation; the rights of transferred officers were amply preserved under the Constitution. On the contrary, said Messrs. Kingston and Holder, they thought the probabilities were that the public servants would gain by the transfer. Public servants, they declared, had everything to hope for, and nothing to fear from Federation. But the experience of a large body of men and women in South Australia is that that promise has not been fulfilled, and the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, which comprises a large body of officers, set out their claims as follows:"" ( i ) T h a t the Federal Convention intended that no transferred officer should be worse off under Federal control than he was under State control, and enacted section 84 to insure that intention being carried into effect. felt bound by section 84 to respect the rights of transferred officers, hence section 60, Commonwealth Public Service Act. Lyne's speech in moving second reading-Fede ral Hansard, Session 1901-2, page 1084; also see -Quick and Garran's Commentaries on Constitution, page 818, and pages 656-661.). High Court in Cousens v. t h e Commonwealth ruled that officers did take over with them rights -suc h as the right to a certain salary-in their transfer from the State, but that the Federal Parliament was a competent authority to vary or abolish such rights. vice Commissioner, finding himself clothed with all the powers of Parliament in respect of Service matters, exercised the power claimed for the Parliament by the High Court in the Cousens case, without regard to the moral obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by the tacit agreement between the Convention and the Service (vide section 84), and in disregard of the direction given him in section 6o, Commonwealth Public Service Act, by the First Federal Parliament. (5) That this action of the Commissioner, under the circumstances, amounted to an abuse of power, and, though his action by virtue of the powers conferred upon him by the Public Service Act has the force of law, it was an unjust and oppressive action, and a distinct repudiation of the Commonwealth's obligations towards its servants. (6) That the law, apart from the Commissioner's action, did not forbid, but clearly contemplated, the continuance, until their natural expiration, of the accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers. (7) That, in view of the Attorney-General's statement that the Commissioner would not have been acting unconstitutionally had he, in his classification, recognised and provided for the accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers, the matters in dispute should, by direction of Parliament, be settled by arbitration on the grounds of equity without involving the officers in the heavy costs of a suit before the High Court or the Arbitration Court."" The Federal Attorney-General, in a letter dated 26th February, 1911, addressed to the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, saidIn making the first classification of the Clerical Division, I know of nothing in the Public Service Act which prevents the Commissioner from recommending that any officer be placed in any class or subdivision which he thinks appropriate-whethe r that involves an increase or a diminution in the salary and emoluments previously received by the officer. That clearly shows that, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, there was nothing to prevent the Public Service Commissioner from recognising the claims of his officers, and the promise contained in the Constitution, which promise was also made on behalf of the Government of the day by Sir William Lyne. The following is a copy of a letter sent to the Postmaster-General, (2) That the first Federal Parliament Melbourne, on behalf of the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, and (See Sir William as it contains their case in a very short compass, I wish to submit it to the House. Copy of letter to Postmaster-General, Melbourne, dated Adelaide, 7th December, i g n , from (3) The South Australian Post and Telegraph Association. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., and beg to thank you for same, and for minutes of deputation. (4) That the Public SerThe managing committee of this association desires us to express its great regret that you are unable to meet the wishes of the South Australian officers with regard to the requests placed before the Prime Minister in a memorandum of the 14th October. The committee had hoped that the principles involved in the "" accrued and accruing rights"" questions, and also in the claims of the South Australian postmistresses to be placed on the same footing with postmistresses occupying similar offices in New Soutb Wales and Tasmania, would have appealed to the sympathies of your Government. association is most reluctant to believe that tbe present Government, by adopting a negative attitude in regard to the flagrant injustices inflicted upon South Australian transferred officers by the Commissioner at the time of classification, endorses the repudiation of the moral obligation imposed upon the Commonwealth by clause 84 of the Constitution, and recognised by the Federal Parliament in clause 60 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. it seem possible that the Commissioner's demand that the postmistresses shall accept a degradation in status as a condition precedent to receiving a small increase of salary, can have the approval of a Labour Ministry. how keenly the postmistresses feel the slight cast upon them by the Commissioner, I beg to quote the text of a letter from a postmistress declining the Commissioner's offer"" In reply to your letter received on the 22nd instant, I note your acknowledgment that an increase to my salary is possible, but I must respectfully decline the alteration of my designation and subsequent degradation from the Clerical to the General Division. such indignity, and I feel I should be wanting in self-respect if I accepted it . "" Most of the postmistresses have indicated tbeir intention not to accept the increased salary with such a condition, and my committee respectfully but strongly urges that increases should be given and their present designations retained. Frominquiries made, we gather that it is doubtful whether the accrued and accruing rights questions come within the scope of the Public Service Arbitration Bill now before the Federal Parliament. these matters, however, they appear to be prejudged by the provision that awards may be disallowed by Parliament if they conflict with the Commonwealth law or regulations. With regard to the legal position stated to us by the Honourable the Attorney-General, _ MrA l l at once the position changed. The Cousens Hughes was good enough to advance the opinion in a letter of 22nd Februarv, that, had the Commissioner granted the claims of transferred officers in his classification, he would not have acted contrary to law. It is clear to us, therefore, that it was an act of the Commissioneras a deputy of Parliament-whic h raised the legal difficulties spoken of by the Honourable the Attorney-General, and not any express act or intention of the Legislature. Our committee would be glad to know if your letter of the ,14th November must be regarded as final reply of the Government to the association's requests, contained in memorandum of the r4th October, to the Prime Minister. whether it will be competent to submit the questions of ""accrued and accruing rights"" to the Arbitration Court under the proposed Act, and which of tbe matters mentioned by us are covered by the proposed, amendments to the Public Service Act, vide paragraph 4 in your letter. The only reply to that letter was to theeffect that the Postmaster-General thought, these accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers could be dealt with by. the Arbitration Court, -"" Mr Gordon. but the Court itself would decide what matters were within its jurisdiction. Indeed, the Those matters to which I am referring are not new to the present Postmaster-General, or his predecessor. The grievances have been felt for a considerable time, and are causing discontent, more or less, throughout the Department, which has given, and is prepared to give in the future, loyal service to the public. So impressed was the Nor does predecessor of the present Postmaster General with the facts brought before him that he made a distinct promise to this Association in Adelaide. The following are To indicate extracts taken from an official report of a deputation to the then Postmaster-General, the present Minister of External Affairs, on the 15th December, 1910Mr Macdonald said that when the Constitution was being prepared the position of the transferred officers was considered to be an important one in the opinion of the Convention. . . . Mr Trenwith had said that unless the rights oi the transferred officers were protected, a large I have done nothing to deserve number of the community might be induced to vote against Federation in defence of their own rights and their living, and in defence of justice. That was practically the keynote of the matter in connection with the rights of transferred officers. The Postmaster-General said that if that was the point, they would see that, in view of all that had taken place in the past, it was rather a difficult thing for the Government to say that it would pay these emoluments, but he would promise that if the officers would suggest a If the Court has jurisdiction on friendly suit to meet the case, the Government would do all it could to meet them. Mr Lucy said that Mr Glynn, M.P., hatt suggested such a course, but the Government said ""no."" Mr Glynn said he had had the utmost difficulty in getting any information whatever. case came before the High Court, and Mr Glynn advised them not to go on with a case in the face of the Cousens case, as the expenses would be heavy if tbey lost. The Postmaster-General said he did not want anything of that kind, or to put them to any expense. Mr Macdonald said that before any decision was arrived at as to the suit, he would like to know whether it would be a question of equity or law. The Postmaster-General said he would like them to have some one who would be mutually Also agreed upon as arbitrator. If they agreed to a Judge, they would endeavour to get one. There should be no difficulty in getting aa arbitrator in the matter. Mr Macdonald said they would have to submit the proposal to the Association, but he thought the wisdom of the suggestion would commend itself, to the officers. He thanked the Minister fo-r the proposal. Would the matter of increased payment (really the matter of increments) also be submitted to arbitration? -The Postmaster-General -Yes. That 'could be considered..",18,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not
40,Mr Lucy,"Arbitratio n or law?Mr Roberts asked as to legal expenses, and the right of officers to be present to state their case and to give evidence. The Postmaster-General said, if possible, he would like to bave no lawyers in the case, and to decide the matter on equity. They wanted to see justice done, and the men could, of course, get away. He presumed it was quite clear that this arbitration referred only to transferred officers. At a later stage the said. . . . He was very pleased to meet the representatives, and to have a talk with them. He could only say that, so far as the first matter was concerned (that of the postmasters' emoluments), they could have this friendly suit. Mr Mr Hiscock. . . . Batchelor, M.P., would be acting for him for a. fortnight, during which he ( Mr Thomas) would be away, and they could make arrangements with him as far as arbitration was concerned. They could rely on him to deal with the matter. emoluments, increments, and age of retirement. The Postmaster»-General replied that he had not said anything about the last, but it could be inserted. Mr Virgo asked whether the arbitration referred to all State rights? The Postmaster-General said that what he had stated was that it referred to those who had these emoluments prior to Federation, and had bad them taken away. Mr Hiscock said the question of their right to remain in the service beyond the age of 65 was a State right. The Postmaster-General said that was not raised at the time. Apparently, there was no age limit at the time of Federation. Mr Hiscock said there was a clause in the Act which permitted an oflicer to remain indefinitely if competent. The Postmaster-General said that after Federation the State had made the retiring age 70. But he had no objection to submitting the point to arbitration. The following is an extract from the report of the deputation to the then Postmaster-General at Adelaide, on the 4th January, 1911Mr Lucy asked the Minister whether he would Acquiesce in the nomination of Mr Commissioner Russell as arbitrator in connection with the questions to be submitted to arbitration, as agreed upon at the deputation of 15th December, or whether he would prefer Mr Justice Higgins? The Minister said he had seen Mr Batchelor (Minister for External Affairs), who had been dealing with the matter in his absence. He felt it would be a little inadvisable to bave Mr you can deal with him. As far as the GovernRussell, and he preferred, and felt sure the Government would prefer, the nomination of Mr Justice Higgins. On the 14th January, 1911, the following telegram was sent to Mr E. R. Lucy, President of the South Australian Post and Telegraph AssociationI am desired by Postmaster-General to inform you Government agreeable to friendly suit in High Court to decide questions of legal rights in dispute. Every effort be made to minimize costs. Government favours settlement of other than legal questions by arbitration. Details to be arranged by Attorney-General. (Sig.) OXENHAM, Acting Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department. Then we come to another stage of these negotiations as shown in the following exPostmaster-General tract from the report of a deputation from the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association' which waited on the then Postmaster-General in Melbourne on the 17th February, 1911Now, you offered us arbitration on three points when you were in Adelaide-o n the postmasters' emoluments question, on the increment question, and on the question of age retirement. Since you returned to Melbourne, we have had a telegram from you modifying that to some extent. Can you now let us see where we stand with reference to those points? Because, if the questions are to be submitted to arbitration, we need not deal with them now. you to see the ATtorney-General. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government is concerned, we are prepared to submit every question it is possible to arbitration. If , however, there are any questions which cannot constitutionally be submitted to arbitration, then we are willing to have a friendly suit; but, in regard to every question which can be submitted to arbitration, we are willing to submit it. On these matters I would be very glad for you to see the Attorney-General, and deal with him. Everything we can legally and constitutionally submit to arbitration will be submitted. In regard to the other questions, we cannot submit them to arbitration, as it is not in our power to do so. gram does not amount to any modification of your previous unconditional offer, because you remember you said : "" Keep the lawyers out of it. We only want justice."" Dr is not. My wish and the wish of the Government is to have the whole thing settled; a l l , if possible, by arbitration. Where there are constitutional questions which cannot be settled by arbitration, it is impossible for us to say what will be done. But in regard to any point which ,can possibly be referred to arbitration, the Government are quite prepared, willing and anxious to have it referred. We cannot say anything about those questions wbich cannot be referred to arbitration. While you are here, you must see the Attorney-General on these points, and ment is concerned, we are only too anxious, but we cannot go behind the law and the Constitution. As far as I am personally concerned, I am one of those who are against the lawyers every _ time; but, at the same time, we have"" a Constitution, and I am not in a position to say that we can go behind the Constitution.

I take that Constitution to provide that officers transto be the whole tenor of the debate. designed to prevent the officers wbo were to be reduced in status or in salary. That is transferred being unjustly treated or losing anyclearly shown by the debates in the Federal thing under their new employer. way we viewed it, and that is the way we acConvention, and by the provision in the cepted Federation. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL -I quite agree with Parliament, in the Public Service Bill, you, but'would like to point out the difference undertook to preserve all rights of public between a private employee who has a contract with an employer and a public officer who is servants, it being stated on Behalf of the working under a Statute, both being transferred, Government of the day that provisions were is that the one has a contract which is not at all included in the measure to make it quite Mr Gordon. subject to anything except the terms of that contract and its interpretation in a Court of law„ while the other is working under a Statute which can be annulled., modified, or amended by body, that other Legislature, whatever it may be, has the right to take away every privilege every right which he possessed.

That the first Federal",21,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not
45,Mr Macdonald,"-The Federal Convention,",22,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not
46,Mr Macdonald,"Had that view of the casecertain that no trouble could arise with regard to transferred officers. 3. That the classification of the Public Service Commissioner not only did not preserve existing and accruing rights, but actually reduced officers in status and salary, and in respect to the age of retirement. 4. That, recognising the special claims of officers of the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, a promise was given on behalf of the present Government, to refer their claims to an arbitrator-no t the Arbitration Court. 5. That such promise cannot be redeemed by inviting the officers to take their case to when they left the State Service, they enthe Arbitration Court, as the Court would not be likely to make an award retrospective to the date of their claims. If we are to have an efficient Public Service, we must remove all suspicion of grievance or cause for discontent. Officers in South Australia feel deeply that a grave injustice has been done*to them. They are appealing to their employer, the Commonwealth Government, representing the people of Australia, to conwhich he has made out for Ministerial consider their claims, and give them a fair and square deal. The people of this country were invited a few days ago, in eloquent phrases by a Minister of the Crown, to liken Australia to "" the great Temple of Liberty, the corner-stone of whose strongest arch is universal justice, and the Bill of Rights and our matchless Constitution are its solid foundation."" I accept that invitation, and to-day, on behalf of a deserving body of men and women, who are giving loyal service to the Commonwealth, I appeal to the Government and to this Parliament for that measure of justice which our "" matchless Constitution,"" in the words of the Minister, decrees shall be given to these public servants. These men and women, loyal servants of the public as they are, ask for no favour or concession, but they do appeal to this Parliament and to the Government for a fair hearing of their claims, confident that those claims are reasonable, and that justice will eventually be done to them. AlthoughI have not had the opportunity of moving the motion which I had upon the business-paper, and of obtaining from all sections of the House that support which I am sure would have been forthcoming to such a reasonable request, I do sincerely hope that the Postmaster-General will give this matter all the consideration that he possibly can, that he will realize the difficulties which confront the officers in approaching the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that he will see if it is not possible for this country to do bare justice to its servants. We do not want to reduce either the status or the salaries of the men and women who are giving such good service to the Commonwealth. We wish, rather, to remove all feelings of discontent from the ranks of the post and telegraph officials, because we recognise that they are rendering valuable service to the public. We want that service to be not only a loyal but an enthusiastic one, and the only way in whicli we can secure that object is to make these transferred officers feel that, tered one which is prepared to pay them well, to deal justly by them, and to see that the conditions which they enjoyed under the State are fully preserved under the Commonwealth. compliment the honourable member for Boothby upon the clear and convincing case sideration of the claims of transferred officers. As far as my memory serves me, I can bear out his statement that the position of these officers is a matter upon which opinions have been given by Attorneys General upon four or five different occasions. Their opinions related, not merely to the South Australian transferred officers, but also to the transferred officers of Victoria, and of some of the other States. In all cases, I think, the opinions stated that it was competent for this Parliament to interfere with the salaries or privileges of such officers, which were the equivalent of payments, by legislative enactment. I think that was the advice which was given by ex-Senator Drake when he was Attorney General, and also by Sir Josiah Symon. If I remember rightly, Mr Isaacs also expressed the opinion that certain claims made by transferred officers were capable of alteration by this Parliament. But the point is that, though the matters at ^issue are comparatively small in regard to some of the States, they amount to a very substantial sum in the case of the South Australiantransferred officersAs has been mentioned by the honourable member for Boothby, under the classification scheme which was adopted by the Public Service Commissioner, and which became effective on the ist June, 1904, the South Australian' postal and telegraph officers suffered anincidental reduction of their salaries ranging from j£$ to ,£150 per annum. I do not say that the Public Service Commissioner",22,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not
47,Mr Glynn (Angas) [3,"32] I mustwas not obliged by the terms of the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1901 to classify them in such a way that there would be an incidental reduction of their salaries. There may be two opinions upon that Doint. I understand that the present Attorney-General has ventured the opinion that the classification might have been so made that the claims of the transferred officers could have been recognised. But, whether that be so or not, it is competent for this Parliament to so amend our Public Service Act-without referring this matter to the High Court-as to give to those officers who thought that their position would be untouched! by Federation, the salaries which they consider to be their "" accrued"" and "" accruing"" rights, as well as the other privileges which they would have enjoyed if Federation had not been consummated. The South Australian officers say that there are four privileges or rights which they enjoyed under the Public Service Act of that State which have been interfered with by Federation. The first is their right to annual increments bers to recollect that the public servants of of salaries, which would have placed them in a much better position financially than they occupy at the present time. second is their right to extended furlough. The third has reference to the question of retirement. Under the South Australian Public Service Act, they were entitled to remain in the Service as long as they were capable of discharging their duties. 'There was no provision in that Act for their retirement upon reaching the age of sixty-five years. They were also entitled as part of their salaries to an allowance in connection with the sale of stamps and for business done by them in connection with the Savings Banks. When all these amounts are totted up it. will be found that, through wealth Act to do, the Commonwealth being the classification scheme which was framed by the Public Service Commissioner, and adopted by this Parliament, there has been a very substantial reduction in the salaries and privileges which certain of these transstrictly by the legal position. Did not ferred officers enjoyed. When this matter was mentioned about 1903, I remember that Sir George Turner estimated that, in the case of South Australia, about ,£4,000 a year would have covered the whole amount which was then involved. It does seem to rr.e that at that time Parliament would have agreed to any amendment of our Public Service Act which would have made -special, provision for these transferred officers. They did understand that the provision in the Constitution relating to their Ur. Glynn. accrued and accruing rights would have preserved to them, not merely their pensions, but their annual increases as established by the South Australian Public Service Act of 1874. That Act has been respected by the State-I do not think there has been more than one reduction under it since it was passed. In one year, I believe, there was a percentage reduction made in the salaries of the public servants of South Australia, because it was a time of very great financial depression. It is rather significant that the officers whose salaries were made up of annual salaries and allowances were affected under the classification of the Public Service Commissioner, not only by percentage reductions in their salaries, but also in their allowances. They contend that the allowances which have been cut. off by the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1901 were part of their regular salaries, and ought, consequently, to have been preserved to them as an accruing right. But apart altogether from the legal aspect of the matter, I ask honourable memSouth Australia were told, prior to Federation, that if they were transferred to the The Commonwealth, their existing and accruing rights would be respected. What they had in mind was, not merely pension rights, which have been respected, but certain statutory increments of salary. There is no doubt that an Act of Parliament could have altered their position prior to Federation. Hence the High Court decided, in the case of Bond v. The Commonwealth, and, later, in the case of Cousens v. The Commonwealth, thereby endorsing the opinions of Attorneys-General, that whatever a State Act could have done in the way of altering salaries, it was competent for a Commonthe sovereign body to which the State powers in the matter have been transferred. But the question we have to consider is whether it is politic to stand these public servants think that their salaries would be as good, and their increases as regular, after Federation as they were under State control? They were led to think that, not only by what was said in the Convention, but also by what was said by the honourable member for Hume when he introduced the Public Service Bill, and by the fact that section 60 of the Public Service Act practically repeats the words of the Constitution preserving their accrued and accruing rights. The annual Claims of outlay involved in meeting their claims would be comparatively small, and would diminish as the officers concerned leave the Service or die. The proper course would be to bring in an amending Bill permitting the Public Service Commissioner to pay, in addition to the ordinary salaries fixed according to the classification, such an amount as would keep South Australian officers in the position which they would have occupied had the States not federated. I think that is what the suggestion of the honourable member for Boothby amounts to. not think that the Arbitration Court could, under the Act of last year, decide the question of accruing rights. You might refer to a tribunal the question whether, in view of all the circumstances, provision should be made for the case of these transferred ofiicers, but it is competent for Parliament to. deal with the matter without such a reference. You cannot refer to the Arbitration Court, or to any other tribunal except tbe High Court, the question whether, under the Constitution, these officers are entitled, as accrued or accruing rights, to the increments of salary, furlough, allowances, & c , of which they have been deprived by the classification. That is a pure matter of law, which can only be determined by the High Court, and that tribunal has practically decided already that this Parliament has the power to alter the status of officers transferred from the service of the States to that of the Commonwealth. But, considering the way in which the words "" accrued and accruing, rights"" would be interpreted by the man in the street, would it be proper to send the question to the High Court? The proper course is to refer it to a Committee, or to some other body on which proper representation would be given to the officers concerned, or, better still, to deal with it in an amending Bill. I think that if the facts were thus laid before Parliament with the clearness arid convincing logic that the honourable member for Boothby has applied to-day, honourable members would not hesitate to make thesmall provision that would be necessary to realize the just expectation of these officers. As for arbitration proceedings, unless the Government helps the officers to put their case clear of technicalities, they may be defeated. I am doubtful whether they constitute a body that can be an organization within the meaning of the Act.' merits of their case. [19 SEPTEMBER, 1912.] Publio Servants. waive all objections that may be taken to the technical procedure adopted to present the case, which, I think, is one of the demands made by the officers' in their letter to the Attorney-General read this afternoon. If the case is to go before the Arbitration Court, or any other body, I suggest that it should be decided, not on a question of law, but on its pure merits, and that no technical objection should be raised to its adequate presentation. -The question that has been brought under the notice of honourable members affects the honour of this Parliament, and is of great concern to many officers in South Australia. Although the present Postmaster General must meet the case submitted by the honourable member for Boothby, the difficulty is a legacy which was left to this Government by its predecessors, and without wishing to reflect on earlier Parliaments, I say that it is to be regretted that a matter of so much importance was not. settled long ago. I hope that the debate and the inquiry by the Postmaster-General will finally dispose of it. A large body of public servants ought not to be permitted to feel that, although the law is against them, they have a good case in equity. I shall not go over the ground traversed by previous speakers, but shall mention one or two points that have occurred to me. Prior to Federation, the public servants of the States were told that their transference to 3 the Commonwealth Service would not destroy the rights which they enjoyed under State control. In South Australia the principle has been laid down that, whenever a change of conditions is made by the passing of an Act, the status and salaries of existing officers shall be left unimpaired, any alteration affecting only those who were appointed afterwards to the Civil Service. That is a principle which has been recognised by Governments all over the Commonwealth, and I believe outside of Australia, too. In the Convention there was a great amount of tall talk indulged in by those who were advocating the Federation of the Colonies. Very often they must have had their tongues in their cheeks when they were addressing the public, knowing, full, well that a good deal of what they were saying was buncombe, and would not be realized. I do not know whether that was the impression with regard to the rights of civil servants,",23,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not
48,Mr Frazer,"^That will not affect the but. it seems to me .that deception, was.",25,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not

The Constituof judgment or a general muddle all tion, as submitted to the people, was one round. which had been drawn up by lawyers. these men are not lawyers. There was a feeling amongst the people very much in the position of the man in of Australia-unwisely, I think-that was well that lawyers should have the about law, and who is bound to take in settling of a matter of such great imgood faith statements made to him by jx>rtance, as laymen, although all very well those who occupy responsible positions, in their way, knew nothing about such and ought to know the law, and how it questions.

Therefore, it is of no use for dulged in their tall talk fhat a measure the Postmaster-General to tell me that his could be passed by the Commonwealth Par employees can appeal to the High Court, iiament which would break all the probecause that Court has already ruled that mises made to civil servants, and which, their claim is untenable. while annulling their rights in equity, would appeal to still be sound in law. In the face of that what is likely to be the position? it does not seem to me remarkable that, alI take it that if they did appeal the Arbithough leading men had made promises to civil servants that their rights should be protration Court would rule that it had no tected, they passed a measure in this House jurisdiction over matters which arose a knowing that those rights were being taken considerable time prior to its being clothed away.

If the Government will not have been the opinion of fhe Attorneyagree to refer the question in equity to an General who sat by him, for he must have arbitrator of the kind I have suggested it known that his colleague in charge of the would be competent for the Parliament to Bill was allowing the House to draw an adopt his recommendation. I admit that inference which would not be borne out. this grievance is well known to the repreWithout passing any reflection, I hold that sentatives of South Australia, but its in consequence of the error of judgment merits or demerits are not so well known committed by previous Parliaments of the to other members of this House. It would Commonwealth, this grievance of postal take the latter a considerable time to make employees in South Australia should be themselves finalized. It appears to me that for some case. I think reason or other there has been an error Mr Archibald. It should be remembered that They are it the street, who knows absolutely nothing If they the Arbitration Court, The honourable Unfortunately for the postal emmember for Angas has stated that it is Nothing at all. law and equity here, but not so far familiar with the merits of the it would be better settled as I have suggested. I do not know how the Government view my suggestion. may take up this attitude. "" As our predecessors were not disposed to act when the matter was ripe, and as the postal employees have evidently slept over their rights for a considerable time, we are not going to intervene."" ments would be disposed to take that line of action, but I do not know whether it will be taken by the present Government. It would be no reflection upon their dignity to accept the decision of an independent arbitrator, and if the arbitration should go against the postal employees in equity, they would know that they had had a fair inquiry. They would know that the matter had been fairly gone into, and if the proceedings had not worked out as they thought they would, they would have to put up with the situation. In a case of this kind, the supporters of a Government do not care to oppose them when they have taken up a certain line of action, and there are many reasons why such a question cannot be settled on the best principles in an assembly of this kind. The facts show that this is a trouble which the Minister has inherited. A decision has been given, which I hope will be reversed, and an effort made to finally settle the matter. A few days ago I called the attention of the Postmaster-General to this difficulty, which I have had under my attention for some time, and I am very anxious that it should be settled. Unless it is, it will be raised again in the next Parliament, and is bound to be canvassed until the men feel that their grievance has been referred to some equitable tribunal, and that they have had a fair deal. Australians labouring under what they believe to be an injustice are not likely to remain djuiet. I think that these officers will continue to do their duty to the Commonwealth as they have always done. I take no notice of the threats that have been made; but as long as they have a grievance-and a grievance they havethey will find that there are in this Parliament men who are prepared to ventilate it. agitation of this kind to cease, the best thing they can do is to devise a means of finalizing it so that we shall be free to devote our attention to the grievances of other sections of the community. want to have this vexatious question constantly before us. I hope that the Minister will disregard the fact that this is a trouble which he has inherited, and that They he will deal with it on its merits. I certainly trust that the Ministry will not decide to give us two or three editions of law. We know all about the law at the present time. We know that it seldom helps any one in equity. The law Courts, Undoubtedly some Governmay afford a very ready means of spending money; but these employees of the Commonwealth have no money to waste on the lawyers, and they have too much wit, I trust, to do so. Money spent by them on the lawyers might just as well, for all practical purposes, be thrown into the sea. I ask the Minister to deal with this grievance from the stand-point of equity, and to be prepared to waive his legal right. The honourable member for Angas said that to grant what was desired would involve an additional expenditure of about £4,000 per annum; but I am confident that the Commonwealth Government is not so poor as to think it necessary to retain £4,000, or even £8,000, year after year if there is any section of the Service honestly entitled to receive it. In the long run, we shall be none the poorer if we deal with this trouble on just and equitable lines. astounded at the extraordinary attitude of the Attorney-General in regard to the prosecution of directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Honourable members will recollect that the general manager of that company, who was called before a certain Royal Commission to give evidenceand was called first on the very reasonable ground that he was in the best position to give technical evidence as to the affairs of his company-aske d permission to make a statement, and that that permission, which had been granted to other persons appear-., ing before the Commission, was refused to him. ber hold a brief in the Sugar case? adds to the gaiety of nations, but I cannot otherwise understand him.

There are, of course, other directors of the company, and one of them happened at the time to be in a delicate state of health. He was the one man who could not possibly have brawled, even had he wished to brawl. When the question of prosecuting the directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for their action before the Commission came to be decided, against whom, do honourable members think, proceedings were instituted? Was it the brawler-the alleged breaker of the peace in the presence of Royal Commissioners? Not at all. The Government went for the man who was too sick to brawl. They went for a man who knew so little about the evidence that it would be perfectly safe to prosecute him, since he could not enter the witness-box and swear as to what took place before the Commission. Had they proceeded against the alleged brawler, he would have been able to go into the Court, and on oath state exactly what were the facts, and, bearing upon those facts, why he thought it was unreasonable to ask him to appear before such, a Commission. The Government, however, attacked the unfortunate Sir Normand MacLaurin, a sick man, who had no part in this brawl.

Mr Speaker, to discuss any question bearing upon the appeal or the merits of the recent action in the Sydney Court. The point really is this: To-day the Attorney General, in answer to a question put by me, told us that the information laid against Mr Knox and others had been withdrawn. I am making the mere passing criticism that it seems to be astonishing; apart from the merits of the question altogether, that where there are a number of alleged malefactors, one should be singled out, whilst the others are passed over. It seems to me that when the Government are about to proceed against a number of persons, they ought to proceed against the principal malefactors first. able member is now again discussing the case. He must not do that. further with the point. I have said enough to emphasize my criticism.

I feel confident that until justice is done to those who are affected there must be continuous trouble. I do not blame the present Government, for this is a heritage from would be broken by their transfer, and the previous Governments; but, all the same, ihe results are most unfortunate for members of the Public Service. Men who were well advanced when the classification war. made have been made junior to others who joined many years after them, and, further, in some cases they have, for many years past, been deprived of a portion of emoluments which they received when in the service of the State. It is true that these payments ' were made under different, forms, but, under the State Government, they were recognised as part of the salaries attached to the offices. Perhaps the worse case of the lot is tjiat of an old public servant who was utterly ""broken u p "" by this classification. He had given long and faithful service, having joined about the same time as the late Sir Charles Todd, and he found that under the classification he suffered to the extent of £150 -3 year. There are many other cases in which „loss has been sustained, though, as 1 say, the one I have cited is, perhaps, rhe worse. It is quite clear that at the Federal Convention, when this question was discussed, it was fully intended that, under should be preserved to them. Acting upon the section which has caused the trouble, the a suggestion made by Sir George Turner, rights and accruing rights of the transferred public servants were lo be preserved. I wish to make a brief reference to the points raised in connection with this matter at the Convention. When clause 83 of the Commonwealth Bill was before the Mr Justice, Gordon, one of the delegates from South Australia, drew attention to the fact that it did not cover all rights and accruing rights of transferred officers. He was followed by Sir George Turner, who saidWhen these men enter into the service of the of Parliament certain rights which they enjoy SJ long as they remain in the service of those States. If , therefore, they are transferred to some other body, surely it is only fair and right that they should carry to the new body whatever rights they had *in the old body. Mr now Mr Justice, O'Connor, at the same time., saidI should have preferred a I think we are all agreed that when an officer is taken over by the Commonwealth he should not be placed in an unfair position or lose any of his that the continuity of his service has been broken. A reference was made to certain cases in which the continuity of service of officers under existing Acts in South Australia men would be deprived of certain rights they possessed under those Acts. The present Mr Justice Barton also dealt with the matter, and saidA ll we suggest is that where a person is entitled to a locally-accruing right, tinder the law of the State in which he has served, that right shall not be impaired; but where under the law of the Stale in which he has served he is not entitled to any gratuity, pension, or retiring allowance, the mere fact of the transfer does not give him the right to the payment of such. Mr Deakin saidI do not understand why all rights and privileges are not simply continued, and why a change of master should involve any change in the conditions under which he is employed. Any statutory rights which exist should be continued. It arjpears to me that the legal decision given in the Victorian case turned entirely upon the question of what was a statutory right. The claims of the South Australian officers may not be looked upon in a strictly legal sense as statutory rights; but, viewing them on the ground of equity and in the light of die debates of the Federal Convention, no one can doubt that the rights of these men are accruing rights, and",30,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not

104,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [4.37],"Inot because jarrah is not available that closes certain special qualities, and is thus karri is being used for railway sleepers. interestingly described by Baron von His report statesThe State Royal Commission on Forestry, which sat in 1904, and took very exhaustive evidence, reported to the following effect upon the available supplies of jarrah, karri, tuart, an'd blackbutt :Supplies of Jarrah -Virgin jarrah forest to the north of Blackwood River, and suitable for milling, is estimated at 2,000,000 acres. Based on the present rate »of cutting, this would be equivaon the decreased copiousness of parenchymatic lent to about thirtv-two years' supply. To the south of the Blackwood River there are also considerable supplies of this timber; but, being so constantly intergrown with karri, blackbutt, and red gum, no fair estimate of quantities can be given. In addition to these O'Connor, M.I.C.E., who was the disareas, there are several millions of acres of jarrah country not of sufficient commercial value for milling purAustralia. He says*poses, but which will , as the railway system develops, afford immense scope for sleeper-hewing. Surely our railway system is developing, seeing that we are now about to build our first transcontinental railway, which will cover a distance of over 1,000 miles, and which will be the longest line in Australia. I hold that the sleepers for that railway should be hewn in this tract of country, which is suitable for no other purpose. Men can hew them there in a quarter of the time that they can be obtained by any other means. I have had tens of thousandsof sleepers hewn, so that I know what I am talking about. Where time is a consideration"", obviously it would be common sense to adopt, the course which I have suggested. By doing so, we should obviate the necessity for spending thousands of pounds in erecting mills, and providing machinery, horses, whims, &c. The report'from which I have quoted conclusively proves that in the construction of the transcontinental line, we should use timber which is suitable only for sleeper hewing. We ought not to utilize the timber of our best forests in building this transcontinental railway, when we have large areas of country which is suitable only For the hewing of jarrah sleepers. I hold in my hand a report upon the economic uses of the principal timbers of Western Australia. It statesJ sirrah -This timber is the most generally employed for railway construction, railway sleepers, marine and engineering work of all kinds, and building construction, and is specially suitable for underground use, and where in contact with wind and water. The chemical and microscopical examination of eucalyptus woods generally disMuellerIt may be summed up that the capability of different kinds of eucalyptus wood to endure for lengthened periods contact with humidity, air,, and temperature, depends largely, and perhaps mainly, on phlobaphenic substance, unchangeable by water; further, probably, also on the occurrence of oleo-resin, on the reduced number of hollow vascular tubes, on the organization of the walls of the ligneous fibre, substance, and on the lesser space occupied by the medullary rays. The hard variety of jarrah wood fulfils most of these conditions, eminently so of the first one. That opinion is backed up by the late Mr tinguished Engineer-in-Chief of Western For durability and general construction work of all classes, jarrah-is undoubtedly one of the best of all State timbers. It is almost exclusively used throughout the State, in railway construction work, as sleepers, piles, bridge beams, & c , and shows great durability both in and above ground. Mr Palmer, his successor, has expressed a similar opinion, and Mr Moncrieff, the present Railway Commissioner of South Australia, who was formerly the Engineerin-Chief of that State, saysJarrah has been used for railway sleepers, in the construction of bridges, wharves, and jetties, and for general work in buildings, such as goods sheds and platforms, where a heavy durable timber is required; and where the timber was of f u l l growth and seasoned before use, it has in every case proved satisfactory. Appended to that report is a footnote which readsAs regards the value and advantages of Jarrah for use as railway sleepers, a f u l l account is given further on in the special report by Mr Dattnall, M.Inst. C.E., Chief Engineer of Existing Lines for Western Australia. Mr Dartnall saysThe following instance is given of the lif e of jarrah sleepers where they have not been disturbed :A portion of the Great Southern Railway, from Beverley to Cuballing, about 50 miles in length, was laid with about 110,000 8-in. by 4-in. jarrah sleepers in the year 1886 or 1887, and the line was purchased by the Government in 1896. Practically none of the sleepers had been renewed when the line was purchased, and since that time the Railway Department has renewed about 4,300, equal to about 3.9 per cent, in eighteen years; and the balance is still in the road. AgainThe species of timber chiefly used in Western Australia is jarrah. The total number used on the railways, including renewals, has been 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 . Why is this Government disregarding the tlie timber, by creating a vacuum, or in some experience of Western Australia? Mr other way.

Small quantity untreated karri laid same time and place rotted within two or three years. powellizing experiment been made? six years with thirty sleepers, but we are going to use 3,000,000 sleepers. Why did they make the experiment in a country where white ants cannot live? Why did they make the test in the sand near ""Perth? In dealing with railway construction inland, there is quite a different proposition. It is not only a matter of white ants, but also a matter of dry rot. I saw at Broken Hill years ago verandah posts which had been put into dry soil. While that portion of a post which was above the surface was as sound as a rock, one could kick his foot through that portion out of which the dry soil had taken all the nature-dr y rot had made it perfectly useless. enough, being on the main street. It has been reported that powellizing has been an unqualified success in New Zealand. took the trouble to send a cablegram to find out whether that was the case or not, and I received the following replyYour cable re powellized timber experience in New Zealand insufficient enable authoritative opinion to be expressed. A number of sleepers which there is reason to believe were not properly treated by the process have been unsatisfactory. has been efficiently treated for carriage and waggon building has been satisfactory. come? ister of New Zealand. I wired to the head man there, in case my statement might be questioned. The fact that this timber powellizes for waggon-building has nothing to do with matter, because I can prove without doubt that before powellizing was invented karri was a great success for waggon-building, and was always looked upon as a good timber. What has the fact that powellized timber is good for waggon-building to do with the position? The best excuse which they can find for these sleepers not being unsatisfactory is [122] that the process was not properly carried out. That is what they say afterwards. It is more likely that the process was properly carried out in experimenting with a few sleepers than it will be when millions of ; constantly coming, "" Send them along; we* must keep the work going."" That is the time when the process must be done in a rush, and it will not be carried out properly. I claim that we are taking too big a risk in this mattera risk which should not be taken when there are millions of acres available from which to get hewn sleepers of the best jarrah. We should not be asked to make this experiment. We certainly should not act on five or six years' experience of only thirty sleepers. sleepers are to be used in the line? it is said. number ? ber can work out the number, as he knows that 2,000 sleepers to the mile will be used.

Holman? able members on that side as well as on this side to look at this matter without any feeling. I desire to protect tbe Commonwealth from a big error. I wish to do this in the interests of the Commonwealth, and not of a particular State. When we have in Western Australia timber which is suitable for the purpose why should we make an experiment? The question at issue is of so much importance that we should not be experimenting. I doubt whether it was ever mentioned when we were considering the Bill that this was to be an experimental railway in applying material which had never been used before, or that we were to experiment with processes which would make some material altogether unsuitable before that date suitable now. We are not authorized to make these experiments. We sbould proceed on good fixed lines-o n a certainty. We ought to build this railway so as to get the best use of it for the greatest number of years. We should adjure, to some well-beaten track, using good material. I advocated the use of 80-lb. -rails, and I wish to congratulate the Government upon using them, because to-day ll read a report to the effect that the great Canadian Pacific Railway Company had decided to pull up the last part of their 60-lb. rails, and to put in 80-lb. rails. There is no harm in our being a little ahead of them, because it is recognisedthroughout the world now that a heavy rail is the chewiest in the end. Would it not be a calamity if under these splendid rails we were to put sleepers which would have to be continually renewed, because if they will get dry rot anywhere, they will get it there? I do not know of any place in Australia where it would be more costly to carry material, and to pay wages for men I trust that the Government will seriously consider this matter. If , as the Minister He has told me, a contract has been entered into, I hope that they will look through the papers, and see whether it cannot be cut down to the minimum. If we are to have an experiment of this kind, let it be a small one, and let it be made at either end of the iine, where the sleepers can be kept under close supervision, and, if unsatisfactory, can be readily removed. member think that the Commonwealth should experiment at all in this matter? port on "" The Physical Characteristics of the Hardwoods of Western Australia,"" Mr G.

We have no time to season it and hence railway sleepers are very prone to develop it. It appears to be infectious, and is probably due to, or at least assisted by, the decomposition of the sap. I invite honourable members to read the last paragraph in conjunction w it h the f o l l o w ing paragraph in the same reportKarri, whilst in every other respect almost unequalled as a sleeper timber, is prone to develop dry-rot if used when green in damp ground, and in the examination of its sap it was found to decompose when exposed to the air; and, further, that it exercised a greater effect upon the metals immersed in it That is to say it eats away the "" d o g s "" than was the case with any of the other saps.

136,Sir John Forrest,"I think thatdisastrous, when the karri was the closer timber, jarrah has invariably been selected. The only reason for the decision of the Government is that there is a Socialistic wave in Western Australia at the present time, and the State Government are carrying out a good many works. It has occurred to the State Government that they can run Government saw-mills and cut and supply timber. I have read in the press, and I have no doubt the statement is true, that most of the convenient jarrah country is leased to private companies. It is not an inexhaustible product, although there is an immense quantity of it in Western Australia. A great deal of the good karri country is still in the hands of the State Government. They do not propose to lease it, but to work it themselves. There is railway communication near to the karri country, and it could easily be taken into it ; and in carrying out their policy the State Government propose to erect mills and supply karri timber as a Government enterprise. -large order from the Commonwealth Government they will be assured of an easy market for their timber. The karri is a good timber for superstructures, and no doubt for that purpose the State Goverament could get a market for it beyond Australia, though not for use as sleepers; but if would be much more convenient for them to -make a contract with the Commonwealth Government, and to be able to send the timber by rail from tlieir mills straight away to the place at which it is to be used. There could not be any objection to that if the timber were suitable for the purpose. I do not say that the powellizing process may not yet be proved to be all that is claimed for it, but I do say that our experience of it Is so limited that we are not justified in using powellized karri sleepers for this very extensive work. a very expensive job. the process. boiled. sire to say anything against the karri timber. It is not to the interest of any member of this House to decry any product of the Commonwealth. At the same time, we should not let our interests carry us away in so important a matter. I was anxious to find out all about this proposal to use karri timber, and at the beginning of the session asked several questions on the subject of the Minister of Home Affaris. I cannot say that the honourable gentleman met me in the spirit in which I had a right to be met. There were several attempts made to avoid answering the questions. To such an extent was this the case that I at last gave up asking questions on the subject. I was answered as if I had some ulterior object in view, and desired to serve some party purpose. My questions were not answered as they should have been answered. I asked whether karri timber was being used in the construction of railways in Western Australia. The Minister, said it was. I did not pursue the question, -but I now deny that it has ever been used in the construction of railways in Western Australia, except in the case I have men-: tioned where it proved disastrous, and the Minister must have been grossly misinformed when he made that misleading reply. To say that karri was being used in railway construction because thirty If they can get a powellized sleepers were laid on a line as an experiment is a subterfuge. It was dis-: creditable .to the Minister to give such an absolutely incorrect answer. I then thought that I would apply for information to the Commissioner of Railways in Western Australia, whom I know very well. I asked him what length of line in Western Australia had been laid with powellized karri sleepers, and in what locality. I could not get an, answer. The lionorable member for Fremantle has given an .answer, and I should like to know why I could not get one. I think it must have been because the Government did not .desire that I should have the information. I think that is a reasonable conclusion for me to arrive at. At any rate, we now find that thirty powellized karri! sleepers have been laid down in Western Australia. If it was desired to make an experiment, a mile of line, in different localities, should have been laid down with these sleepers. The fact that thirty powellized karri sleepers laid in one locality have stood a good test for six years should not be sufficient to induce any reasonable-minded Minister to embark upon an expenditure of about £1,000,000 for powellized karri sleepers for a great .undertaking such as the Trans-Australian railway. I am surprised that the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence, who know all about the matter, should be parties in any way to so great a risk being run in connection with this undertaking.

Most of the jarrah sleepers used in Western Australia are not sawn sleepers, but have been cut by hewers, and they are really better than sawn sleepers. Large areas of Ijarrah have been specially reserved for hewers, and there would be no difficulty in getting a large supply of jarrah sleepers. Why, in the circumstances, do the Government turn aside from this big and certain supply to follow this will-o'-the-wisp down into the karri country where no mill has yet been erected? outlet by rail. whereas there are many lines already connected with the jarrah country, and there is an aTmy of hewers at the work of cutting sleepers. the sleepersused on the Western Australian railways' are provided by hewers. Why all this risk-al l this delay? It is the company concerned go on intended toassist the Western Australian Government in their Socialistic enterprises. I do not mind that, so long as they provide the Commonwealth with a good sleeper; but why should we incur all the risk ? I will not be a party to foisting upon this Commonwealth a timber which has not been proved to be suitable for railway sleepers. The suitability of karri depends upon the effectiveness of the process of powellization, of which we have had insufficient experience. I am surprised that, notwithstanding the plentiful supply of. jarrah which is available for the purpose, the Minister of Home Affairs should have lent himself to this scheme, which will only bring discredit on him and injury to the country. Minister of Home Affairs) [5.51] I was not present when the honourable member It for Fremantle was discussing this question; but I have listened attentively to the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan, and I fear that both of them are labouring under a misapprehension.

The honourable member for Fremantle, and' the honourable member for Swan, stated that, with the exception of six years, we had had no experience of the process in Australia. But even that six years'' experience has been sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of powellized karri over un-powell'ized jarrah. I know that a storm of opposition has been created because we have seen fit to go outside of certain specified timber rings to obtain the sleepers required for the construction of the transcontinental railway. Recognising, that, I shall endeavour to put before honourable members the opinions of men who are without bias upon this question. For a long time. I was not prepared to adopt powellized sleepers-a t any rate, not until I had had a thorough examination' made of them; but I do not believe that because our great-grandfathers and grandmothers did not change, we ought steadfastly to refuse to change. WeI may say that practically all know that the things which suited them win not suit now.

State the two sleepers have been subjected to a fair test. I propose to show honourable members that whilst the jarrah sleepers have been bored through with white ants, the powellized karri sleepers are just as good as they were on the day they were laid. In fact, they are better. They are more durable. From that six years' experience, it seems safe to predict that they will last thirty or forty years longer.; and we know that fifteen years is the average life of a sleeper. I hold in my hand a copy of a memorandum dated 17th July, 1912, from the Engineer-inChief of Railways to the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, which readsWith reference to the Powell wood process, I beg to furnish the following notes :On the 2nd May, i g n , I wrote to Mr Light, Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Government Railways, Perth, asking him for information as to his experience, and his opinion, of the process. On the 31st March, 1910, Mr Light forwarded a letter to the managing director of the Australian Powell wood process, stating that certain karri sleepers were treated by the Powell wood process in 1906, and were placed on the road on the 16th November, 1906, alternately with some untreated karri sleepers. In November, 1909, an examination was made. sleeper of each kind was handed over to the Departmental analytical chemist, who showed that the untreated sleeper was affected with dry-rot, but that the powellized sleeper was free from disease. A report on the Powell wood process by Professor Norman Rudolph, M.Sc. (Victoria and Liverpool), Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, Chief of the De' partment of Applied Chemistry of the Indian Institute of Science, deals chiefly with the treatment of Indian timber, and is undoubtedly very favorable to the Powell process. There is a report dated 20th August, 1907, by Professor D. F. Mackenzie, Fellow of the Surveyors' Institute, Fellow of the Botanical Society. It concerns the treatment of three sections of karri sent to him to test for "" d r y r o t"" on the 13th November, 1906. The specimens were embedded "" in active dry-rot"" for nine months. The untreated timber became covered with fungus. The treated timber remained unaffected. There is another report by Professor Mackenzie, dated 4th November, 1905, where he writes, apparently to the Powell Company, that he is prepared to endorse all that they claim for their process. Professor G. S. Boulger, F.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.H.S., A.S.I., in a book written by him, says that the processed wood will take paint or varnish, nnd is completely immune to the attacks of dry-rot. . On the 24th July, 1911, Mr Bethell wrote tome forwarding two samples of Victorian mountain ash, both out of the same board, one in itsnatural condition and the other powellized seasoned, showing a very great improvement due to the process. This was in compliance with a request which I had made to Mr Bethell. On the 2nd September, 1911, Mr Light, Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Perth, wrote to me on the subject of the Powell process. He said :"" Some years ago a number of processed sleepers, karri, were placed in the line sandwiched in between sleepers badly affected with dry-rot, and have stood the test well, proving thoroughly resistant to the inroads of the fungus. "" The Public Works Department also has carried out exhaustive tests with powellized timbers in the north-west of this State (where white ants are particularly numerous and voracious) to determine the efficacy of the treated timber in resisting the attacks of the termites, with generally satisfactory results."" Then he adds :"" The value of the treatment having been fairly well established, the Government authorized the construction of a powellizing plant, and one capable of processing on an average 9,000 sleepers per week has been erected at Bunbury."" I think it will be seen that the evidence as to the effect of treatment of karri by the Powell wood process is very favorable. Since writing the above, a telegram from Mr 'Light, Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Perth, conveys the following information :"" Powellized karri culvert perfectly sound, although erected for test purposes inside old jarrah culvert, which has been destroyed by white ants."" I think that that disproves the statements of the honourable member for Fremantle. One Western Australia use powellized karri for its own lines? gard to early rising, it thinks it excellent for other people. an extract from the report of the Consulting Railway Engineer, dated 20th September, 1911, relating to sleepersThe question of the supply of sleepers is one of considerable importance. The forests in Australia where the best classes of timber grow are becoming rapidly depleted. This is particularly the case on the eastern side of the continent, where, at one time, ironbark was considered the only timber suitable for sleepers. Since then, owing to the growing scarcity of ironbark, other very good but relatively inferior timbers are being used. In Western Australia the forests in the south-west can yet be depended upon for large supplies. Jarrah is the only suitable timber, karri not being sufficiently durable or resistant to white ants ->The Railways Department of Western Australia possesses a powellizing plant, and the results are said to be most satisfactory. The process seems to cause a wonderful improvement in the quality of even poor timber. In Gippsland and Tasmania there are large forests, including the so-called mountain ash, messmate, and bluegum. These timbers treated",41,Cadet Roberts Home Customs I N South Australia Who Have Not

I have asked Mr Bethell, the manager of the company in Sydney, to furnish me with particulars of the plant which would be suitable for erection in Port Augusta, on the assumption that it would be necessary to treat 4,000 sleepers per day. I have inquired of timber merchants in Sydney as to the possibility of obtaining large supplies of sleepers from the coast of New South Wales, north of Newcastle, but it is thought impracticable, owing to the absence of co-operation among timber getters. Then there is this report by the Chief Engineer for Existing Lines, Western Australian Government railways, dated at Perth, 21st March, 1910, and addressed to the Managing Director, Western Australian Powell Wood Process Limited, Surrey Chambers, St. George's Terrace, PerthIn the year 1906 some karri sleepers were treated by the Powell wood process in the experimental plant at Midland Junction railway shops. These sleepers were placed in the road on the 16th November, 1906, at certain points alternately with non-treated karri sleepers, aU of the -sleepers having been cut at the same time. On the 17th November, 1909, one set of these -sleepers was examined in the road, and ""dry-rot"" was found to exist in some of the non-treated -ones. One of each kind was removed from the line, and has been examined by the Departmental Analytical Chemist, a transcription of whose report I have much pleasure in submitting -hereunder for your information :"" With regard to the above, I have to state that I have physically examined the two sleepers submitted. I find that the untreated karri sleeper is affected with ' dry-rot.' This timber disease seems to have travelled in a certain direction, as one side and the end are the parts most affected. I found in several places along the side that the apparent affected area extended to a depth of five-eighths of an inch. At these places tbe fibrous nature of karri has almost disappeared, having given place to a granular and friable mass, which can be readily removed with the finger-nail. This structure is best seen with a microscope, which explains thc cause for the disintegration. It is impossible for me, at this stage, to say whether the 'dry-rot' has penetrated deeper. If it has, the fibre has not been visibly affected by it. I have examined the powellized karri ' sleeper, and find it free from the above disease. could any of the fungi be found, and the fibre is sound all over the portion exposed. The condition of this sleeper is much more sound than the untreated sleeper."" We admit that untreated karri is not good, Judging by results on other timber, but the treated timber is another matter. I have also a report by Professor D. F. Mackenzie, Fellow of the Surveyors Institute and of the Botanical Society. It is dated 4th November, 1905. Referring to the specimens of powellized timbers submitted to me some time ago for the purpose of testing, I have to report that I have now completed the tests, and, in consequence of the results obtained, I am prepared to endorse all you claim for your process. With regard to its immunity from the attack of "" dry-rot"" (Merulius lacrymans), I have made a prolonged and thorough test. In order that this test might be thoroughly reliable, I took care to produce and maintain the necessary conditions to induce the attack of the "" dryrot"" fungus These conditions are moisture, temperature, and f u l l contact with a vigorous fungus. As is well known, the moisture and an equable temperature predisposes the wood by dissolving the soluble matter and softening the cell walls, rendering it liable to attack from fungoid plants, and thereby causing rapid decay. In order that there might be no mistake, such as weakness of the fungoid growth, I had placed alternately with your specimens similar pieces of other well-seasoned timbers. These were all attacked by this "" d r y r o t"" and partly consumed, while those sent by you had no appearance of being even touched by Mycelium, and, what may be considered a good feature, the tissue was hardly at all affected by months of contact with moisture. Examining the tissue of your treated timbers under the lens of a powerful microscope, I did not find a single "" thread"" of Mycelium or a spore. There being no penetration by Mycelium there was, consequently, no disintegration of the cells or general tissue. Making a similar examination of the untreated wood, I found the whole tissue permeated with the Mycelium of the "" dry-rot"" fungus, with a large proportion of the cells and tissues disintegrated and collapsed. A more severe test than I have made would be impossible to carry out. D. F. MACKENZIE.

With regard to the white ant resisting timbers, we venture to emphatically state that there is no timber suitable for sleepers that will resist the attacks of these pests, more particularly those in the country through which the proposed line will pass. Tbe Western Australian Government recently powellized the whole of the jarrah sleepers and scantling required in the Port Hedland toMarble Bay Railway, and are enlarging their present plant to powellize all timbers used by them. It bas been found by the Indian railways that ravages by white ants and dry-rot were increasing to an alarming extent, so much so that timbers hitherto looked upon as dry-rot and white ant resisting, were found to be quite the reverse. Two further powellizing plants are to be erected in India to cope with the increasing demand, so satisfactory have been the result's of all tests made. We would also take the liberty of pointing out that the establishing and proving of the Powell process in Australasia has entailed the spending considerable sums of money which would otherwise be spent here.

172,Mr King O'malley,"Some will be.The following is an extract from a letter honourable member privately anything that written by the Assistant Engineer at Perth he wants to know regarding any bargain for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railbefore it isactually completed. Once a way to the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonbargain is made, all the facts relating to wealth railways:Mr Scaddan informed me that aM the Govei'nment Engineers have convinced him that powellized karri is better than treated jarrah, and as the karri forests are quite in the hands of the Government, whilst the jarrah areas are almost exclusively in the hands of. Millars Company, the State Government are determined to utilize this timber (karri) for their own benefit. Mr Light, the Chief Engineer for Existing Lines, is thoroughly convinced that treated karri sleepers are better in every respect than jarrah, and that the extra cost for the powellizing will more than, double the life of an untreated jarrah sleeper. It will thus be. seen that the Premier of Western Australia declares that all the Government engineers have convinced him that powellized karri is better, than treated jarrah, whilst the Engineer-in-Chief, Western Australia; Mr Deane,. Engineerin-Chief; Mr Saunders, Assistant Engineer, South Australia; and Mr Chinn, Assistant Engineer, Western. Australia, all report in favour of it. We have the tests of eminent scientific men to support us, and we know that the Indian Government is putting in a powellizing plant. I had thought of using, steel sleepers, but when I went to Western Australia and had interviews with Mr Thompson and other engineers, who put before me all. the evidence that it was possible to obtain, I decided upon the course I . have followed. I waited all this time before arriving at a decision. The right honourable member for Swan has put to me many questions relating to the railway, but no one knows better than he does that when things are at the experimental stage-whe n they are in a state of nebulosity-it is unwise to tell every one about them. If you do, the whole world is in your business, and, indeed, knows, your business better than you do yourself. No matter how successful a man may be in managing a business, he will find that there are some people who have failed in a great many undertakings, but who think nevertheless that they can manage that business, -a great deal better than he can. I therefore keep these things to myself, not that I desire to give unkind or unsatisfactory .answers to questions put to me Sir member could refuse to answer a question. to do that, but I am prepared to tell any it are laid on the table of the; House. honourable member select jarrah sleepers? to use karri sleepers because I was convinced of their value by the tests of engineers all over the world. orable member tell the Opposition that the jarrah, forests were cornered,, whils! the' karri forests were not. to hurt, their feelings.

Assuming that the honourable member was prompted by the highest of motives, namely, to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and inform the House of some wrong'-doing, he was quite right in bringing the matter forward. The-new Cable Company is drawing a subsidy from the Commonwealth, and if the honourable member's statements were true, they were sufficiently serious to warrant a reply. I do not think that the honourable member ought to be ignorant of the position, in view of disclosures which, have been made in this House. There are two Press Cable Associations operating in the Commonwealth for the purpose of supplying news to journals published here; One is known as the Argus-Herald syndicate, and the other is the Independent Press Cable Association, which was recently formed.

As regards the projected newspaper in Brisbane, I have not been favoured with a circular such as that claimed to have been received by the honourable member for Wentworth. AllI know is that there is a project for a new daily paper which will be in strong contrast to the newspapers already published there, inasmuch as it will be thoroughly democratic. It may be that this newspaper will be the only one to use this cable service, but, if so, that will not on the line from Port Darwin to Pine be because the service is not open to other newspapers; it will be because those other newspapers are bound by agreement with the Argus->Herald Press Cable Syndicate, and cannot, except at very heavy loss, publish a cable coming through any other channel. This Parliament voted a subsidy for the purpose of establishing a company free of monopoly rights; and it ought to be made known that the garbled statement of the honourable member for Wentworth is not in accordance with fact. a very serious matter for the Government, in embarking on a big undertaking such as that of a transcontinental railway, to accept sleepers for practically 1,000 miles of line without being absolutely certain that the sleepers will be serviceable. Nothing that the Minister has told us would convince me, nor, I think, honourable members opposite, that karri sleepers will prove more durable simply because they have been powellized. In company with the Minister of External Affairs and other honourable members, I was shown blocks of karri and jarrah by the superintendent of the railway workshops at Port Darwin. Some of those blocks had been subjected to the powellizing treatment, while others had not; and I can say emphatically that, while the blocks which had been treated were not so badly infected as the others, they had been riddled through and through by the white ant. position ! orable member not to show his head in the Northern Territory-the white ants go for anything wooden. I was given to understand at Port Darwin that the Minister of External Affairs was to bring those blocks of wood down to Melbourne in order to show them to the Minister of Home Affairs. Whether that was done or not I do not know; but I saw the Minister of External Affairs examining the blocks, the powellized portion of which was, as I say, riddled through. sight. every wooden sleeper on the Port Darwin railway has been taken up? Creek were subjected to every possible treatment to prevent the white ants eating them, and ultimately they had to be done away with. years since wooden sleepers were used on that line. They were taken up long before the powellizing process was invented. know that the man in charge of the railway sheds at Darwin, who had long experience of conditions in the Northern Territory, assured us that, so far, no timber is known which will resist the ravages of the white ants, and no process has been discovered which will make timber proof against white ants. On these facts it is quite clear that the Government will not be safe in depending upon karri sleepers merely because they are to be powellized. It bas been admitted by the Minister of Home Affairs himself that, assuming both are untreated, the karri timber is inferior to the jarrah timber. It may be assumed from this that if the jarrah timber were powellized it would be superior to powellized karri. I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but listening to the debate I have come to the conclusion that karri timber is not procurable at a lower rate than jarrah. In all the circumstances, I ask why we should decide to use timber which is known to be inferior when we might use a superior timber? We have had no explanation from the Minister of Home Affairs as to why karri sleepers are to be used in preference to jarrah. I am given to understand that there is a reason for the preference. We learn that it is in contemplation by the State Labour Government of Western Australia to erect State saw-mills, and the Commonwealth Government have decided to use karri sleepers for the transcontinental railway merely in order to put work",46,Victorian Powell Wood Process Ltd

The Minister of Home Affairs in Wis reply dealt with nothing but reports from various, individuals as to the efficacy erf the powellizing process to prevent dry rot. He quoted no report from a recognised authority asserting that powellized timber will resist the ravages of the white ants. Before we are committed to the use of karri sleepers for 1,000 miles of the trans-Western Australian railway we should be absolutely certain that they are tlie best for the purpose.

I would have seen that only those cadets vvho had proved themselves efficient were to be selected to take part in these competitions. But I would point out that it is absolutely impossible for any cadet to become efficient with the rifle, because he has only a few hours in which to qualify himself. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -I beg to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] absolutely contrary to the regulations which have been issued in respect of universal training. Yesterday the Honorary Minister was particular in stating that we must adhere to those regulations. that the honourable member is replying to a speech made yesterday by the Honorary Minister? ing upon his reply incidentally. the honourable member say that yesterday the Honorary Minister said so-and-so. ference. ber must not comment upon a debate which has already taken place. is absolutely contrary to the regulations under which cadet trainmg is carried out. Paragraph 4 of regulation 50 saysBall ammunition is not to be issued to senior' cadets individually except when in position to /ire, and the officer commanding will be held responsible that no ammunition unfiled is allowed to remain in their possession on leaving such position. . The order which was issued makes it incumbent upon those who are in charge of these tactical exercises to supply ammuni-: tion to the cadets. They must have it in their pouches. In carrying out this fieldfiring practice, the cadets will be in extended order, So that it is absolutely impossible to comply with the regulation. I now wish to say a word or two regarding the number of cadets who have used the rifle at all, and in this connection I propose to quote from the report to Parliament of the Minister of Defence himself. Let us see how many cadets actually use a rifle. Appendix vi. of the Minister's report sets out that the annual musketry course for Senior Cadets is to comprise twenty rounds, which are to be fired at distances of 100, 200 and 300 yards. Part II . deals with instructional practice at 300 and 400 yards, at which distances twenty-five rounds are to be fired. In other words, forty-five rounds are allowed for the annual musketry course for Senior Cadets. Now, there are .92,276 cadets in the Commonwealth. How many of these have gone through this very simple course of musketry? How many have fired even the forty-five rounds of ammunition? The Minister states in his report that the number of partially exercised cadets is 2,077, and the number who have completed the course is 3,117Only 3,117 of our cadets out of 92,276 have gone through this simple course of musketry. Yet this most inexplicable order has been issued that cadets are to engage in fi'eld-firing-a tactical exercise. The thing is simply grotesque. burlesque. firing is the highest exercise which can be carried out by a soldier. After he has passed through a recruit's course, which occupies at least from seven weeks to three months of continuous training, he has to undergo the trained soldier's course, which occupies him for a further period of six months. Yet under this order boys who have never used a rifle are supposed to engage in the same exercise. The order will have a bad effect, because there are many military men whose sons are cadets, and they know the danger. place with exceptional success. were successful because the order was ignored, and the only teams competing were composed of State school or college boys, who had been trained with the rifle for years.

It is a mistake to allow boys to go through field practice at all. There will be time enough for that wben they enter the Citizen Forces.

That was a blunder which the Department should see is not made again. The order is still in force, but its effects will not be so bad in the future, because next year there will be more boys who have gone through the musketry course, though there will always te recruits coming in. The danger was greater last year, because the boys only got their rifles in November. passed through satisfactorily. ignored. It had to be ignored to prevent disaster, but it is against all traditions of military discipline to ignore an order from head-quarters. Another serious matter is that, although the universal training regulations say that the cadet officers shall wear uniforms, not a single garment has been supplied to any cadet officer, notwithstanding that ithe scheme has been in working order for sixteen months. This is -very discouraging to the officers. To military men it is incongruous to have officers -in plain clothes drilling boys or men in -uniform. You may occasionally see officers ; in uniform drilling ununiformed recruits, although that looks bad enough, but it is a horrible sight to see a man in mufti drilling boys or men in uniform. I would no more go out in front of a body of uniformed men in the suit that I now wear than I would try to fly to the moon, because I should look and feel out of place if I did so. There is a great deal in clothes. You can call it sentiment, but when a soldier dons his uniform he feels he is a different man. I know it from my own case. Uniform has an effect upon the men under you, and makes your position and theirs clear and distinct. your chest. with a cane, and slap your leg with it, and feel that you are somebody. The distinction between the officer and the men in the ranks must be marked. Without it there can be no discipline. doing without uniforms. absolutely wrong. I have had brothers under me. Of course, when out of uniform we call each other by our Christian names, and act with perfect freedom, but when we are in uniform it is a different matter. If I noticed that certain lines were not clean I would ask, "" Where is Captain Ryrie?"" He would come, and I . would say, "" Captain Ryrie, what is the matter? I see that there are certain things wrong in your lines."" He would salute, and reply, "" Yes, sir."" I would say, "" See that it does not occur again.""

254,Mr Ryrie,"I do not know that youbeen a cause of very great dissatisfaction to those who have volunteered to fill the position of commissioned officers in the Cadet Forces that they Tiave'not been given uniforms. I know a case where the .young wife of a man who had volunteered to be an officer went to the area office, and asked "" What sort of a uniform is John going to have?"" He told her that he would get a uniform. She was as pleased and proud as Punch, and John was waiting every day for the uniform, but it never came. was always wondering, and she was always wondering, about the uniform, but it never came, and he resigned. So it is with a great number of these officers. uniforms which it is laid down in the regulations shall be served to these men, and which have been promised over and over again, have never been given. A great many officers have resigned purely and solely because they have not been able to get uniforms, because they refuse to go out in plain clothes in front of the boys to be jeered at. Do honourable members know that there are parsons, chemists,drapers, and all sorts of men who have volunteered to become officers, and good officers they would be if provided with uniforms? Do they expect a parson who has to preach in the pulpit to go out in his clerical robe, and choker collar to drill boys; do they expect a draper who has to serve customers over the counter to go out in the suit he wears in the shop, to be laughed and. jeered at by the boys? That is altogether subversive of discipline. Honourable members may laugh as fhey like, but it is a serious drawback to the success of the cadet scheme that the Department has not yet supplied cadet officers with a single garment of uniform, although they have been promised it for so many months. Tn regard to the cadets generally, one of the greatest grievances that Area Officers have is that the work is not fairly apportioned. I find that there are good grounds for this complaint. areas, an Area Officer can do the work in a few hours, and then attend to private business, ancl the remuneration or allowance of ^150 a year is sufficient if he has only one area to attend to. metropolitan'centres we might put more than one area in the charge of one good -man, and give him sufficient remuneration to make it worth his while to give up his private business, and attend to that work only. But in the country areas, it is a different matter altogether. I can assure the House that the officers in these areas have absolutely not one minute to spare, and that it is impossible for an Area Officer there to attend to any private business. Here the allowance of £ 1 5 0 a year is not sufficient remuneration-a t all events, it is not sufficient to attract the men whom we should have in the service. In my opinion, the Minister ought to consider whether he He cannot more fairly apportion the work of the Area Officers, and knock two or three areas into one in the metropolitan centres. I am quite certain that one good Area Officer could attend to more than one area there because he has only one training centre or drill hall to go to, and has the cadets more under control. They do not live long distances away. He can get his parades over in a short time, return to his office, and attend to his work. The unfortunate fellow who has to put in the whole of his time gets only the same remuneration. There should be some alteration made in the arrangements. In look^ ing over the Inspector-General's report, I was surprised to find that he does not mention any of the matters to which I have referred. He makes no reference to the failure of the Department to supply uniforms to cadet officers. The only reference which he makes, I think, to the uniforms of the cadets is in a statement that the hats supplied were too small. I think it is part of his duty to inquire into all these matters. When Major-General Kirkpatrick came out here, at the inception of Lord Kitchener's scheme, we took it that he would report all these matters through the Military Board ""fo the Minister, and I am rather disappointed to find that such reports have not been made. With regard to the Pay Department, the delay which takes place in re-imbursing both Area Officers and sergeant-majors the sums which they have to pay in the carrying out of their duties is a source of very great dissatisfaction. I have come to the In the metropolitan conclusion that the fault lies with the civilian member of the Military Board. I have had some knowledge of Mr Laing in the State of New South Wales. I have every reason to believe that he is an estimable I think that in the man, and has no wish to retard the work of the Minister, or the carrying of this scheme to a successful issue, but he .is steeped in conservatism and red-tapism.

No notice has been taken of resolutions carried and recommendations made at a Conference of Area Officers and the Instructional Staff at a big school held at Victoria Barracks, Sydney. At that Conference these delays were discussed, and it was recommended that the Area Officers, instead of receiving only ^10 out of the contingent fund in each area at the commencement of the financial year, should receive £ 2 5 , and that to exercise more care in this regard. there should be no delay in giving them this money. How they hoped to carry out the recommendation that there should be no delay I do not know, but, at all events, they thought that there should be no delay in reimbursing officers after the first payment had been made. taken of that recommendation. „ was not approved of, no blame can attach to Mr Laing. all events, was worthy of serious consideration. for the Minister, not Mr Laing, to deal with.

A cadet named Roberts, son of Commander Roberts, of Osborne-road, Manly, was served with a summons, although it would appear that the service of a summons upon him was quite unjustifiable. It transpires that he had never .missed a parade or a drill of any sort. His father was very wrath, and, at his request, I took up the matter, and brought it before the Department. In reply, I received the following letter from I know that, the Minister of DefenceMelbourne, 29th August, 19,12 DEAH SIR,-With further reference to the letter addressed to you by Commander M . A. Roberts, "" Maiolsa,"" Osborne-road, Manly, relative to the case of his son, Walter Frederick, I desire to inform you that reports received disclose1.

At roll-call in each parade, cadets whose names have not been called aTe asked to signify, in order that no one may be missed, and that cadets putting' in parades with other companies than their own may receive credit for same. Cadet Roberts failed to signify his presence when called upon to do so. The company officer concerned, however, is considered to have shown lack of supervision in repeatedly passing over this cadet, and has been informed to that effect, and given instructions This is evidently an attempt to saddle Cadet Roberts with the blame-to show that it was due to his own neglect that a summons was served upon him'.

268,Mr Ryrie,"There is one other matter4. The reports disclosed in paragraphs 2 and 3 in the above mentioned letter are absolutely false and misleading in every detail. 5. Prior' to tlie 30th ult. I was never instructed by the officer commanding "" A "" Company, or by any other person, to apply to the officer commanding for the transfer in question. 6. My name having not been called on parade, I. never, on any occasion, failed to signify my presence.

This declaration was signed by Cadet Roberts, in the presence of Mr Maddock, J.P. Incidents of this kind cause dissatisfaction among, the cadets I do not know on whose report the Minister based his letter, but there can be no doubt that -an effort is being, made to put all tlie blame on Cadet Roberts. The facts of the case are that a policeman, called, at Commander .Roberts' private house, and, entering it, served the toy with a summons. This lad, who had shown the greatest enthusiasm in his work, and had attended every parade, was served with a summons owing to the. blundering of an officer. There is only one remedy for this sort of thing. It is that the people themselves should take tlie matter in hand. Let them wake up, and return to this House men who have some knowledge of military matters. If they do that, we shall have a different! state of affairs. Is. there no man in Australia who is able to put things right ? When the Inspector-General was appointed we thought that he would set everything right, and see that Lord Kitchener's scheme was carried out in its entirety. We have some ground,. I think,, for a little disappointment in. this regard. I do not know what is the reason, but it. seems to me that things are drifting in connection with, the great scheme of compulsory training. They appear to be drifting hopelessly,, and it will be. a. very sorry day for Australia if we allow them to drift to such an extent that it will be impossible to place the system on a sound footing. I hope that the Minister, and' his Department as a whole, will endeavour to see that these matters are rectified ; that there is no delay in making payments to the Area Officers, that cadet ofiicers obtain their uniforms, and that the cadets themselves are not subjected totreatment which discourages them, damps their ardour, and does away with their enthusiasm., t f that be done, we may still hope fo* success ; we may still hopeto be able to 1 create the great citizen army that we may require some day to defend our hearths and our homes; but, if not, we can. look forward only to failure. honourable member who represents North Sydney has referred to my head as being wooden. But, sir, I assure you that if my head is wooden, I am not suffering ^ from white ants. the honourable member for Capricornia in ber for North Sydney has white ants in his head ? the honourable member to say so. am prepared, to leave, it to the House, after having heard the honourable member's speech on clothes. It will be a. sad day for Australia if we ever have to' depend on military gentlemen who can only get up Dutch courage when they put their uniforms on. The honourable member has told us that when he puts on his uniform his chest swells, and he marches along striking his leg with his little cane, feeling immensely proud. orable member to understand the argument. there were some 50,000 Boer soldiers -the y were hardly called an armywho had not a uniform amongst them. I saw pictures of them in the newspapers, and if I remember rightly the only uniforms they had were those which they took off their opponents. It is not necessary, I think, and I hope it will not be necessary in Australia, for our soldiers to work up Dutch courage in that way. I can well' imagine the. honourable member to be of. the man-milliner type. I understand that some of our officers belong to that class; but I should be very sorry to think that all the military officers in Australia were like the honourable member. He probably spends most of histime discussing with his brother officers as to whether heshould have four buttons or three on his coat. sets. he does wear stays.

Sir Speak correctly. to me, you ridiculous Knight Commander of the Bath! yet. Commander of something. whatever he is, I object to his statement that I am not telling the truth. I appeal to honourable members as to whether we were not told that the Western Australian timber which is to be used in the construction of the railway is not suitable. Probably millions of money are at stake, and it is time that we took into consideration the warnings of these two honourable members. It is evident that if Western Australian timbers are used we are likely to lose a considerable amount of money. sense, I hope. firms me in the opinion I have already expressed, that before we powellize any timber, we should try to powellize the Fusion, to prevent the dry-rot which is,apparently setting in. I have read that there have been many inventions in the nature of concrete sleepers. I suppose that more than a dozen have been patented at the Commonwealth Patent Office. One man has invented a concrete sleeper, and another has improved upon it. In fact, I believe that many improvements have been made. The Minister ought to ask for a return from his officers as to the various inventions of concrete sleepers. In that way we might possibly avoid the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money, and save the lives of many of the people who use the railway. If we are going to use such rubbishy timbers as have been described this afternoon by the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Fremantle, we may suffer a serious calamity. The matter is of very great importance, and the House is indebted to the two honourable members who have given us the benefit of the information which they possess. If there is any honourable member who ought to know the qualities of Western Australian timbers, it certainly is the right honourable member for Swan, because he has made many explorations in Western Australia, and no doubt he has becgme acquainted with these timbers.

292,Mr Mcwilliams (Franklin) [9.4],"up. There was an item in the Estimates for making provision for the storage and testing of certain timbers. Then the question of preserving timbers was mentioned, and I understood that the Minister informed the House that experiments would be made. But, apparently, we have waited until the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway is being commenced; and now the Minister tells us that experiments are being made with the powellizing system. simple system. It consists either of steaming or boiling timber to remove the sap, and then dipping it in a solution of molasses and arsenic. The question -is whether if is the steaming and the removing of the sap, or the ingredients used afterwards, that confer tlie benefit on the timber. The steaming of planks for boatbuilding has been done in my own State ever since I can remember; and there is no doubt that the process does improve timber, and make it easier to handle. We ought to remember, however, that the Western Australian Government have never used karri sleepers for a mile of railway. I think that the honourable member for Capricornia was labouring under a mistake in regard to what was said by the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Fremantle. I understood those honourable members to say that jarrah, which is admittedly one of the best timbers in the world, is exclusively used by the Western Australian Government as railway sleepers, though we find that, when there is a contract with the Federal Government, about 1,500,000 sleepers are "" run in "" which they would not put down themselves. The Minister said that the number was 600,000 or 700,000, but I find that in answer to a question in the House he said that the Western Australian Government were supplying 1,500,000 sleepers, consisting of 680,000 of powellized karri, 100,000 of jarrah, and 720,000 untreated karri. It has been said that powellizing will convert an inferior timber into a superior timber. It will do nothing of the kind; there is no system in use in Australia, America, or Great Britain which will do so. There is no doubt that powellizing will make a good timber better, or an inferior timber better; but there is no process on earth that will make fhe inferior karri equal to jarrah, much less equal fo the bluegum or stringy bark of Tasmania. Has there been a fair deal ? Has every State been given the same opportunity to compete ? During the whole of the session I have been trying to ascertain the terms of the contract, but without success. of the House. Home Affairs, in reply to the honourable member for Parkes, said that it was not advisable to put the contract on the table. time ago. and prices obtainable now? The Minister told us to-day that there are only 750,000 karri sleepers tendered for, whereas, in answer to a question, he formerly said there were 1,500,000. 700,000 yet to be treated. which the Minister read to-day declares that karri should be used, untreated, as sleepers. No doubt reports tell us that treated karri can be used, and amongst them is a report from the agent of the Powell Company, who is not likely to say that the system is hot a good one. On the other hand, Mr Julius, a Government expert in Western Australia, tells us that karri is not a timber to be used for sleepers. timber untreated? 750,000 sleepers untreated. those sleepers are going to be laid untreated. not answer that question. In my opinion-, it is time there was a re-allotment of portfolios in the Government. ber not think that that is for the Prime Minister to say? the House to say, if circumstances warrant. I am not speaking harshly of the Minister of Home Affairs; but there is no doubt that he is asked to do work that no man in Australia could perform. In the earlydays of Federation the Department of Home Affairs was admittedly the easiest to administer. able member say that the Department of Home Affairs is not competent to manage its business now? so.",54,Victorian Powell Wood Process Ltd

The public works now undertaken represent many millions of pounds. The railway to .Western Australia will cost anything from £5,000,000 to £8,000,000, and the railway from Port Darwin southward will, on the Minister's own estimate, cost £.10,000 a mile, which means, for the 1,000 or 1, too £11,000,000 for construction alone. Such stupendous works ought not to be the business of a mere branch of a Department;, and it is time, as I say, that we had a Public Works Department, with a Minister at the head of it. is a re-allotment of offices, and all the public works in connection with the Postal and other Departments should be under one head. Under present conditions, we are creating two staffs and two responsible bodies, when there should be only one set of responsible officers. partment of Home Affairs a Public Works Department? Has the honourable member any trouble in getting any information from the Department now? the Minister to take my remarks as personal. I am not making a personal matter of this at all. I am merely pointing out, what every honourable member knows, that during the last five years the work, of the Home Affairs Department has been multiplied three or four times. We are putting upon that Department responsibility for work which could be very much better carried out if it were separated from the Home Affairs Department. If my honourable friend the Minister of Home Affairs would prefer to look after the construction of public works, there is no reason why he should not become Minister of Public Works. It is unreasonable to expect a Minister charged with responsibility for the ordinary business of the Home Affairs office to properly supervize such enormous expenditure, approaching, perhaps, ,£20,000,000, as will, be involved in the public works which are to be carried out at the Federal Capital, the construction of the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, and the construction of this great Western Australian railway. It is time the House and the Government seriously considered the question of a re-allotment of Ministerial portfolios, and the creation of a Public Works Department. One mistake in connection with the great public works which we have in hand may involve a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds miles, from £10,000,000 to to the people of the Commonwealth. The mistake now being made by the Government in deciding to use karri sleepers for the Western Australian railway may involve us in enormous loss. These sleepers will probably cost ios. each, and we are being committed to an expenditure of about .£750,000 for sleepers of practically untried timber, which has, so far, been condemned by everybody who has tested it. It is not fair for the Government, the"" Parliament, or the people, to expect any one man to shoulder the enormous responsibility now placed on the Minister of Home Affairs. It does seem strange to me that the bluegum and stringybark sleepers of Tasmania should have been turned down as they have been. have to be treated for white ants.",55,Victorian Powell Wood Process Ltd

319,Mr King O'malley,"They wouldtest of them been made? Why has the Minister decided to use karri sleepers, when he must know that that timber has been condemned, that there has never been a. single karri sleeper exported from Australia, and that only a few of them have been put down as an experiment by the Western Australian Government? Tasmania is exporting millions of feet of timber every year in the shape of railway sleepers, which are sent to South Africa, America, China, and different other parts of the world. It does seem strange that when Tasmania can secure tenders for sleepers in competition with the timbers of the world, the Commonwealth Government should adopt an untried and an unknown timber. that the sleepers used in Tasmania are small sleepers, compared with those which will be used on the Western Australian railway. 1 have here an expert opinion on the life of a Tasmanian bluegum sleeper. I quote from a pamphlet by Mr ber of this House must be aware that a A. O. Green, which has been circulated by the Tasmanian Government, and for which they accept responsibilityWith a rainfall in the different districts running from 20 to 60 inches per annum, on Government railways ballasted with gravel and laid with bluegum sleepers, 6 f t . 6 in. by 9 inches by 5 inches, it is shown that the average l i fe of the any one believe that the people of Westsleeper is fourteen years. The Tasmanian bluegum sleepers, under the heaviest rainfall under which any railway sleepers are tested, are shown to have an average life of fourteen years. Yet the Minister of Home Affairs turns that timber down without a fair chance, and accepts a tender for 1,500,000 sleepers of a timber which has been condemned, and which the State Government of Western Australia have not used. The State Government have been able to secure an enormous order from the Federal Government for the use of these karri sleepers without any reasonable experiment. I think that the timbers to be used on the Western Australian line should have been subjected to careful experiment. Had it not been for the enormous amount of work in the Home Affairs Department, no doubt the promise made twelve months ago to have timbers tested would have been carried out. Powellizing is not a new thing. It has been known for some years at least. Before accepting a tender for sleepers for this tremendous work, the Minister should have carried out severe tests of the timbers to be used. It is not fair that the people of Australia, who will have to find the money, should be committed to the use of this untried timber. It may not yet be too late to carry out some tests of the karri timber. The order for these sleepers has been given to the Western Australian Government, and we cannot believe that they would seek to take advantage of the Commonwealth in any way. I suggest that the Minister should even now have these karri sleepers subjected to a severe practical test. They have never been tested yet. tested for six years. life of a sleeper? back the railway for another six years. never intended to build it. business is a very old game.

369,Mr Mathews,"I was correct whenmembers do not consider the matter from that stand-point, they will give the people of the Commonwealth something which they will not digest. [9.47] I have listened with a good deal of attention all the evening to this interesting debate on the system known as powellizing timber. I listened very attentively to the testimonials which the Minister of Home Affairs read, and the only thing I have to say about them is that they are quite inconclusive, being too old. There is an insufficient amount of data to make them of any use, I think, in estimating the final value of powellizing as a process. For instance, the Minister quoted some statements made so far back as 1905, but in not one of them did I hear anything which would indicate how long this process had occupied. long the test had been applied. It seems to me that time is the very essence of this matter. the Minister was reading them,. of them. years. since the report was furnished. ground was one test. white ants. and it seemed to me, as I listened to the Minister, that there was a very simple explanation of that fact. The case, as I understand it, is that a bridge built with jarrah was lined with powellized karri, and that stood the test. eaten up. very well be. for sleepers. that point in a moment. I understand that the material for this powellizing process is made of arsenic and other ingredients. sugar. is acquainted with the matter knows that white ants will not eat arsenic without something happening. It is just possible that the lining of this bridge with a dose of arsenic, so to speak, did destroy all the white ants; but that is not a conclusive test as to the value of the process in connection with the laying down of a railway for, say, fifteen or twenty years. WhatI do not understand is the depth of the saturation. For instance, if it only stops the pores of the wood, that may be effective for a little while; that is, until one white ant after another has had his dose and died and another white ant comes up, finds a way in where there is no arsenic, and lives on, and then occur those things which we are told happened in the Northern Territory. The whole question is, How long is the protection afforded by this process going to last? If it is only going to last for six or seven years, it simply means that after that time the karri timber will be practically useless on this railway. Even the Minister admits that the moment the powellizing is exhausted this timber is very inferior for sleeper purposes. Therefore, he has applied no test to show that by powellizing he will make the life of the karri longer than the ordinary life of a good sleeper which is untreated. That is the test, and there can be no other test which is satisfactory, it seems to me. I would suggest years in the that the Minister ought to go very warily in connection with this process, and ought not O'MALLEY -Among the to commit himself to a huge expenditure of 3 money when the whole way is untried, so far as the laying down of sleepers is concerned. Can he point to a railway anywhere where powellized sleepers are used? In connection with the bridge matter, which has been made so much of, it is admitted, I believe, that karri is good for superstructures. That was mentioned in the report read by the honourable member for Fremantle to-day. That is the information supplied, I believe, where the matter has been under test in New Zealand. They say that it is good for anything above ground, but below ground nobody has yet undertaken to use it, and to trust to it for any permanent works of any kind. Although the Minister has supplied a lot of interesting material, and a lot of testimony to the value of powellizing from O'MALLEY -Arsenic and these gentlemen, it must only go for what it is worth.

It has not been tried, so far, and I cannot understand why, if the powellizing of inferior timbers makes tbem into superior timbers, or into timbers which are usable and suitable for the purpose of railway construction, it has not been tried in other parts of the world where the timber problem is a very severe one so far as railways go. There are men to-day all over fhe world looking for something of this kind, and the fact that even in his own country, where men are specially_keen in these matters, the Minister cannot point to a single line of railway laid down with sleepers made of inferior powellized wood shows that the process is by no means conclusive so far as the world's experience goes. I should think that in an undertaking like this, where there is so much at stake, and where every foot of the road has to be pioneered, the place where there is an abundance of good timber dose by is the very place where my honourable friend ought, above all others, not to make experiments. It is time to experiment when he must, but there is no need to do it here. We are told that a better kind of timber is infinitely more available, and is easier and cheaper to obtain. Why the Minister should select an inferior timber with superior timber all round must, I think, pass the comprehension of any ordinary human being. honourable friend making experiments if he were hard put to get suitable timber for making .sleepers; but, according' to ail the information we have, it is easier to obtain superior timber. Although there is more of this superior timber close at hand, yet he deliberately selects inferior timber for the purpose of constructing this line. That is a point which has not been answered, and which, I think, requires an answer from this Government. They ought to explain why they are resorting to experiments where they are not needed; why they are taking an inferior timber in preference to a superior one, for use in a part of the country which, because of its peculiarities, requires to be dealt indifferent, about the powellizing process. with in the light of experience. Moreover, the tests will not be complete until the two timbers have been tried side by side and it is shown that treated jarrah is inferior to treated karri, or at least that they are equal. I strongly urge the Government, in the interests of the work itself, in the. interests of their reputation as administrators, and of the taxpayers, not to make these experiments until further tests have been carried out. If they are inclined to be experimental in their mood, let them select some end of the railway on which a close watch can be kept, and try the experiment there on a small scale. Why they should commit themselves to this huge .expense for an inferior article while a superior .article is more easily available requires an explanation that has not yet been furnished. I hope to hear the Government do more than quote statements-writte n six years ago-as to the value of the powellizing process. We may admit, for the purpose of our argument, that powellizing is good. If it is-if it will preserve the inferior timber, and make it last longer, it surely will have the same effect upon the superior timber.. It is, therefore, not in point at all to say that powellizing will improve timber. The only point that we have to consider, as guardians of the public purse, is whether this process will make the inferior timber better, while it will not have the same effect upon the superior timber. The life of a sleeper on this line, I dare say, will not be more than fifteen years I do not quite know what is the average life of these sleepers. the minimum for a jarrah sleeper. I could understand my I should say it would be from fifteen to twenty years. To begin to renew 1,000 miles of railway is not an easy task, and the railway is not going to turn in a surplus of millions so as to enable us to deal with it in this way. This, of all other railway projects, requires the strictest economy and the greatest care in its construction consistent with its efficiency. We are building this trans-Australian railway, not merely because we hope that it will be revenue-producing, but for a Federal purpose pure and simple, and it ought not to be the ground of experimentation for various processes which may or may not prove to be good. I am not going to say one word, good, bad, or I take the Minister's statements for what they are worth. But let us regard the situation in the favorable light in which he tried to present it. Let us admit that powellizing will add to the life of the timber, and even then we shall .have vo",60,Victorian Powell Wood Process Ltd

387,Mr Joseph Cook,"On the average,reason for giving a preference to inferior timber. In the country yonder, where both these timbers grow-le t us say where, in some instances, they are equally availablethe jarrah has been preferred. The one has been taken, and the other left. That is what experience teaches the people over there. We are throwing that experience to the winds, setting it absolutely aside, and deliberately selecting a timber the superiority of which has never been provedOn the contrary, its inferiority has been proved wherever it has been tried. The^e is no case in point where the powellizing process has been adopted upon a large scale of this kind, and in connection with works which have to staiid the wear and tear of a railway line. Every one who has tried karri says that it is satisfactory for superstfuctures, but it has never yet commended itself to the railway experience of the world when used where water has to be faced. The Minister often tells us that he is fit to run the world. He told us upon one occasion, I think, in a burst of exultation, that he thought the world ought to pay him a million or two a year to run its big things. In this case, he is deliberately setting aside time is being worked now in that branch. the experience of the world. I submit that he ought not to make these experiments when there is no need to. forced to take this step, I should say, "" Make a trial by all means."" But he is not. This is a deliberate act of choice on his part, prompted by some motive which I do not attempt to fathom. It is the duty of the Minister and the Government to show why they are adopting this course, and why they insist upon applying the powellizing process to an jinferior timber for use as sleepers on this railway. Unless an answer is forthcoming, it will be the duty of the House to try to learn something more about the matter. I should have thought that the Government would undertake at the earliest moment to make a complete statement of the motives that have induced them to enter upon this departure, and to endeavour to lead the world in connection with a matter of this kind. I wish now to call the attention of the Postmaster-General to the matter of overtime in connection with the General Post Office, Sydney. I do not think he can be aware of what is going on there, or he would not tolerate it. able member,is aware of what is going on.

The honourable member is quite right. the Minister is aware of what is going"" on there. It is time that he made himself acquainted with the facts. When the trouble first occurred, it was stopped on the Minister's order. It is going on again. Men are working until io o'clock night after night, week after week, and month after month. They get no payment for their overtime, and no time off in lieu of payment. I say that this system should be stopped at once. It is nothing more nor less than a public scandal. master-General doing ?

I am simply stating the facts calmly. member send a written communication to the Minister about the matter? the honourable member for East Sydney inquire into these matters, which are taking place in his electorate? ister to make inquiries, and tell the House what the facts are. I turn to another matter. I allude to a very interesting little enterprise of the inimitable Minister who has been addressing us this eveningI mean the Minister of Home Affairs. '' chaser'' that the honourable member has before him? it is what they call a "" chaser."" It is a schedule. schedule by the Home Affairs' Department began in a very small way, but it is developing. WhatI strongly object to is the political tone that it is taking. I do not want the Minister of Home Affairs to send me the latter part of this stuff. I do not object to the earlier part of the publication. If the Minister will confine himself to telling me how works are progressing in my electorate, I shall be glad, although I must confess that I have not gathered much comfort in that direction up to date. I do not mind that, however, as long as I am reminded that something is being attempted, something done. But when the Minister sends me political argument in this form, I say to him that I would rather make my own political arguments, if he pleases. I should like to inquire whether the section of "" Census and Statistics"" to which I allude has been inserted by Mr Knibbs without consultation with the Minister of Home Affairs, or whether the Minister has directed the Statistician to make the compilation in this particular way. For instance, here is an article under the heading "" The alleged withdrawal of capital from Australia."" It is statedI t is alleged in certain quarters that'in the last year or two there has been a marked withdrawal of foreign capital from Australia. Now, such statements have been made in this House by a, number of honourable members. .This is ostensibly a reply by Mr shown by a reference to figures that there Knibbs, who offers a political argument to members of this House amongst others; and I have yet to learn that that is a function of a Statist, the very value of whose work consists in its freedom, as far as possible, from any tincture of political bias. which the people of Australia should know. I ask the Ministeri f this statement has been put in this compilation by his direction ? ister direct the figures to be compiled in this particular way? I simply asked Mr Knibbs to furnish the statistics. Minister did ask Mr Knibbs to furnish them in this particular form? The issue of this interesting furnish them to the Department. strange that on one page I find a table of comparative data, going back as far as' the beginning of Federation, while on another page I find a table for two years only? terested up to the beginning of Federation, so far as this book is concerned. table is not to the extent that Federation takes us; but I suppose it is quite a coincidence-the extent to which the present Government take us. part of it a thought. lar coincidence, then.
