Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (4.00 p.m.)--In this debate on the motion to take note of the paper on East Timor we are dealing with one of the most serious issues that we have had to face as a nation for a long time. All of the House supports the resolution of the United Nations Security Council on 15 September. In this House there has obviously been a discussion of the issues and of what led to the events in East Timor. Even today in question time, we had the Prime Minister making certain statements in relation to the matter. He did make the point that governments of various persuasions over the last 25 years or so have been responsible for far too much acceptance of what has been happening in East Timor and the role of the Indonesian military and the Indonesian government in East Timor. I think that is a correct proposition. But he also went on to imply that, because government had done this, somehow all parliamentarians had been of the same view, and that is not true. That important point needs to go on the record. In fact, from time to time a large number of parliamentarians----obviously not the majority-on both sides of the House have raised concerns about East Timor. The Parliamentarians for East Timor group of the parliament raised issues in relation to the Timor question. Today, the Leader of the Opposition referred to a comment by the Prime Minister in which he said that he criticised the left of Australian politics in 1985 in relation to their attitude to East Timor. The Prime Minister, in his reply to the Leader of the Opposition, did not actually deal with the question. He referred to the fact that governments of both persuasions had a certain position but he did not address the fact that there were many people, not just on the left I might say-although a lot of them were on the left of Australian politics-who expressed concerns in the community and in parliament in relation to the matter. Therefore, I have to say that what has happened in the Timor crisis is a salutary lesson about the excessive influence of the executive over parliament. There were concerned people on both sides of parliament and they were not able, irrespective of who was in government, to get their message or ideas across that things were wrong in terms of human rights and what was actually happening to the people of East Timor. We have to ask ourselves whether in these foreign policy areas there ought not to be a greater assertion of the role of parliament over government, irrespective of who is in government. In Westminster, foreign policy is discussed much more than it is in our parliament, and issues offoreign policy do need to be debated and dealt -th by parliamentarians. We do have our foreign affairs committees and the like-and I have participated in those committees for a long time-nevertheless, I think that it is very important that parliament asserts its authority in these matters because we can make mistakes. And in the case of East Timor, even in recent times, we have made mistakes. A lot has been written about the Labor Party's recent position on East Timor, and it has been asserted that there was a very recent conversion to that position. But the facts of the matter . REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Parliamentary Service Bill
160,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 4.00 P.m.,"Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10675 are these: in April 1998 I moved a motion in the full caucus of the Labor Party which was seconded by the shadow foreign minister in which there was a significant shift from the position which Labor had held before then in relation to East Timor. That significant shift was then followed up by the shadow foreign minister in a number of important speeches in which he explained where we were coming from-that is, the Labor Party since that time-in relation to events in East Timor. Hardly anyone could have seen the dramatic nature of these events, but it is true that the Labor Party's change of position predated the announcements by President Habibie and the others in relation to the referendum and to the choice that was supposedly offered to the people of East Timor. Many people in this debate have spoken about the failure of the government to actually foresee what would happen following the referendum, and I think there is a point that needs to be made about this. We have an expert Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but a department which is culturally dominated by certain attitudes. And what they brought to bear in this case was this: a certain culturally biased view. Because in Western democracies, or at least in democracies such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand-English speaking democracies, let us call them-people, generally speaking, accept a referendum result, they wrongly assumed that this was going to happen in East Timor. It was not what happened. If they had been sensitive to the intelligence which they received and, more importantly, to the cultural milieu in which these events were taking place, they would have realised that, just because a referendum passed, it does not follow that those who lose the referendum are going to automatically accept the result and go off peacefully. It was this cultural failure to understand people of a different background and what their response was likely to be in this matter which led to false propositions, not merely on the part of the government but on the part of the advisers to the government in foreign affairs. Maybe in the multicultural society we have in Australia we should get some government advisers in the department of foreign affairs who are broader in their cultural outlook, who understand that the reactions are not always the same. If we had done that, if we had understood the Indonesian psyche-where they were coming from, what they were encouraging in terms of the East Timorese-we might have recognised that we were facing an extremely dangerous situation and that we should avoid it. I think this is a lesson which we have to take on board straight away, because we will make further errors if we bring to this exercise a mentality and an approach which is culturally vety narrow, which presupposes that other people behave and act, notwithstanding their cultural background, in the same way, for example, as people in English speaking democracies do. Therefore we should try to make our foreign policy more sensitive to the cultural situation, to the understanding that other people have and not merely to the understanding that we bring to it. We are facing very dangerous times in East Timor. It is not clear what is going to happen, especially in Indonesia where it is possible that there could be a coup. Even if there is not a coup, the government itself, when it is elected-if there is an elected government-may persist in a policy which is detrimental to the people of East Timor. That may happen; I hope that it does not. Australia has to be sensitive every step of the way in this process. Not only do we have to support democracy in Indonesia; we also have to support those progressive forces that want to have an arrangement between Indonesia, East Timor and Australia. That should be our goal, and we should approach that goal with sensitivity to the people of Indonesia, who -!"". ft ,.. REPRESENTATIVEMAIN COMMITTEE I , 10676 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 are caught up in a battle for their own democratic rights. This is a very important matter. (Time expired). tragedy that is East Timor, our involvement in the conflict, the suffering of the East Timorese people and the cruelty inflicted by the militia on the defenceless East Timorese people. I rise today for the same reason-to enforce the importance of the Prime Minister's decision to send our troops to East Timor. Firm commitments have already been given by a number of countries to support the international peacekeeping mission and others, such as the Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka, are considering making a contribution. Since our troops landed in Dili, they have been involved in minor incidents with members of the militia and members of the Indonesian defence force. Thankfully, to date all Australians are safe and well as. they continue in their peacekeeping role. This is our nation's largest military involvement for more than 30 years and our most sensitive. Some individuals in the community are asking how the federal government could send these young soldiers to East Timor. How could we send our young men and women to a country where, at present, there does not appear to be any regard, or care, for the lives of anyone or anything? Others raise the issue of the growing discontent of some Indonesians-they do not want Australian Army personnel there and many of them have a hatred of the 'colonials' who have entered their country and taken over. Questions continued to be raised when President Habibie agreed to allow our troops to enter East Timor on the condition that a majority of them be Asian in appearance. The answer to why the federal government persisted in leading a multinational force into East Timor, even after all of these issues were raised, was that it was requested to do so by the United Nations Security Council. That is not to say that committing our defence personnel was not a carefully measured, well-thought-out decision on the part of the government. I am positive that the Prime Minister agonised over which was the right course to take. To his credit, he made the right decision. And, yes, we have all thought about what it would be like to send young Australians off into dangerous conflict. We have to remember that our defence personnel have received the best possible training to handle this mission. In fact, the Australian Defence Force is at the highest point of readiness since the Vietnam War. Our Defence Force was aware this conflict was coming and, in June this year, began preparations. Preparations began with the increase in training and operational readiness of a brigade-size force in Darwin. It was this preparation that enabled us to respond with the speed and agility with which we did, and it is a testament to the profes!lionalism of the Defence Force that we were able to do so. We were able to react because our Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were closely monitoring the situation prior to and following the results of the independence ballot on 30 August, a ballot which clearly showed the people of East Timor's desire for independence and freedom. The initial deployment to East Timor included land forces of brigade strength, logistic support elements, rotary wing support, air support and naval components. We have entered this difficult task well prepared, with every faith in the men and women who represent us in East Timor. We were so well prepared that we took on the role of leading the multinational force and are leading this force, I have to say, with the confidence and enthusiasm of a country well aware of and dedicated to achieving its goals, whatever the sacrifice.",192,Parliamentary Service Bill
161,Mr Schultz (Hume) (4.10 P.m.),"Many of my colleagues have risen to discuss theMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10677 The maturity and success with which the Australian troops are handling this crisis make it difficult to believe that it is the first time Australia has been given the task of building and leading a multinational force on behalf of the United Nations. Most of you would have seen media images of our soldiers with their heads high, weapons ready and protective transport lumbering behind them. I recall the vision on TV of our armed forces carrying the Australian flag through the streets ofDili. Any country that called Australia lazy, complacent or uncaring can retrace their steps and rethink their view, for Australia, in one swoop, is proving its commitment to neighbouring countries, its commitment to peace and, most of all, its commitment to the security of all Australians. Nobody wants conflict; nobody wants the threat of war, but we have to accept that differing views will sometimes, unfortunately, lead to violence. In UN Security Council Resolution 1264, which was adopted unanimously on 15 September 1999, INTERFET has been mandated to restore peace and security in East Timor, protect and support UNAMET and facilitate humanitarian assisted operations. That is exactly what we are doing. We are leading a strong force of international soldiers to the resurrection of a country and to ease the suffering of thousands of human beings. Sacrifices that we have made by risking the lives of a maximum of 4,500 of our men and women will ease the suffering of thousands of others. Let us make no mistake about this. Our prime objective is to restore peace and allow the people of East Timor to enjoy the independence that they have sought for so long and which now, at the highest price, is in their grasp. To use the words of our defence minister, it is also in the interests of our national security to provide support in East Timor. We in Australia continue to enjoy our oppression free democratic lifestyles. Yet we still have some idea of what the East Timorese people are experiencing. Media coverage has shown us that. But can we or do we ever really want to understand it? Do we want to know what it is like to pass armed individuals walking the streets casually killing with callous disregard for human life? Worse yet, do we want to watch our loved ones slaughtered, their only crime a desire for freedom-Jreedom which we enjoy every moment of every day? Of course we do not. It is only when we really try to visualise and feel what these individuals are experiencing that we begin to understand the importance of this peacekeeping mission. Our troops will venture home, scarred by memories, but able to continue with their lives. These soldiers will appreciate their existence in the Lucky Country and will occasionally give thought to the notion that it was their bravery and commitment that removed a threat to the peaceful existence of the East Timorese. The people of East Timor will always remember the commitment by Australians. However, many of them will never recover from the atrocities meted out by the militia and sections of the Indonesian army. It is our decision as a strong country to try to ease their pain and, if possible, allow them to begin to gain what we have taken for granted since Federation-freedom. Since Federation, Australia has developed a network of security related alliances, treaties and agreements. Australia's relationships with the United States, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada are close and enduring. Shared history and a common commitment to Western democratic ideals strengthen these relationships. Also of fundamental importance to Australia's security are its regional relationships, particularly with the nations of South-East Asia and the south-west Pacific. 10678 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 In support of these collective defence arrangements is a wider security architecture of collective security, common security and other multilateral agreements. The maintenance and development of these relationships are enduring features of the way in which Defence seeks to protect Australia, its people and interests. The Army's professional competence and reliability has been a key element in forging and building these relationships. Furthermore, the deployment of ground troops to counter aggression is the ultimate demonstration of commitment to support friends and allies. By 29 September, as the leaders of the multinational force, we will, at the calling of resolution 1264, provide a progressive report to the UN Security Council on the situation in East Timor. We have just two days until this deadline and, in my view, the report looks good. This report mayor may not recommend that more troops from Australia enter East Timor. Either way, the decision will be based on our success at undertaking the mandate given by the UN. The multinational force has been successful in carrying out the guidelines of the mandate so far, but this does not mean that death and destruction has, or will, cease. Hitting the headlines recently was the callous, unthinkable execution style murder of a Dutch journalist on the outskirts of DilL This journalist, while sadly just one of the hundreds killed by the militia or Indonesian forces, served as a warning symbol to our media and, indeed, to the nation. This man had a family, friends and coworkers and he died because he was trying to keep his countrymen informed of what was happening in this atrocious abuse of civil liberties. These forces, part militia and part Indonesian army, hell-bent on denying freedom and independence to East Timor, will not give up easily and have no regard for the lives of others. Rather than allow independence or freedom, these poor excuses for human beings would prefer to see thousands of innocent men, women and children killed or maimed and mutilated. I hope that the cowards carrying out these murders are, at the moment, confused, scared and feeling threatened by the presence of armed, well-equipped peacekeepers. The evidence provided, however, suggests they are evil, arrogant and dismissive of this show of strength. As evidence, I refer to the grizzly discovery of several bodies and further confirmation of torture that has taken place in and around Dili. This murderous abuse of many East Timorese people is occurring in an environment where our troops have not yet begun the most dangerous component of their mission. As they scour the outskirts of Dili and enter small villages and provinces within East Timor, they are sure to find more evidence of death and destruction and will inevitably clash with forces wanting to kill as a symbol of some kind of sick victory. I know a lot of the issues I have raised today are echoing the thoughts and feelings of many of my colleagues who have already risen on this subject. What our troops need now, while working towards their goals in East Timor, is our support, our encouragement and our confidence in their ability to succeed in carrying out the UN mandate and to complete it without further loss of life. We cannot question the decision of the coalition government; we cannot question our troops' ability; and we certainly cannot question the reasons associated with the deployment of peacekeeping troops into East Timor. (Time expired) of guilt that Australians, under governments of both political persuasions, have let the East Timorese people down badly from the time that we left them to the mercy of the Japanese forces in 1942, to the present period when Australia and the United Nations have failed to keep their promise to provide protection for the East Timorese people after the independence ballot.",194,Representatives Main Committee
162,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (4.20 P.m.},"I think we all speak in this debate with a feelingMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10679 However, all Australians would have welcomed the Indonesian government's decision to invite an international peacekeeping force into East Timor, while expressing our horror at the continual suffering of the East Timorese people. The point of my rising in this debate is to indicate on behalf of all Greenway residents our absolute support for the remaining people in East Timor and for the multinational peacekeeping force. I say 'remaining people' because the militia has indiscriminately slaughtered so many of the population. Not only ordinary people were killed but also several nuns and priests were killed, including the General Secretary of the Christian Church in East Timor. Other church figures such as Bishop Belo and Bishop Nascimento were forced out of their homes and had to flee for their lives. These attacks on religious people and on the Timorese, who had the courage to vote for their own democratic state, are as bad as anything that was witnessed by the victims of, and undertaken by, the Third Reich during World War II. As we sat in front of our TV sets or listened to the radio or looked at the press pictures, we must all have been experiencing real horror and absolute disgust that these outrages could have been taking place. We should particularly thank the media for their detailed coverage of this ongoing disaster so close to our shores. Some of these people have already suffered with the loss of their lives. At the same time, we must be critical of the current government for its short-sighted decision to close down Radio Australia which robbed the East Timorese people of reliable news from the outside world during their crisis. Even more outrageous is the fact that the killings and mayhem appear to be supported by the Indonesian military. The failure of the Indonesian security forces to guarantee the safety of media representatives, United Nations and Red Cross workers, resulting in these people being forced to leave East Timor, would lead ordinary Australian citizens to believe that the Indonesian military was supporting a media blackout in East Timor to hide the atrocities that were being inflicted on the East Timorese people. The Indonesian military in East Timor has to accept its full responsibility for the atrocities that were committed in its name and committed by its supporters who were well armed by the military personnel, and who, it now appears, had never intended to accept the will of the people if it did not agree with their point of view. The Indonesian government should have told its military generals not only to stop the killings in Timor, but they should have been under instruction never to start the killings or to face all the penalties that murderers should face. The international community, now with the cooperation of the Indonesian government, must move quickly to ensure that the atrocities in East Timor do not go unpunished. The security and the health of the remaining people in East Timor must be our first consideration, then evidence must be collected quickly so that the appropriate legal action can be taken to ensure that breaches of international law are pursued. It is pleasing to note that Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has stated that the United Nations will establish a tribunal to investigate crimes committed in East Timor. It is probably a bit churlish of me to say that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has been vindicated in his many pronouncements on this issue. Nevertheless, I think it needs to be noted that the honourable member was in fact vigorously chided by the government on more than one occasion for his policy stand and I suspect he may have been chided by one or two prominent people from our side as well. I believe the important issue was that at least 10680 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 someone was raising the real prospects of what finally happened, and no one can say that they were surprised by the events following the successful ballot. The member for Kingsford-Smith stated in a press release on 3 September that a senior member of the pro-integrationist militia had said: ""If the UNAMET announces that the pro-independence side has won the ballot I promise it will be civil war a g a in . ' ""If the UN says that they have won then the pro-independence forces don't deserve to live any more because it is not fair ... I would go to war to slaughter all pro-independence people, because we will be sure that they have cheated."" With this information available to the shadow minister, and being aware of the policy failures of previous Australian governments, why was this government caught so unprepared? With atrocities committed in East Timor by the Indonesian troops so well documented, such as the killing of the Australian journalists and the now infamous cemetery massacre, why was postreferendum East Timor going to be any different? The shadow minister for foreign affairs referred to several events that should have alerted the government to the tragic events that were likely to unfold in East Timor after the independence ballot. But the most poignant example was the case of Father Francisco Barreto. I quote from the honourable member's speech: Father Francisco Barreto sat in my office in Sydney. He came in his capacity as Director of Caritas in East Timor. He also called on the foreign minister in his plea for Australia to do what was required to guarantee security. He sat there and he told me of his dreadful foreboding of what was likely to happen to his people if they were left to the mercy of the militia and their military controllers. I saw him again in East Timor the day after the baIJot and the day before the parliamentary delegation returned to Australia. He repeated his fears. Tragically, his foreboding proved all too correct. He was one of the first of the Catholic priests to be assassinated by the militia following the announcement of the ballot results. Surely this man was one of the real heroes of East Timor. He in fact predicted his own death, yet he bravely returned to East Timor, having failed to obtain protection for the people that he represented. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did say in question time last week that the government did not anticipate the extent of the violence. This has been a major international crisis close to our shores and this government has been caught asleep on the job. I do not mind the government taking credit for what it has done, and that is that, once it decided to do something about East Timor, it moved quickly to get a multinational peacekeeping force together. But it would also have been nice for the government to have said that they were sorry that they did not do more to protect the East Timorese people after the independence ballot had been conducted, and so have saved many innocent lives. At least more diplomatic pressure should have been applied to the United Nations to provide adequate protection for their own staff. Hopefully, we can now be sure that, as we look towards a more peaceful future for East Timor, we will provide full protection for the people there and that we can ensure that they are provided with housing, food, bedding and other necessities of life. We must ensure that all of the people have access to emergency supplies. We must also ensure that the peacekeeping force knows that all Australians are giving them their full support. The trauma in East Timor was aided and abetted by a group of belligerent generals who were not restricted by their government, as they should have been. I join with my fellow members of parliament in mourning the loss of the many killed in Timor. I am thankful that there remain many valiant people in East Timor who will pick up their lives again, with help from us and Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10681 from other equally caring nations. On behalf of the people of my electorate of Greenway, I wish all members of the peacekeeping force in Timor a safe completion of their tour of duty and a speedy return to their home country and loved ones. . Ms BAILEY (McEwen) (4.30 p.m.)--Just a few weeks ago, the East',Timorese people voted in a democratic election to decide on their independence from Indonesia. The result was what we would describe as a landslide victory for independence with 78.6'·per cent of the East Timorese people voting for independence. It must be remembered, Mr Deputy Speaker, that over 98 per cent of registered voters voted in what has been acknowledged by those international observers of the election process as a relatively calm environment. Members of this parliament, led by the Hon. Tim Fischer, who acted as observers of the election process, have reported on the lengths people went to to ensure their vote. They reported that before the polling booths opened people had voted in their thousands, often holding their registration cards and their photo IDs in full view. In some villages where polling booths were located, people returned to vote in areas where their homes had already been burnt to the ground by the militia. This is an extraordinary commitment and demonstrates the will of the East Timorese people to exercise their democratic rights. However, as the result of this democratic vote became known, that announcement marked the end of any peaceful environment on East Timor. Credit and congratulations must be given to the officials from the Australian Electoral Commission for the work that they have done, to the consular staff and in particular to our Australian Ambass-dor, Mr John McCarthy, who has worked courageously and tirelessly throughout this entire period and continues to provide valuable advice to the government. Hour by hour we heard reports of armed anti-independence militia killing innocent bystanders, burning buildings, looting and forcing people at gunpoint to leave their homes. We then saw evidence of these acts of unbridled violence on our nightly TV news. Anyone who heard of or saw these acts of atrocities on innocent and vulnerable people, including in the following days, acts of violence against children, nuns and priests, was horrified and repulsed by such senseless violence. This violence spread to the UN and other international staff. In anyone's language, these were totally unacceptable acts of violence by the militia and those within the Indonesian military who did not disarm and stop the killing by the militia. Human rights were swept aside in this tide of violence and brutality. Australia did not shirk from its responsibilities in assisting the East Timorese gaining the opportunity to have their say in determining their future in a democratic election. Australia has not shirked its responsibility in coming to the assistance of the East Timorese in the aftermath of the election. When it became patently obvious that the Indonesian government could not or would not control the militia, many people both here in Australia and throughout the world demanded that something be done. Many people from my own electorate contacted me urging the government to do something. The reality was that' neither Australia nor any other nation could send in peacekeeping forces to bring the militia under control and stop the killings without the permission of the country they would have to enter. To do otherwise would be regarded as invasion. Instead of our troops entering the country as peacemakers, they would be seen as hostile invaders and treated accordingly. The facts as now revealed show that Australia, through the leadership and drive of our Prime Minister and so well assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Defence, achieved the agreement of Indonesia to accept an international peacekeeping force and the 10682 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 involvement of the UN. On 16 September, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for a resolution to establish an Australian-led multinational peacekeeping force for East Timor, known as INTERFET. The swiftness of this decision by the Security Council is testimony to Australia's detennination and the acknowledgment of the seriousness of the situation by the UN Security Council, not known as having a record for such swift action. Major General Peter Cosgrove commands INTERFET, with Thailand providing his deputy. New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Brazil and Ireland are all members of the coalition. While these negotiations were being pursued, Australia was also providing humanitarian assistance by airlifting homeless and displaced East Timorese and UN workers and aid personnel, as well as organising food drops to areas where people forced to flee their villages had sought refuge. I am sure that most of us saw those horrific scenes on television where parents passed their children across barbed wire fences into the safety of the UNAMET compound. Many of those children are now being cared for at the Puckapunyal any base in my electorate. I was there to welcome them and other family members who were airlifted out of Dili. I shall never forget their faces as they were assisted off the buses on arrival at Puckapunyal. Many of the children were unwell and were showing obvious signs of lack of nourishment. There are currently over 800 refugees being cared for at Puckapunyal. I want to place on record the simply outstanding job that the following people are doing: Megan McCrae and her team from DIMA, Major Blu Horton and his defence personnel, Jenny Oakley and her helpers at the neighbourhood house and the hundreds of locals who have been so generous in donating goods, services and their time. People from all over my electorate, whose generosity was spontaneous and overwhelming with the Kosovar refugees, are displaying the same level of concern and desire to help. It has been impossible to estimate exactly how many East Timorese have been made homeless and are at risk because of the violence of the militia, but it is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands of people. Australia has taken the lead not just in providing the humanitarian assistance that I have already detailed but also in assisting UN agencies to provide assistance directly to where it is needed in the shortest possible time, and making Darwin the jump-off point for international relief operations and warehouse facilities for storage, both for Australian donations and international relief supplies. As well as these efforts, Australia is making every effort to gain access to displaced East Timorese in West Timor. The Australian effort to restore peace and security in East Timor is the largest military involvement for more than 30 years, with an initial task force of 2,000 but with the capacity to increase this to 4,500, if necessary. As the Prime Minister has said, 'Our soldiers go to East Timor as part of a great Australian ... tradition, which has never . s-)Ught to impose the will of this country on others, but· only to defend what is right.' It has always been our objective to ensure that the will of the East Timorese in voting for their independence so overwhelmingly on 30 August be allowed to take effect in a stable and secure environment. Our concern also, of course, is for our troops, who have been given the task to achieve this outcome. I Was particularly pleased that the government has increased entitlements to our troops in recognition of the level of their deployment and, importantly, it has provided , the highest level of support to their families with a national welfare coordination centre being established to provide a 24-hour point Of contact for families . ., .. ' "" ,I· , REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10683 This is a tragedy that continues to unfold for a gentle and peaceful people. We must, and we will, maintain every effort to see these people re-established in their own country in peace and security. of Wills, I wish to extend to the people of East Timor our acute sense of distress and grief at that which they have been experiencing in recent times and, of course, in many respects for the best part of 25 years. It is extraordinarily difficult for us to contemplate the magnitude of the horrors that people in that place have been through and, indeed, to reflect on how difficult it will be for them to rebuild their community and rebuild their society. I feel obliged to offer an apology on behalf of all of us who have been involved in the political process. While I think we should be careful about wallowing in blame, we should understand that it is the Indonesian military who have been primarily responsible for this tragedy, for this debacle. All of us who are involved in politics, people involved in the media, and people involved in other aspects of public life, must share some responsibility for what has occurred here because there is no doubt that to some extent the people of East Timor have been effectively lured into a trap and that they have suffered grievously as a result. What has occurred in East Timor leads me to make some sad reflections on human nature and the fact that people are still prepared to kill and torture others in cold blood. Some of my earliest political views were formed as a student of history and politics at the University of Melbourne. We used to study and reflect on things that had occurred back in the first part of this century, particularly things that had occurred in the Soviet Union with the rise of communism and the work of Lenin and Stalin and others in that place. We also used to study the rise of Hitler and the Weimar Republic and things that occurred during the Second World War, and events such as the Spanish Civil War, the conflict between the nationalist and communist forces in China, and so on. It was appalling, bloodcurdling, to realise what people were prepared to do to each other as part of these political conflicts. But, when I reflect on these things, I used to think of them as things of the past, as things that belonged to a different time. I used to think that in some ways we had learned from these dreadful experiences and had become more civilised as a result. However, when we see what has occurred in East Timor and, indeed, in other places in recent years as well, we realise that this has not occurred and we have to make some pretty sad reflections. on human nature. I want to make a few brief points about this tragedy as I see it. I want to borrow to some extent from the work of Gareth Evans, who is uniquely qualified to comment on some of the history of the situation that we now find ourselves in. If we look back on the past years, one of the points that ought to be made is that Australia was not in a position militarily to stop or reverse Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975, and neither were we in a position to move in unilaterally, against Indonesia's will, to stop the recent carnage. Perhaps we could have done more back in 1975 to try to discourage Suharto at that time, but there is very little reason to believe that it would have made any practical difference. There was very little international enthusiasm for getting involved in another conflict in Asia in the wake of the Vietnam War, and it seems highly likely that the Indonesians would have invaded East Timor irrespective of our views. The de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor has been the subject of quite a lot of comment. I think it ought to be recalled and remembered that Australia continued to recognise East Timor as a non-self-governing territory entitled to self-determination. That",196,Representatives Main Committee
163,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (4.39 P.m.),"On behalf of the people of the electorate10684 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 was its status under Portuguese sovereignty and it continues to be the case under Indonesian sovereignty. We ought to be aware that, before the economic crisis of 1997, with its political aftermath which changed everything, there seemed to be absolutely no realistic prospect that Indonesia would ever actually agree to a fully-fledged act of self-determination on the part of the East Timorese in which independence was an option. I think people who followed that period closely would accept that. Of course, after 1997, this all changed dramatically and the economic crisis saw Indonesia coming under a great deal of international pressure and being very keen to get international support. So, with Suharto's downfall, we did see these new options for the resolution of the East Timor situation open up. As part of that, it should be noted that, at the time, those calling for independence-for example, Xanana Gusmao and then Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Belo---talked about a decade of autonomy before a referendum on independence was held. Those East Timorese leaders knew all too well the potential for violence if things were rushed and handled poorly. The next point that ought to be made is that a great deal more could have been done to work for better security for the East Timorese during the ballot process and its aftermath. Clearly, what went on put the safety of pro-independence supporters horribly at risk. But we did not try in this area-and, indeed, we sought to dissuade other countries from pursuing the peacekeeping options. We should have done more with the US, but I guess we will never know whether that would have changed things because we never really tried. There are these issues of the past: whether we should have had this ballot on independence without East Timor going through a substantial period of autonomy; whether we should have proceeded with the ballot in the absence of proper protections for the preservation of physical security; and also the length of time that it took us to get the peacekeepers in there. But what we have to do now is to look to the future. In looking to the future, there are a few points that I think are very important. Firstly, we have to understand that our quarrel in East Timor is with the Indonesian military, not with its government, not with its people. I think some of the protests that have been made in terms of picketing embassies, bans on Garuda and so on, miss the point in this regard. Secondly, we are leading the United Nations military operation because we reflect the collective concern of the whole international community. As Gareth Evans said: We shouldn't be spooked by the strident claims of some Indonesian spokespersons ... that Australia is playing regional policeman out of colonialist instinct and residual racist sentiment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, I want to say, as forcefully as I can, that there is no such thing as Asian human rights and other people's human rights. There are universal human rights and universal values. Next, I think we should still see our security interests as being best pursued with Indonesia and our Asian neighbours rather than against them. When this is all over-and it may take a very long time before it is all over-they will still be there and it is absolutely essential that we continue to have good relations with Indonesia and the other countries of the region. As I said at the outset, I feel-and I know that many people in the electorate of Wills who have contacted me feel-a great sense of grief and distress at what has happened to the people of East Timor during recent times. Our hearts go out to them and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to this debate in support of the UN resolution. Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10685 to have this chance to comment on what is undoubtedly the biggest defence and foreign policy challenge that Australia has faced in a generation. Ben Chifley's 'light on the hill' was, he said, to work for the betterment of mankind, not just here but wherever we could lend a helping hand. It seems to me that Australia's intervention in East Timor stands in the great tradition of one of our greatest Prime Ministers. In 1949, when the people oflndonesia were fighting to be free, the Australian government refused to support the Dutch colonial occupation and laid the basis of what should be a lasting friendship between Australia and the peoples of Indonesia. The tragedy of East Timor, which the Indonesian establishment, and particularly the Indonesian militruy establishment, seems never to have grasped, was that the Indonesians were every bit as much colonial overlords there as the Dutch had been in Indonesia itself. From 1975, Australian policy towards the forcible integration of East Timor into Indonesia has been that of an awkward and embarrassed bystander. For understandable reasons, we did not want our moral qualms to affect good relations with our giant neighbour, but you cannot have business as usual when people are being slaughtered in the street. I think the vast majority of Australians-and, I suspect, the vast majority of Indonesians-are actually relieved that an ignominious chapter in history seems now to have closed. If, as I hope, East Timor becomes a free, stable and democratic society, two people deserve considerable credit. The first is President B.J. Habibie, who realised that Indonesia's hold on people who did not want to belong was politically, economically and ultimately morally untenable, and thus permitted the United Nations ballot. The second is Prime Minister J.W. Howard, who could easily have dithered on the sidelines like so many of his predecessors, or, like the Pharisee, passed by on the other side of the road. Instead, he organised the multinational force which is now giving the people of East Timor the protection they are entitled to expect. A few voices have suggested that Australia should have let the Indonesians sort things out in their own way, as if the slaughter of innocents has ever been a part of any culture's ordinary way of doing things. A few voices have even suggested that Australia is trying to impose Western values. As the previous speaker, the member for Wills, has said, this is dead wrong. Australia is standing up for universal human values, values which are every bit as much Indonesian values as they are Australian values. When President Habibie sanctioned the free vote he was standing up for the best values of the Indonesian people, and when John Howard organised a force to stop the slaughter he was standing up for the best values of the Australian as well as the Indonesian people-values which had been forgotten, it seems, by rogue elements inside the Indonesian militruy. There have been times when Australia has committed more troops abroad. Obviously, the 300,000 who went abroad as part of the 1st and 2nd AIF had a much bigger role in conflict than the peacekeeping force. There have been times when Australia has made a bigger impact on world history-for instance, in March 1918 when the 1st AIF stopped the big German push, and in 1941 when the 2nd AIF virtually knocked Italy out of the war. But never before has Australia, in its own right, stood in this way for justice and freedom. We have never been a leader in any international expedition in this way. The UN resolution was our doing; the multinational army is our doing. None of this would have happened without us.",201,Representatives Main Committee
164,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Minister for Employment Services) (4.49 p.m.)-I am grateful10686 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 There are some voices raised now to say that, because of what is happening in East Timor, Australia is the odd man out of Asia. On the contrary, we have never had more friends than since we decided to take our stand for justice and freedom for a people denied both for far too long. As well as Australia, Thailand, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Brazil and the United Kingdom are contributing to the force in East Timor. In addition, Fiji, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Mozambique, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Japan and Portugal are assisting in other ways. The People's Republic of China is making a small but significant contribution. All this is happening because our government and our Prime Minister decided that we had dithered on the sidelines for too long. Our government and our Prime Minister decided that Australia had to lead on behalf of the suffering people of East Timor. I doubt that Australia has ever stood taller in our region. Certainly, I have rarely felt more proud to be an Australian; proud to be an Australian and humbled at the exertions of our soldiers who are standing up for decent, civilised values on behalf of the Australian and Indonesian people. I just want to close with a few observations about the way this debate has been conducted in Australia. I regret to say that on this issue the Leader of the Opposition, who is a decent man, has blown a tin trumpet. It is as if Neville Chamberlain of 1938 was pretending that he, too, would have been Winston Churchill in 1940. He seems to be saying that we should have kept good relations with Indonesia while at the same time we should have labelled them an international pariah before the ballot and its aftermath. He seems to be saying that we should have known that elements of the Indonesian army would go on the rampage and we should have insisted on armed peacekeepers before the ballot, even though he must know that this would have resulted in the ballot's immediate cancellation. It seems to me that on this issue at times Kim Beazley and General Wiranto seemed to have formed a unity ticket. The result of the Beazley line is that East Timor would have remained an Indonesian killing field and a blot on Australia's conscience for ever. today concerns a horrific situation in East Timor at the moment where virtually the entire infrastructure of the island has been destroyed. The country that was there previously, with its own designation as a territory within Indonesia, has been virtually wiped away. Australian troops are now serving with the INTERFET force in a country where most of the population has been displaced. It is a country where at least 200,000 people in the past 25 years have been killed by the occupying Indonesian forces. It is a country where the militias numbered two just over a year ago. Those militias now number 13. They cover every region of East Timor. Minister indicated in his speech on this matter-that some elements or rogue elements within the Indonesian military forces were responsible for helping the militia does not bear even the slightest or most marginal examination. The deliberateness with which the Indonesian armed forces have gone about increasing the number of militia, from two to 13-increasing its geographic spread from Ii part of East Timor to every region of East Timor-and the manner in which they have conspired and colluded to drive the anti-independence militia campaigns, has been, and should have been, evident to this government before they made their major decisions.",203,Representatives Main Committee

166,"The Notion Brought Up By The Minister For Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer","and as the PrimeMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10687 As our shadow minister for foreign affairs has indicated, there was ample evidence before the government throughout this year and prior to that that the Indonesian military were in a position where they determined their position in case East Timor should become independent. Effectively, that position was to raze the land to nothing, to displace its peoples, or to do away with them through the agency of the militias. The argument of the Prime Minister that there has been only one course to follow-only one reasonable, sensible course in all of this-is open to question. It is open to question in particular because of the misreading of history, either deliberate or unintended, that has been at the back of what should have been an informed view of what the intentions of the Indonesian military and the Indonesian government were. In 1965, during the period of time when there was a problem throughout the archipelago of Indonesia with the Indonesian Communist Party-from memory, the PKI-there were about 750,000 people killed by the Indonesian military in order to put down what the military typified as a communist coup or an insurgency. Since that time, since the establishment of the Suharto government and the relative stability brought by the Indonesian military to every village, every small part of the Indonesian archipelago, that was imposed with immense and brutal force in the 1960s, not one person who has worked in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade over the past three decades would be unaware of that campaign. Not one person seeking to give advice to the government would be unaware of the long history of what has happened, not only in East Timor but in other places. Irian Jaya is very close to Australia, as is East Timor. Papua New Guinea is free; Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia. But because there has been virtually no media coverage of what has happened in Irian Jaya over the past many years, it does not come up as the slightest blip on the Australian radar. But the department of foreign affairs has background information in relation to what has happened in Irian Jaya and in other places in Indonesia-certainly, in the last year or so, as to what has been happening in Aceh, Ambon, Kalimantan and the great instability that is there since the fall of Suharto, since his replacement by President Habibie and since the Indonesian economy was flattened to the point that 30 years of work building that economy were wiped out overnight. This is an unstable and difficult economic, political and social environment that the Indonesian government faces. The move towards democratic elections, despite the result, still hangs in the balance, and it hangs in the balance because the military still have an effective control over what happens in that parliament. Nothing demonstrates it better than what has happened in East Timor in the past year. And it is demonstrated absolutely when'you look at the fact that they have been able to turn the militias on and off at will. The Prime Minister said it was just 'elements' of the military. The foreign minister repeatedly said they were simply 'rogue elements' of the military. During the election day, 78Y2 per cent of people bravely voted for independence, an independence vote that they were precipitously driven to by Foreign Minister Alatas and President Habibie, and which this government drove towards and pushed, against resistance from the leading East Timorese leaders who had cautioned time and again that the great problem in East Timor, for its people and for the country as a whole and its future, was its security and that, unless security was guaranteed in East Timor, what has happened would happen. All of those leaders warned in relation to that. 10688 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 As the shadow minister indicated, the Defence Intelligence Organisation did its job. It is not a secret that the United States listens in to every telephone call that is made in Australia. Equally, it is not a secret the Defence Intelligence Organisation has the capacity and has for many years been listening in to all communications within Indonesia and to the Indonesian military communications as well. That is how they have gained a lot of their information. All of the Western countries have that capacity. In fact, Australia gets information from the United States that it chooses to give us from its intelligence gathering activities, and we share our views with them. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister have argued that they could not have been prepared for what happened, that it could not have been predicted because there was very little information about what impact there would be after the independence vote. But, as Laurie Brereton pointed out on 23 September 1999 in his press release: The Shadow Minister. . . said today that the Australian Consulate in Dili received from UNAMET in early August, copies of documents detailing intimate cooperation between the Indonesian military and militias and their plans for widespread violence following the vote, including the mass deportation of population and liquidation of pro-independence East Timorese. That was in August of this year, before the ballot. In fact, if we look at what material was there, in one long paragraph there is a full indication of the Indonesian military cooperating with and organising the militias, planning what would happen if the independence vote was positive, and planning not only what they would do prior to it to try to disrupt it but what would happen afterwards. They laid out a plan for the devastation of that country and the destruction of the people. Our soldiers have entered into a very dangerous situation. It was argued by East Timorese leaders that foreign soldiers coming as a peacekeeping or peace enforcement force should have come in as soon as possible and that preparations should have been made before. Their preference was not fo be driven by Foreign Minister Alatas and Prime Minister Habibie and then the Australian government into a precipitate vote, but once that had happened, even though they wanted a long period of time, they said there needed to be a peacekeeping force straight away. Instead of that we had a wait of almost three weeks. The reasop for that is the Australian government's failure to properly interpret and take regard of all of the military intelligence that it had in front of it. I think they did not take that into account because they simply chose not t-. They chose not to because they placed their reading of the situation above the accurate information that was coming in, not just a small amount, but in droves from our intelligence sources. Mr SEeKER (Barker) (5.07 p.m.)-It pleases me to be given an opportunity to contribute to this debate on East Timor. I rise to speak on this motion sponsored by our Prime Minister, a motion which should receive the unanimous approval of iill Australians and this parliament. However, what has been noticeable is the cheap, unprincipled attacks by various members of the opposition from the top down. It is both disappointing and demeaning for Her Majesty's opposition to be seen to be behaving in such a way over a matter of such national importance. If the opposition leader had reasonable grounds for acting in such a way, it could be excused. But he does not. The opposition leader claims that there has been a policy failure and that he could have done better. He claims that the large measure of this destruction could have been avoided. The only way that that could have occurred was by invading Indonesia, Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10689 and surely he is not advocating that we should have invaded our nearest neighbour as an act of war. That sort of woolly thinking is naive and shallow, and the people of Australia deserve a lot better from such a representative of this parliament. It just does not follow that the United Nations would have acted before it did just because some people with the wisdom of hindsight suggest they saw it coming. Even the Leader of the Opposition himself said on 15 July this year that it was up to the United Nations to act, not Australia unilaterally. Anyone with any semblance of understanding of the United Nations would know that the Security Council would have had any action vetoed by at least one of its members, such as China or Russia, prior to the independence vote, or indeed before it actually did vote. This nation of approximately 800,000 people needs our support and we have given it. It is to the credit of our Prime Minister and our foreign minister, Alexander Downer, that we were able to obtain, on behalf of the East Timorese, a chapter 7 peacekeeping force on behalf of the United Nations in record time and without a veto. It is in our strategic interest to have a stable, secure and prosperous Indonesia and to ensure that the UN process in East Timor moves back on track so that the overwhelming will of the East Timorese for independence is obtained. It is also important to fulfil the humanitarian expectations of both the international community and the Australian population. Contrast this statesmanship with that of the opposition whose main contributors to policy making seem to come from a rabble of left wing journalists who were rightly taken to task by the Media Watch program on the ABC last Monday. They were taken to task for their lack of consistency and professionalism. They are bereft of policy and credibility to the Australian people. The member for Kingsford-Smith is no better in his role of shadow foreign affairs spokesman. To selectively leak details of confidential cables and briefings is not acceptable behaviour for a member of parliament. Just imagine if this had been done during any of the world wars. John Curtin would not stoop this low; Ben Chifley would not stoop this low; and even Gough Whitlam or Bob Hawke would not have stooped so low. Last SundayI had the pleasure of being the guest of the Murray Bridge RSL sub-branch. They were unanimous in their support for our government's actions and deeds. They were unanimous in their support for increased defence spending and a build-up of our defence forces. I was certainly left with the feeling that they did not want to move to a republic. President Habibie is to be congratulated for his actions in allowing a free vote for independence against considerable opposition from his own people and our government for its change in policy towards East Timor. Indeed, the shadow foreign affairs spokesman is to be congratulated for dragging the Labor Party out of its acquiescent attitude towards Indonesia. Indeed, the actions of our government and those of countries such as Thailand, New Zealand and others have been exemplary in their quick and forceful commitment to solving the problems of East Timor. It is to their shame that, when Australians need to be seen as united in their resolve, the opposition is seen to be cheap, unprincipled and derogatory. I add my best wishes for a safe return for all our brave soldiers that will act as a peacekeeping force in East Timor and for all those soldiers from other countries as well. I am sure that I can express the same sentiment on behalf of all the people in the seat of Barker. In my short time in this parliament I am pleased to report that this issue has caused the greatest reaction from within the electorate of Barker and, importantly, from the ordinary people of all ages within Barker. These were people who.would not ordinarily make representations to 10690 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 me, but they were good people who wanted to see an end to the injustices inflicted on the East Timorese. It pleases me that Australians still want a fair go for all the world's citizens, no matter what their colour or creed. We have taken the hard decisions. We have applied the right diplomatic pressure and we have planned this policy position correctly. Again, my best wishes to all our service men and women and God bless them. resolution on East Timor, firstly, I want to express my disappointment that I am speaking so late in the program when I had been led to believe that I would be speaking quite some time ago. I wonder whether or not that was accidental because part of my speech will be taken up with a report to this parliament, made back in October 1991, of a delegation of parliamentarians that visited Indonesia, including East Timor, earlier that year. That delegation to East Timor was led by the then Speaker of the parliament, the current member for Watson. The visit took place on 7 February 1991. The delegation included, as well as the then Speaker and me, the member for New England, Senator Macdonald, Garrie Gibson and John Riggall, who are ex-members. It was a very complex delegation dealing with very complex matters. It took quite some time before we finally tabled a report in October, some eight months after our return. That was partly because there was quite a lot of disagreement and discontent amongst committee members. It was quite difficult for us to formalise a final report. The report itself does incorporate a minority report on the question of East Timor. That minority report was tabled by me, Senator Sherry and Mr Gibson. For the record, it recommended that a conference convened by the United Nations consisting of all parties involved in the current dispute, including the governments of Portugal and Indonesia, be held as soon as possible; and, further, that the Australian government should directly pursue the recommendations, as outlined in the report, with the UN and the Indonesian government. That was a watered down version of what we had hoped for. We had hoped to get majority agreement on that. The three of us who submitted that report actually wanted an act of self determination, but unfortunately at the time the alliance of the then Speaker with the members of the then opposition meant that that did not occur. If it had, it no doubt would have gone further towards shifting the attitude within the government to which I belonged towards a recognition that the issues in East Timor were not going to go away. While we were there there was a demonstration, and I do not think anybody was surprised at the subsequent massacre that occurred later in the same year at the cemetery. It was obvious that the tension and pressure building up in East Timor was close to boiling point, despite the comments made by General Warouw with whom we spoke at the time. Evidence of that tension was reinforced when Bishop Belo made it clear in our meeting with him that at that very moment he was not permitted to visit some people who were in jail. The report made some quite sensible unanimous recommendations, including concern about the level of Indonesian military in East Timor, but it failed to press some of the issues that we would have liked. In particular, we felt that there needed to be international recognition of and discussion on East Timor. Certainly, from our point of view, we would have liked to have put forward the view· that there should be an act of self-determination and, just as importantly, that we should change our stance at the UN by calling for these activities. The",204,Representatives Main Committee
167,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (5.13 P.m.),"In speaking on this motion on the UNMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10691 fact that that failed to get a majority recommendation will, I think, be to the shame of those who were involved. The report, on reading it now, is in some ways poignant. General Warouw was telling us then about the demonstrations of the previous year-these were not new things; they had been going on virtually annually and even more frequently-and he said that there were only a few stone throwings, that there was no big trouble, that it was not really serious, that it had all calmed down, that matters were very peaceful and that they were moving to ,persuasion. All those things were being said when that was obviously not the case when we were walking around the streets. I think the report referred to an unannounced visit to Viqueque. When we got there, because there was no forewarning, the people in the marketplace that we went to were absolutely terrified. They all hung back and everything came to a halt as soon as we arrived. In other places we had visited, things went on as normal and so the difference was obvious. When a late change of plan meant that we visited somewhere unannounced, the reaction of terror and apprehension by the community was absolutely paramount. As one of the few parliamentarians who had the responsibility of visiting East Timor on behalf of this parliament and who reported back, I am disappointed that more was not achieved as a result. In fact, after the report was tabled, some people saw the report as in some way authenticating-of course, it did not do that. With hindsight, I do not doubt that the four people who were opposed to that minority report would now regret their actions, but they could have been part of a changed attitude on both sides of this parliament and it is somewhat of a tragedy that they were not. I think this whole debate has now become something of an apology for the Howard government, and that is unfortunate. I suppose the old saying that, if you do not learn from history, you are bound to repeat it, has never been more relevant. Moving to the more current events, I will just read through a few of the headlines that we have been getting in recent times: from the West Australian, 'Timor, troops pay for PM's judgment'; the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 August, 'An open invitation to a bloodbath'; the Australian, 'A holocaust of Canberra's making'; the Canberra Times-not exactly a radical rag-'We should not have been surprised at events in East Timor'. An article in the Financial Review of 11 August, with the headline 'Good policy loses out to saving a neck', states: Saving Alexander's neck is now taking a precedence over good policy making in East Timor. Again, in early August an article in the Sydney Morning Herald talks about the Americans and says: A senior united Nations official told our foreign affairs department that Australia's attitude in East Timor was defeatist and that a peacekeeping operation would be necessary. In the Age News Extra on 11 September the headline reads 'Timor's pain; Australia's shame: why we kept Timor's secrets from the US.' The one that perhaps is the most striking is that of Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin of 21 September, 'Canberra's massacre we had to have'. All of those comments are in fact hurtful, but they go to the core of what we now have, which is an absolute catastrophe-a catastrophe for the East Timorese people, a catastrophe for the Indonesian people and a catastrophe for our country. This was without doubt the greatest disaster in Australian foreign policy ever-ofall time. We are playing with deckchairs on the Titanic as to whether we should have conscription, whether we should have 4,500 troops or 3,500 troops and whether they should be there for six months or nine months. The real issue is: firstly, how on earth do we win back the confidence of the people who used to 10692 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 see us as the experts on Indonesia and on Asian affairs and who trusted us and, secondly, how do we repair our relations with the rest of Asia? Our relations with Indonesia are dramatically affected, with the mQst recent events being the possible ban on purchasing Australian wheat, which we saw over the weekend. But that is no less so with the rest of Asia. Whilst Asian countries are involved in the peacekeeping activities-and I am delighted; I think we would all express our appreciation of that-the fact is that the idea that somehow we become a deputy sheriff for America in this region is absolutely appalling. The fact that that was not rebutted and refuted instantly and absolutely has meant that virtually every Asian country sees us as being the colonialists up to our old tricks and doing what we always wanted to do-help America in Korea, help America in Vietnam and now be America's deputy sheriff in the rest of Asia. (Time expired) and Resources) (5.24 p.m.)--The member for Newcastle has referred to a whole lot of newspaper headlines and to the more recent nonsense that was attributed to the Prime Minister regarding us being the deputy sheriff for the United States. I remind the honourable member that newspapers survive on sensationalism and, unfortunately, we have in this country nowprobably nationally-a situation where journalists are more interested in creating the news rather than reporting it. A lot of the nonsense that they tend to report, in my view, deliberately inflames the situation so that they can sell more newspapers. I suggest that we do not give them too much credibility. They certainly do not deserve it. Only yesterday I saw images of East Timor which distressed me immensely. One of our soldiers was handed a suspected militia man to apprehend. During the process of that fellow being secured on the ground I sawjournalists almost crawling over his back, and lying on their stomachs as they were jamming television cameras in the face of the militia man and in the face of one of our soldiers trying to do his job-absolutely disgraceful, and intimidating for our soldiers. A lot of this nonsense can clearly go back to the media. I rise today to support the Prime Minister in his efforts in the past few weeks to restore stability and peace to the South-East Asian region, particularly East Timor. I would also like to praise the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, for his very hard work and skill in being able to convince the Indonesian government that a ballot should take place. There is absolutely no way on this earth that there would have been any movement to restore independence to East Timor if the people there had not been afforded the opportunity to show overwhelmingly that they wanted independence. There is no way that the international community would have come on board without that. Unfortunately, the people are going to pay a very high price for it, but at the end of the day they will certainly achieve that outcome. I commend the countries that have come on board-Thailand, Britain, New Zealand, et cetera-although I must say I was very disappointed with the United States for the time that it took. I believe that it could have responded a lot more quickly than it did, and we might well have been able to be in there a little bit more quickly. However, it is there now and is committed to supporting the United Nations peacekeeping force. For that I am very grateful. In Cairns we have quite a considerable population of East Timorese, about 300. When these events started to unfold, there was a lot of concern in the area, prompting the formation of the Cairns East Timorese Support Association. It has conducted a very effective public awareness campaign, including a number of public meetings to which it has been able to attract",208,Representatives Main Committee
168,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, ScienceMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10693 quite a considerable number of people, and has been able to draw strong attention to the plight of the East Timorese people. One of the leaders and spokesmen, Antonio Pinto, has the very strong backing of a large group of people from Cairns, from a very broad range in the community. I have to congratulate them on the very proactive way in which they have acted, without resorting to racial or inflammatory tactics. What the group has done is very commendable, and I understand that several hundred are now involved in that support group. One of the things that is concerning me, and which is starting to unfold gradually, is the extent of the horrific crimes that have been inflicted on the East Timorese people. I must say I was very pleased to see the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, come out with some very strong words on this issue. I think that we are going to have--from what I have been able to see--crimes against humanity of huge proportions. It is really going to throw a very bad light on the Indonesian military and some sections of the military in particular. I think that we have to be very careful when we are dealing with this that we do not point the finger at all of the Indonesian people. We should realise that it is only one small section of the population. In a media release today, the Australian Council of Overseas Aid, which represents all the non-government aid organisations, commented that Indonesian doctors in Australia are travelling to this area to offer their support. The fact that the Indonesian community in Australia is raising funds in support of the East Timorese is a wonderful thing. I would have thought, given the seriousness of this issue, that we would have had some sort of bipartisan support, particularly from the leadership on the other side. I was very disappointed when, on the first day of this debate, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, reverted to quotes of commentators in an effort to do some mudraking. The opposition leader made many hollow claims, the most hollow of all being that the intervention of the troops should have occurred earlier on. I have got to say that the Australian government as a whole has to accept some responsibility for what has happened here, and I say that successive governments for the last 25 years have been very reluctant to do anything. As I say, I am very proud to be part of a government that has been prepared to have the political will and the courage to get out there and actually start to do something. On 10 February 1999, Mr Beazley said that he 'would be against overseas deployment of Australian troops in circumstances where there was no agreement within the community that they wanted a peacekeeping role performed'. That was on 15 February this year and he was totally opposed to going in there before we were invited by the Indonesian regime. On2 March 1999, Stephen Martin, the shadow defence minister, said: You simply cannot commit troops in advance of a final system of Government being determined by the East Timorese people themselves. That is exactly what we had to do, and he acknowledged that on 2 March. Most importantly though, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Laurie Brereton, has been ranting and raving about the fact that he had demanded sending a force prior to the ballot. This is the same man who, as Minister for Industrial Relations in 1993, said: I think one should not adopt the role of critic. One should, in acknowledgment of the vitally important bilateral relationship (with Indonesia) move in and assist wherever possible. 10694 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 The shadow minister also went on to say: We hope that in tum we could help the development of our neighbourhood, a neighbourhood in which we see Indonesia as our most important partner. So they also played a very strong role in supporting the Indonesian regime back then. It is interesting to note that he is probably the only shadow foreign minister that I am aware of in Australia who has actually been told that he was not welcome in Indonesia. I suppose that highlights his ability as a diplomat. I am pleased that Alexander Downer was working at that time rather than the shadow minister for foreign affairs. In closing, I would just like to send my best wishes to the Australian troops. Let us not forget that they will be there for some time. They have a very strong risk of facing hostile fire, from what we have seen to date. For the time that they have been there, they have absolutely excelled themselves. Also, we must not forget the families-their loved ones who are sitting here waiting on tenterhooks that they return safely. I think it is important that we all get behind them 100 per cent with our best wishes and encouragement and, of course, wish them godspeed. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (5.34 p.m.)-All Australians cannot help but be moved by events as they have unfolded in East Timor. I think all Australians are horrified by the death and destruction that has been visited upon East Timor since the people of that area voted for their independence. The UN Security Council resolution we are debating here today sets out the parameters for the UN's involvement in East Timor, especially since the ballot for independence which was held recently. Australia is playing a central role as peacekeeper in the United Nations force which is now in East Timor and which has the responsibility of securing the peace and setting the conditions for a reconstruction of East Timorese society, both of the economy and the social framework. My interest in this part of the world goes back a long way. Since my university days, when I majored in Indonesian politics, I have had an interest in the affairs of our near neighbour to our north. I was also fortunate to visit East Timor in 1994 as part of an Australian parliamentary delegation that had attended an AIPO conference in the Philippines and had also visited Singapore and Indonesia. Part of that visit to Indonesia included a visit to East Timor. We were the first Australian parliamentarians who had gone to East Timor for some time. Even today, my impressions then of East Timor are very much to the forefront of my mind as I see the graphic pictures coming onto our TV screens from East Timor. It was an area that had experienced extraordinary poverty and a strong Indonesian military presence. It is fair to say that the visit that we made to East Timor was a heavily sanitised visit. We knew that, and we were aware that the Indonesians were not allowing us to see the full extent of their involvement in that area. However, it was an important visit in the sense that we took the opportunity, as we did in Jakarta with the audience that we had with the then President Suharto, to put this issue on the table. And we put it on the table with the Indonesian parliamentarians that we met in Jakarta and again with the Indonesian military during the time of the delegation's visit. Sad to say, as one looks back at the history of Indonesian involvement in the province, that we could all say, 'We could have done more.' But, on that occasion, we did make it very plain to the Indonesian military that we were concerned about human rights violations in East Timor. I was fortunate enough to carry a letter from Catholics in my electorate to Bishop Belo. There were concerns at the time for his personal safety. The first response from the Indonesian Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10695 authorities at that time was to encourage the delegation not to see Bishop Be10. My fellow parliamentarians left East Timor and I stayed behind to deliver the letter. It was quite a harrowing experience to live for just a short time in an environment where there was a very strong military presence. It was an overbearing presence. The embassy official at the time counselled me about talking at random to East Timorese for fear that they would later become the victims of persecution by the Indonesian military and police authorities in East Timor. My community in the electorate of Corio has played a very strong role, both locally and by joining with other organisations around Australia, to keep a community focus on this issue and to keep pressure on the Indonesian government. The Catholic Social Justice Group in Gee10ng has been very active on this issue, as has the East Timor Association. I pay particular tribute to the activities of one of my staffers, Rosemary Nugent, who has put a lot of time and effort into making sure that that organisation kept this issue before the people of Gee10ng. Since the Vietnam War, Australians have become peacekeepers throughout the world, and now we find our men and women in the defence forces doing that job again in East Timor. They do it in extremely difficult diplomatic and military circumstances. The thoughts of all members of this House go out to them in that onerous task that has been put on their shoulders, to play the central role in bringing peace and security to the East Timorese in the wake of the pro-independence ballot that was held recently. The previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt, spoke about the role of previous Labor ministers. I think all members who have spoken in this debate would not wish to wash their hands of the particular roles that their governments have played in the past on this particular issue, and I do not seek to do that here. However, it is very important that the Australian people understand that the role of Australian peacekeepers in East Timor today, and the diplomatic and the military situation that they find themselves in in executing this noble task, has been the responsibility of this government, and in so many areas. there are grounds to criticise the ministers who have been making key decisions. I am appalled at the manner in which the defence minister seeks to answer questions on the floor of the parliament on his role in the government's decision making on this issue. Likewise, I am appalled at the manner in which the foreign affairs minister has conducted himself both in the lead-up to the ballot and in the post-ballot era. The consequences of the failure of government policy at the end of the day will be borne by our soldiers in the field in East Timor. That is simply the fact of the matter. In the remaining moments that I have here let me reflect on the future of our relationship with our northern neighbour. It has been pointed out that in the past the relationship with Indonesia has gone through significant stresses and strains, but none more so than we find today in our relationship with Indonesia. It is very important that the Indonesian government accept and shoulder its responsibility in this matter of the conduct of its military forces in East Timor. The fragile democracy that has emerged in Indonesia is at risk because of the situation in East Timor, but the Indonesian government, democratically elected or otherwise, must accept responsibility for the Indonesian military in East Timor. Australians, as they always have, will regard the Indonesian people as their friends, and the relationship will endure beyond this particular crisis. (Time expired) into the House by the Prime Minister. In doing so I know I have the full support of the people",210,Representatives Main Committee
169,Mr Baird (Cook) (5.44 P.m.),"-I rise to support the motion on East Timor that was brought10696 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 in my electorate of Cook. One thing that has impressed me, having been the member for Cook since the election last October, is that on this issue I have received more phone calls than on any other issue since I have been a member. It is also interesting that the particular electorate I represent has 78 per cent Australian-born constituents and 93 per cent of Anglo-Celtic background. So my electorate is not one which is highly ethnic in nature, but rather it represents middle Australia. To have that level of support to show to our near neighbours has encouraged me. Overwhelmingly, the recommendation that has been made to me is that we should support the Timorese wholeheartedly in their efforts for independence. The first aspect of the motion was the overwhelming choice for independence exercised by the East Timorese people on 30 August. As a nation, Australia values its democratic traditions, its history and the whole environment in which we live and we look to our East Timorese neighbours and say, 'What an amazing situation.' These people were under personal attack. Their houses were being burnt and their personal safety was being jeopardised. Yet they stood out in the sun, with their personal identification photos and cards, to be counted as part of the vote. Despite the difficulties, the pressure and the history, they were going to record their vote come what may. The level of the vote--there were 98.5 per cent who actually registered for the vote--is ovelwhelming, even by Australian standards. Given the pressure that was on the East Timorese, it is remarkable indeed. It is because of that fact that these people were expressing their own hope for independence. It has been a long and difficult period, not the least of which has been Australia's own involvement in East Timor. We came into that land in 1942-which actually coincides with the date of my birth. Australia has been involved for a long period. We were concerned that the Japanese were going to invade that area and use it as a base to attack Australia. Subsequently, we withdrew from that area and they had to put up with attacks from the Japanese who invaded East Timor. Following that, in East Timor in 1975, we saw the invasion by Indonesia. Australia remained silent during that period. We actually endorsed the Indonesian acquisition of the territory and never uttered any protest. Of course, it is very easy to look back, and I must admit my own personal liability in this regard. We did not regard the issue as being significant as far as we were concerned, and I did not lend my voice to the concerns of many people about the situation of the East Timorese. So today, these people, who have been through so much, have voted overwhelmingly for freedom, for independence. We can only stand back in amazement at the actual persecution they endured to reach that stage. But they have voted for independence and it behoves us as they are our close neighbours and because of their history-part of which is somewhat unfortunate in terms of our relationship with that country-and it is appropriate that we take part in the United Nations peacekeeping force and lead the delegation into East Timor at a very difficult time. Obviously, there are security problems involved and risks to the Australian troops, but they go in the best ANZAC tradition. We have seen a great resurgence in terms of support for the ANZAC tradition. At the early morning service on ANZAC Day that was held in my own electorate, they had record numbers. We recognise the sacrifices of the generations before us. Now we have our own generation who are involved in the conflict in Timor, who are representing us in that place, who are part of a force that comes from Thailand, the Philippines, Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10697 Malaysia, Korea, the USA and Britain. We have become part of the United Nations resolution 1264, which authorised a multinational force to restore peace and security and protect the United Nations mission in East Timor and facilitate humanitarian assistance. It is appropriate we do and I am sure all Australians support this effort. Of course this is a sensitive time. In his book, Australian Foreign Policy, former foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans wrote that in terms of achieving adherence to human rights standards: ... blunt statements are usually not as effective as repeated, deliberately quiet entreaties. I have heard many careless and blunt statements made in this debate without recognition of the sensitivities of our relationship with Indonesia or of the work that has gone on in the past to assist East Timor. This damages our effectiveness in realising our goals in this sensitive international arena. President Habibie gave the option for an independence vote. Ideally, we should have had a greater amount of time in order to secure peace in the province. The decision to hold the ballot is a great achievement. It is a decision which President Habibie should be congratulated on. We should be sensitive to the political pressures he is under. He did not create the East Timor problem, but rather he inherited it. There was no way of knowing how strongly independent the military is of the government. We can only make our own assessments as to how important they are in the overall equation to ensure the stability of the Indonesian government. We must be careful in the types of statements that are made. Australia could not move in peacekeepers earlier. The whole rhetoric that 'We should have done more; we should have done this' ignores the fact that on 5 May the agreement was made between Portugal and Indonesia to hold an independence ballot, and it specified that Indonesia would maintain security. Offers of peacekeeping on our part were rejected. We would have hardly wished to engage the 260,OOO-strong coercive force in direct military conflict. That is what would have resulted had a peacekeeping force been forced upon Indonesia. Without Indonesia's agreement there was no prospect for UN or other regional peacekeeping. The debate has also focused on the question of defence funding. In recent times, defence funding has focused more on hardware than on the number of troops the ADF has at its disposal. It is right that, in this period of lasting peace, Australia should find other priorities, and it is true that we now have the smallest number of personnel under arms since 1962, but the nature of the approaches to the Australian continent dictates that our focus should be on such issues as arming our submarines with cruise missiles and upgrading our FIll planes to allow in-flight refuelling. There is also no validity to the argument that Australia could have done more to pressure the United States or the international community. Our diplomatic efforts are unmatched by other nations. We are the only country to have diplomatic representation in East Timor, and we have never missed an opportunity to discuss East Timor. The United States has been fully apprised of the intelligence Australia has had on East Timor. It is with pleasure that I support this motion before the House. We do endorse the great stand taken by the East Timorese people on their decision to vote for independence from Indonesia. We welcome the United Nations security team and the fact that it is being led by an Australian group. We endorse the United Nations decision to send in a peacekeeping force. We also, as a parliament, as a country, and as parliamentarians who fully support our troops as part of the peacekeeping force, say that we are totally and absolutely with them. We uphold that great 10698 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 Australian tradition. We certainly look forward to their safe return and hope that it is without incident. We know that they go bearing with them the great wishes of Australia. We look forward to a time when both Indonesians and East Timorese can live in a situation which is one of peace in the region. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (5.54 p.m.)-I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this debate on a motion to take note of United Nations Security Council resolution 1264, authorising a multinational force to restore peace and security in East Timor, protect the United Nations mission in East Timor and facilitate humanitarian assistance. I have been particularly saddened by the events that have occurred in East Timor over the past few months. As members may be aware, I was honoured to be part of the international observer mission to the general elections which were held in Indonesia at the beginning of June. My participation in that as one of 500 overseas observers' who were working in conjunction with domestic monitors from Indonesia led me to be inspired by the process and optimistic in the lead-up to the referendum in East Timor. During the Indonesian elections there was a lot of talk about the possible corruption of the system and the violence that might occur, and some of that violence did occur in areas such as Ambon and Aceh. However, in the main, the Indonesian general election went very smoothly for the first fair and free elections that that country had held. The Indonesian people spoke out at that time overwhelmingly in favour of a change in government, in favour of ousting the Golkar party from power and welcoming a new political party into power in Indonesia. I came back from that exercise optimistic and inspired, hoping that the same result might have occurred in East Timor during the referendum. I cannot reflect on what could have been done, should have been done or may have been done. I cannot reflect on whether we should have sent in peacekeepers earlier or whether there should have been more international presence in East Timor in the lead-up to the referendum and following it. WhatI can say is that at the moment there is a multinational force in East Timor to try to enforce peace, to try to protect the East Timorese people, and, even though it may be too little too late, it is a step which Australia has taken in the right direction. During the Indonesian general election the people spoke out to change the government without fear of reprisals, in much the same way that the United Nations and Australia encouraged the East Timorese people to vote in their referendum. We encouraged them to tum out to register to vote in the referendum, which they did in droves. We encouraged them to tum out to vote in the referendum, which they did in droves. As we know, that vote was overwhelmingly for independence of East Timor. We and the United Nations said, priQr to the referendum, 'We are here to assist you. We will stay with you throughout the vote and we will protect you after the vote has been counted.' The East Timorese people placed their trust in the United Nations but I believe that the international community failed the East Timorese people. People of any nation should never be subjected to the atrocities that reportedly have been inflicted upon the East Timorese people for voting for independence and participating in a democratic process. But finally Australia and the international community rose to speak out against these atrocities that were being committed in East Timor. I would just like to reflect on some of those actions which have taken place in our communities. On9 September this year, we held a meeting in the Newcastle Town Hall. It was initiated by the Lord Mayor, Greg Heys. There were various speakers, including the Anglican bishop, Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10699 Roger Herft; the Catholic bishop, Michael Malone; the federal member for Newcastle, Allan Morris; the Newcastle Trades Hall Council Secretary, Peter Barrack; the state member for Newcastle, Bryce Gaudty; and Sister Carmel Hansen from Caritas. Sister Carmel had been working alongside the Caritas sisters in East Timor. She said that about 40 minutes prior to her coming to speak to the packed Newcastle Town Hall, she had heard that a sister that she had been working closely with and had made very good friends with, had been hacked to death with a machete in East Timor. She chose to share her emotions with us at that time. We were also spoken to by Stephen O'Brien, another local Hunter Valley person, who was a volunteer district electoral officer in East Timor, and Stephen Tickner, a media photographer who had recently been in East Timor. They both recounted some of the ah'ocities and the violence that they had witnessed. That meeting at the Newcastle Town Hall was packed, as I am sure other town halls right across the country were as public meetings were held, and Australians stood arm in atm together and spiritually side by side with the East Timorese people. On 10 September, another meeting held in my area was of the Retired Mineworkers Association of the Northern District. I would like to mention a resolution which the Retired Mineworkers Association, Northern District delegates conveyed to the Prime Minister on that day, following their meeting. They urged the United Nations to urgently dispatch a peacekeeping force to East Timor to oversee and facilitate a peacekeeping process. They also called upon the trade union movement to exercise its ability to impose sanctions against the Indonesian government while the Indonesian government was seemingly not supporting, or not inviting, an international peacekeeping force. The MUA in Newcastle was the first group of trade unionists which placed sanctions against loading Indonesian vessels in the port of Newcastle. This delayed the loading of the ships for nearly two weeks. Patrick, which was the force behind the attacks on the unions early last year, supported their stance, indicating that any trade unionist who was involved in employing sanctions against Indonesian vessels during this time would not be penalised at all under the current Workplace Relations Act. An article in the Sun-Herald on 12 September described the international world trade union movement consolidating a campaign to impose sanctions, both economic and political, against Indonesia and the Indonesian government. This is just another message about the way that, when people are in trouble-whether they be workers, downtrodden citizens of another country or people being denied their participation in a democratic process-they are supported by trade unionists in all countries right across the world and across all industry bases. The international trade union organisation vowed to end the massacres and enforce the sovereign decision of the East Timor people and of the United Nations. (Time expired) in the main chamber after so many speakers, I guess it is going to be very difficult to say anything that may be new or have more impact than all of the things that have been said before. Nonetheless, I can understand why other speakers from both sides have been talking about this issue and why I feel impelled to talk about it as well. It is something of great importance not only to Australia but also to our region and the world as a whole. I have to say that I have never known so many people in my electorate to be so concerned and so upset about any particular issue. In the days when things were consolidating, virtually every time there was a television news broadcast of some of the disgraceful, horrifying and atrocious",213,Representatives Main Committee
170,Mr Nehl (Cowper) (6.04 P.m.),"Coming at this stage in the debate in this committee and10700 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 things that were happening I would have grown men and women calling me in tears because of their emotional response to those news telecasts. The response was one of pity and sympathy for the East Timorese. It seemed that people's judgment was overcome very often by their emotion and by their concern. I can understand that. I had one man ring me in tears demanding that we, as the government, should just go and bomb Jakarta that night. This was never an option. A number of people rang and said, 'The government is doing nothing. You are not talking to anybody. You are not talking to the Indonesians, the United Nations, the Americans, the Malaysians or anybody.' This was totally untrue because the government was doing everything it possibly could in an endeavour to put together a solution to the situation which we now see, with the United Nations resolution of 15 September being put into effect with a multinational force led by Australia. We need to point out that this is only a temporary situation. Stage2 will be a United Nations peacekeeping force with blue berets or blue helmets. We would expect that Australia will be part of that, but it will be led by the United Nations. We are acting on the basis of a United Nations Security Council resolution passed unanimously, which is quite amazing, in the shortest time that anything of that nature has ever taken place with regard to a similar peacekeeping force. With the greatest respect to my friends in the opposition on the other side of the chamber, not all of them but too many of them have used this particular issue as a little political whipping boy to attack the government. I am sorry that they did that because I believe that the government did everything that possibly could be done. I want to say, too, that we are not at odds with the Indonesian people; we are at odds with the atrocious things that happened in East Timor. We felt obliged to take the action that we did. We had to lead in the formation of the United Nations force, but it should be clearly understood that we have no argument with the Indonesian people as such. It is perhaps difficult for them to understand at this stage and I can understand that we may suffer in terms of our trade relations; nonetheless, whatever the outcome, we had to take the action that we did. There is one issue that is not germane to this but it is relevant in my mind, and that is-as has been said time and time again and the Prime Minister said it only today-every government of Australia up to the present time has not acted as we would, in retrospect, wished they had acted in regard to East Timor. The issue I want to throw in as another matter concerns West Papua, West Irian. We have not spoken in this parliament very much about West Irian since I have been here. But just as the issue of East Timor was a thorn in the side of so many of us because of our inaction when that invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians happened, I have to say to this committee and to the House in general that, for me, it has been a thorn in my side too that Australia did nothing when the Indonesians took over West Irian. We should remember that the island of Papua New Guinea was, in 1848, divided into three to carve it up between the Germans, the British and the Dutch. Of course, in World WarI we liberated-to use the modem word-the German colony of New Guinea, we got the mandate over it from the League of Nations and it is now an independent country. But in 1848, over 150 years ago, that island was carved up. On1 October 1962, post World War II, the Dutch government handed over their former colony of West Papua to an interim United Nations administration. I will not go into great detail on this because I have a lot more I want to say about East Timor. But West Papua was a Cold War sacrifice-it was a sacrifice to the aims and the objects of the Cold War Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10701 participants. On1 May 1963, Indonesia became the new colonial power in west Papua New Guinea and we did nothing about it. I regret to say that it was in the time of the government of former Prime Minister John Gorton and we did nothing about it, and I do not believe the Labor opposition at that time did anything about it either. I think it is to our eternal shame that not only did we not protest about the invasion of East Timor, but that we sat back and did nothing about the fate of the West Papuans. To come back to East Timor and, in particular, to our forces there, I have to say that I am so full of admiration and pride for the way they are conducting themselves. I have the greatest sympathy for their families, their loved ones, at home. Like everybody in this house of parliament, we all pray and hope that nobody will be seriously injured or killed. We cannot guarantee it, unfortunately, in this situation. But the message that we have to send to those Australian men and women who are serving in East Timor at the moment is that the whole of Australia is proud of them and what they are doing. I will not run off a list of all the countries that are participating, but it is more than encouraging that there have been so many countries which have come forward to say they will participate in one way or another-some with troops, some with ships, some just with money. It is worth noting that the Security Council resolution was unanimous. China was one of the members of the Security Council which voted for the resolution, and that is pretty significant. I was in China the week before last and it was in their news that China had agreed to send a small group of civilian policemen to participate in the peacekeeping task. It does not matter that it is small. It is the very first time, I believe, that China has participated in anyone of these peacekeeping forces or activities. I think it says an enormous amount for the correctness of what is going on. It is such a pity that the militia in East Timor-or from West Timor-have behaved in the way that they have. I do not think that anybody witnessing that film footage will ever forget it; I know I certainly will not. It is up to the Indonesian government to realise that it has let down the people of East Timor. The army were there as peacekeepers, even under martial law, and they did nothing-I would find it very difficult to be convinced otherwise. They just let the militias run amok. It is also a great shame for Indonesia that they apparently allowed their troops, their people, to raze Dili and other areas to the ground to destroy the infrastructure, which will make it so much more difficult for the free, independent country of East Timor to emerge. Long-term, Australia's aim must be to assist that new country to emerge in a free, democratic manner, and we should give every assistance we can, once the emergency is over, to provide the East Timorese people with assistance to let them go forward in freedom and peace into democracy. this debate tonight, and in doing so, I thought I might give a brief report of a couple of public meetings in my electorate of Bendigo, which have taken place in the previous two weeks. The first one was a meeting in Castlemaine on 7 September, which was called at one day's notice; approximately 90 people attended that meeting. The second meeting was a few short days later in Bendigo, again at short notice, and some 120 people from the Bendigo district attended that meeting. That meeting, incidentally, was called by the city of Greater Bendigo. This not only highlights the depth of feeling that people in Bendigo have over this issue, but I am sure it is reflected in communities all over Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the resolutions carried at those meetings.",217,Representatives Main Committee
171,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (6.14 P.m.),"I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in10702 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 Leave granted. The resolutions read as followsEast Timor Meeting Castlemaine-Tuesday, September 7, 1999. At a public meeting held in Castlemaine, Victoria, called at one day's notice, 86 people attended and passed the following motion unanimously: That this meeting demands the immediate and complete withdrawal of Indonesian Armed Forces from East Timor to be immediately replaced by a Peacekeeping force made up of Australian and/or United Nations Forces. Until Indonesian Forces agree to leave East Timor, we demand that the Australian Government implement the folIowing actions: 1 A complete trade embargo on all trade with Indonesia. 2 Halt all financial assistance to the Government of Indonesia. 3 Immediately desist from training members of the Indonesian Armed Forces in Sale or any other Australian Bases. 4 The mobilisation of Australian Military forces to give armed support and protection to the People of East Timor as they move towards their democratic choice of independence. TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR FOLLOWING THE HAVOC IN AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IN FAVOUR OF CUTTING TIES WITH INDONESIA. The meeting commenced at 6.00 p.m. and was attended by approximately 120 Bendigo citizens. The meeting was addressed by Mr Victor Kaye, who had recently returned East Timor, after serving with the United Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor. The following resolutions were passed by the meeting: That this meeting of Bendigo citizens request: 1 That the Prime Minister, the Honourable John Howard and the Foreign Minister, the Honourable Alexander Downer, express our outrage on behalf of the Australian Government to the Government and Military of Indonesia, and their failure to meet their obligations of protection and security for the East Timorese people as defined by the United Nations Agreement of the 5th May 1999. 2 That a PeaceKeeping Force be deployed in East Timor and trade sanctions be imposed on Indonesia forthwith. 3 That the Government be urged to use its influence with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to withhold all monetary assistance to Indonesia immediately. 4 That Bendigo people and businesses be urged to boycott Indonesian products and suspend all dealings with Indonesia until continuing peace and freedom is established in East Timor and all East Timorese have control of their own destiny in accordance with the United Nations 5th May, 1999 Agreements. 5 That the recommended action expressed in the letter from Amnesty International be endorsed which requests the sending of telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/airmail letters, making the following points: (a) Expressing your horror at the situation in East Timor, and your fears for the safety of the entire population; (b) Noting that the United Nations is a party to the 5 May 1999 Agreements, and has an obligation to the East Timorese people, who, despite threats and intimidation, courageously exercised their right to self-determined by participating in the popular consultation on 30 August 1999; (c) Asking what, as a member state of the United Nations, your Government is doing to protect the rights of the East Timorese people; Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10703 (d) Urging your Government to impose an immediate moratorium on all transfers to Indonesia of military, security and police equipment, weaponry, personnel or training which could be used by the army, police or militias to commit human rights violations. The moratorium should include all financial and logistical support for such transfers, including spare parts and maintenance, licensed production, brokering and Government-to-Government agreements; and that trade sanctions be imposed. 6 That it be recognised that the resolutions made are aimed at the Government and the military of Indonesia, rather than the Indonesian people. 7 That there be an immediate and safe return of all East Timorese who have been forcibly removed to Indonesia. 8 That the Federal Government be advised that the Bendigo community stands ready to provide whatever humanitarian aid it can to assist those affected by the civil strife in East Timor. A collection was taken up to aid the people of East Timor. Funds would be distributed by Victor Kaye, through the United Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor. The Mayor and Council were thanked for arranging the public meeting. A small group of people arranged to meet after the meeting to arrange a candlelight vigil and rally. The meeting concluded at 8.00 p.m. who is a resident of Castlemaine in Bendigo. Mr Kaye was in East Timor as a United Nations observer at the recent election, and made it back to Castlemaine on Monday, 6 September. Ironically, Mr Kaye said, the election day was quite peaceful. When he arrived at the guesthouse he was to stay in, an eight-year-old boy played his guitar and performed a song for him. The boy politely refused Mr Kaye's offer of 500 rupiah, or about $A1, for performing the song by saying, 'I do it for you.' Such is the generous nature of the East Timorese people. But, as Mr Kaye reported, there were ominous undertones beneath the surface of normality. Violence erupted in the area he was staying in on the Friday, when the house Mr Kaye was staying in was fired upon. He and others who were staying in the home, including judges from the International Commission of Jurists, had to flee for their lives. The house opposite had exploded and was burnt out. The group fled to a second house and then a third house in the one night, dodging shots and being pursued by armed militia. Mr Kaye slept on the bare floor, rather than risk sleeping on a mattress, in case a fire bomb was thrown in. Outside, the streets turned to chaos, with incidents which made Mr Kaye sick to his stomach. He reported on a situation where a soldier ripped a three-year-old child out of the arms of its father, wringing its neck and throwing it into a burning house. Such were the activities being pursued by the militia. As Mr Kaye said, these people are not soldiers, they are dogs. On Saturday morning, Mr Kaye and his group managed to get a spot on a vessel which was due to depart East Timor. But as they departed, about 15 shots were fired at the vessel from the wharf. When the boat docked in the West Timorese harbour, the group was told to stay aboard for some hours, and then they realised that they would be taken away for interrogation. Again in fear of their lives, they grabbed their bags and barged through the armed militia guarding the wharf. 'Just a few days later, we would not have been able to do that,' Mr Kaye said. 'We were in mortal danger.' The group escaped into the streets and eventually made it back to the airport and back to Australia. That is a snapshot of the experiences of one man who has been very active in East Timorese affairs for some years and who was, as 1 said, over there as an observer in the elections. Man's inhumanity to man has never ceased to shock or amaze me. The stories relayed by Mr Kaye,",219,Representatives Main Committee
172,Mr Gibbons,"-The guest speaker at both meetings was a man named Mr Victor Kaye,10704 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 and indeed the horrific pictures we see on our news bulletins, show that what has happened in East Timor is probably one of the most barbaric acts we have witnessed in our region. Last Sunday week, I attended the arrival of the second wave of refugees to the Puckapunyal safe haven, along with the member for McEwen, who is the patron. I remember standing at the door of the bus, helping the people off it, and seeing the looks of absolute despair on their faces, especially the elderly and the young kids. It was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life and something I will probably not forget for some time. As I mentioned before, we have seen horrific footage coming through on our television screens each night. Obviously, equally barbaric is the action of the Indonesian military as they withdrew from the province and bum and pillage everything that is left. Whilst the Indonesian people cannot be held responsible for that, their military certainly can, and thereby their government, and they must be forced to pay for the rebuilding of East Timor. Australia has its peacekeeping forces in East Timor, and we all welcome that. I know I speak for all people in central Victoria, and in fact for people all over Australia, in wishing those forces a successful mission and a safe return to Australia and their families. We owe an extreme debt of gratitude to the people of East Timor. We know how much assistance they were to us during the Second World War, and anything that this country and this parliament can do to help them must be done. They would have to be one of the most gentle races of people I have ever had anything to do with. Our hearts go out to all of them. negligent over the past 9years in that the problems of the people of East Timor have not been a top of the mind issue for me. Since my election in 1990 I have tended to concentrate on domestic issues such as economic growth, taxation reform, tariffs, welfare, and internal regional issues. These were the issues which were of primary concern to my electors and to organisations and lobby groups within my electorate. East Timor was never raised during these 9years as a top of the mind issue. It was not something we had to focus on as a matter of urgency. There was, however, one exception, a constituent of mine by the name of Mrs Olive Taylor, a member of the Noosa branch of the Liberal Patty. Olive had a background in defence and her late husband was an international pilot with Qantas. Olive had a passionate concern for the people of East Timor and she never let an opportunity slip by without raising the plight of the East Timorese. Even in election campaigns when the topic of conversation was far removed from East Timor, Olive would go to public meetings and get to her feet and push the case for the problems of those people. Like most Australians I was complacent, and like most Australians I left these problems to others whom I thought knew more than I did and who could handle foreign relations far more competently than I could. I accepted the assurances of the experts on both sides of this House over the past 25 years. East Timor has always been someone else's problem. So, Olive Taylor, all that time you were right. Your perceptions were far better based than many of your complacent colleagues, including me. The eyes of the world finally focused on East Timor immediately prior to, during, and after the independence ballot. We sent unarmed Federal Police to supervise the ballot, we sent officers of the AEC, and Tim Fischer led a delegation of members of parliament to supervise the ballot. What happened after the results of the ballot were announced is now a sorrowful chapter in world history.",221,Representatives Main Committee
173,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (6.20 P.m.),"-Like many members of this parliament, I have beenMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10705 When the violence broke out Australians, including me, received a very loud and clear wakeup call. Australians saw atrocities never seen before in this region. We have seen over recent years atrocities, murder and the torture of people in Rwanda, Somalia and Kosovo, but that was far away, wasn't it. East Timor is part of our backyard. Nothing in my 9Y2 years has generated such a reaction from the people of my electorate as has the slaughter of the East Timorese. Families watching the nightly news saw men, women and children being butchered before our very eyes. We may never know the extent of the carnage. The reaction of the Australian government was swift and right in the circumstances. It reflected quickly the mood and anger of the people. No member of a civilised society can stand back and condone the wholesale slaughter of his fellow men. I refuse to believe that the average person in Indonesia condones the wholesale slaughter by the integrationist militia, apparently aided and abetted by the Indonesian army. No-one knows how this situation will evolve or how long it will take to resolve, but it does highlight a problem for this country. We have tended to put our heads in the sand and we have ignored the problem on both sides of the House. That problem is defence forces morale and conditions of service. Really, there have been decades of neglect and decades of erosion. Each one of us in our electorates have servicemen and we have ex-servicemen who have left the service and who wish they could have continued being servicemen, but the economics and the reality of pay and conditions are such that these people have no choice but to leave the defence forces. I believe there are key points to note in regard to this issue of conditions of service. The Defence Efficiency Review conducted recently set defence personnel ranks at the lowest level since before the Vietnam War. Now we see we have a problem and we have to face that problem. How do we resolve it? Conditions of service erosion in recent years include: inflation has outstripped pay rises for at least the last three years and maybe more; rations and quarters charges for single defence personnel have increased; married quarters entitlement ratios have decreased to the disadvantage of servicemen; remote locality leave travel entitlements are affected by things like fringe benefits tax; constant changes to the defence superannuation scheme have increased the age entitlements that can be received. Resignations in the Army are far outstripping recruitment. These are notes I have made resulting from quite a few years of dealing with defence personnel and their complaints to me as constituents. Complaints they make include that they are not happy with defence leadership. There is a perception that the ADF lacks leadership at the highest levels. They say that there is serious dissatisfaction with the Chief of Defence Force as well as other key army leaders who have sold out defence personnel for their own gain. There has been a series of senior leaders in Defence who were effectively sacked or passed over because they had the integrity to say 'enough is enough'. They complained bitterly about cuts in the defence budget. Another problem area which has to be addressed is isolation. Because of Australia's vast coastline, the Army particularly has seen an increasing trend of moving troops to isolated locations such as Darwin, Puckapunyal and others. Prime locations in urban areas are being sold with no concept of the long-term effects. As I say, these are issues that the men are raising with me. The view on conscription is that it should be discouraged. Good recruiting and conditions of service will rectify this situation. A good soldier is one we can use for at least 10 years, 10706 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 not one year or two years. It would be better to have half the number of volunteer soldiers with higher morale than soldiers who do not want to be there. There would not be one professional army officer who would support conscription in this situation. The East Timor crisis, they believe, will in the short term lead to an increase in recruitment. This crisis has also helped to increase morale and revitalise the Army. Army personnel actually look forward to overseas operational service; this is what they are trained for. In conclusion, it is time, at the tum of this century, to address what has happened to our defence forces and their readiness. I have the greatest of respect and sympathy for the men and women who have gone to East Timor to serve their country, and for those who will also go in the coming months. I feel for their families, the mums and dads, the wives and the kids and the loved ones. This nation owes them a great debt and I think we should start paying it now. Thank you. Sitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. resolution on East Timor, like other members speaking to this motion, I want to relate and state what I feel on this occasion. I believe the last time. I spoke on something as tragic as this was before the House in January 1991. On that occasion, the Hawke Labor government had just made what was arguably its most difficult decision: to commit our Australian troops to the Persian Gulf as part of the United Nations force determined to liberate Kuwait from the occupying Iraqi army. Recently, as we all know, circumstances in East Timor have demanded that the Howard coalition government make an equally difficult and painful decision. Beginning on the weekend of 17-18 September and continuing in earnest throughout last week, Australia's service men and women once again entered a theatre of conflict with all the dangers and threats inherent in such a commitment. Just as the coalition in opposition offered its full support to the Labor government in 1991, so too do we, the Australian Labor Party in opposition, offer our support to the Prime Minister and his government in making this difficult decision. We just wish the decision had come sooner. While the opposition's support for Australia's troops in the field and for the government's decision to send them to East Timor remains unqualified, we do have some very serious concerns about the way the government has managed our role in this whole affair. I would like to return to those concerns later in my speech. Australia's forces in East Timor have embarked on an operation unique in our country's military and political history. For the first time, Australia leads a multinational force into the field. This is a challenge far beyond anything that Australian troops and service personnel have encountered since Vietnam and beyond. The objective of the multinational force is, I believe, no less forbidding-that is, the restoration and maintenance of law and order in East Timor and the facilitation of a peaceful, safe environment for its citizens that will allow them to move peacefully towards full self-determination. As a consequence of taking on this leading role, the numbers of Australian service personnel committed to the conflict are required at a level not seen since the conflict in Vietnam. Indeed, we are seeing a level of mobilisation of the Australian armed forces that we have not seen, I would venture to say, since World War n. Any time our Australian men and women are placed in a dangerous or a threatening position as a result of their membership of the armed services it gives us all cause for concern-for them and for their families and loved ones. But somehow our concerns and our emotions this",222,Representatives Main Committee
174,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (8.00 P.m.),"In referring to the United Nations Security CouncilMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10707 time are even stronger. As the Leader of the Opposition said while addressing those troops in Darwin on 20 September: This is different. He went on to say: This is a new stage in the responsibility of the Australian people. This is a different page in Australian history being written here. In talking with my constituents over the last few weeks, I know that, especially in recent days as Australia's role in this peacekeeping force has become clearer, they, too, recognise that a new chapter in Australia's history is being written with our involvement in East Timor. With this greater level of responsibility come greater challenges, greater dangers, and Australian service men and women face the prospect of paying greater sacrifices for their service. We know they will not shirk taking on that extra responsibility. We also know they will not fail to take on any challenge and see it through successfully. We know they will not falter from paying any sacrifice to get the job done. For that, we all owe them a great debt of gratitude. Without a doubt, the people of Australia are fully supportive of our men and women in uniform. The people of Australia are with them as they embark on this dangerous mission. Our thoughts are also with their families and their loved ones, especially their spouses, partners and children. We pray it will not be too long before they are again united, safe and on home soil. They are extremely well trained. They are competent and capable young men and women, they have trained for the moment when their country would call on them to put their training to good use-and now is that time. It would have been better, however-certainly for the people of East Timor-had that time come earlier. We cannot discuss the situation in East Timor-the devastating violence and terror that have been witnessed there over the past weeks and the involvement of our Australian troops-without raising questions about the way in which the federal government has handled this matter. One of the more obvious questions-and one yet to be adequately addressed by either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs-is why a greater effort was not made to convince the Indonesian authorities to introduce a UN peacekeeping force into East Timor before the independent ballot took place. If, as we know, that it was only because of the influence of the United States that the UN and Australia were able to convince the Indonesians to receive an international peacekeeping force in East Timor, then surely logic dictates that, had we marshalled US influence prior to the independence ballot, then a multinational force could have been in East Timor much earlier. It is a question that remains to be answered. If such a force had been in place, could we honestly say that the level of violence and upheaval that we have seen in East Timor would have taken place? It certainly would not have occurred on the same level that we have now seen. We knew-both from leaked documents and from the brazen statements made by senior members of the TNI-that the Indonesian army and its sponsored militias intended to embark on a reign of terror if the result of the ballot was a vote for independence. Australia's failure to get an international peacekeeping force into East Timor before the ballot-indeed, the Prime Minister's and foreign minister's grim refusal to even consider such a proposal-hangs over this government as the INTERFET force, having arrived in Dili, surveys the devastation and destruction. 10708 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 Indeed, questions must also be raised over the Australian government's failure to work harder at convincing Indonesia to allow East Timor a period of greater autonomy before an independence ballot took place. This would, I believe, have created a much smoother transfer to self-determination. That is what the people wanted. The Prime Minister seemed to want that, too, at one stage. He raised the prospect of East Timor passing through a period of greater autonomy before reaching independence with President Habibie. But, once the President signalled his opposing view, that was the end of it for him-our Prime Minister-and the foreign minister. Indeed, the Prime Minister and foreign minister helped drive the independence ballot forward at a cracking pace, ignoring all the signs and the military intelligence that, to push ahead for a ballot-especially without an international peacekeeping force in placewould lead to the slaughter of hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent people and the complete devastation of East Timor. We have to tum only to our nightly news to see that this has happened. Australia played a part in convincing the East Timorese that they could vote in safety and security and that there would be no retribution if they exercised their democratic rights. Because of our government's mismanagement of this situation, and because of the mismanagement of the UN, we have failed the East Timorese people-just as governments of all political persuasions have failed them in the past. We failed, but they have paid the consequences for our failure. The foreign minister has repeatedly congratulated himself and the government on the speed in which they have rallied an international force together for East Timor, but, if the truth be told, we saw three weeks of desperate improvisation on behalf of this government. The foreign minister and the Prime Minister should not be allowed to claim any credit for themselves over their handling of the East Timor situation. Quite the contrary, rather than accept the accolades, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have many serious questions to answer regarding the debacle into which East Timor has finally descended. Once and for all, they have been exposed, I believe, as amateurs in foreign affairs that we already knew them to be, but this time we have had and seen devastating consequences. You cannot rewrite history. I believe Prime Minister Howard has tried to do that, but the people of Australia have long memories and will not allow it. I was most concerned to see on tonight's news our forces going through town after town and village after village and the scorched earth policy that has been implemented. On tonight's 7.30 Report, sadly, it was said that there was 'destruction on a scale that no-one could ever have imagined'. I believe-and reports have shown this, even on tonight's news-that over 80 per cent of houses, buildings and infrastructure have been completely destroyed as the TNI make their way back to Indonesia. As our people start coming in to aid, assist and help the East Timorese people, it is going to take more than six months; it is going to take more than 12 months. It will take many years to put that country back on its feet. The people are certainly entitled to help and assistance but, more importantly, they are entitled to explanations, as the people of Australia are entitled to explanations. One of the first major questions has to be why we did not move sooner and why we did not act more quickly. More importantly, when people say how quickly we did act, I say to those people that there are many people now buried over there who perhaps would have been alive today if we had acted sooner than others thought was a great triumph, and I really condemn the' government for that. (Time expired) Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10709 Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (8.10 p.m.)--The present debate on this UN resolution on East Timor reminds us that in Australia we take for granted a freedom of political expression which does not occur in Indonesia and does not occur in East Timor. It was 24 years ago when Indonesia invaded East Timor; it has been there for that time. Now, I understand, only 1,500 of its troops are left there. Of course every Australian has been positively dismayed at the scenes that they have watched in the news on television. I have not had the opportunity tonight but I understand, having phoned home, that the pictures are still of people finding trashing of buildings and trashing of areas as the TNI pulls out. I understand that photographs have been found linking some members of the TNI with the militia. This has all been most unfortunate and most extraordinary. But, as the Prime Minister has said as recently as today in the parliament, governments of both political persuasions have made mistakes in their foreign policy in relation to East Timor and also to Indonesia. I am reminded of just how important that vote for independence was: East Timorese being given, for the first time in their lives, the opportunity to vote and have some say in their future. I think there were velY few people around who thought that this was all going to go smoothly. The fact that the ballot took place at all was nothing short of extraordinary. The opposition has chosen to attempt to score cheap political points on this but there is no way, as we have heard time and time again, that Indonesia would have allowed a peacekeeping force in to supervise that election. It was held with United Nations observers, including some of our own members of parliament. But what we have seen since, some people are saying, was predictable. The Prime Minister, in speaking to this motion, said that there was no more serious decision that any govermnent could take than to commit Australian military forces abroad. There was a great seriousness in the chamber as we all listened to what he had to say, but then I was quite genuinely dismayed to hear the Leader of the Opposition attempt to turn this into a political debate, because this was not a subject for one political party over the other. It was something for the Australian parliament and it was something for the Australian people. It was a very serious commitment to be committing young, well-trained men and women of the Australian armed forces to combat in another country--extremely serious. Yet even on that occasion we could not have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition would join in a bipartisan way with the Prime Minister of this country to discuss this motion. I regret having to bring politics into this at all, because I think we are the most fortunate people, in the most fortunate country, in the world. But I remind those on the other side who wish to make this a political issue that it was the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who signed the Timor Gap treaty with no parliamentary debate, no usual process. He was making foreign policy work in that area in what he considered was a relationship built on his special relationship with the leadership of Indonesia. And a previous Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, while not endorsing Indonesia's invasion of East Timor 24 years ago, certainly understood it and publicly said so. It is unfortunate that today, and during this week as we speak to this motion, these things have to be raised at all. I would like to think that Australian armed forces in East Timor could be sure in the knowledge that every member of the Australian public and the Australian government was behind them wishing them a safe and speedy return and that they were being prayed for every day. There would not be a mother in Australia who would not be concerned 10710 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 that her son might at some stage have to fight to serve his country. These are very serious times, and we do not know when they will finish. It has been very important that Australia act with the United Nations, that we act with the countries that are friendly in this region and that we be part of a multinational force. Growing up after the Second World War, I remember discussions at that time that the United Nations was to be our great hope-the great hope for having nations around the world working together to ensure peace. The United Nations has taken part in 42 peacekeeping operations since 1948, and Australia has participated in 20 of them. They include operations in India and Pakistan from 1950 to 1985, a Federal Police presence in Cyprus from 1964 until the present, operations in Iran and Iraq from 1988 to 1990, in Cambodia from 1991 to 1993, in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to the present, in Somalia from 1992 to 1995, in Rwanda from 1994 to 1995 and in Mozambique in 1994. All these efforts are reminders of what Australia has been doing as part of our United Nations obligations. But this is different. This is our troops in large numbers. This is Australia leading a force in our-own part of the world. The founders of the United Nations were determined that it would work to save succeeding generations from the ravages of war. Peacekeeping has perhaps been the most visible way in which the international community has tried to meet this objective, but there have been other ways, too. There has been increasing interest in the provision of electoral assistance, and Australia has been increasingly involved in this area-as we were in the ballot that took place on 30 August. Like other members of this parliament, I have been influenced by what I have heard from my constituents. Working in my Adelaide office sometimes well past 8 o'clock at night, I know that people ring the number on instinct-probably not expecting it to be answeredbecause they have watched the news that night and have seen what has been occurring. It has always been beyond my comprehension how one human being could slice up, torture or put another to death. It is something I have not really been able to understand-unless one was protecting one's own family and one's own life. But that has not been the case. The East Timorese, like other oppressed peoples around the world, have suffered and are suffering. But Australia is doing its best. To every man and woman in our armed forces who is there serving their country, doing what they are trained to do and representing all other Australians in East Timor, I wish a safe return. I trust that this matter will not be a long time in the settling, but I fear otherwise. I think there will be a high financial and personal cost to Australia being part of this peacekeeping force-or trying to install some kind of peace before it can be kept. I wish our troops well, I wish the East Timorese some peace in the future and, also in the future, I hope that, as we debate these issues, we will do so as a parliament and leave cheap political point scoring out of it. our troops in East Timor well and a safe return home. While we may disagree in some ways with the government's method of getting there, no-one-either on my side of the parliament or on the government's side-is in any way being derogatory about the role of Australia's soldiers in Timor. I am sure that was not the import of what the member for Adelaide was saying about my colleague Mrs Crosio, who spoke earlier. . Like everybody else in Australia, I have been deeply saddened by recent events in East Timor. It is impossible not to be moved by the tragic circumstances of the East Timorese with the graphic images and reports of violence and atrocities perpetrated upon them. The",224,Representatives Main Committee
175,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (8.20 P.m.),"All members of parliament on both sides wishMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10711 ovelWhelming majority of the East Timorese people, when given the opportunity on 30 August to choose their future, voted for independence. No-one could doubt their determination to be independent and their joyful reaction when they learned the result of the vote. About 80 per cent of those eligible to vote voted for independence and the people, at the end of it, were very happy. Unfortunately, their happiness was short-lived. A wave of violence swept over the island and it seemed little could be done to stop it. The frustration of being unable to do anything to realistically stop the violence was felt by all Australians. With the United Nations resolution in place and the presence of the multinational force in East Timor, there is now a different set of feelings being experienced. For the first time, Australia is leading a multinational force and that puts an awful responsibility on us. Many of us will know someone who has a family member in the defence forces. Young men and women are being transported to the small island of East Timor not to defend their own country but to help stand up for a small group of people who want to be their own people and not part of a neighbour's empire. There are a number of things that worry me about our involvement in East Timor. We are not a large country in world terms. We are larger than East Timor, of course, but not a really big player when it comes to world conflicts. Sure, we are willing to join in with other democratic nations to assist where we can, but we cannot do it all on our own. While I am aware that we are certainly not alone in East Timor, the government has accepted a huge responsibility. While I have confidence in our armed forces, and am sure that they will do their very best in the situation they find themselves in, I do not want Australia to be drained of the best resources and left with a depleted Defence Force in years to come. It also needs to be acknowledged that this is not going to be a quick and easy operation. It could go on for years. Even if the militia were quietened down, you would still need a strong presence there. You could never be sure that peace could be sustained. When the issue of East Timor is discussed by politicians, the temptation to bring politics into it is almost ovelWhe1ming. Political point scoring is the order of the day for many. I do not want to do this. I want to look to the future and what is best for Australia as well as Timor. We need to keep our mind on the future and our place in the world. We need to think of the importance of independence for the Timorese and the importance of Australia's relations with our neighbours. We are not a large enough country to sustain a big commitment to East Timor indefinitely. We cannot afford to have our troops locked into an engagement in East Timor forever. I believe we need to have a realistic balance which is in the best interests of the East Timorese and the best interests of Australia. There is probably a need to have some of the political rhetoric wound back. This morning on AM I heard a diplomat say that he believed that the last few weeks had destroyed 50 years of engagement between Australia and Indonesia. If that is true, I think that is a very sad thing. It is sad for both Australia and Indonesia and I hope that it is not true. Too much political rhetoric by both the newspapers and politicians can end up making it. situation which is terrible even worse. Comments, for instance, made by commentators that compare what has happened in East Timor to the Holocaust and to Rwanda are just taking it too far. Let us be very clear about this: the Holocaust and Rwanda were state sponsored murder, sanctioned from the highest level of the state and were state policy. No-one in their right mind can say that what has happened in East Timor is the policy of President Habibie and his government. There are disturbing reports that elements of the TNI 10712 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 have been involved, but no-one can say that President Habibie has had this as his government's policy. To compare what has happened in Timor to the Holocaust and to Rwanda says just that. Indeed, I think the reverse might be true: that President Habibie, if he can be criticised in this issue, can probably be criticised for moving too fast to allow self-determination and independence. It is not the policy of him or his government to kill the Timorese people. Other government commentators have suggested that there should be conscription to fill up the Australian Defence Force. What a quaint 19th century Tory view that is-let's start a small war and conscript the unemployed to fight it for us! These are the sorts of rhetoric which I do not think do Australia or Indonesia or Timor any good. What has happened in Timor is most disgraceful. If only one person has been killed it is a tragedy for that person and for their family, and we Australians must provide help. But let us not demonise the Indonesian people in doing this because this is not a war that they have started. They are not the people who are to blame. Some inquiry in the future might show us who are the people to blame. But it certainly is not the Indonesian people and I do not believe it is President Habibie and his government. Indeed, he will probably be the person who loses his job over this, so he will pay the price for the decisions that he has made. It is really time for us to wind back a bit of the political rhetoric. And it is time for us to consider what we as Australians can do and what we should be encouraging our friends in Indonesia to do. We should not be getting into these bellicose arguments about how it is necessary for Australia to rearm, about how we should be improving the size of our Defence Force, because all that does is send a signal to our neighbour that we are not really interested in engagement and involvement with them but that we see them as the enemy. I think people in this parliament should make sure that we do not see that happening. Having sounded those cautionary thoughts, I sincerely hope and pray that the situation in East Timor can be put right. Unlike most Australians, I have had the privilege to visit East Timor and I was struck by the relative unsophistication, quiet dignity and determination, and deeply felt Christian faith of the majority of its people. For many years now those people have suffered and have wanted to lead independent lives. That is what I think a lot of the people in Indonesia have wanted to do. What we have seen in the recent little while have been steps towards proper and open elections and democracy in Indonesia. That, for us, in our region and with our largest neighbour, is very important. I do not think we should see all those good things that have happened in Indonesia get washed away, in the minds of Australians, by what has happened in Timor. As I said at the beginning, the people of Timor have been trodden on and have suffered the consequences of being a small community with a bigger neighbour, but they have remained true to themselves and their faith. We should remain true to our friendship with both the Timorese people and the Indonesian people. We should make it very clear, in the things we say and the things we do, that we have a vast distaste for what has happened in Timor and that if the Timorese people have chosen to be independent they have that right, as we and others have that right. But we should ensure that we also send a signal to our friends in Indonesia that our argument is not with them, that our argument is about what has happened in Timor. I think we should just take a step back and take a little bit of a deep breath to ensure that we stand up for the rights of the people of Timor and, in the same circumstances, ensure that we encourage the Indopesian people to continue the friendship that they have with us and Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10713 to continue down the path of democracy that they have started to take. These are thoughts that we should consider at this time as well. Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (8.30 p.m.}-It was with a degree of hesitation that I put my name down to speak to this motion because I thought, 'There isn't anything that I could add to this that hasn't already been said.' I am sure that many members in one way or another have reiterated what has gone before them. But then I realised that I do not come to Canberra just to say and do the things that I think are important; I am here to represent more than 80,000 people in the electorate of Bradfield. From their perspective, I have a responsibility to put at least some comments on the public record. As our troops sailed to East Timor, it was with a sense of great apprehension that their families bade them farewell. That the safety and lives of Australians have been put at risk to secure the peace, dignity and survival of others is not new to Australians. Although mateship did not make it into the preamble, I thought it was rather ironic that, almost a century after Federation, that endearing, often uniquely Australian characteristic was being demonstrated by young Australians abroad-in this case in our region. That is something that ought not be lost on us. It reminds us perhaps that the more things change, the more they remain the same. I also thought that, as devastating as the inhumanity of human beings is towards others, as devastating as the images of East Timor and what we read about it are, in other parts of the world things as bad as that-in some cases even worse-are happening every day, yet in many ways, Australians seem desensitised to what goes on. But in this case, we have something happening on our doorstep, and for reasons that are obvious to anyone who observes the political process and human behaviour, we understandably have greater concern about that. Yet some of us have been frustrated in not having other significant nations throughout the world appearing to share our concern. With a sense of impotent rage, we have seen---certainly I have seen, along with all honourable members-and heard cruel evidence of man's inhumanity to man in East Timor. At the same time, the political machinations of the Indonesian army have made very little-if any-sense, as soldiers seemed unwilling or unable to prevent the brutality so evident to anyone who can see, hear and feel. As each day unfolds, as the peacekeeping forces go further into East Timor, it would seem that there may be some basis for accusations that the Indonesian military--or at least sections of it-if not participating in some of these violent acts, certainly may have stood by as they occurred. Over the last month my office has been deluged-and I mean deluged-by people advocating everything from the immediate dispatch of warships to harsh economic reprisals and indefinite trade bans on Indonesia. While not all of us have kept our feet on the ground, we are indeed fortunate that our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, has. Troops into East Timor without United Nations endorsement and Indonesian government consent would be tantamount to invasion. There is every reason to believe that had Australia pressed stridently for a UN peacekeeping force before the ballot was held, it is likely Dr Habibie would not have allowed the ballot to be conducted at all. Australia is in no position to invade anyone, let alone a country with military resources at least 12 times greater than our own. In advocating a vote for independence and subsequently leading the peacekeeping force, Australia is not regarded by many Indonesians as their favourite neighbour. Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world with 211 million 10714 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 people, attributes blame for a disastrous situation to Australia, amongst others. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this, like our troops, Australia is headed for an uncertain future. As the economic repercussions of this human tragedy face the discipline of capital markets, a number of issues are already emerging. Defence expenditure is likely to increase. Whatever the member for Watson has said, it has become obvious, even to the most left-leaning Australian, that Australia is going to need to invest more in its defence forces, not because we want to send a message to Indonesia and other countries in our region that we are arming ourselves, but rather because it may be said that Australia is not perhaps adequately equipped through its defence forces to provide its contribution to humanitarian and peacekeeping work as we are currently doing. The peacekeeping role is indefinite and is likely to require vigilance of shipping and trade routes, amongst other things. Refugee intakes might need to be increased at a time when tension in the region militates against Australia's ambition to become one of its key economic players. Advocates of economic sanctions against Indonesia, particularly the IMF rescue package, ignore two critical facts. The first is that the people who would suffer most are already the poorest of the poor. Sixty million Indonesians have been sending their kids to bed hungry at night for almost two years, and some people want to make it worse it would seem. The second fact relates to self-interest through which, with a degree of concern, I notice foreign policy seems to be conducted increasingly over the last few years. Financial instability means one thing, and that is political instability. To urge the withdrawal of financial assistance to a country that is only beginning to emerge from the worse currency and equity crisis in its history is to impose a slow and agonisingly painful revenge which will not easily be forgotten by our northerly neighbours. Australia's measured response has been as decisive as circumstances would allow, and the UN Security Council, as we have been reminded by the Prime Minister, has made a significant decision in record time. In avoiding precipitate action it may be that a far worse long-term outcome of human and social condition dimensions has been avoided. We will never know. One of the disappointing aspects of the debate about the motion, and I refer particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, is that there have been some attempts by people on both sides of politics to assign blame for foreign policy decisions in relation to East Timor over the last 20 years. It is very easy for any of us to look back in hindsight and say that the right or the wrong thing was not done, but I do not think it is going to serve the interests of anybody for us to blame any of our previous governments, whether they be Labor or coalition governments, which really thought that they were doing the best thing for both the East Timorese and for Australia at the time. The other point that I would like to make is that Australia and Indonesia are evolving in their own respective ways. Australia is only just beginning to adjust to its place in this region, both economically and socially. Mr Keating as the Prime Minister pushed it in a particular direction, much to the consternation of many Australians. But so too are the Indonesians starting to feel the first stirrings of real democratic processes. I think it is going to be a tumultuous period. We do not know where this whole East Timorese situation is going to end up, but it is going to be difficult. I would like to think that in the long term Australia and Indonesia and our other Asian partners will develop a more enduring and substantive relationship than perhaps we might have been led to believe existed when Mr Keating was the Prime Minister. Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10715 I would also like to reinforce the comments made by the member for Watson criticising suggestions that we have conscription. I would like to fully endorse those remarks. I believe that it is nonsense to be suggesting that we go back to conscription, particularly in relation to this matter. And whilst I am a strong supporter of work for the dole, I do not particularly want to live in a country that has to fight for the dole. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. I strongly support the motion in the terms that have been described. Let us hope that Australian troops are home soon, as much for the sake of the East Timorese as for ourselves. motion in relation to East Timor. Part of that motion was a formal recognition of the UN Security Council resolution 1264, which is the subject of tonight's debate in the Main Committee. There can be no greater decision of any government than to commit troops for overseas service. No matter what the circumstances, a debate by the federal parliament in this environment is of great moment. The fact that the motion of last week received unanimous support in both houses is a clear reflection of Australia's resolve to contribute now, in 1999, in the most positive way to help the East Timorese people attain their quest for independence. In my original notes, I have written that I do not wish in this debate to enter into discussion about whether the Howard government could have acted in a more decisive manner to minimise the bloodshed since the referendum on 30 August. On some occasions, having reviewed the debate and having now listened tQ the further debate, I am a bit ambivalent about whether I wish to enter into a further discussion. The issues have well and truly been canvassed, especially the clear evidence of the availability of intelligence reports and the statements of East Timorese leaders predicting that the retribution carried out by prointegrationist forces would, in fact, occur. Whilst it is important to acknowledge the availability of these assessments, I believe it is still important to acknowledge that these are not the first intelligence reports over the last 25 years that have been ignored by successive governments. When some of those on the other side choose to criticise the actions of Labor governments over the past 25 years-whether it be the Whitlam, the Hawke or the Keating government-there has been a fairly consistent attitude by the leadership of not only the Labor Party but also the coalition on this matter. That is not to say that there have not been brave souls, individual members, ,who stuck their necks out in putting views that went against the views of the leadership of their political parties. The issue of East Timor has always had a special place and, as individuals, from time to time we have tried to come to grips with the reasons for previous decisions. The reaction of young people to the issue of East Timor has interested me. Soon after being elected to this place, I came to realise that many Australians who questioned what successive governments had done in East Timor were too young to realise what had actually happened. They had therefore made a judgment based on the evidence that they had gathered, and based on what they thought should have happened in contemporary times. This is an issue that has always been important within the Australian public. Therefore, the men and women of the Australian defence forces who are now deployed in Timor have the greatest support of the Australian public. No matter how robust the debate has been on the motion moved in the House of Representatives or on the notation of this UN resolution, there is one clear fact: all members",228,Representatives Main Committee
176,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (8.40 P.m.),"Last Tuesday the parliament unanimously passed a10716 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 of this parliament give their greatest support to the ADF forces. They support those forces and hope that they are able to return safely as soon as possible. I know that this is one occasion when I feel very confident that I can put not only a personal view but also a view on behalf of the people I represent here in this place-the electors of Scullin. They would wish me to convey to those people serving in East Timor-in the knowledge that those people serving will do so in the most professional manner possible-the hope that they return safely in the not too distant future. Regrettably, it would appear that that not too distant future may be a little way off. In talking about those serving in the ADF, we would also like to ensure that those serving as humanitarian workers in East Timor also feel the support we have for the work that they are doing in trying to help the East Timorese people back to the greatest degree of normality. It is important that those who have committed crimes against humanity in East Timor should be brought to account by the world community. It is not trite to say that some of the footage and stories that have been beamed out of East Timor are of the most horrific crimes imaginable. It would not be appropriate to think that those who carried them out would be able to get away with what they have done. Another thing that Australia should playa leading role in is the humanitarian effort. Whilst, on behalf of the community, the government is encouraged to provide a safe haven to some of the refugees from East Timor, we should also remember that those efforts should be carried out in the context of ensuring that those who wish to return to East Timor can do so with great safety and success. Another point that we should remember is that there are many in the Indonesian community who are involved in a great struggle to further democratise Indonesia, and they are deserving of our praise and our support. When we make comments, in general these should not be seen as being against the whole of the Indonesian populace but as a recognition that there is a determination that out of this Indonesian democracy can also gather great strength. In the quaint language of the UN, this particular resolution concludes by saying that the Security Council decides 'to remain actively seized of the matter'. I am not too sure what that actually means. If it is a very positive notion, I hope that the UN, through the Security Council and the other agencies, is 'actively seized' of the matter with great urgency and determination so that the East Timorese people may be freed from the situation in which they find themselves. People such as Xanana Gusmao, Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Belo--the leading public figures who have continued the struggle and who are supported by the many thousands brave enough to participate in the referendum to overwhelmingly support independence-are deserving of our greatest support. That is the reason Australia is involved-not for any reasons of territorial gain, but to see that the right thing is done. I have quoted James Herny Scullin before, but I never actually thought that it might be appropriate in the context of a foreign affairs matter. This quote appears on Scullin's memorial. It says: Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong. It is in that context that I wholeheartedly support Australia's involvement now in INTERFET and, if required, later in peacekeepingtroops in East Timor. that Australia has taken in East Timor. Our action follows an internationally monitored",233,Representatives Main Committee

It is an honourable task that they are carrying out. It is a great pleasure to be able to stand in this House in bipartisan company to support such an historic resolution. I am sure the Australian defence personnel involved in East Timor, and the wider Australian community, will also welcome the bipartisan approach taken by this parliament. It is with hope that we in Australia look to a resolution of the humanitarian and military crises within East Timor and the quick restoration of good relations with Indonesia bilaterally and in the context of the international community and the region's neighbours. East Timor has been for too long a running sore in South-East Asia. Although it is painful for all involved to have to dress the wound now, we look with hope to its rapid healing and to the time when we can all get on with helping each other to a better future without the threat of violence and the intimidation in East Timor. The history of the region since the Second World War has confirmed to all in South-East Asia that peacefulness and good relations within the countries of that region, and within the region itself, are the highway to economic prosperity for Australians, Indonesians and everyone else. We keep extended our hand of friendship not only to the East Timorese but to all the people of the Republic of Indonesia. I give thanks to the Indonesian military leadership who, in the best spirit of international community cooperation, have facilitated the safe arrival of the international force in Dili. With respect and a warm heart, I sincerely ask the distinguished members of the Indonesian parliament and the Indonesian people to support their President's call for them to accept East Timor's vote for independence, as it is in their and all their neighbours' self-interest to do so. All in our region must look to the future, seeking reconciliation and mutual cooperation. The dispatch of the Australian troops to East Timor on Monday, 20 September 1999 saw an interesting confluence of time and destiny. In a few weeks time there will be the centenary of the Australian colonial expeditionary force that was sent to South Africa following the outbreak of war between Britain and the two Dutch South African republics on 11 October 1899. After the Federation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901, there began the unification of these units-consisting largely of mounted rifles-in action in South Africa, which led to the whole force being designated for the first time as an Australian force. There is another dimension to the dispatch of the Australian troops this week that is of notable distinction. The arrival of the troops was preceded not by an air bombardment of high explosive bombs, but by an airdrop of food and other emergency supplies to a displaced, starving and terrorised population. I ask those who are critical of Australia's involvement to note this. This follows decades of development and periodic emergency assistance worth billions of dollars to our neighbours in the near region. If anyone in Indonesia wonders why Australia has taken the lead in coming to the aid of the East Timorese people, it is quite transparent. There is nothing sinister about it. It is a natural extension of the goodwill policies, largely in the form of grant aid, that Australia has been following in Asia for almost half a century, beginning with the Colombo Plan. As I 10718 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 speak, it is not bombs that are exploding on the Indonesian archipelago, but emergency food parcels fluttering to the ground, and you cannot get more benign than that. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Australia's armed forces have come to know full well the seriousness of armed conflict. They have tasted the fruit of victory and have suffered the consequences of battles lost. Indeed, not only have many Australians on active war service lost their lives in the region but many have suffered terribly as captives. Australians understand what it means to be unarmed, unprotected and at the mercy of bmtal and armed adversaries. This is another reason why Australia has given a high priority to the elimination of suffering in East Timor. We carry a heightened awareness of events in this part of the world, partly brought about by the shedding of Australian blood. The loved ones of the Australian military personnel who today are left behind in Australia are experiencing the daily anxiety of hanging on to every word of every news bulletin and reading every newspaper report they can find. I have more than a few of those loved ones in my electorate. There are a number of military installations there, including one of Australia's largest military installations, the Holsworthy defence area. For this reason, and for the sake of those who are personally involved in events in East Timor, I want to make something quite clear. It is this: despite what others have said in this House during this debate, the crisis that has occurred in East Timor is not due to any failure in Australian policy but to a failure in Indonesian policy. Australians have no cause to feel guilt or blame for what has happened and nor should this government. Nor should we be the scapegoat for the failures and misdemeanours of others or for the passing political advantage of others. I want to say to the families of our troops that, whatever happens, your loved ones are in East Timor for the best possible reasons. They are there following the best possible efforts of the government and the international community to bring about a peaceful and just resolution of the slaughter and mayhem that has occurred in East Timor since Indonesia agreed to a United Nations ballot earlier this year. The government has ensured that the rules of engagement allow them to adequately protect themselves and the lives of others. As well as the best wishes of the Australian people, Australian defence personnel deployed in East Timor will receive tax free salaries and other benefits, including a set of tax free allowances totalling $125 a day. As well as receiving additional leave entitlements and loan subsidies, they are covered by the Commonwealth veterans' entitlement and the military compensation scheme should they be harmed. They will also become entitled to service pensions. The Prime Minister has cautioned Australians about the dangers of this humanitarian mission to establish the rule of law and order. I have no doubt that Australians will stand up and bear any unpleasant consequences of the danger because we are united in our objectives in East Timor, as set out in the resolution before the House, and because it is a just cause, without any shadow of a doubt. On behalf of many Australians, I give thanks to God for the democratic institutions of our nation which we too often take for granted. I give thanks to God for the men and women who place themselves in danger in order to protect others, whether it is to be police or emergency services personnel here in Australia or defence personnel undertaking hazardous assignments overseas. We pray for the peaceful and just resolution of the conflict in East Timor. We pray for the safe return to their homes and loved ones of those who have been sent forth from Australia and from other countries to make up the international force in East Timor. We thank Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10719 God that help has arrived for the displaced, sick and dispossessed. We pray for his blessing upon all in the region. For all our Australian troops, we pray that he will bring them all safely home. Mr O'KEEFE (Burke) (8.57 p.m.}-I would like to add to the comments of many members in the House on this motion on the UN resolution on East Timor. I commence by saying that I do not intend to canvass again many of the views that have already been put forward by members. The views about our involvement, as expressed in the contribution of my leader, Mr Beazley, at the commencement of this debate, sum up my views about the political issues surrounding our involvement. As one of the members of this place who was fairly heavily involved during the mid and late 1980s in the task of assisting Vietnam veterans achieve some proper recognition, I want all those serving to know that military involvement weighs heavily on the national psyche. There is not a person in this place who does not take very seriously and heavily the weight of decisions such as this to become involved. As every other member has expressed wishes of electorates, I also express the best wishes of every constituent in my electorate of Burke for the safety and well-being of the members of the defence forces now serving in East Timor and those who will follow on as well. In the few minutes remaining for my contribution, I would like to canvass some ideas I have about where all this really ought to go a little further down the road. I believe that the Australian government has no option but to be planning now for a long-term involvement not only in the securing of peace but in the long-term rehabilitation of what has become a destitute, ravaged nation of people. We must make a long-term commitment to securing peace and security for these people. I believe that we now need to begin planning and perhaps building a coalition of helpers, of volunteers for when we are in a position to guarantee their safety and to say to the aid agencies that it is not just a case of securing peace for East Timorese people, not just of helping people return to their homeland, not just a matter of securing emergency accommodation and emergency food supplies for these people, but that in fact Australia has a much greater and longer-term obligation than that. I believe that, for better or for worse, we have been a significatit player in bringing on this vote for independence, in bringing on what has taken place, and I believe there is a national will to help in the long-term rebuilding of East Timor. I have not experienced that national will in such a broad range across the community in relation to anything else that we have been involved in in my time as a member of parliament. The will towards helping here is across all age groups and for a whole lot of different reasons, so I think there will be the opportunity for Australians to be more than willing about this. The picture that I am trying to create is that the Australian government, with the support of the opposition, should be planning not only a long-term presence to secure safety and peace but that those transport links, the accommodation links, the supply links should be kept open. We should now be starting to build a volunteer force of people who are prepared to go to East Timor-be it for a month, two months, three months or a longer term-to actually take part in replacing the infrastructure and in helping people rebuild their homes; even going and looking at the 1974 manifesto of Fretilin. Fretilin's manifesto in 1974 talked about building a nation. At that time, in the broad policy guidelines, there were items such as building a justice system, building a system of civil administration, building schools, running an education system and taking part in the world as 10720 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 a fully developed nation. Nowhere in that 1974 manifesto of Fretilin did they envisage doing it from mbble and ashes. The fact is that East Timor starts from a worse position than it was ever in in 1974 and a worse position than anyone ever envisaged. In my view, that means that Australians have a key role to play. I cannot help but reflect on the many thousands of Australians who are in the huge group of 50-year-old people who have been displaced from the work force or told they can take their lump sum and go in their four-wheel drives and caravans and wander around Australia for the next 20 years. Do we seriously think that that is what these people want to do for the rest of their lives? Of course it is not. I think anyone half smart could now start reaching into groups of people like that who have enormous skills and who are grossly underutilised in Australia. It might be one in 100 of them, it might be one in 1,000, but I reckon it would be closer to one in 10 of them who would say, 'Yes, if you could transport me there, if you could provide me with food while I am there, if you can guarantee my security, I'll go up and help them build a school, I'll help teach those kids, I'll help set up a local government structure, I'll help build a trade union,' or whatever it might be. If we were to begin planning and talking about such a notion, I believe you would be amazed at the response you would get from Australians who would be willing to go and provide their presence, providing we can guarantee their security, providing we can transport them there, and providing we can accommodate them while they are carrying out that task. Such a proposal sent my mind back to the airline pilots strike of the late 1980s when there was a situation where the military did transport many of us around, not just VIPs and the rest. They went into action keeping the tourist industry alive during that horrific six months, particularly in North Queensland and in Tasmania. They kept the tourist industry alive by putting resources to work, proving the capability that is actually there. I know this is all very optimistic. I have made preliminary assumptions in bringing a proposal like this forward. I have assumed that we will be able to secure peace. I have assumed that under a lot of pressure the government will reinvent the reserves and we will have an ongoing presence. I have assumed that as part of the UN force we can set in place the preconditions to do this. Having put those preconditions in place, I want us to start thinking now where we will take it from, not start thinking then. I reiterate the thoughts I had at the outset, and that so many other members have conveyed in this debate, about our support for our personnel. I also place on notice now my belief that we need to begin thinking optimistically about how we can pull this nation together to actually make that longer term contribution.

178,Mrs Draper (Makin) (9.07 P.m.),"I rise to support the motion that this House:Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10721 I support this resolution, particularly as a former serving member of the Women's Royal Australian Navy within the Australian Defence Force, and I am pleased that the opposition also supports it. It is a great honour to have served in the Australian Defence Force and now serve the Australian people as a federal member of parliament for the seat of Makin. However, it is with some surprise and concern that I note the Australian media so far has not given credit for the fact that the Prime Minister has displayed some of the greatest statesmanship of all our prime ministers this century. The following ministers should be given credit for their endeavours to secure a peacekeeping force under the auspices of the United Nations: the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer; the Minister for Defence, John Moore; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Bruce Scott; and the Prime Minister. Many countries are participating from within and from outside our immediate region. I understand that so far we have commitments from Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the United States and the United Kingdom. I am delighted that all of these countries have made such a commitment, due largely to the efforts of our Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, on a sad note I am disappointed at the opportunism displayed by some members of the Labor Party on this issue. It can only be detrimental to the morale of our soldiers and all of the peacekeeping forces currently in East Timor. In fact, I am ashamed and appalled at the way the opposition is behaving in this matter. As the Prime Minister said in question time today, it is time to look forward-to work and concentrate on the present-to our continuing success in Operation Stabilise. It is at this point that congratulations of all of the Australian people should go not only to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence but also to our soldiers and the tremendous professional work that they are carrying out in East Timor. I am heartened by the knowledge that all of the peacekeepers, but in particular our own Australian soldiers, are highly trained professional, committed and dedicated men and women. I salute all of them and their courage and would like them to know that this is not only my own personal point of view but my view as a federal member of parliament representing many Australians who are also justifiably proud of our peacekeepers. I also salute and commend the courage of their families and loved ones back home. I am heartened by the fact that our ministers and their support staff are doing everything in their power to support the families and loved ones of our men and women serving overseas. Again, I would like to point out that it is simply irresponsible for the Labor Party to behave in the manner that it has. It was simply irresponsible for some people to suggest that the government should have somehow pushed harder than it did for Indonesia to accept a United Nations peacekeeping presence before the independence ballot. It is on the record that our Prime Minister raised this very issue with President Habibie of Indonesia before the ballot, but that the Indonesian government was, at that stage, resolutely opposed to the idea. By suggesting that Australia should have pressed this case further than we did, in the face of clear Indonesian opposition, the Labor Party is suggesting that we should have thrown away our entire relationship with Indonesia at that point. Not only that, but we could possibly have jeopardised the prospect of there being any independence vote for East 10722 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 Timor at all. Instead, we did the only sensible thing under the circumstances: we prepared our own forces for what might-but still we hoped would not-happen. Imagine Labor's alternative policy, that Australia humiliate the Indonesian government in international forums-and send our troops to be slaughtered. Even if the ballot had still gone ahead, under these circumstances Labor's policy would have guaranteed the unnecessary shedding of Australian blood in East Timor. Not only the militia but very likely the Indonesian military and the government would have been deeply antagonistic to our presence in East Timor under those circumstances. As it is the INTERFET commander, Major General Peter Cosgrove, has reported that he has received cooperation from Indonesian military authorities. It is important to note here that our Prime Minister has praised President Habibie for realising the need for peacekeeping forces to enter East Timor under these difficult and tragic circumstances. No mistake should be made on this point. However dangerous our position in East Timor-and it is dangerous-it would have been made immeasurably more so had we acted in the way that the Labor Party is advocating. The approach of this government to the East Timor question has been by far the most principled of any government since East Timor was integrated into Indonesia nearly a quarter of a century ago. This government has faced the issue squarely and acted at all times to find peaceful and diplomatically sustainable solutions to the East Timor question. In particular, I would like to commend Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer for their tireless efforts in the face of confused and contradictory criticisms from the opposition and some foreign policy commentators. I would also like to take this opportunity to send my personal message of thanks and good wishes to Australian personnel currently serving in East Timor as well as all of the United Nations peacekeeping forces. With those brave people go all of our thoughts and prayers for a safe and successful mission. We are not in East Timor because it is the safe thing to do or the politically expedient or . the popular thing to do. We are there because it is the right thing to do for the East Timorese. I applaud the conviction of our Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the courage of our defence forces and the tremendous generosity and goodwill of the Australian people. I would like to echo our Prime Minister's comments, as I am sure many Australians do, that we pray for the speedy and safe return of all our Australian soldiers and that security and peace can be restored in East Timor for the good of the East Timorese, Indonesia and the security of our region in general. I hope that Australia can look forward to rebuilding its relationship with Indonesia. bear witness to the truth as we know it. This afternoon I listened to the members for Cook and Fairfax and their sincere comments about the failure all of us have exhibited in giving this issue the due weight it deserved over the last 25 years. For myself, I also say mea culpa. Many of us were gulled, I believe, by the positive democratic developments that took place in Indonesia during the last year. We believed that the referendum in East Timor could take place with a quasi democratic regime led by President Habibie. Supporters and, indeed, critics of the Howard-Downer-Habibie plan for the democratic referendum in East Timor underestimated the sheer bastardry of elements in the Indonesian ancien regime. We",238,Representatives Main Committee
179,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.15 P.m.),"At such moments in our history, we all mustMonday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10723 underestimated the evil of some elements in the Indonesian military such as General Zacky Anwar, whose legacy is burning churches and the uprooting of an entire people. One person, in my view, however, stands out from the prevailing wisdom, and in my capacity as a member of the Labor Party's foreign affail's caucus committee I have had the honour to support him: the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. His siren calls went unheeded, and hundreds of thousands of people have paid the price. Yes, it is true that all previous Australian governments bear historic guilt in this debate. It is true, however, that there is not a total historical discontinuity between past Indonesian-Australian relations and the cold peace that unfortunately exists between our two countries now. As the past foreign minister the Hon. Gareth Evans said: ... before the economic crisis of 1997in Indonesiaand its political aftermath changed everything, we all had to live with the fact that there seemed no realistic chance of Indonesia ever actually agreeing to a fully-fledged act of self-determination in which independence was an option. He went on to say: ... after 1997 the impossible suddenly seemed possible. It had nothing to do with the change of government in Canben-a. Rather, the economic crisis or Indonesia coming under international pressure as never before, and desperate to gamer international support. That and Suharto's downfall opened up brand new options for the resolution of the East Timor situation. John Howard con-ectly called one of them when he wrote to President Habibie in December 1998, urging Indonesia to grant East Timor significant autonomy immediately and to hold out the possibility of a full self-determination ballot at an unspecified later time. The trouble was that Habibie's response-inspired more by pique than high principle, and insufficiently canvassed with his militaty-went a quantum leap further than Howard has proposed, by throwing open the prospect of independence if autonomy was refused. Unlike the previous speaker, I think that honest people can disagree about this issue. While all of us undoubtedly support the role of Australian troops in East Timor-indeed, some of us on this side of politics would be willing enough to be generous to the foreign minister and to the Prime Minister and say that the deployment did take place remarkably quickly-people on this side of politics do not believe there was an either/or option prior to the referendum taking place. It may indeed be true that the referendum would have taken place only if the Indonesians were not forced to have a peacekeeping force there while the referendum was actually on. However, there are a great many other things that the Australian government might have done. The shadow foreign minister repeatedly pointed them out in question time in the previous months, and I remember them. I have been there since 3 October, and two events stand out in my mind in particular. They are the meeting where the head of the Australian fOl'eign service met the US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr Stanley Roth, in January and, when asked about a contingency plan, Australia said, 'We are not interested'; and later when one of our military officials was asked by a US Marine general about a similar contingency plan. I believe that the telephone call made by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff to General Wiranto some days after the sacking and pillaging of Dili shows that other things could have been done. As the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow foreign minister have said, we should have been on the phone to the Americans making sure that the situation in Dili was tied down and that, if our influence could not be used, that the considerable influence of the US government was deployed with the Indonesians. 10724 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 When General Shelton rang Wiranto-and, unlike our Minister for Defence, he was· able to get through on the telephone-he immediately agreed, and Indonesia agreed soon after, to a peacekeeping force being deployed in Timor. If such pressure had been put on the Americans immediately prior to the referendum, the situation in East Timor might have remained relatively calm, as it did on referendum day. On referendum day, the Indonesian TNI showed that they could keep control in Indonesia, where 78 per cent of people voted for independence. I believe that, if Australia had fulfilled its responsibility of keeping the Americans focused on this part of the world immediately prior to the referendum, we could have concentrated the minds of General Wiranto, General Anwar and the various other people whose evil deeds we know about now. During question time today, the Prime Minister distanced himself from the report in last week's Bulletin that he had announced a new strategic imperative for Australia-the Howard doctrine. Whether the Prime Minister used the actual words or not, what he argued for was as follows: It is the more muscular Australia prepared to fulfil the role of regional deputy to the global US policeman ... Howard embraces the ""deputy"" concept, , , Australia. , , will draw strength from its distinctive characteristics of a Western civilisation in Asia; an Australia not seeking to fashion itself like the rest of Asia, . . It is very disappointing for those of us who, like the Prime Minister, would like to look forward on this Timor issue, that such a fundamental commitment of our country's position seems to have been made on the run-not in a considered speech, not after extensive consultation with military and foreign policy advisers, but, with apologies to Mr Brenchley, in a throwaway interview in a weekly magazine. Doctrines can be extremely significant things. President James Monroe, the then President of the United States, told Congress in 1823; We owe it, therefore, to candour and to the amicable relations between the United States and those powers (referring to European Powers) to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety , . . He clearly did not have the same eye for history as our current Prime Minister. It was some time before historians and commentators came to refer to this enunciation as the 'Monroe Doctrine', The word 'doctrine' was also their addendum. Earlier this afternoon, we heard comments from the members for Leichhardt and Grey that some of the reactions to the Prime Minister were sensationalist and left-wing journalism, et cetera. A person whom I have never known 'as a left-wing journalist, Mr Greg Sheridan, a foreign editor of the Australian, had this to say about the so-called Howard doctrine: Gaze out today on the rubble of what was once Australian foreign policy and weep. As Canberra races to find an ark of 1950s antiquity in which to carry its back-to-the-future Howard doctrine, the region has reacted with extreme hostility. The Howard doctrine has instead overwhelmingly underlined every cliche and stereotype of white arrogance and neo-colonialism. This is a dangerous moment for Australia. The understandable pride at our magnificent servicemen and women is in danger of spilling over into ugly and destructive jingoism. And he concluded: What is needed now is a steady, calm hand on the tiller, an emphasis on continuing friendship and engagement. Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10725 Instead we've had wild talk of fundamental change in Canberra's approach to the region, involving especially a new emphasis on military power. And there is no sense at all that this has been thought through or the necessary policy figures consulted. This is a mess, built on failure. God knows where it is leading. As for left-wingers and sensationalists, could I also quote David MacGibbon, a former Liberal senator and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee. The real danger we face in all this is being seen as a post-colonial relic, isolated from Asia in a comer of the Pacific. It's very easy to run the campaign against Australia that we are isolated in Asia and we've spent 50 years trying to put a different perspective. The tragedy of this foreign policy is not its implementation in Timor on the ground at the moment. The military forces are doing a fine job, a job that is supported by all of the Australian people. We have a great responsibility to see that at a future time they are replaced. The 7th Task Force, particularly, in Brisbane will have to be upgraded very rapidly, and certainly Australian military expenditures will need to be focused on providing more foot soldiers so those very professional service people can be transited out. Honest people can disagree about what this government did in the past, prior to the referendum. Honest people can argue, as I believe the opposition does, that a different pressure could have been put on the Indonesian authorities and a different result would have been had in Timor. if I make my remarks sitting down? well be continued. visible. In addressing the motion on the UN resolution on East Timor, and having watched the television records of what is happening in East Timor at the moment, I would like to commend the Australian forces on the impression that they have given, which is of a highly disciplined, very effective force. I, as one Australian, have been very proud to see the way that they have behaved: with dignity and yet at the same time with firmness. Certainly my congratulations go to Major General Cosgrove for the way that he has acted in an extremely difficult situation. Having said that, I would like to spend the rest of my time in comments on various issues. The first is East Timor itself, and Australia's obligation to East Timor. I read in the Australian several days ago a comment by Paul Kelly discussing the various myths, as he saw them. One of the myths that he named was Australia's 'obligation' to East Timor. His point of view was that we had no obligation to East Timor and the feeling that post World War II we should have done something more for East Timor was neither practical nor even reasonable. I would disagree with Mr Kelly on that point. My father was one of those servicemen during the Second World War who fought in the islands and near East Timor. They were very much aware at the time of how much their lives and safety depended on the East Timorese. They had an understanding with the East Timorese that the kindness, the putting aside of their own safety, the putting themselves at risk by the",240,Representatives Main Committee

184,Mrs Gallus,"I can see little point in standing in a room where we are all so absolutely10726 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 East Timorese for Australians would always be remembered by Australia. But after the events of 1975 there was a feeling that Australia had not remembered what had happened during the Second World War. I believe that within the country there was a feeling of, perhaps, shame that we had not done more to protest at what had happened to East Timor. This is not to say that we could have changed the events of history. I doubt that we could have. But there was a complicity in our attitude to what had happened in East Timor which I think has caused many older Australians and, from them, their children and grandchildren to feel a sense of shame. That now has passed and I think there is a feeling in Australia that we have done the right thing: even by putting Australian lives at risk we are standing for principles that we believe in in East Timor. We are opposed to butchery, and we will step in where we can to prevent it from happening and to protect innocent women and children. I have heard people say, 'We will regret this decision because popular opinion will go against it when we see bodies coming home in bags.' Those people are treading on very dangerous ground. If it should happen that Australian lives are lost in Timor, the worse thing that we could do to the survivors and the relatives of those people who died, who gave their lives, would be to say that their involvement should not have happened, that we should not have been there. All that we should say is that they died for a good cause, and we need to say that if it happens, not to start at this stage saying, 'Well, we weren't going to achieve anything anyway. It is not a good pragmatic decision because we may lose Australian lives.' There is pride that we have taken the right decision. The feeling of the population is that we have finally stood up for the liberal democratic values that we are supposed to hold in this country and there is a time to say that these values are more important than pragmatism. Having said that, I would like to briefly touch on the role that the opposition has played in this debate. It is not one that I suspect covers the opposition with any great honour. They have had two arguments against the course of events. The first is that Australia should have sent in peacekeeping forces earlier. The second is that there should have been a coalition of peacekeepers before the ballot. Both of these points are so far from what was possible as to be ludicrous. To go back, we did not know what the vote on East Timor was going to be, and neither did Indonesia. I defy anybody to say that they were not surprised when they saw the extent of that yes vote, especially after the intimidation that had gone on in East Timor. We did not know how the referendum was going to pan out, neither did Indonesia. Although we were afraid of what the militia might do, we could not prejudge the issue. To do so would have brought the severest condemnation not only from Indonesia but from all of our other South-East Asian neighbours. We could not say, 'This is going to happen: let's rush in.' Let us also look at the practicality. When we finally did go in as a peacekeeping force, it was with the agreement of Indonesia. We could not have gone in without that agreement, without declaring war on Indonesia, which was obviously patently ridiculous. It also followed a resolution of the United Nations. That resolution only followed an invitation by Indonesia. We had to have that invitation. If the opposition thinks there was any real likelihood of Indonesia offering that invitation beforehand, they should have a look at what was needed to eventually get that invitation. It was the television sets around the world displaying the violence that was erupting in East Timor and the actions of the militia. On top of that, it required pressure from the United States and also from neighbouring countries and the Intemational Monetary Fund. That pressure had to be there at the end in face of what was happening to get Indonesia to make that offer. But Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10727 the opposition has sought to find party political advantage in this situation which, for the welfare of the whole of this continent, is a very dangerous thing to do. Indonesia is upset about what happened in East Timor. It had spent a lot of money and time in trying to secure the province and it was slapped in the face with a 78 per cent vote against it. Following that, it has the condemnation of Australia. It does not need, therefore, any encouragement from Australian politicians for Indonesia to start badmouthing Australia. How does the opposition think that the leadership of other South-East Asian countries, such as Thailand, react when they see not only Indonesia criticising Australia but also Australia's own politicians? They do not see it in the way that we see it, as party political point scoring, but they see it as dissension within Australia about the role we are playing in East Timor. In doing so, the Leader of the Opposition has much to answer for. It may be that it was in response to the stinging criticism of his ex-colleague that he had an un-Churchillian streak of timidity. This was not the time to show that he was not timid. It was a time to unify all Australians to stand behind Australia's effort in East Timor and to look to the future of Australia and East Timor. Finally, may I say that it is in East Timor's interest that Australia have good relations with Indonesia because we do not need Indonesia taking out anger at Australia on East Timor. Despite the posturing of the opposition, it is not Australia who will be the be-all and end-all of what happens in East Timor. It is very much up to the Indonesian military whether they continue to support the militia in East Timor or not. If we look to the future, we have to try to stabilise the relationship with Indonesia, not just for the sake of the relationship itself but for the interests of all East Timorese and the future of a stable and secure East Timor. Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (9.35 p.m.)-BeforeI go through the body of the statement that I want to make, I do want to make one reference to the previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh. Taking on board her acceptance of the commitment and obligation that we owe East Timor, all I wanted to say was that the UN promised that they would be there before, during and after the ballot. They gave a commitment to the East Timorese people that the Timorese believed. Let me say that I do endorse the motion currently before the House and, in doing so, I certainly echo the sentiments of my electorate. The support that the Australian community has for the people of East Timor is enormous. By supporting this motion, we have sent a clear message to the Australian and the international communities that the Australian parliament is serious about the protection of life and liberty in East Timor. The only solution is to stop the violence so that the East Timorese people can live in safety. We must also commit ourselves to the rebuilding of East Timor when peace is a reality. These people have lost not only their security but their infrastructure. Over the last few weeks we have all seen the destruction of towns and the murder of thousands. There are reports by the few remaining journalists and those gradually returning that the atrocities have been incredibly disturbing. The annexation of East Timor by Indonesia has had a devastating effect on the East Timorese people. Estimates have been made that between 100,000 and 200,000 people have lost their lives as a direct result of the conflict in East Timor over the last 24 years. Over the last few weeks we have all seen the destruction of Dili and the murder of thousands. The television coverage of the situation in East Timor has been disturbing but it has brought home to the Australian community the importance of Australian participation in moves to assist the East Timorese. I would like to take this 10728 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 opportunity to applaud the courage of the Australian troops now in East Timor, or as the Leader of the Opposition called them, our 'young Australian warriors'. I have, like other members, received a huge amount of correspondence regarding the situation in East Timor. One email I received last week struck a particular chord with me and I would like to share some of the comments of the writer with members today. She said: I am a soldier's wife. My husband is very likely to be deployed overseas if the Liberals ever get their finger out. It needs to be done, they need our help. I have four children and I just think of all the poor kids over there who need a digger's hug and safety they can provide. IfI didn't think this was necessary I would not be writing this. I don't normally want my husband to put himself in danger but, for God's sake, it needs to be done. This email was signed' Just a diggers wife'. The friends and family of these defence personnel are justifiably concerned about the safety of these Australians, but I believe they appreciate the importance of this commitment to peace. When entering a career in the military, people are making a commitment to the security of Australia, and at a time such as this they have also made a commitment to the security and safety of our region. While these defence personnel accept the risk associated with their career choices, any moves into areas of conflict necessarily increase the potential for harm. I wish, therefore, to thank those people for their commitment to Australia and wish each of them a safe return to family and friends. I think we need to ask ourselves in exactly what context we are sending our young warriors to the killing fields of East Timor. I am concerned that the situation in East Timor has degenerated without the Australian government having adequately prepared for these highly predictable circumstances. According to the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford-Smith, there are two main reasons for the situation in East Timor reaching this crisis point. Firstly, there was the decision to allow the independence process to move quickly and disregard the intelligence outlining the potential for bloodshed should the TNI remain in force with the so-called militia forces which, media reports indicate, is operating with, at the very least, the tacit support of the Indonesian military. Secondly, there was the delay in involving the United States. In November 1998 Xanana Gusmao suggested a timetable for the territory to gain independence from Indonesia. The essence of it was that 18 months should be spent solving problems relating to security, which included the disarming of paramilitary groups followed by a transition process lasting at least three years during which there would be a political education program and the establishment of an East Timorese police force as part of a possible deployment of peacekeeping forces. Xanana Gusmao, with Noble laureates Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Belo, suggested that it might be necessary for East Timor to have a significant period of autonomy-in some statements up to 10 years-before a referendum on independence. It is clear that these three people so involved in the movement for an independent East Timor felt that the safety of the East Timorese people was best ensured through a gradual process. When it was decided that the East Timorese should vote as quickly as possible on whether they wanted autonomy within Indonesia or complete independence, neither the United Nations or the Australian government acted to oppose this decision. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs acted to expedite the process of independence. The consequence of that inappropriate action is now apparent to all. Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10729 The recognition by Xanana Gusmao of the potential for violence and the need for the internal security of East Timor to be established was unfortunately not shared by the Australian government. Indeed, it appears that US intelligence reports derived from Australian sources indicated that there was a very high risk of violence following the conduct of the ballot for independence. I believe that, with effective diplomatic endeavours, thorough planning and regard to appropriate risk assessments, much of the bloodshed in East Timor leading up to and following the independence ballot could have been avoided. Due to the lack of foresight by this government and its apparent unwillingness to heed advice on the situation in East Timor, the Australian troops-a significant portion of the multinational force-are now entering a dangerous situation. They do so with bravery and with that certain matter-of-factness that often characterises Australian forces. I would like to repeat my heartfelt thanks to those people for their commitment to Australia and to wish each of them a very safe return to their families and friends. We need to urge the government to adequately resource and relieve these men and women. I also urge the government to rethink its very short-sighted policy of de-funding Radio Australia and to reinstate the broadcasts needed not only by our troops-members may have seen a few of them watching the footy the other day on television-but by those members of the Indonesian community who support our actions and who need to know what our position is. I want to pass on my congratulations and my appreciation to all those Tasmanians who have written, emailed or attended rallies and vigils in Tasmania, in particular to those who organised a rally and vigil in Launceston last Friday. Unfortunately, this event was not incredibly well attended, but those who did attend have an incredible amount of regard and support for the people of East Timor. They have been involved in this issue for some time and expect an awful lot from this government. In conclusion, it is very important that we must not kid ourselves that we are not culpable in this affair. The United Nations promised the East Timorese that we would be there before, during and after the ballot. Indeed, there were UN posters which contained a picture of the dove, the UN sign of peace, and said, 'UNAMET-the prize is peace'. I support the motion before us, but I believe we owe it to those who have died to examine the process. This should not have happened and it should never happen again. but also to canvass a few of the issues around East Timor and what has occurred. It is true that the whole policy and the issues around East Timor have in many ways dominated Australian foreign policy over the last 25 years. I for one, amongst a number of other members, have been involved in demonstrations on these issues in years gone by. Certainly it is true to say that many on this side of the House have had concerns about East Timor policy over the last 25 years, often in a situation where we were critical of the policies of our own government. However, we can also agree that it has been an issue to which there is no easy solution. Recent events have shown that that is, in fact, the case. As we look through what has occurred over the last few months, we are now in a situation where there is a debate about what might have been if certain things had happened, and 20/20 hindsight has been used on a number of occasions in looking at the question of what policy actually was undertaken on a number of issues. Those issues focus on things such as: was the ballot for independence for the East Timorese people held too early; should there have been peacekeepers in place prior to the event; how and how well were the Americans involved in",243,Representatives Main Committee
185,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.42 P.m.},"I am pleased to be here tonight in support of the motion,10730 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 the formulating of options and their involvement in options around the question of what occurred; and where do we go from now? I would conclude that there are a number of things which the government should be looking to in the future around the question of what occurred. Although 20/20 hindsight is something that none of us have, it is certainly true that there were a range of concerns raised about aspects of policy on East Timor. Certainly it is true that spokespersons on behalf of the opposition, and a number of commentators, had raised a number of these issues over time and suggested quite strongly that there were matters that needed to be taken up earlier than they were and probably more effectively than they were. It is always hard in the foreign policy area to make judgments about how well a particular policy is pursued. It involves making judgments in an area where people often are involved in rewriting history after the event. However, as many academics have said, it is fair to say that there are issues there about the terms of engagement, about the Australian foreign minister and defence minister being involved earlier, and there are certainly issues about involving the United States at an earlier time and making sure that they were aware of the desperate situation. It is also fair to say that since the results of the ballot were made known, the resultant carnage in East Timor, the ferocity of what has occurred and the degree of desperate action that has been taken by the militia in the context of what has occurred in East Timor have been a surprise to some of us. Only tonight on the news we saw more details about the level of death and destruction. New atrocities are appearing on a daily basis. That leads to the issue of a human rights court and the need to have a war crimes process to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice. This is going to take a long time. It is certainly something I am sure the government will be cognisant of and will move forward on as quickly as it can. I understand that there are difficult issues there that need to be addressed, but certainly those issues must be addressed if we are going to see a situation where those who did these acts in East Timor, and those who may do them in other parts of the world, understand that barbaric behaviour cannot be allowed to go unchecked. One of the other issues that has come up and which has been an item for discussion over the weekend, and in particular today in question time, is the matter of the so-called Howard doctrine. I stress that the Prime Minister today in question time did seek to clear up a range of inconsistencies and concerns that had been raised about that policy, but there are some things that still need to be said and some issues that need to be taken up. The Bulletin article that has been the basis of this matter was published five days ago and yet it took the Prime Minister until today to clarify some of those issues about being a regional policeman, or a Deputy Dog as some would say, for the United States in this area. You have got to ask yourself the question why he took so long to respond. I saw Admiral BaIne on the Sunday program yesterday and he was clearly struggling to avoid answers on that issue. He saw it as being outside his brief, but also he was clearly uncomfortable with the position the Prime Minister had taken. He knew full well the concern about our position within the region as an independent power. I will quote an article in today's paper as an example of the commentary that the initial position has brought forward. Greg Sheridan in the Australian said: Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10731 Gaze out today on the rubble of what was once Australian foreign policy and weep. As Canberra races to find an ark of 1950s antiquity in which to carry its back-to-the-future Howard doctrine, the region has reacted with extreme hostility. We have seen the reaction from a number of countries in the area. The problem with having a proper debate on some of these issues about our position in the region is that you often get into a 'he said, she said' argument. You get a situation where particular issues are reinterpreted time and time again in order to try to remove any concerns or inconsistencies. But it took five days to respond, five days to actually address the issue and clarify some of those concerns. We see in this particular position, however it has been redefined to this day, a fairly common thread that has run through this government on foreign policy issues and from this Prime Minister from a very early stage. It is an approach which harkens back to the days of empire in some respects. It is a variation on a theme where we can go forth and basically be a policeman or a great white Raj. I am not quite sure how you quite put it in these circumstances. I think that is an issue of concern. It does miss a fundamental reality about today-and I don't want to get into a debate about whether we are Asian, from Asia or in Asia-that we need to be conscious of our position in this region geographically. We need to see ourselves as a nation that can engage within this region. Indonesia, and a number of other regimes, have a democratic base that is not in common with our own nor are their actions to domestic security concerns what we, as a people, would endorse. These things raise concerns about how we involve ourselves in this region. The reaction that has come back to what was perceived as the Howard doctrine has been one of scorn and derision, pretty much universally within the region. This is a concern about how we position ourselves in the future. This has to be looked at very carefully. I hope the government will look at that very carefully because, if we are not in a situation where we can be seen to be working with our neighbours within the region while still having differing views on a range of issues, we will have problems on a trade and defence level and in putting ourselves forward as a proper contributor in the region. These are the sorts of things that this government particularly has to look at very closely. I wish all the troops who are deployed in East Timor all the very best of luck. We are with you; we believe in what you are doing there. We believe it is important for this country, this region and for the world to see a proper and just settlement in East Timor, for the people to be protected and to have the right to build a new nation of their own. That is something that we all want to see. The job that they are doing there is so important. They have our very best wishes for a safe deployment, hopefully not for too long-but I suspect it will be for some time. I wish the very best to all those troops who are there. seconded and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. In Australia we believe in freedom and we believe in democracy. This issue is an awful lot about both of those concepts. I understand that, in much of the world, freedom and democracy have interpretations which would not be ours in Australia. I remind honourable members that we have the sixth oldest parliamentary democratic system in the world, exceeded only by Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland-that is to say, countries that have kept their original democratic institutions, that have not been destroyed by military takeover, dictatorship or outright war.",247,Representatives Main Committee
186,Mr Charles (La Trobe) (9.52 P.m.},"-I rise to support the Prime Minister's motion10732 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 There is no question in my mind that East Timor has been a significant problem for the world community for a very long time. It has been a greater problem for the citizens who live on that half of that island. I would not pretend to know the answers to their problems nor would I pretend to know whether or not the Indonesian Prime Minister Habibie's decision to have a referendum or plebiscite on the issue of independence versus administration for autonomy as part of Indonesia was correct. It is not for me to say what is right for Indonesia. Some 25 years ago, I suspect that the whole world maybe made a wrong call when they let Indonesia attack East Timor; when they let them come in with armed intervention and take over a very small country that did not want to be under their control. Nonetheless, we live with history as we do, and we wi111ive with history for a very long time, because. what is left today of East Timor is perhaps not worth owning except to those people who live there, who want to live there and who have been displaced from that country. It was not that the Howard government sought independence for East Timor but rather that it sought some autonomy for a number of years, leading to the possibility of a referendum or a plebiscite on independence. Those on the other side who blame the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other members of the government, or indeed backbenchers like me, for the problems that we experience today in East Timor are just plain wrong. No-one created the problems in East Timor other than Indonesians themselves. We recognise the importance of good relations with Indonesia. It is absolutely important that we continue to work towards gaining increasing good relations with that very major country, that major conglomerate of islands so very close to our north. It is self-evident that we cannot go our way in this part of the world without some relationship with Indonesia. It is better for us and it is better for the Indonesians if that relationship is positive. At the moment it is not good; I would be the last one to deny that fact. It is obvious that the relationship has deteriorated since East Timor voted for its independence and since, apparently, members of the Indonesian armed forces encouraged the militants in East Timor to destroy the infrastructure of the country, murder many of the inhabitants and chase others to other islands of the archipelago. But, notwithstanding the military's actions, we can only assume the good intentions of the Indonesian government and the people of Indonesia, and we must work towards improving relations over the near and distant future. We wish our troops in East Timor well. They go with our very best wishes and we wish them to stay out of harm's way. I would never wish anyone to have to go to war: I believe in peace. But I also know, realistically, that there are times when it is right to fight for what you believe in. Without putting too fine a point on it, the fact that the international community has decided that this is one of those times is highly appropriate. That those poor, gentle people in East Timor, suffering as they have over how many decades, should be put to the ultimate desecration by the militia and apparently by some Indonesian troops over recent weeks since they voted for independence, is beyond the pale. It is highly appropriate that Australia leads the international force. It is highly appropriate that we asked for the international force and that we have asked for support from not only Asian nations but European and American nations as well. From my viewpoint, it is encouraging that that support came freely and willingly, and as the troops build up we will see, increasingly, different faces and different uniforms across the small bit of that island that is East Timor. Monday, 27 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10733 It is a difficult operation for the troops. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert on military operations or military affairs, but that mountainous island poses extreme difficulty for the international troops. They come under heavy pressure from the militant militia and others with weapons who would do them harm, and who want to destroy the international peacekeeping force for no other reason than to make sure that either they win or they simply destroy that which they were unable to win. That is very sad. This is a difficult operation and I wish our troops well. I hope they come under no criticism and I hope they come to no harm. Australians send them with goodwill and with all our support, from every side of politics, from every colour, from every religion, from every country on earth. We send them to represent us in this international situation which we cannot control but where we wish, on a humanitarian level, to help people who deserve our help and our respect to maintain their lives, to rebuild their communities and infrastructure and to make a future for themselves now that they have said that they believe in freedom and they believe in democracy, as we believe in freedom and we believe in democracy. I have no question in my mind, having watched television and listened to reports, that there have been extreme violations of human rights in that poor, small island. And they are extreme. The kinds of atrocities that have occurred are not minor violations of imprisonment or incarceration but violations that demean all of us as human beings, and I deplore those atrocities. I wish I could wipe them from my mind but I cannot. It is important that the United Nations, as the body from which we seek leadership in this issue, comes to grips with this problem, examines the violations of human rights that have occurred there and brings to justice those who have perpetrated the injustices. This is a critical time for all of us. It is a critical time for our poor friends on that small island to our north. It is a critical time for us, in terms of our standing in the international community. I am confident that we will stand tall and proud, as will our East Timorese neighbours, at the end of the day.
