There are fibre coax networks.

The NBN is so expensive per cent of Australian households. The because of the decision taken by the Telstra network in Melbourne is currently government to build this new running at 100 megabits per second and it is telecommunications network, this new offering that very high-speed service. For a broadband network, by connecting relatively modest additional cost, Telstra is households directly with fibre. It is well going to upgrade its HFC network in other understood that the vast bulk of the cost of cities to 100 megabits per second. That is any new telecommunications rollout is the hardly surprising; everywhere in the world civil works and, obviously, the more of that pay TV cable networks are used for the civil work component there is, the more delivery of broadband services and, even expensive it is. That is why in most markets where there is fibre-to-the-home cable, HFC around the world-almost all markets, in cable is a very important competitor and a fact-telcos and governments are using a provider of facilities based competition. variety of technologies to get the most cost Every other market encourages the cable effective upgrade of broadband services that to provide competition.

Not so in Australia; as we have technological approaches, in particular the seen with the Telstra agreement and the approach of fibre to the node, which, as the legislation supporting it, the NBN Co. will House has heard me say before, in the UK be a fixed line monopoly, and the will nonetheless deliver 80 megabytes per government has spent billions of dollars to second speeds for the cost of a third or less pay Telstra and Optus not to use their HFC of fibre to the home. That speed is way in network to provide broadband and voice excess of the speeds demanded or needed by services once the NBN is rolled out. This is households at the present time or for the not only an extraordinary act in terms of foreseeable future. This is a fundamental anti-competitive conduct and really quite at question. The NBN Co.'s response has been odds with policy everywhere else in the simply to say: 'The government has told us to world where governments seek to promote do fibre to the home and that's that.' Having that type of facilities based competition, but said that and particularly in the constrainedalso extraordinarily wasteful. capital circumstances of today with so many I will conclude on the issue of waste.

183,Orders Of The Day Mr Stephen Smith,"As DeputyThursday, 24 November 2011 Toner, Mr Brydan record that here in the HouseI have not seen a Speaker resign before. I would like to place on record my admiration and respect for Speaker Harry Jenkins and wish him well in his future career. I need to quote the words of Brydan Toner. Last week during President Obama's visit to our great nation, a 16-year-old was provided with the incredible opportunity of taking part in the parliamentary celebrations and witnessing the President's address to a joint sitting of parliament. Brydan said: I, Brydan Toner, am writing to say that I was that extremely fortunate teenager, and I am eternally grateful to my Federal Member, Joanna Gash, for giving me this once-in-a-lifetime chance. The friendship between the Commonwealth of Australia and the United States of America is one that is second to none. As the visit coincided with the marking of a 60 year long alliance, it was a great pleasure to see that the bond between our two nations is stronger than ever before. The announcement of the joint training and exercises, planned for Darwin, between our two defence forces is a testament to our nation's leaders. As the current school captain of Nowra High School, it was a great honour to be able to witness this historical moment in our nation's history. From meeting with various MPs, to dining with a doctor who often works in Antarctica, from having a conversation with former Prime Minister John Howard, to shaking the hand of the President of the United States of America, the experience is one that I will never forget, and one that I have gained a great deal from. I am hoping that from this, I will be able to give something back to the community that allowed me to represent them during the course of the Presidential visit. Being someone who has a keen interest in politics, and someone who is hoping to represent my electorate one day in federal parliament, words cannot describe what the experience meant to me. I was able to gain a brief insight into the working lives of various politicians, and even had the chance to converse with various representatives on a matter of issues, and on the workings of the Australian parliament. As I stated to my federal member, Joanna Gash, 'I can already imagine telling my grandchildren about this one day', and I can honestly say that this is true. Whether it was the fact that I was a guest at an official state dinner hosted by the Prime Minister, the fact that I exchanged a few words with President Barack Obama, or the fact that the Federal Member for Gilmore invited me to be her somewhat excited guest throughout the visit, I know that the experience will be etched into my brain for the remainder of my life. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity now, to thank Ms. Gash and various other parliamentarians for making my experience even more amazing than one would expect, and for making me feel welcome. It is not often that a high school student takes part in such events and celebrations, and the fact that I, a sixteen year old boy, was able to witness the president of the USA address the Australian Federal Parliament is nothing less than remarkable.

Our country is in good hands when we have young people like Brydan, who I am extremely proud of. Petition: Disability Services Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (09:34): I am so proud to be part of a government that is committed to making sure that every child has the best start to life. Of course, we know that that is no more important than for children with disability. We know that for parents, caregivers and families the task of caring for a child with disability is a full-time job like absolutely no other. We recognise that this is an incredibly tough job that families are doing, and that it is tough emotionally. It is also tough financially. That is why from 1 July this year our government is providing $147 million over four years for early intervention services for children with disabilities that affect their development through the Better Start for Children with Disability measure. However, our government also recognises that more needs to be done. Australia needs a disability services system that provides care and support based on people's needs, not a lottery of what kind of disability they have, how they acquired it or where they happen to live. It should give people with disability certainty, choice and individually tailored services. That is why our government has fronted up to the challenges in this important area and taken the lead on fundamental reform of disability services. It is why we asked the Productivity Commissioner to examine reform of disability support, providing a blueprint for the National Disability Insurance Scheme-which we are so incredibly proud to be working on implementing. We understand that the current system for caring for and supporting people with disability is not working for everyone. Sometimes we just have to face up and admit that. I know that for many people with disability and their carers providing care and support is a challenge. I am pleased today to be able to provide a voice for a local mother in the electorate of Adelaide, which I am lucky enough to represent in this place-Melissa, who is dealing with this challenge on a day-to-day basis. I want to place on the record my absolute admiration for the work that Melissa does in providing care for her son, Sebastian. Melissa is also a passionate advocate for ensuring that all Australian children with disability receive access to effective treatment and early intervention services. She has been incredibly hard at work collecting signatures right across Adelaide-in the suburbs and all of the streets-and I am pleased to be able to table that petition here today after it was considered by the Petitions Committee and determined to be in order. We know that people with disability and their carers deserve the same opportunities, and I am pleased that our government is working hard to deliver real outcomes in this area. We know that there is more work to do, but we also know that for every story like Melissa's-the incredible courage that she displays day in and day out-there are thousands of families just like hers right across Australia. I am pleased to table this petition on their behalf. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: MAIN COMMITTEE The Better Start for Children with Disability (Better Start) Initiative urgently requires reform. The Better Start policy excludes thousands of Australian children with developmental disabilities in need of early intervention services. These children have comparable early intervention needs and similar developmental disabilities as those with eligible conditions, and many are able to prove the beneficial impact of such treatment. The inequalities of Better Start must be removed to allow all Australian children with developmental disabilities access to the support they need in the critical early years of development. Your petitioners request that the House take all necessary steps to: Act urgently and effectively to amend the Better Start for Children with Disability policy so that: ï‚· there is no longer inequality of access to effective treatment and early intervention for Australian children with developmental disabilities; ï‚· the current eligibility criteria is revised and replaced with a needs-based model whereby eligibility is determined by the functional aspects of the child's disability, the level of impairment and how the impairment affects the child. from 2,261 citizens. Petition received. Speaker removed a number of times since and now being back in the House, I have been here for some historic moments: the removal of one of the most popular prime ministers this nation has ever seen to be replaced by his former Treasurer, the changes in leadership, changes in Speakers and the removal of a Speaker-although it seemed to be a resignation at the time, with the replacement of that Speaker by one from another party, which was unusual at the time. I met Harry Jenkins when I came here in 1990, a man of great integrity with a work ethic par excellence. We struck up a very close working friendship, even though he was a member of the Labor Party. He was chairman in one of my early committees and I worked very closely with him. But one thing that I knew was that he had three priorities. First was his family and the people of Scullin who he represented. Second was his other family, which was the Labor Party. His integrity, and seeing the Labor Party as a family, was always going to be his first and paramount response in this parliament: to his party and its best interests. No-one would know that like Harry knows that. I saw that a note was passed to you just a few moments ago, Mr Deputy Speaker, which you received gratefully. For the Speaker to resign and go to the floor of the House to get a number for the Labor Party is not exactly what you would expect of the integrity of Harry Jenkins. However, I put to the group here in this chamber that this may not bode well for my side of politics. SoI stand at this historic moment, recognising the integrity of Harry Jenkins and knowing that he will enter the floor of the House and he will, once again, play the role on behalf of his constituency and his party that he has always played. His integrity as Speaker has been above reproach and the way he has handled himself in this 43rd Parliament is only as we would expect of a man of his integrity and great character.

186,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (09:37,"Having come to this place in 1990 and beenFranklin Electorate: Youth Forum Ms COLLINS (Franklin-Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services) (09:41): I would like to talk today about a youth forum that was recently held in Kingborough, in my electorate, and which I had the pleasure of attending. The venue was the Twin Ovals, a new venue that I have talked about in this place, which is funded by the federal government with some contribution from the state government. I made a commitment at that youth forum that I would talk about some of the issues that they raised there here in this place. Seventy-eight students from six of the seven high schools in the Kingborough region attended on that day. They had a well-known facilitator, Michael O'Meara from MOHOW, who has a long history of supporting young people across this country, including the federal government's peak youth body, the Australian Youth Forum. The afternoon session was also attended by the Mayor of the Kingborough Council, Graham Bury, as well as various employees and councillors of the Kingborough Council. We were there to hear about the vision and the project plans that these young people had for their local region. They got together and came up with what they wanted their region to be. Some of the visions for their local area, which they needed to work on with the local community, were to treat people equally; to listen to the community's point of view; to make poverty history; to see gender equality; to accept people of all cultures, religions and races; to stop pollution; and to live sustainably. People had a total of eight visions for their local area. After the forum they went and looked at potential projects relating to that vision and seeing that vision come to fruition in their local region. They came up with some interesting projects that would achieve this. These included free bus rides for all students to and from school, monthly community meetings for young people, and a youth representative on the council. One suggestion I thought was quite inventive was to have a paintball arena on the old public high school site. They wanted to hold a University of the Third Age weekend skills workshop where elderly citizens of the area would work with young people. They wanted a recycling or container deposit scheme in their local area. The council employees who were there also went off and created their own project, which was to develop a social media strategy to engage the young people in their area. This all bodes well for the region and the municipality of Kingborough, where the youth of today are engaging actively in their local community, not only talking to their local council about their visions for the area but also coming up with their own projects and their own ways of ensuring that their visions come to fruition and working with the local government to achieve that. I was really impressed by all the young people who managed to go there on that day, to develop their visions, to articulate them and to come up with those projects. It really does bode well for the youth in that local area. Cowan Electorate: Halal Foods all meats that had been slaughtered in the manner of the Islamic religion to be clearly labelled as such. The petition, which was presented to me by the Barnabas Fund, stated that, while they support the freedom of religious groups to access food and other products that meet with MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements
187,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (09:44,"I recently presented a petition in parliament calling for the requirements of their faith, they are concerned about the massive growth of shariacompliant products being sold to Australians, whatever their faith, often without being informed or consulted. As a result of the petition, I investigated in my electorate in Western Australia and found that almost every animal, apart from pigs, is killed in accordance with the Islamic religious requirements known as halal. So, when you go to Coles, Woolworths, IGA or other supermarkets, you cannot purchase the meat for your Aussie barbecue without the influence of this minority religion. You have no choice. And the point is that almost no Australians are aware of this, because it is not labelled. Why is this the case? Why is it that we are being provided with meat that is slaughtered in accordance with the practices of the Islamic religion? I expect it is convenience and marketing for these meat providers, but it is important that everyone also be aware that Mohammed, the prophet of Islam-as reported in the Hadith, the traditions of Islam, the book second only to the Koran-talked of how Islam would be furthered to those parts of the world that had not yet embraced it. He reportedly said, 'The non-believers will become Muslims when, amongst other things, they eat the meat that we have slaughtered.' This is one of the key aspects to converting nonbelievers to Islam. As many people would be aware, halal forms part of the sharia system. Most people know sharia to be a system of laws relating to the Islamic religion. Any religion's adherents, of course, can make personal choices about the way and the standards by which they live their lives. This is as true for Christians as it is for Muslims. We should have no trouble with personal standards. But a religion is not a social or a political system, and those who believe it to be so, by implication stand against our great democracy. Consumers are being denied information about meat. Meat killed in accordance with the Islamic religion's requirements should be labelled accordingly. By having Australians unwittingly eating halal food we are all one step down the path towards the conversion, and that is a step we should only make with full knowledge and one that should not be imposed upon us without us knowing. What is happening is wrong. Too often the minorities in this country are looked after without regard to the majority. The time has come for this to stop. I call upon the following businesses in Western Australia and every business in Australia to clearly label halal meat and stop deceiving Australians: V&V Walsh, Western Meat Packers, Harvey Beef, WAMMCo, Hillside Tender Meats, Inghams and Steggles. In closing, I would like to recognise two Western Australian companies, Mount Barker Free Range Chickens and Dardanup Butchers Company, who have not yet yielded to the pressure to impose halal food on everybody regardless of their faith. Ben Donohoe Fun Run Capital Region Cancer Centre Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (09:47): Ben Donohoe was a sports-loving, caring and intelligent nine-year-old boy who lived with his parents, Robyn and Peter, and siblings, Luke, Lauren and Kate. An active boy who particularly loved cricket and soccer, he played every sport. He also loved his music and would sing and dance around his bedroom to the sounds of Shrek, Robbie Williams and Shannon Noll. Ben attended Latham Primary School and was in year 4 when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour on 10 June 2005. When he became sick, his mother Robyn would often ask him if there was anything she could get for him and Ben MAIN COMMITTEE would simply say, 'Just a cuddle.' That is a testament to his caring nature. Despite an operation to remove the tumour and despite Ben's determination, the tumour was too aggressive. Ben passed away on 2 August 2005, less than eight weeks after being diagnosed. Now in its seventh year, the Ben Donohoe Run and Walk for Fun has raised over $220,000 for the ACT Eden Monaro Cancer Support Group, Make-A-Wish Australia and Brain Tumour Australia. This has greatly helped in supporting families affected by cancer and bringing hope and joy to the lives of seriously ill children. The Ben Donohoe Run and Walk for Fun is now one of the largest fun runs in the region. On6 November, a team from my office ran the sixkilometre circuit around Lake Ginninderra with almost 2Â½ thousand others who helped raise over $65,000. Cancer patients in the ACT and surrounding region will also benefit from a new Capital Region Cancer Centre. When completed in late 2013, the new centre will improve cancer treatment by drawing together and integrating cancer services including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, haematology, immunology, research and teaching programs, within a single five-storey building on the Canberra Hospital campus. The Capital Region Cancer Centre is part of a $2 billion Australian government initiative to build a world-class cancer care system. It was my pleasure on 2 November to be part of a sod-turning with the Minister for Health and Ageing; Katy Gallagher, the Chief Minister of the ACT; the member for Canberra and Senator Lundy. The Capital Region Cancer Centre will service around half a million people across the ACT and surrounding regions by providing access to screening, assessment, diagnostic treatment and palliative care services. I would like to thank the organisers of the Ben Donohoe run, and members of the 'Leigh team', who wore T-shirts emblazoned with my name and joined me on the day-Damien Hickman, Gus Little, Claire Daly, Jules Zanetti, Angela Winkle, Karina Leys, Jess Woodall, Alex Cubis and Eleanor Cubis. Next year's Run and Walk for Fun will be on Sunday, 4 November 2012. I look forward to doing another lap of the lake and encourage all Canberrans to take part. Swan Electorate: Transit Guards parliament-and I hear the members on the opposite side cheering in remembrance!-I rise to speak about two transit guards who suffered some horrific injuries at the Beckenham train station in my electorate of Swan in the early hours of Sunday morning. After being alerted to troubles on the train, the transit officers were called on to deal with problems as the train made its way through my electorate before evicting large groups of troublemakers at Beckenham station. In the local news it was reported that, after shepherding them off the train, the female officer turned around to face the other side of the platform. At that moment a man ran from behind and glassed her face. A male transit officer was subsequently knocked unconscious and fell onto the tracks. The female transit officer has received 17 stitches to her face after suffering severe lacerations, and the male officer will be off work for several weeks with severe injuries. This was a horrific and cowardly attack on people whose job is to try to protect the people of Perth in Western Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Constituency Statements
188,Mr Irons (Swan) (09:50,"On this fourth anniversary of my election to thisAs members would be aware, I have a long-running local community campaign for safety improvements on the Armadale line. As my constituents know, I have been consistently calling for permanent guards to be positioned at all stations on the line in my electorate. The Thornlie-Armadale train line consistently records the highest number of assaults of any line in Perth, and the last year has been no different, with a number of troubling incidents. We call it the 'Crime Line'. I began my campaign after a 16-year-old was assaulted by three youths when leaving the Burswood station on 21 June 2009. Since then I have met communities at all train stations on the line, spent a morning at the CCTV monitoring station in Perth, held meetings with the police and distributed railway crime surveys to gauge public sentiment. Responses to my rail line survey strongly show that the people want to see these stations guarded at all times, and this is what I have been campaigning for on behalf of the community. I presented those survey results in person to the authorities-to the PTA, the police and the state government. I renew these calls again today. It is my view that we need to look at the Victorian model that will soon be put in place by the Baillieu government. In my view this is what the WA state government needs to move towards, and I presented this idea to them earlier this year. I am encouraged that the state government is to launch a four-week blitz and that Minister Buswell will go on some night patrols with transit officers to assess the situation. However, we do need a longer term solution, and I urge the government to consider the Baillieu model. And, while it is not often that I agree with unions, I agree with their support for the transit officers, who do a great job at night-time on the trains in Perth. I also take this opportunity to wish all my colleagues, on both sides of parliament, all the best for Christmas and look forward to seeing them return safely to this place early next year. Merry Christmas to everyone. Volunteers Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (09:53): Thirty-four per cent of the Australian adult population volunteer. They contribute over 700,000 hours of volunteer work each year. TodayI rise to say thank you to those who choose to volunteer overseas. Our international volunteers work tirelessly in developing countries all over the world, including the Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East, often playing a vital role in the fight against poverty and making a profound difference to communities that they serve. I would particularly like to acknowledge some of the incredible individuals from my electorate who have recently returned from overseas service. Apineru Apineru volunteered in Cambodia for Habitat Humanity Australia; Wesley Baker volunteered for ABV in East Timor; Joseph Elias volunteered as a protection adviser through Australian Volunteers International in Lebanon; Renee Grant volunteered his time in the Philippines with Habitat Humanity Australia; Hazel Maglantay volunteered as an organisational development adviser in the Philippines; Cara McGrath volunteered in Cambodia for Habitat Humanity Australia; Mel Chung Ng, through UnitingWorld, worked in Fiji as one of the medical personnel with the Fiji eye care team; and Daniel Tay, through Habitat Humanity Australia, volunteered his time in Indonesia. MAIN COMMITTEE Lastly, I thank and congratulate a very special young lady, Katrina Lancaster, who not only deserves recognition for her volunteer work in Samoa but also, on Tuesday night, won the Young Disability Challenge Award at the Australian government's National Disability Awards. That is an incredible achievement. As a young deaf woman, Katrina displayed outstanding leadership qualities running youth empowerment projects and working with schools to build a network of deaf youths to share information with students and families so that they are equipped for life as deaf adults. Her volunteering has led her across international borders to Samoa, where she helps to equip deaf Samoans to take leadership in the development of their community and to work towards full inclusion for themselves and for others with disability. Katrina and all the other volunteers act as great ambassadors for Australia. By serving in the way they do, they change their own lives forever, develop a perspective on the world that few of us share and change the lives of those they serve. Through volunteering they strive for the great Australian spirit of a fair go for everyone. I thank them all and express my deep appreciation for their efforts. Bennelong Electorate: Schools are fortunate to be given the opportunity to spend time in our electorates congratulating students and teachers on a successful year and joining our local community for holiday celebrations and Christmas cheer. In Bennelong I will be attending the Ryde Secondary College 10th anniversary and the launch of their community partnership program. Ten years ago the school changed its name from Malvina High School to Ryde Secondary College. The school's principal, Cassy Norris, has established a program of community partnership with local business, the community, the council and clubs. The idea is that these organisations can provide work experience placements as well as mentorships for students. Principal Norris is very keen to build links between her school and local businesses to assist the students. This is a great initiative, and I congratulate Casey Norris on the program. I am looking forward to joining her in a week's time. I will also be attending Karonga School's celebration of learning and the official opening of its new amenities block. Principal Sue Dennett has requested that I present the Bennelong award as I did last year. This year's winner is Cyrus Chan, who has won the award for most outstanding year 12 student. I congratulate Cyrus and Sue for their hard work in this very impressive educational facility in Bennelong. Other schools and speech nights I will be attending include those to be held at Epping Boys High School, Denistone East Public School, West Ryde Public School, Epping North Public School, North Ryde Public School, Marsden High School and Marist College Eastwood-and I am sure there will be others. The community celebrations culminate in the Weekly Times Rotary Community Christmas Carols Spectacular on 18 December at North Ryde Common. I urge all in the area to attend this very special community event. As we come to terms with the great challenges that face us, we can think back to the famous quote by Winston Churchill, 'A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.' As we come to the end of a very difficult year with international conflict, world economies in crisis and many challenges at home, there is still cause for optimism, with our frontier character, to seek a better life and a better wayMAIN COMMITTEE",134,Constituency Statements

I wish all of you and your families and local communities a very merry Christmas. Speaker Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (09:58): I take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to Harry Jenkins, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives. All his life, Harry has been totally dedicated to the principles of democracy, and he has brought humour, integrity and a fair approach to the role of Speaker. Harry has the respect of and is held in high regard by not only members on this side or members on the other side but also, I think, all the staff in this parliament. Harry has been a friend to us all. He has acted as a mentor to most members of parliament. He is always there to talk through issues when you need to. He has exasperated me and made me angry when he has been in the Speaker's chair, and I think that shows what a great Speaker he was. He really delivered to the parliament by being bipartisan in the way he fulfilled his role as Speaker. Harry would have to be one of the people I hold in the highest esteem within this parliament. I thank him publicly for what he has done for this parliament, what he has done for our country and what he has done for democracy. I know that he will continue to make enormous contributions and will still have that wonderful sense of humour. He will still be a friend to us all and be the unique Harry Jenkins-a very special person who has established a place for himself in history because of the way he was able to conduct himself and what he brought to this parliament as Speaker. Thank you, Harry. I say that on behalf of all members of this House. Shortland. As Deputy Speaker, I endorse the remarks made by the honourable member. Mr Speaker Jenkins and I have had a very good working relationship, and he has my greatest admiration.

192,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10:30,"by leave-It has been a very active day in thean important time for the forestry industry. The debate on forestry has been raging for the last 20 years, and it is time to look properly at the future of the industry. The House committee has certainly done that. Its report reflects the nuances of the discussion on forestry. The title comes, of course, from the saying 'you can't see the forest for the trees', meaning, in this case, that people have been focusing too much on the details and have lost sight of the bigger picture of forestry and the importance it has for this nation-for the states, the regional centres and rural Australia. We need to look at the big picture of forestry because it is the mainstay of many areas of the Australian economy-it has been so in the past and will continue to be so into the future. It also has an important role to play in the world's efforts in dealing with excess carbon emissions. There is a lot to do around the use of wood. When I look around this room I see how much carbon is stored here in wooden products-in our furniture and in our panelling. We have to make sure we are measuring the storage of carbon and recognising where it is stored. There is a great future for forestry. It can help with the storage of carbon. Also, it is a renewable resource whereas resources such as plastic and steel, which contain an enormous amount of embedded energy, are not. The forestry industry does not use much energy converting wood into what we see in front of us in this room, so it presents a great opportunity. We import about $2 billion worth of forest products, but we do not want to be taking wood from other parts of the world, especially countries in our own region, which certainly do not have the same environmental standards as we have in this country. The report also focuses on the time when I believe we started to really get on top of forestry policy. The National Forest Policy Statement came about in 1992, and from that grew the RFA processes and the regional forest agreements which meant that we focused on regions to make sure that we maintained the different species of each region. We wanted to make sure that we had a lasting process based on science so that we could continue to have a good forest industry into the future, and that is what we have done. The report focuses on renewing RFAs and on making sure they are modern and that they deal with the issues we will need to deal with in the future. For this report the committee consulted widely with many communities and all aspects of forest industry. We certainly looked at downstream processing and how that has changed. We looked at how the peelings from small logs that come from thinnings are now turned into really good products. There are opportunities for building large pieces of wood from small pieces by joining them together, and we saw that the economics of all those things work very well. Those things can be done in regional Australia in the sawmilling industry that we presently have. Through innovation there are lots of opportunities for new products that will take us forward but we also need to have a look at how we grow wood. We need look to the future and decide how to encourage investment in the forest industry-whether it is through plantations or supporting rural Australia through our farming communities. I think 70 per cent of the Australian landmass is owned privately and there is a lot of wood there that can come into production, but it can also store carbon into the future. We need to find the right policy settings for that. Farmers certainly need extension work and there is the aspect of meeting the future needs of the Australian industry. We need to help farmers take advantage of those opportunities and reach the potentials available through the storage of carbon and the production of wood. MAIN COMMITTEE We need to look at the way we build plantations. People look at plantations as being monocultures when really that is only one part of what a plantation can be. There can be many species in a plantation. Farmers looking at growing wood can do it in different configurations on their farms. We had a good discussion within the committee about bringing forward opportunities from Caring for our Country to encourage that sort of policy direction. Where a farmer might plant three rows of trees to protect a river or creek bank, maybe we could go out to 10 or 15 rows and fence it, therefore building a whole wood lot in that place. These are innovative ideas that we should be able to achieve. But farmers will need help in extension, in finding the right business model and, of course, in finding the opportunity, as an enterprise, to be able to turn a dollar and pay their way. When we were taking information and evidence it was quite interesting. It was pointed out that many farmers have the opportunity not to make a cut at a certain time. They have a lot more flexibility, and wood gives them opportunities outside the normal agricultural cropping cycles-the turning off of lambs or beef cattle or whatever-so their incomes can be stretched out. There are lots of opportunities into the future but we need to look innovatively. Governments certainly have a role to play in getting some of these policy directions right. In the committee we touched on the arguments that come up in terms of land use-forestry versus other crops-and we received evidence that there are overdone arguments that do not hold up. There is one per cent of the Australian landmass under plantation. So some arguments against plantations do not make much sense, although plantations certainly have an effect in a local area and should be done in a proper, sensitive way to meet the needs of the community. What species is grown is very important. We certainly came across areas where, during previous times, when we were trying to meet the needs of the 2020 Vision project, trees of the wrong species were planted in the wrong area so that we did not get the right outcome-the proper outcome that we could have got for the nation and for this industry. We need to make sure that we get those things right. We need to have the policy directions that pull things together and make them work. This is a very good report-I certainly hope. It is a very important report. It is also a report well done. I am very proud to have been the chair of the committee. I am very proud of the people who put in so much, including the staff of the secretariat. I believe we have done very good work that will go on to help governments and oppositions form good policy positions into the future. We wanted to make sure that waste from the forest industry could be dealt with for the best economic benefit for the nation. We based the recommendation on that being waste only-that we do not go into native forests and use them as the basis for, say, driving a power station. The waste from sawmills and the timber industry should be used fully, for the best economic need, as they do in other parts of the world. Europe and South America, for instance, are driven by the greener side of politics, and bioenergy is one of the big renewable energies. So we need to make sure that we are on board for that and not left behind as a nation. There are some very good recommendations and some very good work in this report. I am very proud that we have been able to pull it together, and I believe that it will serve the nation well. MAIN COMMITTEE Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has tabled this report, which makes 19 recommendations for the Australian forestry industry. The committee inquired into the prospects of the industry, including opportunities for and constraints upon production, opportunities for diversification, value adding and innovation, the environmental impacts of forestry, the potential for energy production and land-use competition. The future prospects for forestry, according to the report, are huge. As an industry, it can and will provide for many other industries, nationwide. There are exciting new avenues for investment and innovation opening up to Australian forestry. Forestry has the potential to contribute renewable energy to the Australian economy and to improve land management practices across the agricultural sector. The Australian construction industry will be supplied with more building materials, which, in turn, will bring about more job opportunities. The chance for timber as a building product will increase as we move into a more carbon constrained world. Many Australian timbers are prized for their unique qualities and over time further markets for these timbers will surely develop. Timber can be engineered to be used in many different applications and as a renewable and carbon storage building material it has a clear advantage over many other building materials. The demand for timber in the construction industry is expected to increase in the years to come. The forestry industry is well placed to benefit, obviously, from this increased demand. In addition to the inherent value of Australian timbers, new investments and new methods of processing will enable the industry to add value to all products that come out of Australian forests. According to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the average national consumption of wood products is 22 million cubic metres per year. By comparison, around 27 million cubic metres of logs are harvested in Australia each year. However, Australia still imports a large amount of wood products and has a trade deficit in wood products-totalling $1.9 billion in 2010. According to Australia's forests at a glance 2011, Australia imported $4.2 billion worth of wood products in 2010 and exported $2.3 billion worth in the same year. The committee believes that the forestry industry needs greater certainty about possible demand and supply scenarios in the decades to come. The forestry industry has one of the longest lead times in the Australian economy. It will benefit from a better picture about how the market might look into the future and policy needed in this area. Forestry is a key component of the Riverina economy. This is certainly so in the Tumbarumba and Tumut shires. It has long been so. The towns are heavily reliant on the wealth generated by the softwood industries, particularly involving the Hyne timber mill at Tumbarumba and Visy at Tumut. This weekend, the Prime Minister is due to open Visy's first waste-to-energy plant at its Coolaroo manufacturing and recycling plant in Melbourne. The event is expected to be attended by more than 2,000 people, according to yesterday's Australian. The Coolaroo energy-from-waste plant will reduce Visy's emissions by 70,000 tonnes a year and divert 100,000 tonnes of waste which would have gone to landfill. In a clean and green environment, which we all want, that has to be seen as a very positive thing. It will reduce the gas used in the manufacturing and recycling plant by half and 10 per cent of the energy consumption. Again, that is an extremely good thing. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Committees
193,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:41,"The House of Representatives StandingThe plans of Visy's executive chairman, Anthony Pratt, follow his commitment four years ago to invest US$1 billion in paper recycling and waste-to-energy infrastructure at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York. Last year, Visy's American associate Pratt Industries commissioned a US$60 million energy plant in Georgia which converts waste from its manufacturing into gas. Mr Pratt and his company are visionaries. They do great things right across this country and certainly great things for my electorate in the Riverina, particularly through the Visy pulp and paper mill at Tumut. The new waste-to-energy plant in Australia, which is likely to be located adjacent to Visy's Tumut pulp and paper mill in southern New South Wales, will be three times the size of the US facility, and that has got to be a tremendous thing both for the Riverina economy and for the Australian economy. It will provide baseload power, unlike other renewable energy technologies such as solar or wind power. In this day and age, when we have people such as Anthony Pratt willing to invest in those sorts of things, that is good. This report for the forestry industry is also a positive one and I commend it to the House. for Riverina in relation to Visy. The Coolaroo plant is in my electorate, and I very much look forward not only to its contribution to the environment; it is a major employer in my local community. on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry entitled Seeing the forest through the trees. I want to quote a couple of things from the report. The first is from A Whitney Brown, writer and comedian, who said: â€¦ They give us two of the most crucial elements for our survival: oxygen and books! The other is Henry Abbey's poem. It is very appropriate and I would like to have it recorded; I thank the secretariat for including it. The poem is as follows: What do we plant when we plant the tree? We plant the ship, which will cross the sea. We plant the mast to carry the sails; We plant the planks to withstand the galesThe keel, the keelson, and the beam and knee; We plant the ship when we plant the tree.

196,Mr Lyons (Bass) (10:47,"I rise today to speak on the report of the Standing CommitteeWe plant the spire that out-towers the crag, We plant the staff for our country's flag, We plant the shade, from the hot sun free; We plant all these things when we plant the tree. Australia has 149.4 million hectares of forest, comprising 147.4 hectares of native forest and two million hectares of plantations. These forests cover about 21 per cent of the continent. That is about eight hectares of forest for each Australian, one of the highest areas of forest per person in the world. The world average is less than 0.6 hectares of forest per person. Australia has about four per cent of the world's forests. I have recently witnessed first hand the devastating effects of uncertainty in the forest industry in my own electorate of Bass. I have spoken in this place before about Scottsdale and the north-east of my electorate of Bass. This is an area that has, in the past, been heavily reliant upon the forest industry. This region has faced a period of substantial uncertainty, with forest downturn in Tasmania. This saw the loss of many jobs in the area, which had a widespread impact on my local community. But the assistance provided in this report will begin to regain a level of certainty and direction for communities such as Scottsdale. With a range of climate and soil types, the north-east of Tasmania is suitable for a range of agricultural production, being the recipient of a significant and reliable rainfall and being assisted by the federal Labor government with respect to several irrigation schemes. Forestry is a major sector of this region. In fact, in 2010, 26 per cent of the region's employment came from the agricultural and forestry sectors alone. As pointed out by many submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, the forest industry in Tasmania is currently undergoing some substantial changes. This is largely due to the announcement of a 'Statement of principles to lead to an agreement', which was signed on 14 October 2010. The central aim of the process, beginning with the statement of principles, was to resolve the conflict over forests in Tasmania, to protect native forests and to develop a strong, sustainable timber industry. There are a number of parties to the statement of principles. It is important to note that neither the Tasmanian government nor the Australian government were parties to the statement. However, the Australian government has welcomed the new relationship between industry, union and environmental organisations to develop the Tasmanian forest statement of principles to lead to an agreement as a positive step towards balancing the conservation and sustainable development and management of Tasmania's forest resources. It is important to have the recommendations on the record. Recommendation 10 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government lead a process through COAG to create a national plan for plantations, to ensure that: ï‚· plantations of appropriate species are planted in appropriate locations; and ï‚· appropriate regional infrastructure exists or is planned and funded. Recommendation 11 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government: ï‚· decide whether the encouragement of long-rotation plantations is an appropriate objective of policy â€¦ MAIN COMMITTEE Recommendation 13 states: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in concert with state and local governments, provide immediate and ongoing financial support to local organisations that provide extension services for farm forestry, particularly through the Caring for our Country initiative. Recommendation 19 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government lead a process of discussions with all state and territory governments, to consider national approaches to: ï‚· Forestry and climate change; ï‚· Farm forestry; andmost importantlyï‚· Future wood product demand and supply. A persistent theme of the inquiry focused on the need for research and development of the forestry industry. These calls came from industry, community and environmental organisations, as well as from academics. This need was identified across all areas of the industry, including native forestry, plantation forestry, farm forestry, production development and energy generation. Many submissions to the inquiry noted that many plantations have not been managed for sawlog production. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry submitted that less than 10 per cent-perhaps no more than five per cent-of hardwood plantations are managed for sawlog production. The remaining 90 to 95 per cent of hardwood plantations are managed for lower value products, such as woodchips. Another issue I wish to outline is that there is considerable agreement that managed investment schemes did little to support long-rotation sawlog plantations. Evidence, however, suggests that it might be able to do so in the future. As noted by Ian Ruscoe of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, legislative change in 2007 was aimed at ensuring longrotation plantations could be supported by MIS. Throughout this report the committee has focused on new forestry opportunities, both for today and for the future. The committee firmly believes that the future of the Australian forestry industry is bright and looks forward to seeing those in the industry take advantage of those opportunities. May I take this opportunity to thank the secretariat, for their hard work; the committee chair, the member for Lyons; and those who took the time to make submissions to the inquiry. I would like to thank all the witnesses who provided evidence to the committee during the inquiry and those who took us on informative site visits. During the course of the inquiry, the committee were impressed by the passion and commitment of individuals and groups throughout the forestry industry. New methods of forestry planning and management are continually making an impact on the forestry industry, and this will enable the industry to be more efficient and flexible in the future. This inquiry has come at an important time for the forestry industry, especially in my home state of Tasmania. We were privileged to visit some of Australia's timber communities to talk about the future of the industry. MAIN COMMITTEE Forestry in the future will be about putting the right trees in the right places for the right reasons. Australia must be able to plan for the future of the forestry industry. As the poem said at the start of my speech: What do we plant when we plant the tree? We plant the ship, which will cross the sea. We are moving to a great future for forestry, but it must be planned and we must get the right trees in the right places for the right reasons. One of the most important aspects of any inquiry is to spend time listening to people talk about the things they know best. I firmly believe that, with the right policy, the industry has a bright future and will continue to play an important role in Australia's economy, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I say again: we should plan to put the right trees in the right places at the right time for the right reasons for Australia. Bass, on a poetic contribution, the member for Riverina and the member for Lyons, all of whom have a great interest in the subject of forestry. I am very proud to be a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry and to have had a place in this inquiry. The inquiry, as has been said, has come up with this fantastic report, Seeing the forest through the trees, which has made 19 recommendations. The inquiry was tasked through its terms of reference to inquire into the forestry industry, looking at different aspects, including: Opportunities for and constraints upon production; Opportunities for diversification, value adding and product innovation; Environmental impacts of forestry â€¦ ; Creating a better business environment for forest industries â€¦ ; Social and economic benefits of forestry production; Potential energy production from the forestry sector â€¦ ; Land use competition â€¦ The final one was obviously an interest of mine, as I come from a sugar-growing region where there have been some issues over that, but I have to say that I came to this from my part of the world without a great deal of expertise in or knowledge of forestry. It was heartening to see the number of submissions and people who came before the inquiry from industry sector groups basically saying that there is a bright future for forestry. The one thing that they said needed to happen was that government also have the view that forestry is viable as an industry and to put plans in place that ensure the industry's viability into the future. The recommendations that have come out of this inquiry in the report certainly pave the way for a bright future for forestry. If they are adopted by government, then they will provide a sound basis for the industry into the future. Recommendation 1 calls on the government, through the COAG Standing Council on Primary Industries, to lead a process to assess and report publicly on the likely wood demandand-supply scenarios over, say, the next 40 years. We are also calling on the COAG council to consider and report publicly on whether this nation should aim for self-sufficiency in wood supply. There is strong support for that concept within the committee. Recommendation 3 calls on the government to run public information campaigns to promote timber and wood products as replacements for more energy-intensive materials. There has been a concerted negative view of forestry over a long time-it has been thought that it is a bunch of people just chopping down trees and doing nothing for the environmentMAIN COMMITTEE",141,Committees
197,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (10:57,"I would like to congratulate the member forbut the fact is that wood products consume less energy than most products out there on the market. That needs to be factored in. The general public need to understand that wood is not an anti-environmental product. There are groups out there at the moment such as GetUp which are really flogging this angle and running campaigns against legitimate commercial operations such as Harvey Norman. They are basically campaigning against wood products. That is why it is very important that the government look at a public education campaign on the subject. The other thing we recommended along these lines is that COAG create a number of national plans, including a national plan for plantations to ensure that appropriate species are placed in appropriate locations and that there is appropriate infrastructure in places where plantations are planned. We have again called on the government, through COAG, to develop a national plan which would enable infrastructure for farmed forestry to be funded and constructed-another very important part of the mix if we are to have a viable forestry industry in the future. The final recommendation of the report-and I certainly have not listed them all; there are 19 of them-was for the government to hold discussions on national approaches to farmed forestry and future wood product supply and demand. I suggest that that would have to be done through COAG. All of these things are vitally important. The report also looked at RFAs, regional forestry agreements, which have been controversial in the past. But the way forward that has been suggested here would reconcile the conflicting interests. We have said that the RFAs should be renewed, incorporating an evergreen extensions process. Ensuring that the industry has that longer term would provide security. The committee has called for new RFAs to be in place for at least three years before the expiry of the existing agreements and for a new regime within RFAs for ongoing monitoring and periodic assessment. Another thing within the report which is mentioned a number of times is the concept of social licences, obviously for regional areas where there is forestry. There are certain impacts on the community, particularly where new plantations are being planted, so the concept of social licences is discussed. It is something where we think the industry itself needs to look at it and then come to some agreement on what is acceptable when setting up in a new location to get that social licence with the community. I fully support that concept. One of the things the committee has recommended, and this is an extremely important aspect, is that native forest biomass be considered a source of renewable energy under the renewable energy targets. It is immensely important that that be taken into consideration. The issue of conflict in land use has been an issue, particularly in my electorate of Dawson, which is historically known as a sugar-growing area. It ranges from Mackay through Proserpine and the Whitsundays and up through the Burdekin to Townsville. I think my electorate would be the largest sugar-growing electorate in all of Australia. We have had an experience with forestry and I have to say it probably has not been a good experience. The experience was one that was driven by managed investment schemes. The committee has certainly taken what I think is a fairly reasonable, but hard, view on managed investment schemes. I want to give some background to some of the issues that occurred in my electorate on this matter. Canegrowers are the peak body for sugar farmers in Australia and I want to read a section from a submission they gave to a previous inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint MAIN COMMITTEE Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into agribusiness MISs and the impact they had. They said: MIS investments can use their tax advantages to bid for prime agricultural land to the detriment of existing industries. In the case of the sugar cane industry, ongoing viability of a region depends on the availability of sugar milling capacity. That means land and cropping land. They continue: If a significant proportion of a sugar mill supply area is alienated, the mill would become uneconomical and would close. Cane cannot be transported economically more than about 60km, so unless there were another mill in that radius, all growers in that area would thereby have lost access to growing their traditional, high-value crop. That particular problem was causing a great deal of angst to growers in the Sarina, Proserpine and Burdekin areas, which are all within or near my electorate. We have seen MISs go belly up with the problem they had. I think there were fundamental flaws with the whole thing. The report from the inquiry has recommendations in regard to managed investment schemes. The committee said that the government should be looking at whether or not they think that long-term rotation plantations are an appropriate part of policy in terms of forestry's future; whether it is necessary and appropriate for government to provide incentives in that regard; and whether MISs are the best mechanism for reaching that objective. If they still do think it is then it needs to be seen whether or not it can be altered to make it much more effective. If it cannot meet that objective, why are we still doing it? The submissions we received and the statements made by people who fronted the inquirysome were from within the industry and others were talking about the impact of the industry in their community, and when I say 'industry' I mean MIS forestry-said that there were problems such as inappropriate species planted in inappropriate places, dislocation of other industries and a range of different issues. Finding the balance in terms of where forestry should be, where MISs should be and where there should be other agricultural pursuits is something that I know the committee was very mindful of. I commend most of the report. There is some stuff about the carbon tax in there and implications regarding that that I do have an issue with, but, all in all, I welcome the report and hope that governments look at the recommendations into the future. Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry report to the House. Like the previous speaker, I do not agree with everything in it but I agree with the overall nature of it. I would like to thank all committee members for their contribution to this and I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the secretariat for the very good way they managed the process and all the logistics around it. The report has come up with a number of recommendations. I would like to step through those recommendations because I think they are important and go to the heart of what is in the report. The first recommendation is: â€¦ the Australian Government, through the COAG Standing Council on Primary Industries, lead a process to assess and publicly report on likely wood demand and supply scenarios over the longer term â€¦ MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Committees
198,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (11:10,"I rise today to commend this House of RepresentativesBy 'longer term' we mean over the next 40 years. We would like to see this process completed within 12 months. That was one of the clear things that we heard evidence on: there should be a public process which should include both state and federal governments to report on what Australia's future timber demands are going to be. That would help coordinate and plan for what occurs within the industry and how the government can help and facilitate as a result of that plan. The second recommendation is that, once again, through the COAG Standing Council on Primary Industries, there be: â€¦ a process to consider and publicly report on whether Australia should aim for wood supply 'selfsufficiency'. I do not think that we should get too hung up on the end result. The main thing is that we look clearly at where Australia wants to head with its timber production, what our overall aims are and what the overall policy settings, from both the federal and the state levels, should be to achieve that. Recommendation 3 asks the Australian government to: â€¦ run public information campaigns to promote timber and wood products as replacements for more energy-intensive materials. That is something that we need to do because, sadly, the green movement has captured the view of timber, logging and the whole process of forestry. There is a real need for us to reeducate, especially young Australians, on the whole timber process-how user-friendly and renewable timber products are. We really need to get the balance back in this argument. We have been chopping down trees since Adam and Eve and we need to continue to do so. As long as it is done in a manageable way, in a renewable way, we can and should continue to do it; yet, sadly, I get the feeling that the Greens would be very happy if not another tree was chopped down in Australia. This is a problem that I think we need to address sensibly. Both major political parties could usefully look at something around this and say, 'Let's go out there and look at what the timber industry has to offer Australia.' The fourth recommendation is: â€¦ the Australian Government develop robust national standards quantifying the carbon stored in different products made from harvested trees, including the duration of storage and policy implications of those standards. Once again, a fairly sensible recommendation. We can look around at all the timber here in the Main Committee chamber. There is carbon stored in all the wood product here. We should be able to see the benefits of that. We are not causing severe environmental harm by chopping down a tree; if you replant that tree and you use the timber wisely, you are actually storing carbon. We have to make sure that we take notice of that, and that is a sensible part of the public debate on how we can make sure that we use timber successfully and also promote timber as being an environmentally friendly product. The fifth recommendation of the committee was that the Australian government, as it develops a mature Carbon Farming Initiative regime, consider the capacity for additionality, the capacity for permanence and other ways for the CFI to support the forestry industry generally. This recommendation is not very clear cut-we have to be very careful in this area. But there are real opportunities when it comes to farm forestry. This is where the use of MAIN COMMITTEE additionality and the use of permanence can, if we get the policy settings right, benefit farm forestry. With farm forestry, I am not talking about a plantation of a single species in a vast area; what I am talking about is a farmer using 10 or 15 per cent of his land for tree plantations whereby he can actually increase the productivity of that land by the sensible plantation of timber and then that timber can value-add to his property because in 20 or 30 years time he can rotate that timber. It can be hardwood timber which goes into mills. If done sensibly this is an area where we can get farming communities and the timber communities working together. When it comes to additionality, when it comes to permanence, if we get the settings right, this can be very good. If we do not, sadly, there is a worry that the CFI could lead to more single plantations, and we heard a lot of evidence that they were put in at the wrong time at the wrong place and have not benefited anyone. If we get this recommendation right, there are some real opportunities there. Recommendations 6, 7, 8 and 9 are around native forestry. Once again, this report sets clearly what should be defined as a 'native forest' and what should be defined as an 'oldgrowth forest'. We need to stick to these definitions and we need to stick to them in our regional forestry plans. We are seeing timber communities being driven out of forestry under regional forestry agreements because of the continual redefining of what is a native forest and what is an old-growth forest. The more they are redefined, the more our timber industry is going to rely on plantations, which is then going to create land use issues between farmers, between the timber industry-and we are already seeing land use competition when it comes to mining. We have got to get this balance right. But we have to make sure that, where forestry has been occurring, we let it continue. Let us not define an area which has been forested as all of a sudden being 'old-growth' and 'native' so those timber industries and timber communities who want to go in and harvest that product can no longer do so. I am hoping that that will be something which comes out of that series of recommendations. Recommendations 10 and 11 are around plantations. To me these are the most important recommendations which have come out of all this work-and obviously that is very much a personal view rather than a committee view. Recommendation 10 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government lead a process through COAG to create a national plan for plantations, to ensure that: ï‚· plantations of appropriate species are planted in appropriate locations; and ï‚· appropriate regional infrastructure exists or is planned and funded. Recommendation 11 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government: ï‚· decide whether the encouragement of long-rotation plantations is an appropriate objective of policy; ï‚· establish whether it is necessary and appropriate for government to provide an incentive to meet that objective; ï‚· if it is, set out a clear plan to meet that objective, according to the national plan for plantations; ï‚· assess whether MIS as a mechanism can meet that objective; ï‚· if MIS can meet that objective, determine whether it needs to be altered to make it more effective; and ï‚· if MIS cannot meet that objective, determine whether other mechanisms could do so. MAIN COMMITTEE The evidence we heard on MIS was quite damning. It is not working. It might have led to investment in regional and rural communities when it started, but that investment was driven by corporates looking for a tax advantage, not by the long-term interests of regional and rural communities. My view-but it is agreed by the committee and by all sides-is that the minimum we need to do is to review and relook at this. I hope that the government will be doing that, and I will be doing everything I can to make sure that the coalition does that. This policy needs to be reviewed, and seriously reviewed. We have stepped out the process by which that should take place, and I will now be doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. MIS needs to be reviewed. We need to take evidence to see whether it is continuing to do what it was designed to do. My strong belief is that it is not. We need to relook at this whole area. That is what the committee has recommended, and I would hope that all sides will be looking at doing that now. Recommendation 11 of this report is a very important recommendation. My view is: if we can get the long-term investment incentives right, we will see farm forestry continue to grow, with all the environmental benefits that that will bring, instead of one sector, the timber sector, competing with the farm sector in a way which I think does no good whatsoever to either side. Farming communities suffer. And, if you look at what is happening currently, especially in the area that I represent, the electorate of Wannon, you will see MIS plantations, trees, being ripped out of the ground and burnt. That is not doing anything for the timber industry either. We need to relook at this policy area. We need to get it right. My view is also that, following on from our committee's work, we really need a committee somewhere to look at recommendation 11-take it by itself, look at it and have a full review of what needs to happen in this area. We need to look at whether we need longrotation plantation investment and to encourage that investment. Recommendations 12 and 13 go to farm forestry. I was particularly glad to host the committee in the electorate of Wannon and to look at some of the farm forestry practices there. I think these have enormous potential. In my view we are going to see farm forestry grow, because you can continue to farm successfully by adding a little bit of diversity by putting plantations into 10 to 15 per cent. The evidence overwhelmingly was that this would increase the productivity of the farm plus increase the future income of the farm itself. So it is win-win, and it is an area where I think we need to see enormous growth. It is an area where, if we get the Carbon Farming Initiative correct, we could see a lot of growth. And it is something which I will continue to speak up on and to push. I am running out of time so I will look at part 7, which includes recommendations 15, 16 and 17, to do with forestry biomass. The evidence we heard on this was overwhelming. We have these policy settings wrong. We are not encouraging biomass use as a renewable form. We are all, at the moment, beholden to the Greens and their ideology. It is ill-founded. It defies logic. It defies what the Greens are pushing as a movement in Europe, where they are encouraging biomass. It is the largest renewable energy source in Europe. That we are not doing that in this country beggars belief. We have to look at the absurdity of this policy, especially when it comes to the carbon tax-taxing carbon usage in the timber industries and then not allowing the use of biomass. Those timber offcuts are now going to go into landfill and release the worse kind of CO2 emission, nitrous oxide. How you could have a policy in place which is going to lead to this is-there are no other words to describe it-beyond belief. MAIN COMMITTEE I will leave it there at recommendation 18 in the chapter 'Forestry into the future' and the rest of the report. I think the timber industry does have a strong future in this country. If we get the policy settings right we will see that happen. What we have to do is change the way the timber industry is viewed. We have to get education into our schools to see the merits and the environmental friendliness of the industry, change the way it is perceived and change some of the policy settings. The timber industry's future is bright. (Time expired) on the Seeing the forest through the trees inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. Upfront, I would like to put on the record my thanks to the secretariat, who did a first-class job in assisting the committee in undertaking its deliberations. I think the forestry industry has a very bright future in Australia-albeit it is an industry that has been going through and will continue to go through significant innovation in the way in which it conducts its business, particularly as in many parts of Australia we transition out of more traditional native forestry into more plantation and on-farm or private land forestry. That has been taking place for some time and will continue to do so. I was delighted with the efforts that the committee put in, particularly in terms of farm forestry. Farm forestry has a very bright future, particularly if we get the policy settings right at a national level. I would like to highlight a very successful group in my part of the world, the Otway Agroforestry Network, which has been advising fellow farmers of the benefits of farm forestry for some years. Indeed, I have seen first hand many farmers who have planted out their properties to the tune of 15 to 20 per cent without affecting the productivity of their properties or reducing stock on their properties and, as a consequence, have provided themselves with a long-term investment which they are able to take advantage of in more challenging years-and they have done so particularly over the last 10 years through drought and the like. The real strength of an agroforestry approach, particularly if it is supported by government, is having in place a peer mentoring service, where farmers provide advice in an extension sense to other farmers. That is a far more powerful model than having extension provided by bureaucrats. Farmers providing advice and support to other farmers is an inherently stronger model. It is a model that will provide an opportunity for farmers not only in terms of being mentors but also in giving them access to people in their area that they trust who have a lot of practical experience in agroforestry. There is a real opportunity, particularly in marrying agroforestry with more traditional landcare. I use a practical example. Farmers, perhaps through a traditional landcare grant, might choose to fence off and plant a creek bed. Moving that fence 15 or 20 metres further into their properties provides an opportunity for farmers to plant a number of rows of hardwood timberA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:30 to 12:04 contributionMAIN COMMITTEE",146,Committees

201,Mr Mccormack: Trees.,"no doubt that forestry has gone through and will continue to go through quite substantial innovation and change of practice as we continue that journey of transition out of more native forestry, which we have been doing. I was reflecting on the important contribution that agroforestry can make to Australia's wood security as we move forward. Not only is it good practice for farmers to undertake agroforestry where appropriate on their land; if it is done appropriately and with strong peer support in place, it can provide opportunities for farmers to diversify their own practices and provide support to fellow farmers in their communities. I think we have certainly been seeing that in a very strong way down in south-west Victoria, where agroforestry has been providing a useful additional income stream to farmers there. I would be hopeful that the work undertaken by the Otway Agroforestry Network can expand to other parts of Australia, where peer support mentoring can be put in place and agroforestry can take root. There are of course opportunities that will come from the Carbon Farming Initiative which will help support the extension of farm forestry throughout this nation, particularly in areas where farm forestry has been more marginal in the past. If developed properly and thought through and implemented appropriately, the Carbon Farming Initiative can provide additional support. I do want to again make reference to the role that the Caring for our Country program can play in coupling agroforestry or farm forestry with Landcare to provide real opportunities for environmental gain, particularly where farmers might have been fencing off and planting out watercourses for environmental reasons. If we could have some practical arrangements put in place, where fences could be extended further into properties by perhaps 20 or 30 metres, it will provide opportunities for additional rows of trees to be planted for commercial gain. Leaving the Landcare arrangements in place and appropriately harvesting the farm forestry rows where appropriate is something that we can continue to work through in the Caring for our Country arrangements to ensure that they do work appropriately, and of course marrying up the arrangements under the Carbon Farming Initiative. Comments have been made throughout the report, and certainly the committee received an enormous amount of evidence, on the taxation treatment of forestry. I think there are mixed views around the table on what taxation treatment for trees that have been planted has done for regional Australia. My view is that, in a broad sense, it has led to a very substantial additional planting of timber on private land, but there is and has been conflict between corporations-looking to plant, particularly, blue gums down my way-and farming communities. Of particular concern to some farmers is that they are having to compete with corporations on an unequal playing field, particularly around taxation. Further work and reform can be undertaken in this area to ensure that forestry does not have an unfair advantage over farming communities when it comes to acquiring a property. We need to think carefully about that as we move forward. We also need to consider carefully the taxation arrangements we have in place, which certainly has led to a very substantial increase in what we call shortrotation timber, which is predominantly grown for woodchip; predominantly the harvest can be secured after 10 or 15 years. That has done wonderful things for the woodchip market, but it has not helped with producing timber for structural purposes, tables or whatever. We do need to think carefully about whether additional arrangements can be put in place to encourage long rotation of timber so that we can work through a process to secure Australia's MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Committees
202,Mr Cheeseman,"I was talking about trees, as was quite rightly pointed out. There is long-term forestry, particularly recognising that we will continue that journey of transitioning out of native forestry. This inquiry has appropriately recommended additional work that needs to be undertaken at COAG, involving all the states and territories to continue to secure Australia's future wood independence. That is certainly something that I strongly endorse. A lot of work will be required, and I certainly hope that there is strong cooperation between the states and territories on this matter and that we continue to undertake that work. I very much look forward to having a discussion with the forestry minister to see how he might work through the recommendations within this report. There are some very strong opportunities moving forward. I recommend the report to all members of the House. Debate adjourned.

Then we will adjourn the Main Committee. former Mexican President Vicente Fox, 'serve as testimonies of man's greatness and establish a dialogue between civilizations showing the extent to which human beings are linked.' How very true. The German playwright Frank Wedekind said it best: 'Monuments are for the living, not the dead.' Across Australia, particularly in state capitals and the regional cities made rich in the mining booms of the 19th century, stone monuments literally glorify a golden age. Ballarat and Bendigo have some outstanding monumental pieces and architecture, preserving a heritage and history which made these Victorian centres great. Queen Victoria, Britain's longest serving monarch, still reigns over our metropolitan cities, including those in the two states named in her honour: Queensland and Victoria. Particularly striking is Sydney's larger-than-life bronze statue of Captain James Cook, standing on a cylindrical granite shaft and tiered granite base. The Hyde Park memorial to the mighty English cartographer and navigator, whose greatness should always be accurately depicted in the school curriculum, faces towards the Sydney Heads and shows Cook holding a telescope in his left hand whilst proudly pointing his right hand skywards. Perhaps the most common of all the monuments dotted across this wide, brown land are those that stand as proud yet sombre tributes to those who fell on the battlefields and in the trenches of the Great War of 1914-18. Memorials evoking the spirit of ANZAC are everywhere, from the acclaimed design masterpieces of the magnificent Australian War Memorial here in Canberra and those in the capital cities through to the stone soldiers-silent sentinels-gazing off into the distance atop columns of names of men who never made it home to their rural, regional and remote towns. It seems that every city, town, village and district has a war memorial in some shape or form, and that is wholly appropriate. Memorials are important. MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Committees

204,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (12:12,"'Monuments and archaeological pieces,' said'What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments but what is woven into the lives of others,' Greek statesman Pericles said nearly 2,500 years ago. He was right of course. There are plenty of great people who do not have great statues to ensure that their actions echo across the centuries. Nonetheless, monuments play a significant cultural and historical role in guaranteeing that tradition survives, perpetuating those deemed by their peers worthy of perpetuating and honouring causes and battles won and lost. To this end the parliament's National Capital and External Territories Committee has recommended a completely new process for approving national memorials. This is a noble venture. The committee's report, Etched in stone?, following the committee's inquiry into the management of the National Memorials Ordinance 1928, recommends that the ordinance be repealed and replaced with a commemorative works act. This would follow the same lines as those operating in Washington DC. The main features of the new legislation are: a definition of commemorative work covering both national memorials and national monuments; the formation of a national memorials advisory committee, a committee of historical, cultural and subject experts to consider commemorative intent; the establishment of new and binding criteria for commemorative works to underpin the assessment process; the development of a memorials master plan to guide future works; and a two-pass approvals process for commemorative works. At the first pass, memorial proponents must meet commemorative criteria and have an achievable budget. Proposals for commemorative intent are to start by motions in both houses of parliament and be approved on the recommendation of the National Capital and External Territories Committee. At the second pass, design and location are to be agreed upon. Approval to proceed is to be given by the National Capital and External Territories Committee on the proviso that heritage and environment assessments and realistic financial budgets have been reached and community consultation has been made. This approval is to be final and binding. The committee has fulfilled its task. Australia's history is a rich tapestry of interesting people and events. In my home town there are significant landmarks documenting Wagga Wagga's remarkable past. There is the Wagga Wagga beach monument to the intrepid explorer Charles Sturt, who visited the area on his trek of discovery in 1829. In Collins Park, a white concrete and marble obelisk, generally surrounded by colourful flowers, is dedicated to the memory of Saddler Joseph Palazzi, the first man of the 1st New South Wales Mounted Rifles regiment to be killed in action in the Boer War of 1899-1902. Thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast Barney Hyams approached me some time ago with the idea of erecting a suitable local monument to the memory of Arthur 'Scobie' Breasley, the Wagga Wagga boy who became the Queen's jockey and who won the 'blue riband of the turf', the Epsom Derby Stakes, twice-1964 and 1966. It is a suggestion which has merit. After this morning's extraordinary and historic events just after parliament began, you can be sure there will be no statues moulded to the memory of how the present Prime Minister will do anything and say anything to keep her job. splendid job in difficult and trying circumstances and that, given his sacrifice today, perhaps a bronze bust of him ought to be made and placed at the ALP's Sussex Street headquarters in MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Committees

We need a sound mechanism in place to ensure that national memorials are rigorously assessed for their commemorative intent, design and location before people commit money and resources to the final outcome.

Etched in stone? fulfils its objectives and I commend it to the House. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Fraser. I remind the member for Riverina that he can't leave! Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (12:19): National memorials are a crucial part of the nation's collective memory. They bind a nation together through one of the most powerful of unifying forces-shared history. The National Memorials Ordinance 1928 came about at a time when Canberra's population was under 10,000, and Lake Burley Griffin was just lines on a map. It was instigated by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce when parliament had just moved to Canberra and rapid development was underway in the new national capital. The recommendations arising from the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories into the administration of the National Memorials Ordinance 1928 reflect Canberra's transformed milieu and how Australia's management and use of national memorials can be improved. In seeking to improve the management of the capital's national memorials, the committee found it instructive to look at the case of Washington DC. Washington, like Canberra, is both a national capital and a planned city. Both are sites for the expression of the national aspirations of their people. Both are governed by a detailed planning regime that balances the legacies of the past with the needs of the present and the potential of the future. Part of the challenge is in choosing appropriate subjects for commemoration and choosing suitable designs and locations for new monuments and memorials. This process must balance the competing desires and interests of the different stakeholders. We on the committee found that one of the key strengths of the Washington model is that the planning stage involves broad constituencies. Washington's National Capital Planning Commission has 12 members, representing federal and local constituencies. Each member represents a different section of the community and brings different perspectives. No one entity dominates the process. As many Canberra residents made clear in their submissions to the inquiry, the need for local consultation and input in the development of national memorials is paramount.

Main Committee adjourned at 12:24 MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Securities Investments Commission: Managed Investment Schemes (Question No. 354) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 10 May 2011: In respect of investigations by the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) into (a) Trio Capital Ltd and its associated managed investment schemes, (b) Storm Financial Ltd, and (c) the Westpoint Group of companies, (i) when did investigations commence, (ii) what prompted the investigations, and (iii) what series of actions were taken by ASIC to prevent each entity from continuing to operate, or continuing to offer financial products. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As ASIC's investigations and proceedings into the affairs of Storm Financial Limited (Storm), Westpoint Group and Trio Capital Limited (Trio) are continuing ASIC is unable to provide a comprehensive response to all questions in detail. Trio ASIC formally commenced its investigation in relation to Trio on 2 October 2009 in respect of the Astarra Strategic Fund ('ASF'), of which Trio was the responsible entity. ASIC in taking regulatory action worked closely with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as Trio Capital was the trustee of a number of superannuation funds. On 14 October 2009 ASIC applied to the NSW Supreme Court for orders restricting overseas travel for two directors of the investment manager of the ASF. On 16 October 2009 ASIC placed interim stop orders on the Product Disclosure Statement for the ASF and on 21 October 2009 interim stop orders were placed on three associated Trio superannuation funds. This had the effect of stopping further investments being made into these funds. On 16 December 2009 Trio was placed into voluntary administration. The next day ASIC suspended its Australian financial services license which ensured it was no longer able to provide financial services On 16 December 2009 APRA suspended Trio as the trustee of four superannuation funds and one pooled superannuation trust. APRA also appointed an acting trustee to manage these five entities. On 16 April 2010 Justice Palmer in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, on the application of Trio's administrator, ordered the winding up of five managed investment schemes for which Trio was the responsible entity, including the ASF and ARP. Storm ASICâ€™s formal investigation commenced on 12 December 2008. In the months of October, November and December 2008 the stock market fell significantly resulting in a shortfall between the equity and margin loans for Storm clients. Around 18 December 2008, following the commencement of its investigation, ASIC sought to negotiate an enforceable undertaking (EU) with Storm. The purpose of the EU was to address ASICâ€™s concerns that Storm may have been providing conflicted and incorrect advice to Storm clients who were in negative equity that they did not need to meet their margin calls and should not deal with the banks. An EU was not ultimately executed. However, around 19 December 2008, Storm said it would cease contact with all its clients over the Christmas period. This action was not requested by ASIC and was a decision made by Storm. Storm subsequently went into administration on 9 January 2009. Westpoint From 2000 until early 2006, a number of investigations were conducted by ASIC in relation to the Westpoint Group of companies. On 10 May 2004, Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd commenced action against ASIC seeking a determination as to whether the promissory notes issued by it were regulated under the Corporations Act. On 12 May 2004, ASIC commenced proceedings against Emu Brewery Mezzanine Limited alleging that that company was carrying on an unregistered (but registrable) managed investment scheme. The two proceedings were heard together. In November 2004, the Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that the promissory notes issued by Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd and Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd were not debentures requiring a prospectus to be lodged with ASIC, but they were interests in a managed investment scheme. In June 2006, the Court of Appeal held that the promissory notes were interests in a managed investments scheme. In 2004 and 2005 ASIC issued a number of interim and final stop orders in relation to the fundraising activities of the Westpoint Group. In November and December 2005 ASIC issued applications in the Federal Court seeking to wind up York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and to appoint a provisional liquidator in the interim. ASIC also sought orders for lodgement of financial reports for a number of Westpoint Group entities. On 20 December 2005 the Federal Court ordered that Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd, be wound up. Orders were also made for the lodgement of financial accounts for a number of Westpoint Group entities. Australian Securities Investments Commission: Managed Investment Schemes (Question No. 355) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 10 May 2011: In respect of investigations by the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) into (a) Trio Capital Ltd and its associated managed investment schemes, (b) Storm Financial Ltd, and (c) the Westpoint Group of companies, (i) approximately what total sum of money was lost by investors in each fund/scheme, (ii) what series of actions were taken by ASIC against parties, including third parties, for loss recovery purposes, including compensating investors, (iii) what criteria were used by ASIC in taking such actions, particularly in determining whether the public interest was served, (iv) how were the facts of each case assessed against the criteria, (v) what weight was given to situations where investors had been placed into very risky investments, versus those where money was lost through fraud, and (vi) what was the outcome of the series of actions taken by ASIC. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: General overview of civil recovery proceedings by ASIC ASIC plans to publish a document by the end of this year that sets out factors that may be relevant in choosing particular enforcement remedies. One such remedy is to take action to recover damages or property on a personâ€™s behalf, including as part of other court actions we take. However, ASIC must form the view that it is in the public interest to commence such litigation.. In considering whether it is in the public interest to take civil recovery action on behalf of an aggrieved investor ASIC will take into account a range of considerations including the following: ï‚· A viable cause of action being identified (that is, establishing misconduct by the defendant that gives rise to the basis for a compensation action); ï‚· The availability of evidence to prove the cause of action; ï‚· The regulatory effect of bringing the action; ï‚· The extent of impact or quantum of loss arising from the misconduct; ï‚· The costs of bringing the action and the potential liability for costs if not successful; ï‚· The existence of other parties able to commence proceedings seeking compensation for aggrieved investors (such as an external administrator or the investors themselves); ï‚· The availability of funds to satisfy a judgement against a defendant to the proceedings; ï‚· The prospects of the action being successfully litigated by ASIC; ï‚· ASIC's regulatory priorities at the time; and ï‚· Availability of alternative forms of dispute resolution. Trio Capital Ltd Trio Capital Limited ('Trio') was the trustee of five superannuation entities, the responsible entity for twenty five managed investment schemes and trustee of three unregistered managed investment schemes. ASICâ€™s investigations have focused on: ï‚· the conduct of the directors and officers of Trio, the investment managers of the Astarra Strategic Fund ('ASF') and ARP Growth Fund ('ARP'), managed investments schemes of which Trio was the responsible entity; ï‚· The conduct of the officers and directors of the investments managers of ASF and ARP respectively; ï‚· ASIC is also looking at the conduct of a number of financial advisers who advised their clients to invest in ASF These investigations are continuing. When Trio was placed into administration the reported value of the ASF was around $125 million. These figures include the capitalisation of questionable returns reported by Trio for a number of years. The reported value of ARP was around $58 million. Both these funds are in the process of being wound up. To date the liquidator of Trio has been unable to realise any value from most of the investments made by the ASF and ARP. ASIC has not commenced any actions against any third parties for loss recovery purposes. As ASIC's former Chairman indicated to the Joint Standing Committee for Corporations and Financial Services on 24 November 2010, ASIC is unlikely to commence such an action in relation to ARP. Approximately 5000 investors who invested in APRA regulated superannuation funds with an exposure to the ASF will be compensated through the Part 23 SIS Act compensation decision announced by the Assistant Treasurer on 13 April 2011. The amount of the compensation is in the order of $55 million. Storm ASIC commenced its investigation into the collapse of Storm on 12 December 2008. On 19 March 2010, ASIC announced that it would enter into confidential discussions with the individuals and entities which had been the subject of its investigations, to see if a commercial resolution could be reached which would be acceptable to ASIC and which ASIC would be prepared to recommend to investors. Those negotiations proved to be unsuccessful. In December 2010, in addition to civil penalty proceedings against Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis, ASIC commenced 2 compensation proceedings. The first proceedings seek compensation and claim damages on behalf of 2 investors, Barry and Deanna Doyle, and are against Bank of Queensland Limited (BoQ), Senrac Pty Limited, the franchisee of BoQâ€™s North Ward branch, and Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL). ASIC alleges in these proceedings that the banks acted unconscionably in lending to the Doyles, breached the Banking Code of Practice and were linked to credit providers with Storm under s73 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (re-enacted as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) and are jointly and severally liable for any loss suffered by the Doyles as a result of any breach by Storm in relation to the services they supplied. The second proceedings, against Storm, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BoQ and MBL, seek declarations that Storm operated an unregistered managed investment scheme and that the banks were knowingly involved in the operation of that scheme, as well as injunctions. A successful outcome in these proceedings lays a foundation for subsequent claims for compensation against the banks on behalf of those who have suffered loss. ASICâ€™s proceedings above are ongoing. Westpoint When the Westpoint Group collapsed in early 2006, investors in Westpoint-issued financial products had an outstanding total capital invested of approximately $388 million. The estimated losses to investors totalled approximately $310 million. In 2007 and 2008 a number of compensation actions were commenced by ASIC under section 50 of the ASIC Act. The actions were in four categories: (a) a claim brought against KPMG, the former auditors of the Westpoint Group, (b) a claim brought against the directors of certain companies in the Westpoint Group, (c) representative proceedings on behalf of investors against financial planners who recommended investments in Westpoint Group financial products (seven separate actions) and (d) representative proceedings on behalf of investors against State Trustees Limited, the trustee of mezzanine finance notes issued by one of the mezzanine finance companies in the Westpoint Group. ASIC's actions against State Trustees Limited and a number of financial planners produced settlements in excess of $25.5 million. On1 February 2011 ASIC settled the actions against KPMG and the Westpoint directors. The settlement of the proceedings against KPMG and the Westpoint directors means the total amount recovered as a result of ASIC's compensation litigation will be up to $92.95 million. Another $49.2 million obtained through the liquidation process has also been distributed, a figure that is expected to reach $56 million. Returns from Westpoint companies not in liquidation are expected to reach $22.5 million. In all, investors are expected to see a return of around $160 to $170 million of the $388 million in losses. ASIC's class action against two financial planners and a cross-claim brought by a former Westpoint director against ASIC remain on foot. In addition to its compensation actions, ASIC has banned 23 licensed advisers, four unlicensed advisers and one corporate entity in relation to advice concerning Westpoint-related products for periods between 3 years and permanently. ASIC has also accepted enforceable undertakings from three KPMG partners preventing them from practising as auditors for periods between nine months and two years. A number of criminal convictions have also been secured and criminal proceedings against former Westpoint directors and officers are ongoing. Australian Securities Investments Commission: Managed Investment Schemes (Question No. 356) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 10 May 2011: In respect of the investigations by the Australian Securities Investments Commission into Trio Capital Ltd and its associated managed investment schemes, what actions are being, or have been, taken to pursue international enforcement, for example, via intergovernmental treaties, liaison with the regulatory agencies, extradition arrangements, etc. Mr Shorten The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ASIC has been liaising on a confidential basis where necessary with overseas regulators and is able to make use of the IOSCO Multi-lateral Memorandum of Understanding to assist this process. Australian Securities and Investments Commission: Australian Property Custodian Holding Ltd (Question No. 374) Mr Christensen asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 23 May 2011: (1) What is the status of the investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) into allegations of impropriety surrounding Australian Property Custodian Holding Limited (APCH) and its management of the Prime Retirement and Aged Care Property Trust (PRACPT). (2) Can he provide the findings (to date) of the investigation. (3) By when will the investigation conclude, and the outcome be made public. (4) What assurance can he provide that (a) this matter will be treated seriously and investigated thoroughly by ASIC, irrespective of whether or not PRACPT is still a solvent entity, (b) individuals associated with APCH will be penalised and/or prosecuted to the full extent of the law if ASIC determines its actions in managing PRACPT were criminal and/or negligent, and (c) funds will be tracked down and seized to repay PRACPT if it is determined by ASIC that illegal transactions were made on its behalf by APCH. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) ASIC is continuing to look into the affairs of APCH as responsible entity of the PRACPT and has taken steps to obtain further information in relation to these matters, including the operation and current circumstances of the PRACPT. ASIC is liaising with the administrators of APCH and is considering what further action is required. (2) As there is an ongoing investigation being conducted, ASIC is unable to comment at this stage in relation to any findings of the investigation to date in relation to the collapse of APCH and PRACPT. (3) ASIC is taking all appropriate steps to make sure its investigation is carried out as thoroughly and efficiently as possible. ASIC is not in a position at this time to comment on the possible outcomes or actions that may result from its investigation or when these will be made public. (4) ASIC recognises the seriousness of the allegations raised in this matter and is treating them seriously and is undertaking a thorough and timely investigation. Where ASIC determines, based on admissible evidence that individuals associated with APCH, have breached the law, it will ensure appropriate action is taken. Clean Energy Future Plan (Question No. 502) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, on 17 August 2011: Was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report the sole factor in the decision to introduce the Clean Energy Plan; if so, (a) which part; (b) what peer reviews support the evidence in the report (including citations and authors); and (c) what dissenting reports are annexed to the report (including citations and authors); if not, will he provide a list of references for the scientific evidence on which his decision to introduce the Clean Energy Plan was based, including any peer reviews and dissenting reports (with citations and authors). Mr Combet: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government draws on a range of reliable, peer reviewed research in developing climate change policies such as the Clean Energy Future Plan. Reliable information sources include the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, Academies of Science around the world, the World Meteorological Organization and other peer reviewed literature. The role of the IPCC is to advise policy makers about the current state of knowledge and provide reliable information pertaining to climate change. The IPCC does not conduct scientific research itself, but instead reviews the thousands of scientific papers on climate change published in the peer reviewed literature every year. The state of knowledge on climate change is summarised in the IPCC's assessment reports, published approximately every six to seven years. The reports are subject to an intense peer review process involving hundreds of scientific experts and government reviewers. This unprecedented level of peer and government review makes this compendium of climate change science one of the most scrutinised documents in the history of science. The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 is a key information source for the Government in developing climate change policies. Twenty-four Australian authors contributed to all three Working Group reports of the Fourth Assessment Report. (Working Group 1: The Physical Science Basis; Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change). Chapter 11 of the Fourth Assessment Report highlights many of the potential impacts from climate change in the Australian and New Zealand region. Currently, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report is being written and is due for publication in 2013-14. The Government also draws on the body of peer reviewed work that has been completed since the Fourth Assessment Report was published. Key reports include The Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009: Updating the World on the Latest Climate Science; Climate Change: a Summary of the Science published by the UK Royal Society in 2010; Advancing the Science of Climate Change published by the US National Academies of Science; and The Critical Decade: Climate Science, Risks and Responses published by the Climate Commission in 2011. Clean Energy Future Plan (Question No. 504) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, on 17 August 2011: In respect of a statement he made that the Clean Energy Plan is needed to 'save the Great Barrier Reef', was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report the sole factor in his decision to introduce the Clean Energy Plan to save the Great Barrier Reef; if so, (a) which part; (b) what peer reviews support the evidence in the report (including citations and authors); and (c) what dissenting reports are annexed to the report (including citations and authors); if not, will he provide a list of references for the scientific evidence on which his decision to introduce the Clean Energy Plan to save the Great Barrier Reef was based, including any peer reviews and dissenting reports (with citations and authors).

Other sources of information, particularly on the Great Barrier Reef, include research conducted through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and the Global Change Institute, University of Queensland. Immigration and Citizenship: Outcome and Program Structure (Question No. 550) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 23 August 2011: (1) In respect of his department's outcome and program structure in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12, how many programs exist(ed) under each outcome of his department. (2) In the same period, what (a) sum was/is allocated to, (b) number of staff were/are in, and (c) regulations relate(d) to, each program in part (1). (3) In the same period, for each outcome and program, what sum was/is allocated to (a) advertising, (b) travel (including the breakdown of domestic and international business and economy classes), (c) hospitality and entertainment, (d) information and communication technology, (e) contractors and consultants, (f) education and training of staff, (g) external (i) accounting, (ii) auditing, and (iii) legal, services, and (h) membership grants paid to affiliate organisations. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department's outcome and program structure for 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12, as reported in the Portfolio Budget Statements for the Immigration and Citizenship Portfolio, has not changed across the financial years and is as follows: Outcome1 â€“ 1 program Outcome2 â€“ 1 program Outcome3 â€“ 1 program Outcome4 â€“ 4 programs Outcome5 â€“ 1 program Outcome6 â€“ 1 program For further information on the Department's outcome and program structure, please refer to the Immigration and Citizenship Portfolio's 2011-12 Portfolio Budget Statements. (2) (a) and (b) The 2009-10 and 2010-11 expenses are the actual departmental expenses incurred and are reported in the Department's annual financial statements. The 2009-10 and 2010-11 average staffing levels are the actual staffing levels for those years. Both the expenses and average staffing levels are published in the Department's annual report. For 2011-12, the estimated expenses and average staffing levels are as reported in the Immigration and Citizenship Portfolio's 2011-12 Portfolio Budget Statements. 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 Actual Actual Budget Actual Actual Budget Expense Expense Expense Average Average Average Staffing Staffing Staffing $'000 $'000 $'000 Level Level Level Program 1.1: Visa and 540,096 551,309 539,823 3,760 3,698 3,685 Migration Program 2.1: Refugee and 82,309 68,453 72,224 474 481 432 Humanitarian Assistance Program 3.1: Border 182,576 153,741 150,485 827 779 758 Management Program 4.1: Visa Compliance 131,124 143,958 117,101 876 999 1,198 and Status Resolution Program 4.2: Onshore 36,119 29,403 26,267 140 140 168 Detention Network Program 4.3: Offshore 81,310 202,908 233,253 257 888 1,065 Asylum Seeker Management Program 4.4: Foreign Fishers 5,416 2,147 2,744 18 11 14 Program 5.1: Settlement 102,390 71,763 106,092 440 399 400 Services for Migrants and Refugees Program 6.1: Multicultural 80,977 71,387 78,039 549 489 472 and Citizenship Services Total 1,242,318 1,295,069 1,326,028 7,341 7,884 8,191 2009-10 AdvertTravel Travel Hospitality Information ContracEducaAuditLegal Memberising DomInternaand and tors and tion ing ship estic tional EntertainCommuniConsuland Grants to ment cation tants TrainAffiliate Technology ing of OrganisaStaff tions $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Program 1.1: Visa and Migration 221 4,238 4,376 67 61,773 49,841 2,514 753 6,342 0 Program 2.1: Refugee and Humanitarian Assistance 99 577 746 14 8,006 4,817 344 167 7,179 0 Program 3.1: Border Management 47 1,486 1,769 21 24,726 19,298 942 191 1,721 0 Program 4.1: Visa Compliance and Status Resolution 40 4,204 973 11 10,480 8,037 1,488 152 1,822 0 Program 4.2: Onshore Detention Network7 844 35 9 1,495 5,994 332 154 681 0 Program 4.3: Offshore Asylum Seeker Management 10 8,873 1,164 28 5,415 3,015 283 99 186 0 Program 4.4: Foreign Fishers1 153 (14) 1 136 193 45 79 24 0 Program 5.1: Settlement Services for Migrants and 125 679 250 7 15,021 26,652 468 594 1,132 0 Refugees Program 6.1: Multicultural and Citizenship Services 984 768 234 7 9,510 5,996 401 212 771 0 Total 1,534 21,821 9,532 165 136,561 123,842 6,817 2,400 19,858 0 2010-11 AdvertTravel Travel Hospitality Information ContracEducaAuditLegal Memberising DomInternaand and tors and tion ing ship estic tional EntertainCommuniConsuland Grants to ment cation tants TrainAffiliate Technology ing of OrganisaStaff tions $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Program 1.1: Visa and Migration 512 4,093 4,835 43 62,632 62,619 3,203 307 10,428 0 Program 2.1: Refugee and Humanitarian Assistance 107 523 933 7 7,406 3,508 282 38 1,277 0 Program 3.1: Border Management 100 1,277 2,871 19 12,595 23,459 420 63 2,090 0 Program 4.1: Visa Compliance and Status Resolution 153 2,894 3,091 11 13,461 6,126 862 121 1,405 0 Program 4.2: Onshore Detention Network4 740 87 (1) 4,052 4,329 187 381 611 0 Program 4.3: Offshore Asylum Seeker Management 102 18,239 3,035 28 13,400 38,713 1,146 427 989 0 Program 4.4: Foreign Fishers0 58 6 0 267 200 11 2 4 0 Program 5.1: Settlement Services for Migrants and 210 498 181 3 8,829 14,596 269 (13) 1,676 0 Refugees Program 6.1: Multicultural and Citizenship Services 724 790 297 6 8,426 3,343 192 45 1,494 0 Total 1,912 29,113 15,333 115 131,067 156,895 6,571 1,370 19,974 0 In reviewing the financial information provided in the above tables in response to question 3 (a) to (h), the following notes need to be considered: ï‚· The negative expense amounts reported against some programs are due to minor prior year accounting adjustments. Depending on the nature of the adjustment and if the adjustment crosses two financial years, this can result in a negative balance against an expense account; ï‚· The expenses reported in relation to travel include airfares, accommodation and allowances. The airfares were not able to be disaggregated into economy and business class. According to the DIAC travel policy, most international travel is business class and most domestic travel is economy class; ï‚· No accounting services were able to be specifically identified through the Departmentâ€™s general ledger accounts and the Department is reporting auditing and legal services expenses only; and ï‚· No membership grants to affiliate organisations were identified from departmental funding. DIAC does make a small number of contributions to organisations such as the International Organisation for Migration through Administered funding. For 2011-12, the internal budget is not allocated at the disaggregated level sought and therefore estimates cannot be provided. Dawson and Capricornia Electorates: Home Insulation Program (Question No. 585) Mr Christensen asked the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, on 12 September 2011: How many (a) complaints from the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia were lodged regarding work carried out under the Home Insulation Program, by (i) postcode, and (ii) nature of complaint, and (b) follow-up inspections were carried out on homes that were the subject of these complaints, by postcode. Mr Combet: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that 106 instances of contact have been received by the Department in a category including general inquiries, tip-offs for possible fraud, and requests for advice on program guidelines from the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia in regard to work carried out under the Home Insulation Program as at 30 September 2011. These contacts relate to 97 dwellings. These figures are within the context of 17,128 installs of insulation in the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia under the Home Insulation Program. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that more specific information may have the potential to unjustly and adversely affect businesses in the local area, even if it is not business specific. As a result, it is not appropriate to release such information. The Government offers inspections to all homes with foil installed under the HIP and provides householders with the option of having the insulation removed or on the advice of a Licensed Electrical Contractor, a safety switch installed. The Government will continue to offer inspections to any householder that had insulation installed under the HIP and who has not previously had one, until 30 June 2012. The Government has also committed to work with police and other relevant authorities in all jurisdictions to deal with cases of non-compliance and fraud in relation to the Home Insulation Program. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations: Staffing (Question No. 606) Ms Ley asked the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, in writing, on 15 September 2011: How many (a) staff are currently working (i) as contract managers in the Job Services Australia program, (ii) as contract managers in the Disability Employment Services program, and (iii) in each state office, (b) regional offices exist within her department, and (c) departmental employees are working in regional offices. Ms Kate Ellis: The answer to the honourable memberâ€™s question is as follows: (a) As of 16 September 2011: (i) there were 184 full-time equivalent State-based staff managing the Job Services Australia program; (ii) there were 108 full-time equivalent State-based staff managing the Disability Employment Services program; (iii) there were 934 staff working in DEEWRâ€™s State Network. 716 of these worked in DEEWRâ€™s State Offices, and the remaining 218 worked in regional locations; State Office Staff as of 16 September 2011 Sydney 147 Darwin 60 Brisbane 133 Adelaide 107 Hobart 50 Melbourne 123 Perth 96 Total 716 (b) As of 16 September 2011, DEEWR had a presence in 41 regional locations, i.e. excluding National Office and the State offices listed above. (c) As of 16 September 2011, 218 DEEWR staff worked in regional locations, i.e. excluding National Office and the State offices listed above. Home Insulation Program (Question No. 614) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, 20 September 2011: In respect of the Home Insulation Program (HIP) and the programs that were established following the closure of the HIP (such as the Home Insulation Safety Program and the Industry Assistance Package), (a) how many claims has he received in respect of these programs under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (b) at what stage is consideration of each claim at, and (c) when does he expect to be making final decisions on these claims. Mr Combet: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Thirty-two claims under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA Scheme) have been received. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is currently engaging with the claimants and considering the claims. It is the Departmentâ€™s practice to undertake a preliminary assessment of each claim and request further information from the claimant as necessary. The Department will consider any further information which is provided and will give the claimant the opportunity to comment on all relevant material proposed to be put before the decision maker. Claims will not be finally decided before all relevant information, including any further information and comments provided by the claimant, has been considered. No claims have yet been finally decided. Due to the complexity of the claims and the level of consultation with claimants, it is not possible to advise of a timeframe as to when the claims will be finally decided. Dawson and Capricornia Electorates: Tax Revenue Streams (Question No. 639) Mr Christensen asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In the electoral division of (a) Dawson, and (b) Capricornia, what sum was collected per tax revenue stream for (i) 2010-11, (ii) 2009-10, (iii) 2008-07, and (iv) 2007-08. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The data necessary to answer this question in full is not available. With regard to individual taxpayers, complete data for the 2009-10 year is not yet available and data for the 2010-11 year will not be complete until late in 2012. With regard to other heads of revenue, comprehensive data is not available at the postcode level, mainly because Australian Taxation Office (ATO) data shows addresses of taxpayers' agents or accountants rather than taxpayers themselves. However, the following information is produced by the Parliamentary Library from postcode data published by the ATO in Taxation Statistics. Taxation Statistics by Commonwealth Electoral Division (2009 electoral boundaries), 2008-09 Non-taxable Taxable Taxable Net tax individuals individuals income no. no. $ million $ million Capricornia (QLD) 18 300 62 567 3 722 822 Dawson (QLD) 20 741 70 469 4 040 867 Taxation Statistics by Commonwealth Electoral Division (2009 electoral boundaries), 2007-08 Non-taxable Taxable Taxable Net tax individuals individuals income no. no. $ million $ million Capricornia (QLD) 16 985 65 356 3 585 817 Dawson (QLD) 18 649 73 984 3 897 860 Natural Disaster Insurance Review Report (Question No. 708) Mr Christensen asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 2 November 2011: When will the Natural Disaster Insurance Review report be made public, and can he indicate what recommendations the review has made in respect of body corporate insurance. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Natural Disaster Insurance Review report was released to the public on 14 November 2011. The report is available at: http://www.ndir.gov.au/content/report/downloads/NDIR_final.pdf The Governmentâ€™s response to the recommendations of the report is available at: http://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=2226&NavID=037.",154,Committees
