He now tells us that he will not interrupt the -debate on the Budget and Tariff.

IRVINE I have observed in this morning's Age a statement purporting to have emanated from the Acting Prime Minister, in which it is said that certain remarks with regard to increments made by me in my recent speech on the. Budget were most misleading and improper. The facts of the case are these: Some days before I delivered my speech, I asked the Secretary to the Treasury to be good enough to give me figures showing the sum total of the increments provided for since the passing of the Public Service Act,"" not because of the promotion of officers, or for extra work, but merely as increases to salaries. On the morning'.of the day on which I spoke, I received a note from him, saying that the figures had'been prepared, and were ready the day before, but that the Treasurer required him not to deliver them to me until he had had an opportunity to go through them himself.

29,Mr Speaker,"In reply to the honThe point which I raised was, that the whole question to which the honourable member for Flinders referred was still under discussion in Committee of Ways and Means, in connection with the Budget and the Tariff. discussion had not concluded, and that the Committee had not reported to the House. Therefore, as soon as the honourable member for Flinders proceeded from a matter of personal explanation to that matter I thought it my duty to call his attention to it. It would be very unfair for me to allow matter relating to a debate which was current to be brought forward in the form of a personal explanation, because to do so would preclude a reply being made to it by any other honourable member. If I permitted that I should be invading the rights of every other honourable member. ber would be entitled to make a personal explanation, I presume, in respect of any debate ? anv circumstances. to make a personal explanation in reference"" to an observation which was made in Committee of Ways and Means last evening by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and which is reported in the Argus of to-day. According to the report of that journal the honourable member made the following statement :Sir John Forrest, when he said he was in tion in 1910 by substituting for it the favour of old-age pensions, and at the same acquisition of the power to impose special time in favour of the continuance of the duties for special purposes, solely with the Braddon clause, took up the attitude of a. object of initiating a scheme of old-age hypocrite. . I consider that the observation of the honvernment to have undertaken that taskorable member as applied to me is an offenin other words, anticipating what they sive one, and I desire to say that it contains would be able to do at the end of 1910. an absolute mis-statement. It is an unjustifiable statement, because it is not based upon fact. vide for the payment of old-age pensions if the Braddon section be continued? orable member be good enough not to interthe Acting Prime Minister serves to show rupt me? I merely desire to make an exhow strictly the Standing Orders relating planation-and consequently I want to be to personal explanations must be adminisvery concise in my remarks. I have never tered. The speech of the right honourable taken up the position that the sum of member for Swan trenched very much £1,500,000, which is the amount said to indeed upon the subject-matter of the be necessary to provide for a Federal sysdebate which is now proceeding in Comtem of old-age pensions, can' be obtained mittee of Ways and Means, and, as I have from the ordinary revenue of the Commonwealth whilst the Braddon section of the Constitution continues in operation. I . have said the opposite on many occasions, both verbally and in writing. In my I pointed out that that Budget speech, which was placed before the House on 31st July last year, the recommendations of the present Government were submitted to honourable members. My proposal-whic h is also the proposal of the Deakin Government-is that at the termination of the year 1910 the Braddon section shall be discontinued, and that, subject to the approval of Parliament, there shall be substituted for it the system which was agreed to by both the Commonwealth and the States Governments at the Brisbane Conference of Premiers. That system provides for the Commonwealth retaining one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, as well as the right to impose special duties for special purposes, such as defence, old-age pensions, immigration, &c. I wish further to say-as showing that the statement of the .honourable member for Kalgoorlie is absolutely unjustifiable and inaccurate-that what is proposed in the recommendations of the Government-for which I hold myself fully responsible-is exactly in accord with what was proposed by the Prime Minister last session in a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, which commanded the support of a large majority of the Labour Party, and which passed this House. Its object was to anticipate the discontinuance of the Braddon secpensions sooner than it would otherwise have been possible for the Deakin Gowhether the right honourable member for Swan has made a personal explanation or statement.",17,Personal Explanations Public Service Increments Suppl Y Of Information To Members Brad

If it contains any error, we ought to know of it at once. aware that the statement contains any error. The schedule was prepared by the Customs officers, and was gone through very carefully. It is possible, however, that some mistake may have crept into it. I was not present in the Chamber last evening, when the honourable member for Perth made the statement to which the honourable member for South Sydney has referred, but I have given instructions that the schedule shall be well-in view of the allegations which have been made from time to time to have tbe recommendations of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission incorporated in a separate document, so that every honourable member may be able to see clearly the nature of those recommendations.

Sir word. the little discussion which we have just had has created a proper atmosphere for the I called upon the consideration of the Budget and the Tariff, subjects which usually provoke some little hostility. The honourable member for Flinders is quite correct in saying that he asked me whether I would allow him to make an explanation. To that request I replied that I should be only too pleased to do so, but for the fact that honourable members, who had intended to follow me, would consider that I had completed my speech, and take Chairman. Last evening I dealt with one paragraph of the Budget, and availed myself of the opportunity to "" stick up for a p a l .

Now, I am not anxious to have that experience ; and I only desire to say that I have as great an admiration for the honourable member for West Sydney, whom I have known for a great many yearsindeed, I doubt whether any two members we are-as the honourable member last night expressed for the representative of East Sydney. The only difference is that apparently the honourable member's admiration of the honourable member for East Sydney is merely of a political character; he would seem to have some reason for personal dislike. No man who has been as long as the honourable and has made so many speeches on so great a varietyof topics, can avoid a little selfcontradiction sometimes; but it must be remembered that there are some honourable members who cannot even make one speech without contradicting themselves. The honThe right honourable member orable member for East Sydney considered it absurd that free-traders and protectionists who held anti-Socialist opinions, should be separated while there was an army, called the Labour Party, thoroughly united, though the units of it might hold diverse views on the fiscal question. In the Labour Party may be found the most ardent free-traders and protectionists, but for campaign purposes they manage to sink the fiscal issue. The position of the honourable member for East Sydney was that there had been a JOHN FORREST I did not say a .good fight over the Tariff, and Australia . had proved more protective than it was = -I think free-trade.

If I were a member of that party, whether Commonwealth or State, I should receive a backing irrespective of my views on the fiscal question ; but we know that is not the case with other parties.

A member of the Labour Party, when he meets his brother in West Australia or Queensland, immediately understands him-n o explanation is required. Their policy is threshed out for them; the Labour members in this Parliament are here practically as delegates representing a programme and platform prepared for them by the electors of the Commonwealth. The position of other parties is entirely different; and the honourable member for East Sydney-unwisely , as I think, and as I ' have told him personally-electe d to fight on the wrong issue.

Honourable members in the corner say "" Hear, hear "" to that, but I think it would only have been right on their part if, after the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney, who was the able mouthpiece of the Labour Party for the time being, they had arisen in defence of the honourable member for East Sydney. As I said last night, I certainly expected that the honourable member for Flinders would have defended a gentleman who, for the time being, is the leader of the party to which he belongs. for Flinders is not game to do that in Victoria; there is not one man to take command of the free-trade flag. for East Sydney can keep his own end up. own end up if the other fellow is jumping on the other end. The honourable member for East Sydney undertook a big task when he fought the Labour Party; and it is not for his friends to turn on him simply because they may differ from him in reference to his methods. But the honourable member for Flinders,, and others with him, when fighting the election under the anti-Socialist flag, had not a kind word' to say for the man who was leading the forces. had to say were for the Prime Minister. orable member for Maribyrnong, that those honourable members were afraid of the press of Victoria, which had dragooned them into the position that if they were protecspects my views on political questions differ tionists, and also supporters of the honourable member for East Sydney, they had to keep the latter fact dark. The honourable member for Flinders has committed himself strongly enough to protection; and doubtless he will not remain, what the Melbourne Age calls him this morning, a "" gosling "" of protection, but will in a few years be a fully fledged protectionist goose. When the honourable member does proclaim himself a protectionist, then good-bye to the Age support of the Acting Prime Minister or the present Ministry. If ' the Prime never existed.

98,Mr Wilks,"Personally , they are uncould have anything but admiration for the ability which has characterized it. Those who have read the report of the Navigation Conference must recognise that he displayed a wide knowledge of the subject with which the Conference had to deal, and that he proved the equal of any delegate. I am not prepared, however, to say that I agree with everything he said and did as a member of that Conference, nor am I prepared to pass unnoticed the attacks made by him on my party. The attitude taken up by him when he declares that he is the only free-trader in tlie House is in keeping with that usually adopted by the Labour Party at a general election. They are always prepared to take the whole credit for any reform, and to forget those who assisted them in bringing it about. That being so, I do not intend to allow them to escape discredit when it should rightly fall upon them. In the opinion of some honourable members of the Labour Party, the great offence committed by the leader of the Opposition is that he declared in Bast Sydney that the passing of the Tariff would be the work of the Labour Party. I hold a, similar view. If they do not assist the Opposition in securing drastic alterations, they will have to accept the responsibility for it, for without their assistance we shall be unable to prevent the passing of the Tariff as introduced. The leader of the Labour Party has indicated that he is not prepared to agree to some of the proposals of the Government, and since the honourable member for West Sydney has made a similar announcement, I am hopeful that -some of the iniquities of the Tariff will disappear. There are free-traders on this side of the House who will do their best to secure their removal. I propose now to refer briefly to the Budget statement. As a rule, in connection with such a statement, a mass of figures is hurled at us, and lengthy tables are presented which sound well, and look well, but are very often mere matters of accountancy. No one can say that the Budget statement delivered by the present Treasurer was a poem. somewhat disconnected, and it must be recognised that the honourable gentleman was heard at a disadvantage, since, owing to the retirement of the right honourable member for Swan from the Ministry, he was suddenly ""bumped"" into the office of Treasurer, and was compelled, at very short notice, to put the Financial Statement before us. We had from him no very elaborate explanation of the figures, but I hope that they will be elucidated as the debate proceeds. It cannot be said that the Treasurer's utterance was a pessimistic one. He certainly showed that we were enjoying a period of prosperity. In 1900 -the year immediately preceding the establishment of Federation-ou r imports were valued at £41,400,000, but our imports last year were. of the value of £44,729,000, an increase of £3.329,000. This increase cannot be explained by the assertion that our population since 1900 has largely increased. As. a matter of fact, it has been almost stationary. I take it that it is to be accounted for, very largely, by the fact that we have recently enjoyed good seasons. Our exports have expanded-to an even greater extent. In 1900 they were valued at £45,000,000, while in 1906-7 they were of the value of £69,737,763. In six years, therefore, the value .of our exports hasincreased to the marvellous extent of over £24,000,000. The balance of trade is against us, but I think this may be explained by the fact that we have enjoyed good seasons, that we have secured enhanced prices for our products, and that large sums have been paid away in respect of some of the States loans. In Bulletin No. 6-the latest issued by the Commonwealth Statistician-it is shown that our exports of butter for the first six months of the present year totalled 37>35 >7 fbsas against an export of 2 12 31,867,537 lbs. for the corresponding part of 1906, and that our exports of wheat during the first six months of 1907 aggregated 13,266,281 centals, whilst for the corresponding period of 1966 they totalled 14,226,852 centals. Although there was a shortage in our exports of wheat, there was an enormous increase in our exports of flour and wool. The quantity of greasy wool exported for the first six months of 1907 was 182,462,223 lbs., as against 110.999,573 lbs. exported during the first six months of iqo6; whilst our exports of scoured wool during the first six months of this year totalled 36,815,714 It was lbs., as against 32,270,247 lbs. exported during the corresponding period of 1906. The Treasurer estimates an enormous increase in our Customs and Excise revenue during the present year. A very large proportion of that increase will be derived from the new duties on goods coming largely from the United Kingdom. In the case of woollen piece goods, he will receive about .£300,000 as the result of the increased duty, £150,000 from the new duties on galvanized iron, and £125,000 from the impost on wire-netting. These increased returns will come from the enormous duties levied upon products of the United Kingdom, and the tax on wire netting will press on the producers of Australia. It is estimated that the'duty on kerosene will yield £190,000, but"" since the leader of the Labour Party has pronounced against that impost, I am satisfied it will not be permitted to stand. If there be anything in the theory of protection our revenue ' should seriously decrease, for the new duties we are told will cause the output of our factories to largely increase. which has been given to the question both by this Parliament and by various Conferences of States Premiers a scheme which will be acceptable to the Commonwealth and the States alike, as a substitute for the Braddon section has not yet been devised. At the inception of the Federation, the Braddon section was feared by the people; it is now regarded as the safeguard of the States. how 'a free-trader can support it. We 'nave now a' margin of omly about £100,000 per annum to provide for many new services. The Government tell us that they are in favour of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and that they propose to grant a bounty on the production of iron. I trust that if an iron bounty be granted, a bounty to encourage shipbuilding will also be passed as its natural corolbecause it regards the subsidy payable lary. If it be found that the retention of one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue is not sufficient to provide for the wants of the Commonwealth, I would suggest that we should retain the existing machinery, but should reduce the amount returned under it to the States. It is not suggested that the retention of the Braddon section is necessary to insure the solvency of the States; it is simply urged that the States Treasurers need a system which will afford something like a satisfactory basis for their estimates of revenue. I suggest, therefore, that if it be found that the return of threeI do not therefore say that everything he fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States deprives us of what is necessary for the services of the Commonwealth, we should return only, two-thirds to the States. an experimental provision, and I think that we ought not to wait until 1910-the date when it expires-befor e devising a. scheme to take its place. States debts will be a substitute for the present arrangement.' difficulty in arriving at a settlement of that question. I repeat that we might well continue to use the machinery that has proved so satisfactory, but that we should, if necessary, reduce the amount paid under it to the States. That system might well be observed until the States have greater conNotwithstanding the attention fidence in the CommonwealTh. Whilst we rejoice that the outlook is so satisfactory, I think it is well for us to remember that we must expect lean as well as fat years. No one can say that I am a croaker when I suggest that we should provide against bad times. To remind the public that we must expect bad times in the future is not to take up the attitude of the croaker, or to cry ""stinking fish."" Governments, like private individuals, are do not understand only too ready to live up to their incomes, and in boom times expend freely. But, as with private individuals, their expenditure should not exceed their incomes. The Treasurer has placed on the Estimates £200,000 to meet the annual contribution under the Naval Agreement Some months ago the Prime Minister, when in London, represented to the British authorities that the Commonwealth desires to terminate this agreement, under it as a tax upon its -resources, and thinks that the money could be better spent in other directions. The British authorities replied that, if Australia finds the subsidy a burden, they will not object to the termination of the agreement. The honourable gentleman, however, did not correctly voice Australian public opinion on the subject. He received a very good reception on his return to this country, and I , for one, was pleased that he did, because he showed himself while in London to be a very able man. I differ from him in regard to many .matters of policy, but doe's is wrong. I acknowledge freely that his general bearing in England was such that he acquitted himself well in. the eyes of the leading statesmen of the Empire, , . and so long as Australia can send men like him to these Conferences, she will",22,Chapman Whe N The Member For East Sydney Before The Public

104,Mr Wilks,"There seems to be greatbenefit by doing so. No doubt the honourable gentleman's present illness is due to the nervous tension \Yhich he endured while representing the Commonwealth in London. He crammed into three weeks work which an ordinary man would think sufficient for a couple of years. I have been told that he addressed 130 meetings in England. The leader of the Opposition could have, addressed 230, and would have been all the better and fatter for the effort. From my point of view, he would have been even a better representative of the Commonwealth than was the Prime Minister, though I have no complaint to make about the latter in respect to the way in which he acquitted himself in England. Unfortunately, he is a man of a highly-strung, nervous temperament, and'he is now suffering from overwork. He tried to excel himself on each occasion, and the strain was too much. But, returning to the Naval Agreement, it is now evident that he misrepresented public opinion in regard to it. Ministers have since felt the public pulse, and tacitly acpossible. The work done by the Prime Minknowledge that that is so. Notwithstanding his limitations, no one reads the poliand I trust that a High Commissioner tical barometer more closely than does the Acting Prime Minister, and the fact that as Treasurer he has placed on the Estimates £200,000 to meet this year's contribution, and has refrained from expressing his personal views in regard to the Naval Agreement, show that he thinks that the public are not opposed to its renewal. It will not be long probably before we extract from him the statement that he does not believe in the termination of the agreeThe governor may have been taking risks. ment; and that he would be willing to increase the subsidy, if that were thought necessary. The Government is also providing £32,000 For the establishment of a small-arms factory. I think it very necessary that wealth difficulty by manufacturing the small arms that it requires for its defence, and I supdiscovered that it is a measure drafted pose that eventually we shall manufacture ammunition too. The sum of £282,000 is set down to, I presume, carry out the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee in regard to the defence of this country. With regard to the establishment of a Commonwealth office in London, the Treasurer has told us that he is negotiating for the acquirement of a site there. The sooner. some definite arrangement is made, the better. . The honourable gentleman should employ the keenest business acumen in his negotiations, because Australia must have a position in a front street, and must make herself as well known to the British public as Canada has done in the past. The Dominion does not play with this matter, but spends £500,000 a year in advertising her resources. The investment .is a good one, returning twenty times as much every year in the steady influx of immigrants from the United Kingdom, and the demand for Canadian produce which it creates. For Australia to spend £20,000 in advertising is absurd. Sometimes no return is obtainable from an expenditure of ,£10,000, whereas an expenditure of £40,000 will give a good return, and business men concern themselves, not with the magnitude of proposed expenditure, but with the probability of obtaining a profit from it. Parliament should vote a sufficient sum to secure a substantial return; it will be useless to vote money in dribs and drabs in the manner proposed. No reference has been made to the appointment of a High Commissioner, but I think that a High Commissioner should be appointed as soon as ister in London has not yet been forgotten, will ibe appointed before it is forgotten. I do not intend to canvass at the present time the merits of possible candidates for the position. It will be sufficient to do that when a definite proposal is made to us. The Treasurer told us that when in -London he dined with all sorts of persons-h e is not a particular sort of chap-and that on one occasion he dined with the governor of the Bank of England. However, they dined together, and, in the course of a confidential conversation, the governor told the Acting Prime Minister that the. Banking Bill which the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce the Commonwas a very good one. We did not hear of should provide for future this Bill from the Government until the mention of it in the Budget. Then we by the honourable member for Swan. take on the part of the Acting Prime Minister to mention what was told to him confidentially. honourable gentleman himself. His Budget statements are public property, and, therefore, we have the right to ask for an outline of the provisions of the. measure,, if it is to be proceeded with, and to know whether it",24,Chapman Whe N The Member For East Sydney Before The Public

106,Mr Wilks,"That is a matter for theis to be gone on with or to be abandoned. The Government proposes the establishment of penny postage, though we have not been told how it is to be provided for. However, it is a placard which reads well, and helps to fill up the Ministerial programme. I should like to put before the Committee some importantfiguresrelating to immigration , which appear in bulletin No. 6 1 of this year, issued by the Government Statistician. This is a statement showing the number of persons of each nationality or race arriving in, or departing from, the Commonwealth during the month of June, 1906 and 1907, together with the total arrivals and departures for the first six months of those years. mation is subject to correction, but is the latest official statement. I can get. I find that, during the last six months, the white persons arriving in the Commonwealth numbered 33,414, and those departing 27,856, a gain of 5,558 for the half-year. Notwithstanding our resources and expanding revenue, Australia is adding only 11,000 white persons to her population each year. If immigration largely increased, there would be an excuse for increasing taxation, because the increase would not be felt, since it would be divided amongst a larger population. The present increase of population does not warrant the proposals of the Treasurer for an increase of taxation. The facts relating to the immigration and emigration of coloured persons are very gratifying. During the first six months of the year the arrivals of such persons in the Commonwealth numbered 1,975, and the departures 5.338that 916 Chinese arrived here and i,533 -departed, which makes our .Chinese population considerably less now than it was last December. Although our white population is increasing very slowly, our coloured population is rapidly decreasing. Great Britain is answerable for most of the white immigrants that come here. In 1907, she sent ^9,800, and 24,700 British persons left Australia. It is very gratifying to know that so many of our immigrants are (Pritish subjects. The next largest number came from France. The Germansa very good class -of citizensare disappearing from our : midst. There are more departures of Germans from Australia than there are arrivals, I present these figures to the Committee with a view to show that it is necessary to bring under the notice of the people of Great Britain the resources of the Commonwealth, and that the sum of £20,000 is altogether inadequate for the purpose. Of course, the Labour Party would cure our lack of population by the imposition of a land tax. They propose a sufficiently high exemption to prevent injury to small landholders, their argument being that the tax will disrupt large estates, and that it is useless to invite population to Australia until our lands are thrown open for settlement. My reply is that the .States control the administration of our lands, and that the question of land taxation should therefore be left with the States. Of course, I am aware that The inforWestern Australia is offering very liberal conditions with a view to attract settlers to that State. I wish that equally liberal conditions obtained elsewhere. But what chance has the Labour Party of securing the adoption of a progressive land tax by this House? Even assuming that the cure which they suggest would prove an efficacious one-whic h I do not admitI say that in the interim almost one of our first duties should be the appointment of a High Commissioner, and the thorough equipment of our London office. I now come to the question of the European mail contract. In this connection I think that the Government have shown a lamentable lack of business ability. Up to date the Commonwealth has not obtained the £25,000 guarantee deposited on behalf of Sir James Laing and Company. Not even a copy of the guarantee has been laid on the table of the House. The reason why a copy of it has been withheld is that Messrs. Barclay and Company undertook to"" guarantee thecontractors only, for a certain period. The Government permitted the date of that guarantee to expire without demanding the amount of the bond. In doing so, they exhibited a deplorable lack of business knowledge. The Attorney-General knows that what I am saying is correct. sort. of the guarantee uoon the table of the House? able member move in that direction? motion upon the business-papier to-day if the Government will'permit it to pass unopposed.

112,Mr Wilks,"I will put a notice ofshould address his question to the Postmaster-General. that what I have stated is not very far from the fact. The honourable member for Gwydir has made some very startling statements with regard to the sweating of certain officers in the General Post Office,Sydney. Such a condition of things as he disclosed is not creditable to the Commonwealth. The Government should set an example to private employers in refusing to underman public Departments, and to overwork their officers. In my judgment, the present administration of the Post Office is altogether too centralized. We pay a large salary to the Deputy Postmaster General in New South Wales to act merely as a recording clerk. I maintain that he should be saddled with his f u l l share of responsibility. He should be armed with the necessary power to cure the alleged sweating evil. A t the present time, however, if he desires to spend is. 6d. to repair a broken window in the Post Office, he has to obtain the authority to do so from Melbourne. Consequently he is dear to the Commonwealth at his present salary. The honourable member for Gwydir also made special reference to the sad case of Mr ClaTke, who was employed in the General Post Office, Sydney. The return which the honourable member produced showed that this officer had worked eighty days overtime in less than three years. Mr Clarke had asked for leave of absence on account of ill-health, but his services could not be spared, with the result that he died in harness. that he was a specialist he might have been receiving a salary of £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 more at the time of his death. ment worked him to death, and I think that the Government ought to make some provision upon the Estimates for his widow. clerk. was provided upon the Estimates, but the Acting Prime Minister says that he took it off. not yet been finally dealt with. still under consideration.

The report of the Royal Commissioner who was appointed by the Government to inquire into the matter of patent medicines, to which reference was made last night by the honourable member for Hunter, is a very important one. No more startling document has ever been placed before this Chamber, and in the interests of the community, action should be ta/kera by the Government. The gentleman who is credited with having compiled the report is not upon the same side of politics as myself, 'but that fact does not .blind me to its excellencies. I wish that the press of the country would give more publicity to that report than it has done. The document deals, inter alia, with quite a number of ' advertisements which are working harm to the community.

Some time ago I stated that I had been informed that the report was written by Dr. Arthur, and t h a t ' £ 5 0 0 had been paid for it.

If a keen struggle were going on in his electorate, he would be very glad to have my support, because there is a certain class of votes which I can influence. AlthoughI am challenged from time to time because of my position, I am ready, rightly or wrongly, to fight vigorously for my principles, without finding it necessary to make excuses for mv conduct to the honourable member, or even to the leader of the Opposition. The reports of the Victorian Inspector of Factories show no justification for the alteration of duties which has been made. I should be willing to vote for the removal of anomalies, but it is too much to ask us to increase the duties on such things as hats, boots, shirts, and clothing generally. The number of hands employed iii the 'clothing factories of Victoria was only 5,601 in 1900, whereas it is now increased to 6,300, which shows that the industry is a flourishing one. Why, then, should we increase the duties on clothing? One protectionist who came before the Tariff ignored the recommendations of the freeCommission, said, in reply to a question, ""I do not want to sail too closely to the wind. I want plenty of room. I want a duty of 35 per cent."" He wished to get enough protection to drown himself in'; and that is the desire of the protectionists monwealth. It has been said that very behind the Government.

I tried to have inserted in the Bill a provision which would have prevented them from taking it, but in that I was not successful. Before the Committee sanctions increases of duty, those increases should be justified on the ground that further protection is necessary to give employment to factories which are idle, and to keep in existence factories which would otherwise disappear. The Government, however, has made no attempt to justify increases. It has not even accepted the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Commission-the Quick section-and has so completely trade section that that may well be called in distinction, the dead section. The Tariff Commission, however, has furnished us with evidence which shows the true position of the manufacturers of the Comfew consumers gave evidence before it. The manufacturers came before the Commission because they have something to gain by an increase of duties. The consumers, on the other hand, are not organized.

Wales, I venture to say that the increase will easily spell from 4s. to 5s. per week. It is idle for protectionists to urge that the free-traders in this House are going back upon the fiscal truce. There was no truce entered into of the character which has been suggested. The leader of the Opposition merely pledged himself to remedy existing anomaliesa pledge which he intends to honorably fulfil. I hope that that fact will be recognised by' everybody. I need scarcely point out that the largest increases in this Tariff have reference to the. division relating to textiles. Twothirds of the importations under that heading come from Great Britain. What, then, becomes of the protectionist avowals in fayour of preferential trade? There is absolutely no justification for increasing the duties upon these commodities against the foreigner, seeing-as I have already stated-that two-thirds of them are of British origin. Yet in order to evidence their love for the people of Great Britain the Government have doubled the duty which was formerly levied upon these commodities. I look to every member of the Labour Party-whic h is supposed to be the custodian of the interests of the poorer classes of the community-irrespectiv e of whether he favours free-trade or protection -to vote in favour of a reduction of these duties. The Government have doubled the duty against the British manufacturer in the first instance, then they have doubled it upon the consumer, and finally they have said, ""We will increase the impost against the foreigner by 5 per cent."" A similar remark is applicable to apparel. thirds of the importations under this heading are the product of Great Britain. Here again there is no justification for taxing the foreigner. Yet the Government have raised the duty upon apparel from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent. I now come to the item of galvanized iron. This article was imported into the Commonwealth in 1906 to the value of £1,069,000, of which the United Kingdom supplied £1,032,000 worth. Practically, therefore, the whole of the importation is the product of Great Britain. What have the Government done in this case? They have actually quadrupled the duty which formerly operated. .

At the last election I knew that I should be asked whether I was a free-trader or a protectionist. I saw the storm coming, and thought it would be just as well to have an umbrella with me.

At the last election my return' was strongly opposed by protectionists, as well as by the Labour Party. I .told the electors that I realized there was no hope of securing a free-trade Tariff such as was formerly operative in New South Wales. When the first Tariff was under consideration, with the honourable member for Parramatta, I fought for free-trade, notwithstanding that some of the biggest industries in the Commonwealth are located in my electorate. I did not bid for the support of Mort's Dock, or the chemical works, or the timber yards. I fought in a straigbtforward fashion for free-trade. At Twothe last election I told the electors that I would oppose the imposition of higher duties upon the necessaries of life, but in respect of the other items in the Tariff, I said that I wanted a free hand. Consequently I have not been returned pledged either to protection or free-trade. Having been granted a free hand I intend to vote in favour of reducing the duties upon the necessaries of life to the lowest possible point. During the course of this discussion we have heard a good deal about the subject of wire netting. When the first Tariff was introduced that item was upon the free list.

Now, however, the position is reversed. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. journed I was showing that while the Government profess a desire to give preference -to Great Britain they have doubled and quadrupled the duties, in some instances, against the products 'of the old country. As to wire netting, this commodity was free under the first Tariff, although this is a New South Wales industry, and there were three representatives of that State in the Barton Government. I did not advocate a duty on wire netting, but I saw at the time that, while the industry employed hundreds of men, the nail industry in Victoria employed less than twenty men, and yet a duty was imposed on nails. In the. Victorian factory a few men were employed making nails with imported material by means of imported machinery; but .this was raised to the dignity of an Australian industry, deserving of the protection of a duty. Indeed, an effort was made to impose a higher duty than that originally recommended, but the proposal did not meet with the approval of the Committee. I find free-traders voting for the protection of industries in their own electorates, and protectionists advocating .the favourite policy for those whom they represent, and neither having any regard for the interests of others."" Personally, I am a free-trader, but I refuse to sit here and neglect my constituency, when I see free-traders and protectionists alike paying strict regard to the fiscal interests of their electorates. The duty on wire netting means an impost of £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 per 'annum-rathe r a serious item for the consumer. The Melbourne Age did me the -honour at the time of the election to make a pretty strong attack upon me because I -contended that protection meant protection for Victorian industries, whereas any protection which might be afforded should be I pointed out that this for the whole Commonwealth. Manchester, Birmingham, and other towns in -England have their special industries, and, in the same way, there are certain cities I and localities in Australia where special industries have grown u p ; and we find, that in all our fiscal proposals there is a disposition to regard with favour the industries of Victoria, while neglecting those of New South Wales, simply because the latter happens to be a free-trade State. In regard to the necessaries of life, I shall prove a resolute free-trader; but as to other items I shall insist on sharing any loot that the Tariff may afford. I regard the protective duties on secondary industries as so much plunder, and I am going to see that New South Wales has its share. I have been twitted many times about my references to the Mort's Dock Company, and I wish to 'say here that there will not be found, at times, a better free-trader in a ten days' march than Mr Franki, the manager of that company. Mort's Dock is a fine institution, and a few years ago it employed more men than it does now. In my opinion,the cause of the decline is not the want of protection, but the absence of up to-date administration. I have no desire to introduce personal matters, but I may say, that Mr Franki lives for the works, and the works alone, and, as an elector of mine, and only as an elector, he is entitled to my consideration. In the con.stituency of Dalley, however, there are thousands of working people who naturally feel the pinch of the T a r if f ; and it is in their interests I must fight. Mr Franki, in the matter of metals and machinery, is a protectionist, but a strong free-trader when he has to deal with timber for pattern-making, and so for t h ; and to accommodate him from both points of view is rather a difficult order. There is no doubt that Mort's Dock would be a much larger and more prosperous institution if it had up-to-date management. Around Port Jackson there is a number of smaller engineering establishments conducted by active and energetic men; I should like to see many more such works. It is a fact that some of these smaller firms which, though poor in capital, are rich in enterprise and energy, have competed successfully against the bigger firm. If there is any plundering to be done under",34,Chapman N O One Would Suggest That The Protectionist Arguments Are
188,Mr Wilks,"When the Committee ada Tariff, I agree that there ought to be protection for the iron industry, which is the basis of all other industries. If I were a protectionist I should start with that industry, and end there for a considerable time. The Government have proposed to assist the industry by means of a bonus; and that is a suggestion which I , as a free-trader, opposed for years. But in the HouseI have found honourable members, who call themselves free-traders, voting for rural bounties amounting to £5oo,ooot-bountie s on the production of cotton, fibres, peanuts, and other commodities. If we are to have bonuses, let us have a bonus for an industry which employs the class of men. we desire to encourage to come here, and the class of men who are already here, who earn a standard wage, and live under good conditions; and in my opinion we can achieve that end by a bonus on the production of iron. If an import duty be imposed, engineering establishments are immediately affected by the tax; and I should, therefore, prefer an iron bonus, accompanied by a bonus on ship-buildirig, an industry well worth encouraging in Australia. .have a national industry of ship-building? nationalizing industries. I know that the Labour Party are in favour of nationalizing what they term monopolies; and my difficulty is that if I vote for high duties, I help to establish monopolies and thus pave the way to nationalization. The more assistance that is given by way of duties, the more encouragement there is to the formation of monopolies. should be monopolies, and, therefore, I am not in favour of high duties. My opinion is that we ought not to render any assistance in the formation of monopolies, and, if monopolies exist, they ought to be regulated, and not nationalized. In reference to the wire netting industry, the Labour Party, instead* of condemning the Premier of New South Wales for his recent action, ought to applaud him for taking what is a first step towards nationalization. If the Premier of New South Wales feels it his -duty to buy wire-netting for pastoralists, it ought ""to be equally his duty to provide food for the people. If he is to be a purveyor for the public, why should he stop short at wire-netting ? If I were a member of the Labour PartyI should say, ""Well done, Carruthers; you have taken the first step towards Socialism""; although I do not know that Mr Carruthers realizes that that is the effect of the course he has taken. ' The nail industry of Victoria, which employs only a few hands, has been given increased protection to the extent of 50 per cent., whereas the wire-netting industry, simply because it happens to be located in New South Wales, appears to have been neglected. In Victoria so much is thought of the wire-netting industry that it is to be carried on by prison labour at Pentridge. Mr Bent, the Premier of Victoria, has imported machinery for the work, and that machinery is now being erected. What .does the Commonwealth Government think of that step? has said he would do many things which he has not done. chinery has been imported, and is now being erected. When a deputation waited on Mr Bent, about fourteen months ago, in favour of the establishment of the industry, he was told, in answer to a question, that it was not carried on in Victoria, but in New South Wales, whereupon he said, "" Oh, well, we shall have it carried on in Pentridge."" That is a true Federal spirit 1 If there had been one wire-nail factory in Victoria, employing one man and a boy, Mr Bent would not have dared to suggest the carrying on of .the industry by means of prison labour. But it is of no use talking about a Federal spirit, because I find that honourable members think only of their own States when it comes to the pinch. Another item is that of paints and colours, eleven-tenths of which are imported from the United Kingdom; and yet such is the love of the Government' for Great Britain, that they propose to double the duty. The Government believe so strongly in preferential trade .that they are prepared to double the duty, and give a preference of 5 per cent, to British imports. To my mind, they are simoly gilding the pill, with the object of enabling higher duties to be imposed on the masses of the community. I think that the Government will bid adieu to the proposed duty on earthenware, for the leader of the Labour Party has announced that he is opposed to it.

This tax will fall upon the poorest of the poor. courage the industry in Australia. It is true that there are shale deposits in New South Wales, but ' I hold that the impost is not a justifiable one. I think we shall find that the duty will not be pressed by the Government, since the leader of the Labour Party has intimated that it objects to it. -Had this Tariff been submitted just before, instead of immediately after, a general election, the position would have been different. It has been suggested in the oress that an appeal should be made to the people. elections, but I would sooner appeal to the people on such a question as this than upon any other. member oughtTnot to be so foolish. the electors on the Tariff issue than upon the question of whether or not it was justifiable to increase the allowances to Honourable members. In passing, I should like to inform the honourable member for .Darwin that the Governor General of Java is paid £11,000 per annum, whilst members of the local Legislature receive £2,400 a year. In such circumstances he surely could not do better than take the first boat to Java. To return to the Tariff, I wish to draw special attention to the. fact that grocery lines are seriously affected under it. The duty upon glass is an indirect tax upon oilmen's stores, such as sauces, pickles, salads, and so forth. The timber duties will also operate against trade. .Two-thirds of our imports in the textile division comes from Great Britain, and on these the duties have been doubled. The duty on apparel-mos t of our imports of which come from Great Britain-ha s been increased from 25 to 40 per cent., whilst there has been an increase in [95] the duty on galvanized iron and other British products. Then, again, we have a duty, on matches representing twice the I never said that. actual value. This may be regarded as a small item, but the duty is so high as to be a matter of some concern to the householder. The revenue from the new Tariff will be regulated by the enhanced cost of many of these goods, which must necessarily result in a decreased consumption. The first Prime Minister of Australia, who was an adept at coining phrases, when outlining the policy of the Government, spoke Kerosene, which was of the pattering of bare feet on our pavements. It seems to me that if this Tariff is to prevail, we shall soon hear practically nothing but the pattering of bare feet on It cannot be said that it will enour pathways. Some people may think if. well to do without boots, and to go back to a primeval state, but many of us believe that there is comfort in boots, and every one likes to send his children to school well clothed and booted. This Tariff, however, will so increase prices that many will find great difficulty in doing so. I have already shown that the boot trade in Victoria under the old Tariff increased very considerably, and that the number of employees in the industry in 1906, as compared with the number so engaged in 1900, I am not enamoured of general showed an increase of 30 per cent. The honourable member for Batman knows something about leather, and believes that there is nothing like it.

208,We All Admire The Pluck Of Mr Sandford,",for an expenditure of something like £500,000 to encourage such industries as the growth of peanuts, the production of sunflower seeds, and so forth. In the circumstances, therefore, I am determined to fight for an iron bounty, coupled with a ship-building bounty, at the earliest opportunity. nise the extent to which I am "" rocky "" on free-trade. that I am not going to see other free-traders doing a little in this direction for their own electorates while I do nothing. Referring again to the question of preferential trade, I may say at once that I consider the Government proposals to be mere makebelieve. The rest of the British Empire supplies 63 per cent, of Australia's imports, while we send to other parts of the Empire 61 per cent, of our total exports. The great volume of our trade, therefore, is with the rest of the Empire. The duties cm imports from Great Britain under this Tariff have been considerably increasedsome of them have been doubled, some cf them quadrupled, while in other cases' 20 per cent, duties have been imposed. Notwithstanding this, the Government pose before the country as lovers of the mother land, and send Home to the Imperial Conference representatives who declare! that they desire, on behalf of Australia, preferential trade relations with Great Britain. As a matter of fact, they simply sought to drive a bargain with Great Britain to supply a market for our staple products, while we, in return, should take from her as little as possible. Mr Chamberlain wanted to secure the markets of Australia for"" the manufacturers of Great Britain. He saw that in several directions production was declining in the old land, and he thought that the adoption of his. scheme would stimulate it. He proposed that in return Great Britain should provide a market for our products. country purchase anything from abroad ? if the Government honestly favour preferential trade they should come forward with something like a genuine scheme. Freetraders always .oppose protection, not because they object to the establishment of industries in Australia, but because they believe that under such a system money is taken out of the pockets of the people for the benefit of the few. Many admit that protection helps the capitalist, but not the worker. The leader of the Labour Party has come forward with a scheme to give effect to the policy .of the new protection. We learn now that not a member of the Labour Party will vote for protection unless some conditions are imposed on the manufacturers who reap the benefit of that Honourable members will recog-. policy. .In other words, we are to have protection in bandages. The Labour PartyI am "" rocky "" in the sense are determined that a system shall be adopted which will enable all classes to participate in the benefits of. the policy. When I vote for protection it will be for "" protection in bandages."" .Every time that I vote for an increased duty, I shall tighten the bandage round the manufacturer, so that tlie operatives employed by him will .receive some share of the benefit of that protection. The Labour Party suggest that the bandage to be applied to the manufacturer shall be that which will insure the payment of a proper wage to his workmen. They admit that the manufacturer, like the importer, is prepared to make as much as he possibly can out of his business. I am not here to help either at the expense of the general community. The proposal made by the leader of the Labour Party is, after all, only an expedient, and I do not think it is likely to effect the object which he has in view. I believe it will be just as ineffective as the 'Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill has proved. The Labour Party have declared themselves in favour of the nationalization of monopolies. In view of their latest proposal they ought to go a step further, and say : "" We believe that all big industries should be nationalized."" In that event there could be no doubt as to whether or not the bandage would be effective. If they came forward and said : '' Our object is to nationalize all industries, we cjould understand very well what they had in view. I differ from them as to the wisdom of the nationalization of industries. It is unwise, and not in the interests of the country generally, that the Government should conduct these great industries. It would be a direct step towards Socialism, and I should oppose anything of the kind. The new Tariff has been spoken of as a fence round Australia. I hold that it is something, more; it is a barricade which, unlike a fence, is very difficult to get over. The honourable member for Bass, who is a Government supporter, last night riddled the Tariff. He pointed out item after item to which he was opposed, saying that he believed they .would prove injurious to Tasmania.",37,Chapman N O One Would Suggest That The Protectionist Arguments Are
209,Mr Ewing,Does not a protectionist,38,Chapman N O One Would Suggest That The Protectionist Arguments Are
210,Mr Wilks,"Of course it'does. ButHe said in effect, "" In so far as these duties injuriously affect Tasmania, I am against them. As for the other items, they affect New South Wales and the mainland States, and, therefore, I shall support the Government so far as they are concerned."" The new protection of which we have heard so much is, I believe, an after-thought, and has been proposed to ease down the effect of the Tariff on the public. I know that the people of New South Wales are up in arms against the proposals of the Government. Those who are crying out against them are not merely the old-time free traders. Members of the official. Labour Party, and the average protectionist worker and his wife, are against them. They have no desire that the severe rates of duty to which I have referred shall be sanctioned by Parliament. Unquestionably there will be a long discussion on the Tariff. knows that the discussion must be a long one. But it is difficult to say whether he is the more sorry or glad at the prospect. As a Ministerialist, he must be glad, because delay will suit the interests of his party, while, as a protectionist, he may be sorry. In New South' Wales, the Customs taxation has been increased from 20s. to 50s. per head, so that we have something to complain of, whereas in Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia, it has been reduced. Nevertheless, the people of Western Australia do not like the new duties. The Prime Minister, however, has one supporter there, who says that he has done right. Some one named Jim Griffiths, of Western Australia, has written a letter to the honourable gentleman, saying that this is the ideal Tariff. The representatives of the State will not say that it is ideal. There are many other arguments which I could marshal 1 against the proposals of the Government, but I shall not do so now, because I wish to give other honourable members an opportunity to publish their views to their constituents. There should be no duty on the necessaries of life; and, furthermore, if the country is to be looted and plundered, I shall see that it will not be only the manufacturers of Victoria who will gain. If protection is to be increased, the interests of all the States must be considered. The leader of the Opposition has not said that he will not fight against the Tariff. On the contrary, he has openly and squarely declared that he will fight for the reduction of [95]2 duties. He pledged himself not to attempt to destroy industries established under protection, and promised to vote for the adjustment of anomalies, of which this Tariff is f u l l ; so full that those responsible for it say that there must be a Commission to provide for equity and fair dealing under it. It is admitted, even by the supporters of the Tariff, that it contains as many anomalies as were in the old Tariff. The Tariff is by no means scientific, though it might be called ""skyentific,"" the duties in it are so high. The Government, without regard to the recommenda tions of either the Quick or the Fuller section of the Tariff Commission, has increased rates all round, and its proposals must be threshed out thoroughly when dealt with individually. I regret that the party to which I belong did not take the proper stand on the last Supply Bill, and oppose the granting of money while a Tariff like this was before Parliament. Even in the protectionist State of Victoria the wives of the workers are protesting against the high duties, because retailers are increasing their prices. I have not yet ascertained from the Government how much duty was paid on tobacco cleared during the four weeks immediately preceding tlie ir.trcduction of the Tariff, but it is well known that the sum was an enormous one, and it is difficult to believe that there was not a leakage of information in regard to the proposals of the Government. I make no accusation against the Minister, because I think that that should not be done unless the charge can be proved. But it .would seem that a leakage has occurred. To-day 9d. extra is being charged for tobacco on which only 6d. was paid in duty. In common with other manufacturers, the makers of tobacco are using tlie Tariff for their own ends. creased on articles which bear no duty. That is not honest.

I hope to have the pleasure of addressing you, Mr Chairman, on many future occasions in regard to items in the Tariff, because I shall oppose it vigorously, unless the Government back down, and Ministers say, "" We have made a mistake; we are willing to -take off the increases, to accept a moderate Tariff, and to show that we are true preferential traders."" not expect them to do that, and certainly every free-trader must oppose the Tariff as if stands. not intend to occupy much time at this stage in discussing the fiscal question, because I realize that there will be ample opportunity to deal with each item of the Tariff as it comes before us; but I have a few general remarks to make. I was returned neither as a protectionist nor as a free trader, and, therefore, have a free hand in regard to the Tariff. I realize that at the last elections Australia spoke for protection. That is shown by the fact that a Government which has not more direct supporters than it contains Ministers, still remains on the. Treasury benches. has only six direct supporters. It is being kept in power by the non-fiscalists. would get rid of the present Government if it could put into power one more to its liking. spoken for protection, the Deakin Administration would not be still in power. by protectionists, but by the Labour Party. ministration brought down its Tariff, the leader of the ""Opposition challenged the Government in regard to it , and if he thinks that Australia has not spoken for protection, there is nothing to prevent him from challenging this Government; but no motion of censure has been moved. fiscalists, who keep the Government in power, are too numerous. has spoken for protection, and, therefore, I shall not offer factious opposition to the Tariff, nor shall I captiously criticise the Government proposals. At the same time. I do not admit that the people have endorsed every item in the Tariff. I do not say that Australia has spoken for the Lyne Tariff, although it has spoken for protection. There is a large number of protectionists, especially in the democratic portion of the community, prepared to bring about the manufacture in Australia of such goods as it is thought can reasonably and legitimately be manufactured here. It is not with them a question of rates of duty. They are ready to impose whatever rates I do are necessary to insure the local manufacture of certain goods, and on the other hand, they desire that goods which cannot be manufactured here shall be admitted free. Therefore they are opposed to a large number of the items in the Tariff, because these items are revenue producing, and they. are not in favour of the raising of money through the Customs to permit the Governments of the States to carry on without direct taxation, and to repeal such direct taxation' as they already have. WhilstI am prepared to support the Government, to a certain extent, in regard to duties halving a protective incidence, I shall vote against all items which are merely revenue producing, because I am in favour of direct taxation, even for Commonwealth purposes. I regret the preT h e Government sence of revenue-producing items in the Tariff, and I am sorry that in the financial statement of the Treasurer there was no foieshadowing of direct taxation. Those who, like myself, believe in direct taxation, must take every opportunity to refute the assertion which has been made, both outside and inside the Chamber, that, although the Constitution has given this Parliament the right to impose direct taxation if it It is kept in office, not chooses to do so, there has been a distinct understanding that it shall not impose it . That assertion has frequently been made in this House. I say that no such understanding was arrived at with the democracy of Australia*. When the Constitution B ill was before the people in New South Wales they were assured from every platform that if it were adopted this Parliament would have a perfect right to impose direct taxation. In South Australia, the Commonnonwealth League, of which Senator Sir Josiah Symon was then President, issued a leaflet to the following effectI think that Australia The question of land or other taxation is l e f t under the B ill to the electors of the Commonwealth, who are free to adopt any system of taxation they please, so long as it is equal allover the Commonwealth. this Parliament to impose direct taxation ever been disputed?",39,Chapman N O One Would Suggest That The Protectionist Arguments Are

225,Mr Henry Willis,"H as the right ofday, I understood the honourable member for Flinders to say that whilst he admitted that this Parliament has the right under the Constitution to levy direct taxation, there was a distinct understanding that it would not exercise that right, save in time of national emergency. I venture to say that direct taxation possesses many advantages over indirect taxation. That statement, I think, is indisputable. If we imposed direct taxation we should have less extravawith a protective system, but the idea that gance in the matter 'of government. orable member make that out? ledge of political economy-and I take it that the honourable member has no knowledge of that subject, or else he would not have asked such a stupid question-mus t know that the easiest way to raise revenue is through the Customs House, and that the easier it is to raise revenue the more extravagant we are likely to be. Other hand, if all the money required for the purposes of government had to be raised by'means of direct taxation so that the people would know exactly what they were paying, there would not be so much extravagance as there is at present. I am not one of those who have joined in a sweeping condemnation of the action of certain traders in Australia in increasing their prices after the introduction of the Tariff. I believe that amongst the wholesale merchants and the'retailers of the Commen have come here and picked the eyes out monwealth are to be found a number of dishonest men-me n who are prepared to take a dishonest advantage of any Tariff proposals. But there is not a larger percentage of dishonest individuals amongst these classes than is to be found amongst any other class of the community. To my mind the loftiest calling in the world is that of a minister of the Gospel, but I believe that there is a number of ministers of the Gospel who are a disgrace to their cloth. In precisely the same way, a number of those who are engaged in business as wholesale merchants are not honest and straightforward. But, regarded as a class, the wholesale merchants are just as honest as is any other body of men, and, consequently, it is not fair for us to lay all the ber will admit that the* wherewithal is an blame for the enhanced price of articles upon their shoulders. We must also recollect that the wholesale merchants have to charge the public not only upon the money value of the goods which they import, but also upon the amount which they are required to expend in the first instance by way of duty. If we are raising £10,000,000 through the Customs House, the merchants require to get back not only the amount which they have expended upon the goods themselves, but at least 10 per cent, more which they are required to pay by way of duty. The sooner we realize that it is not the foreigner who pays the Customs duties the better. Even protectionists might fairly admif that. There may be many advantages connected we.can collect a large revenue at the Customs Housea revenue which is paid by the foreigner-is the acme of absurdity. I have already declared that I am in favour of direct taxation. I hold in my hand an extract from a speech which was delivered by the honourable member for Parramatta when a member of the 'New South Wales Parliament. It reads. It is not the thrift"" of the country but the legalized theft of the country that we want to On the tax-the men who have taken through the medium of land values something which they did nothing to create, who have taken from the people the result of their own flesh and blood, who have taken it by the machinery of the law and appropriated it to their own personal use. That is the kind of value, and that is the substance we want to tax. The income tax does not necessarily reach these people. It only reaches those who are cultivating their estates; but it does not reach the estates which are locked up, and which are contributing nothing to the revenue. . . . Because somebody has been fool enough to give the best portion of our -lands away, and some lucky of the country, we are to be told that we ought to respect the rights of these persons and pay huge sums of money and make huge concessions in point of time before we can lay claim to any possibility of getting a livelihood from them. As some one has. said, "" In the name of the prophet, figs "" ! No doubt the honourable member would endorse those statements to-day, but in more elegant and classical English. I regret that the Government have not seen their way to submit proposals in favour of direct taxation. I also deplore the fact that no provision has been made for the creation of a Federal old-age pension scheme. The time is ripe when we should initiate such a scheme. element ? for the payment of these pensions can be found in Australia.

I am very glad that, in connection with Government, we are to seriously discuss what is known as the ""new protection."" The fact that we are to discuss such a question is in itself an admission that in the it is logical protection You distinctly say by past protective duties have not proved a panthe motion you will not submit this material toacea for all evils of an industrial character. Government would do the same in respect toTo-day we say that not only the manufacturer but also the worker must be protected. With that I agree; but it is proposed to go further, and attempt to insure that the consumer is also protected. I am prepared to support the proposal, hoping that it may (be successful, but whether that will be the result, time only can prove. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley when he suggests that we might go one step further. If we are prepared to say how much the dutyshall be in order to secure the local manufacture of a commodity, to say how much wages shall be paid to the employees, and also what the cost of the manufactured article shall be to the consumer, why, in the name of figs, to use the words of the honourable member for Parramatta, should we not go one step further, as a community, and make the article. This seems to me the logical outcome of the new protection. know that there is much to be said against the manufacture of articles by the community. I should like once more to draw attention to a debate which took place some years ago in the New South Wales ParCrick, to the effect that all the articles rewoomba was made only four years ago quired by the Railways Commissioners should be manufactured within the State, and on an amendment, moved by Mr Premier of New South Wales, in referenceFrank Cotton, to add the words "" and in the Government workshops."" I am delighted to say that that amendment was supported by all the eloquence and vigour of the honourable member for East Sydney, who pointed out that if the amendment were adopted, the unnecessary profit of the middleman would be saved, and the purMr Thomas. chaser and the manufacturer brought closes together. member nothing to say as to the merits When the next Budget is of that proposal? what was the argument used on that occasion by the honourable member for East Sydney. I am glad to say that the amendment was also supported by the honourable member for Parramatta, who, at that time,; represented Lithgow, in the local Parliament. The honourable member for Parrathe Tariff proposals of the matta saidI admit at once it is a measure of protection, but I disclaim that it is a fiscal protection. It is a protection of the right kind-in a word,, the operation of a Tariff at all, and if theeverything on which they now impose a duty I could understand their protection. It would be then logical, straightforward protection, instead' of making people pay through the nose. At Toowoomba recently the honourable member for East Sydney said that if we wereto adopt protection, it would be better for the State to manufacture the articles, when we should have a guarantee that' they werenot produced [under sweated conditions. Can we blame t h j man in the street for believing there is something in Socialism, when so distinguished and able a man as the leader of the anti-Socialist party isprepared to say that Socialism has, at least, the two advantages that it does away with the unnecessary orofit of the middleman, and is a definite guarantee that commodities are produced without sweated, labour.

If we do not desire the match-making industry, for instance, let the fact be stated, so that we shall know where we are. If , on the other hand, we do desire to see the mining industry prosper, we should be prepared to support a reasonable duty on the condition I have named. In my opinion, the duty on kerosene ought to be removed. I understand that one of the objects of the appointment of the Tariff Commission was the removal of anomalies; but, in view of the proposed duty on kerosene, I should say that for every anomaly removed, a whole family of new anomalies has been introduced. A duty on kerosene, it seems to me, is a class tax at any time. The man in the city, who uses gas and electricity, escapes the impost, and it is the man in the country who has to pay it ; this seems to me very unfair, seeing that country life is already hard enough, without our imposing further disadvantages. It would not be so bad if a duty of Jd., id., or 3d. were imposed on kerosene all round, but, according to the proposal before us, kerosene in bulk is admitted free, while kerosene in tins has to bear a tax, thus further penalizing . the man in the country.

244,Mr Thomas,"It is being delivered byassume that it could be so delivered in Broken Hill, Milparinka, or Tibooburra? It must be admitted that this tax will press heavily on people in country districts. Kerosene has its industrial uses. Many engines are now being driven by it, arid the impost will be an additional burden on those using such machinery. I would remind honourable members that kerosene is also used largely in connection with the poultry industry. It is used for incubators, and also in keeping down insect life in the poultry pens. Every effort should be made to develop the export trade in poultry. At the present time the industry is almost as large a one as is the wire nail making industry, and it certainly is as important as is the growing of peanuts or the making of matches. We are able to supply the local demand for eggs, except during a few months, when they are very scarce, and the export trade in poultry shows a tendency to increase. South Australia is exporting annually £100,000 worth of eggs to Western Australia and New South Wales. tralia has been keeping the industry going in South Australia? Australia will doubtless supply its own requirements in that respect, and poultry raisers in South Australia will then give further attention to the London and South African markets. I propose now to refer to the duty on magazines. It is difficult to understand why it should have been imposed. dation of the Tariff Commission? the moment, but I should like to learn why the Government have imposed a duty of 6d. per lb. on magazinesone-fifth of which comprise advertisements. The idea is a brilliant one, worthy of a great Government ! Magazines coming into this country may be divided into two classes. In the one division we have high-class publications, such as the Nineteenth Century and the Fortnightly Review. Those magazines will come in free since they depend for their success, not so much upon their -advertisements as upon their high subscriptions and their circulation. I do not suggest that they go only into the homes of the rich-becaus e a man may have a lot of money and not much brains-bu t they enter the homes of the cultured. These magazines will escape the tax; but the second class of publications, such as the Strand, ^Cassell's, Pearson's, Weldon's, other popular and attractive publications, will be penalized. On the other hand, rubbishy papers like Comic Cuts and Tit-Bits will come in free. It ' is the attractive, brightly written, well-gotup magazines that are largely used as advertising mediums, and these are to be penalized. As an illustration of the way in which this duty will operate, I should like to point out that the Rapid Review for this month was admitted free of duty, the number of pages of advertisements appearing in it being one less than the number necessary to bring it under the impost; but next month it may have an additional page or two of advertisements,, and in that event it will be dutiable. The impost is an absurd one. It may be that the desire of the Government in imposing it was to encourage Australian writers. If that be so they ought to have applied the duty to the higher class productions. parently that we should be satisfied with our own knowledge. seems strange that we should allow the highest class of literature, as well as the rubbish, to come in free, whilst attractive magazines, which provide much information and entertainment for the people, are to be dutiable. This duty will apply to some of our first-class scientific journals. I understand that the Printers' Journal, a hia;h class publication, will be penalized. I hope that this duty will be removed, and I should be glad if the Government would indicate their intentions in the matter in time to allow of orders being placed for the usual Christmas editions of English periodicals that are distributed here. The Government say they believe in preferential trade with Great Britain, and they have in this case an opportunity to prove their bona fides. I am opposed to preferential trade, but do not wish it to be understood that I ""am, therefore, disloyal to the motherland. There is no country outside Australia whose-progress I should more heartily, welcome. I love England. I was born there, and in no sense could-1 be disloyal to it. Not only do I love England with the love of. the native born; I also revel in her history.

Speaking on the Address-in-Reply, I saidWhen the Minister of Trade and Customs bo to the people of Australia? I believe was speaking in reply to the honourable member in loyalty to the mother country, but all for Parramatta, I interjected, "" What about preferential trade? .Cannot we manufacture that the preferential trade proposals will everything here"" ?

It is not sufficient for them to be told that c we have imposed lower duties on British gcods than we have imposed on foreign goods, if the duties on English goods are sufficiently high to prevent such goods from being sent here.

In the course of a big debate in the House of Commons, Mr Asquith shortly replied to the preferentialists of England by asking them if they were prepared to tax the food supplies of the mother country, the corn, butter and frozen meat imported into Great Britain from foreign countries If the food supplies of Great Britain which are imported from foreign countries are not taxed, of what advantage will preference imported from Germany instead of from their grain in the mother land.
