Tuesday, & June, 1942. took thc chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. effective, reflect credit on those responMr 3VTAKTTJ (Hindmarsh Minister for the Navy) -by leave-The House is aware than an enemy attempt was made during the night of Sunday, the 31st May, and Monday, the lst June, to damage shipping in Sydney Harbour by means of a submarine attack. The attempt was unsuccessful. Ita failure was due to the preparedness of our defences for such an attempt, and the prompt counter-attack carried out by harbour defence vessels and other warships in the harbour. It would appear that three enemy submarines participated in the attack. All were destroyed. The total damage inflicted by them before they were destroyed was the sinking of a Sydney ferry steamer which was used as a depot ship for naval ratings. It is regretted that, of the personnel on board the vessel at the time, six naval ratings were killed, and thirteen are missing, believed killed. Their next-of-kin have been informed. In addition, ten ratings were injured. Long before Japan entered the war, and when Australia seemed remote from the possibility of naval attack, steps had been taken to safeguard the defences of our ports. Fortunately, therefore, upon Japan's engagement in hostilities, we were well prepared for any eventuality. The completeness of those preparations was made apparent to the enemy in his attack on Sydney. It must be recognized that the form of attack was such that it was difficult to counter. The enemy used midget submarines, which were able to make an entry to the harbour through channels that would be denied to a larger ship. Furthermore, carrying only two men and having been built for the definite object of objective destruction and self-destruction, no consideration is given by thc enemy to the' subsequent fate of the vessels; consequently, they may afford to concentrate on a single objective without regard to the consequences to themselves. That the attempt by such midget craft to enter Sydney harbour in the middle of the night was instantly detected, and that the counter measures were BO prompt and sible for the harbour defences, and should prove both a disappointment and a deterrent to the enemy. The first alarm was given by a patrol vessel at Sydney Heads shortly before 10 o'clock on Sunday night. Before 10.30 p.m. the submarine attempting to penetrate the outer harbour defences had been destroyed by being sunk without managing to get inside the harbour, and the wreck has since been located on the sea bed by divers. Meanwhile, the alarm having been given, patrol vessels and warships in the harbour were on the alert, and two enemy submarines which had succeeded in entering the harbour were quickly dealt with. One of these, at about midnight, succeeded in firing two torpedoes in the harbour. One torpedo Bank the naval depot ship previously mentioned; the other ran harmlessly ashore and failed to explode. These were the only torpedoes which the enemy succeeded in firing. One of these two submarines was sunk in the harbour, and has been located hy divers, lying on the bottom. A full examination of it will be made. Although the wreckage of the third submarine has not yet been located, it has undoubtedly shared the fate of its companions. The search for it is being continued. Obviously, it is not possible for me to describe the defence measures adopted. In the destruction of thc enemy submarines, gunfire and depth charges played a part. I cannot speak of the other measures, such as those that ensure detection of the enemy's presence, beyond saying that, as Sunday night's events show, they are particularly effective and ably administered. They will continue to function effectively, so that any attempt which the enemy may subsequently make will be dealt with as successfully as was his abortive effort on Sunday night. Apart from the losses to personnel, there are good grounds for satisfaction at the results then achieved. The enemy, on",8,Appropriation Act No 2 1941 42 No 30 Of 1942

This morning, I visited Sydney in order to acquaint myself with the circumstances of the attack and to interview the officer in charge of the defences of Sydney Harbour. I am completely satisfied with the efforts of all of those associated with such defences, for the protection of the aooroaches to Sydney Harbour during last week-end. The vigilance, calmness and courage that they displayed give to the Australian people the assurance that, in the present serious national emergency, the nation is being served by men of undoubted loyalty who will fully protect this country to the best of their ability. the known speed and operational range of midget submarines, and the fact that those which made the attack on Sydney entered the harbour about 10 o'clock at night, does not the Mmister for the Navy think it possible that they were launched in daylight by a mother ship less than 100 miles from Sydney? Is there not an aerial and naval patrol protecting the important harbours of the Commonwealth, and if not, why not? attached to the Navy are to-day seeking to determine just how the midget submarines may have been conveyed to a point near the Sydney Harbour in order to carry out the attack which they made on Sunday night last. It is, of course, conceivable that they were launched from a parent ship, and everything possible has been done to discover such a ship. However, that is not the only course the enemy could have followed in order to get the submarines to Sydney. Each of those possibilities which our naval experts consider may have been exploited is being fully examined, and all the essential steps are being taken with a view to ascertaining whether such vessels are still in waters adjacent to Australia, or within range of our naval or air reconnaissance, so that we may despatch tliem with the same swiftness as we dealt with the three submarines that entered Sydney harbour. for the Navy explain how it happened that the first omciai news of the attack was received in Sydney from press sources in the United States of America, the second announcement came from the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the first details were released in Melbourne? Why was the important city of Sydney overlooked in that manner in the dissemination of the news? ber will understand that communiques are issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Eorces in the South-west Pacific. It was considered undesirable to make an earlier announcement, because a premature disclosure of the fate of the three submarines might have warned any other enemy vessels lurking in adjacent waters that we suspected their presence. The Department of the Navy considered that the successful attack on the submarines should be kept a secret for as long as possible and it was left to the Commandev-in-Chief to determine the most favorable moment to release the news. of the fruitless search which has been conducted for the mother ship of the midget submarines which attacked Sydney recently, I ask the Minister for the Navy whether consideration has been given to Technical experts the possibility of such a ship having released the submarines some days prior to the attack in order to enable it to escape? The submarines might have lurked close to the shores of Australia for several days, and their crews might even have communicated with enemy agents in Australia. Has the Department of the Navy any knowledge of the construction or use by Japan of large submarines simila.r to those which were used by Germany during the war of 1914-18 in order to carry cargoes of merchandise between the American continent and German ports?",11,Enemy Submarines In Sydney Harbour

What procedure is necessary, and how long will it be before tliose who bave applied will be admitted to the Australian Imperial Force? decision to allow members of the Citizen Military Forces to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force, I had a further conversation with the Adjutant-General, General Head-quarters, Melbourne, today, on this matter, and he told me that immediately my decision was made, a telegram was despatched to all commanding officers concerned giving them general approval of the scheme, and telling them to await instructions as to procedure. These instructions were carefully prepared, and are now in the post on their way to the Commanding Officers throughout Australia. Conditions are now different from those which obtained at the time the present members of the Citizen Military Forces were in their homes scattered-all over Australia. They then enlisted at their local centres, and were sent down, to their capital city to be medically hoarded and attested. Because of the big concentration of these men now, largely in two or three States, medical boards and records procedure must be first established before their applications for transfer to the Australian Imperial Force can be dealt with. It is conceivable that there might be a solitary unit with one regimental medical officer. Before a. medical board can be established, it is necessary to have at least two medical officers. The necessary machinery is now in motion, however, to get over this difficulty, and records are being taken in all units preparatory to the posting of the men to the Australian Imperial Force in accordance with applications received. for the Army seen the reprint in this week's issue of the Bulletin of an article which appeared in tlie Sydney Morning Herald as follows:Two Australian divisions embarked from tlie Middle East in a plan to save Burma.

In fact, the first that tbe officers of the Department of Information knew of the publication was a reference to it in the press. It is unfortunate that honourable memlbers seem to be disposed to decry at every opportunity the work of this department, and that, when preparing to launch an attack upon it, they do not take sufficient trouble to ascertain whether their facts are even remotely correct. The Department of Information,in association with the Public Relations Department of the American forces now in Australia, did issue a goodwill booklet to American troops. This publication struck a particularly high note of blood brotherhood between the Australian and American people. It is unfortunate that whatever goodwill it has been able to establish should be prejudiced by such an ill-timed and unfounded attack as was made in this chamber last week by those honourable members. for the Army read in yesterday's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald a statement by the Minister for Information that the public is not being given sufficient information about the wav, and that restrictions imposed by the Department of the Army were unnecessarily severe?

It was ruled then that the committee could not consider certain amendments because they would involve an increase of the appropriation, and that-such amendments could be introduced only by a Minister of the Crown.

If we persist in following procedure of this kind we shall make ourselves appear ridiculous. If tbe message of thc Governor General is only a matter of form, the sooner such forms are dispensed with the better. My idea of a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation of revenue is that it sbould provide an opportunity far the responsible Minister to inform the committee how much he wants and the purpose for which he want it. If he is not able to give that explanation, the committee would be justified in refusing tbe appropriation. Slipshod methods such as those which are being applied here would not be tolerated in an outback sbire council. It is ridiculous that Parliament sbould be asked to vote an unknown amount of money for an unknown purpose.

110,Sir Charles Marr (Parkes) [4.22].,"The progress in the use of radio, particularly broadcasting, has phenomenal in the last decade, and only a fool would prophesy what the future holds in this field of science. Having been associated witb broadcasting and wireless telegraphy since 1902, I am able to compare authoritatively broadcasting and radio telegraphy in their infancy, witb modern ' developments. In tbe last war, great progress was made in this things, members of the Australian and New Zealand Wireless Squadron made and operated what is believed to be tbe first radio direction-finding instrument in the world, and devised and operated special sets for receiving enemy signals both from the air and through the earth. Those inventions were greatly in advance of tbe efforts in tbe same field of other countries. In 1916, the system of wired wireless was inaugurated, and became known wave system"". When introduced into Australia in 1926, it was used commercially, particularly on interstate and intra-state lines of the Postniaster-'General's Department. Tbe more one studies the science of radio telegraphy, the more one visualizes its future possibilities and how much there is still to learn. It is paradoxical that tbe more one learns of a science, the more one realizes how little be knows about it . Those who were engaged upon devising a system for the control of radio broadcasting in Australia in its infancy, laid a solid foundation. That is demonstrated by the fact that the Joint Committee on Broadcasting did not recommend drastic alterations of tbe present method of control, and tbe bill provides for tbe continuance of the present dual 3ystem of national and commercial stations, though the control of tbe two will be brought under one act of Parliament. In the early days, 'broadcasting was regarded as a fad and was used purely as a means of entertainment. Nowi t is an essentia] public utility. Honourable members w i ll recall the days of the crystal sets, before the use of valves became general, and tbe early problems associated with tbe granting of licences, and with determining who should listen to the programmes broadcast by various stations. A conference that was been convened by tbe Postmaster-General's Department for the purpose of devising methods of issuing licences, and collecting fees, led to the introduction of the sealed set, which was a failure. To illustrate the progress of radio broadcasting, I point out that only 1,400 listeners' licences were issued in 1924, but this year tbe number is 1,324,000. Of course, the number of listeners substantially field. Among other exceeds tbe number of licences in force. The national broadcasting service is financed entirely from listeners' licencefees, but commercial stations depend for tbeir revenue almost entirely upon receipts from advertising. If advertising were eliminated, their revenue would be very small. When introducing this bill in the Senate, tbe Postmaster-General referred to tbe system of dual control of national and commercial stations, in these words:as tbe "" phantom From tlie investigations of the committee and one's own observations, I have no hesitation in declaring tiiat the present system has been beneficial to the development of broadcasting in Australia viewed from the interests of listeners, and apart altogether from the valuable advantages which have accrued to industry and employment. With the experience of thc last nineteen years to guide us and the valuable report of the committee to point the way to certain improvements, we are well equipped to write a charter for the broadcasting services of the Commonwealth which. whilst imposing safeguards against mis-use, will permit sufficient freedom to ensure continued progress for the benefit of the community. Not only will freedom in broadcasting achieve this objective, but it must also be a significant interpretation of the general freedom that defines democracy. As a part of its investigation, the committee obtained information regarding the broadcasting systems operating in other Empire countries witb a view to comparing their suitability for Australian conditions with tbe existing Australian system. SirH a r r y Brown, in his evidence before the committee, very aptly stated that, before any change was made in this country, it should first be demonstrated how tbe present system had failed. The position in GreatB r it a in is that the stations, eight in all, are under the control of tbe British Broadcasting Corporation. Listeners in GreatB r it a in have available to tbem many alternative programmes from Europe, and the extent to wbich these continental stations are listened to may be gauged from the fact that, up to the outbreak of war, English manufacturers found it worthwhile to spend £2,000,000 per annum in advertising from two English-controlled stations on tbe Continent, namely, Radio Normandie and Radio Luxembourg. Canada, the dual system operates, as in Australia, with tbe commercial stations under some measure of control of the Canadian which is the counterpart of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. mation was supplied to the committee, however, to show that tbe Canadian broadcasting system is neither one thing nor the other. Although a parliamentary committee recommended as far back as 1929 that broadcasting stations should be nationalized, because of the fear that otherwise they would be subject to control from tbe United States, even now there are only ten national stations in Canada, and the only practicable method of having a nation-wide broadcast is to utilize a large number of the privately owned stations. In Australia the position is entirely different, as tbe Director General of Posts and Telegraphs informed the committee that 85 per cent, of listeners are served directly at present by tbe national stations and that, when additional national stations which are proposed are completed, all listeners will be able to listen in direct to national stations. short-wave overseas programmes, are deCommercial stations serve 90 per cent, of listeners, and thus it will be seen that practically every listener in Australia is able to bave the choice of at least one alternative programme from either a national or a commercial station. Another feature of Canadian broadcasting is its dependence upon the United States of America for its programmes, and many Canadians are also regular listeners to the large American stations. In 1940, it was stated that 34 per cent, of programmes on Canadian stations originated in the United States, where the whole of the broadcasting stations are privately owned. The system in New Zealand was also investigated, but conditions in New Zealand and Australia are so different as to make any comparison of little value. In that dominion the government owns both the national and commercial staSir Charles tions, but there are only five commercial stations, and no attempt has been made to provide a commercial service in rural areas as has been done in this country. In addition, there are very few more listeners in the whole In of New Zealand than there are in Sydney. Further, New Zealand is almost wholly dependent upon outside sources for its programme material and, in 1940, AusBroadcasting Corporation tralian recording companies and broadcasting stations sold to New Zealand a Infortotal of 5,352 programmes. In Australia practically all programmes, excepting gramophone records, which are broadcast by either national or commercial stations are produced locally, thus providing considerable direct and indirect employment. In South Africa, the stations are national, only. . The system was inaugurated by a former chairman of the Britisli Broadcasting Corporation, but the service to the community cannot be compared with that received by listeners in this country. Stations are few and in some areas tbe programmes, of necessity, have to be in both the English and Dutch languages. The information which the committee obtained regarding these other systems, therefore, merely confirmed the fact that the present system is eminently suitable for Australian conditions, isolated as we are from other countries so that listeners, except for pendent upon the programmes from our own stations. The committee interrogated practically all witnesses as to whether or not tbey favoured nationalization. Tbere were quite a few criticisms, mainly on programme matter and the like, bnt, almost without exception, witnessesfavoured the continuation of the existing dual system and were opposed to any suggestion that the commercial stations should be nationalized or that they should be under the control of the Broadcasting Commission. Expert witnesses of the Postmaster-General's Department, inviews. Sir Harry Brown, the ex-Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, submitted that no reasons had been advanced for changing the present system. Evidence was also given Marr. to the committee of the pleasant relations",23,Beasle Y
111,"Cluding Mr Mcvey, Expressed Similar","existing between tbe Australian Broadeasting Coinmission and the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting stations. Ou most occasions, the national and commercial stations have their own particular spheres of operation, but, since even greater possibilities, though perhaps tbe war particularly, tbere have been numerous occasions when the two systems have operated together in the national interest so as to provide the fullest service to listeners. It can well be said that tbe have frequently seen pictures of events founders of the broadcasting system in this country showed a wide knowledge of Australian requirements, and the best evidence of the excellent manner in wbich tbe interests of listeners have been served in this country is that the committee after eight months of critical investigation has only found it necessary to formulate recommendations of a relatively minor character. In my opinion the committee's report has been submitted in a readable form. All the recommendations are at the beginning of tbe report instead of scattered through it, as is often the case witb reports of parliamentary committees. Tbe committee paid close attention to three matters closely allied to broadcasting, namely, television, facsimile, and frequency. People talk about those things freely, but without much knowledge. The committee's inquiries were not nearly so deep as we should bave liked, but, if tbe bill be passed and a standing committee be set up, those three matters will be further investigated. Tbe investigations will take a considerable time-probabl y years. I refer honourable members to page 69 of the report, in wbich the committee bas dealt with television. Television bas been operated in several countries since before tbe war, but up to the present it has been more, of a rich man's toy than a. means of public entertainment. Television will never become popular until it bas readied the stage at which pictures can bc transmitted over much greater distances than is possible at present. Television has no attraction for tbe woman in the home, who at present may switch on her radio set and listen to a musical programme without having to confine her entire attention to it. She could not do this with television, because it would then be necessary for ber to keep her eyes glued to the set so as not to lose tbe sequence of the fleeting pictures reproduced on its screen. Another brancli of the science wbich the committee considers to have greater dangers, than television is facsimile reproduction. Facsimile reproduction by means of radio and telegraph already operates. Honourable members in Great Britain published in the daily newspapers, or pictures of important race events sucb as the Melbourne Cup publisbed in the newspapers of other States on the following day. This is done by the use of a system of reproduction involving the application of wireless waves to pictures. The system may be developed for the benefit of ordinary householders, so that printed words and pictures may be sent into every borne by means of special apparatus attached to both the transmitting stations and receiving sets. It would be of particular benefit to residents of outback areas, who could turn on their radio sets 'before starting work each day and could return later to find miniature newspapers containing reproductions of reports 'and pictures published in the newspapers in the cities that day. . is looking far -ahead. is already in use in a small way. If an honourable member from Sydney wished to cash a cheque at >a bank in Western Australia where his signature was unknown, he could have it verified by communicating with his bank manager in Sydney and having a facsimile of his signature transmitted by radio. This system is not used extensively, but it is reliable. There are great difficulties in the way of bringing facsimile reproduction into tbe field of wireless broadcasting. Tbe committee stated, in regard to both television and facsimile reproduction, that, no further licences for the use of these sciences in broadcasting sbould be granted until the proposed parliamentary committee had inquired at length into them. I now refer to frequency modulation. Although these words may appear to convey a great deal to the uninitiated, those who understand wireless broadcasting realize that the problems involved in",25,Beasle Y
112,Mr Perkins,The honourable member,26,Beasle Y
113,. Sir Charles Marr,"The systemfrequency, modulation are very complex. There is much room for development in this field. The committee dealt with the subject very clearly in the following passage of its report:One of tlie great problems that face the Adminstration is the allocation of wavelengths for stations, there being a waiting list of 695 applications. Practically speaking, thc whole of those available have been allotted or set aside for a specific purpose. Evidence given discloses that thc difficulty can only be overcome by sharing the wavelengths now operating, restricting and sharing the times of operation, or by restricting power and, as far as possible, limiting the areas to be covered by individual stations. However, a new system has been evolved, known as frequency modulation, that may in the near future completely solve this problem. Evidence shows that this system is now applied in a moderate way in the United States of America, and, but for the war, may have been operating in Australia. Unfortunately, new types of transmitters and receivers will be necessary for those 'desiring to utilize this new method of transmission. Listening sets in the future will probably make provision for this by covering the tliree bands-sliort , medium and frequency modulation. (These sets are available to-day.) This system claims that many hundreds of additional wavelengths will be made available for new stations. However, we do not attempt to prophesy what will happen in radio development in the future, nor do we propose in this report to cover the technical difficulties that lie in tlie way of future expansion in radio. We recommend that no licences for frequency modulation stations be issued until a f u l l investigation has satisfactory. The position of the Ausbeen made by the proposed parliamentary standing committee. I believe that every honourable member has, at some time, taken an interest in the subject of copyright in relation to broadcasting, and I believe that I should be correct in saying that almost every honourable member regards tbe Australasian Performing similar organizations in other countries, as being monopolies for the collection of huge fees which ought to be payable to those persons wbo contribute, by writing and performance, to broadcast items. Tbe committee heard a great deal of expert evidence on the subject of copyright, and it visited the offices of the Australasian Performing Right Association. It was thus able to see bow returns are made by tbe broadcasting stations, the method of entering the performances of copyright music controlled by tbe Australasian Performing Right Association, and how the fees are paid to the composers, authors Sir Charles Marr. and publishers. In my opinion, tbe system of having one organization of composers, authors and publishers properly authorized to look after their performing rights is the only practical one. From tbe evidence that the committee beard, it seems that this principle is fully recognized in most parts of the world. It is not difiicult to see the logic of tbe case because, if broadcasting stations, relying as tbey do on the use of a vast quantity of music, bad to deal with individual owners of copyright all over the world, they would bave a job involving expense far greater than tbey are called upon to bear under tbe accepted method. The committee recommended that there sbould be an Australian fee payable to the Australasian Performing Right Association, but it did not suggest that this should be a fee for each listener's licence. This point needs to be made clear, because the arrangement between the Australasian Performing Right Association and the commercial stations, which has operated for many years, has been on the basis of a payment for each musical item broadcast. Thus, the commercial stations pay strictly in accordance with the quantity of music that they broadcastEvidence given to the committee on their bebalf was to the effect that their agreement, which bas some years to run, is tralian Broadcasting Commission, however, is different, because the commission receives its income from the listener's licence revenue, and, in this case, payment of a fee to the Australasian Performing Right Association for each licence would probably be satisfactory. Right Association, and The"" fee-per-licence"" system has onerated for many years in the United Kingdom, and it was confirmed by tbe finding of arbitrators, to whom the question of the amount per licence payable to tbe Performing Right, Society in London was voluntarily submitted for decision in 1937. In my opinion, the amount paid by both broadcasting services for the use of any of the music in tbe Australasian Performing Right Association repertoire is very small. Both in this House and elsewhere we have beard complaints that the Australasian Performing Right Association receives a very substantial sum of money annually, but the matter should be examined in the light of tbe number of stations using tbe music and the number of performances that they give. When that information is available, one sees, from the enormous volume of music that is broadcast, that the payment for each performance is almost beggarly. The inquiries of the committee revealed that the Australian writer wbo received tbe largest amount in any one year was paid only about £80 for bis work. Considerable numbers of composers and authors received amounts as low as 2s. 6d. for tbe year. That is doubtless due to the 'fact that Australian composers and authors are in a great minority. We discovered that tbey numbered less tban .1 per cent, of the composers and authors whose works were used. At one stage, early in its investigations, tbe committee considered that it might be practicable to recommend that broadcasting stations sbould use not less tban 10 per oent. of material derived from Australian sources, but it was not long before that opinion was revised. The committee has recommended that it should be compulsory for broadcasting stations to use 2-J per cent, of Australian material, but I fear that some difficulty may be experienced, in tbe immediate future at any rate, in reaching even that percentage. However, this is a step in the right direction which, no doubt, will encourage Australian composers and writers, for tbey will be helped by the knowledge that broadcasting stations will be obliged to use a greater percentage of Australian material than tbey have used in the past. Undoubtedly music is tbe most popular feature, and supplies, tbe bulk of all broadcast programmes. In fact, if music were not available tbe broadcasting stations would find it extremely difficult to maintain continuity of programmes. The committee was unanimously of the opinion that composers of music sbould be granted fair recognition and that, up to date, they had not received it. In making that statement, I do not suggest that the rights of the broadcasting authorities should be overlooked. As music is such an important factor in all broadcast programmes and therefore plays a big part in our community life, the broadcasting stations should be [05] protected against exorbitant demands from tbe controllers of music, especially as that control is practically in tbe hands of one organization. Legal provision has been made for voluntary arbitration where a dispute arises between broadcasters and owners of copyright music, and, as I see it, our act complies with tbe spirit of the international understanding that was approved at the Eome Congress in 1928, but the fact must not be overlooked that it is expressly provided that tbe fees fixed shall ensure adequate compensation to those concerned. That does not mean, I imagine, adequate compensation in a round sum, but reasonable payment to individuals whose rights are vested in one organization. Since the report of the committee has been made public I have been informed that it would be almost impossible for the broadcasting stations to obtain from the manufacturers of records in this country the supply of records that would be ner-.ded to maintain the quota of Australian music recommended by the committee. That aspect of the subject will doubtless require some investigation. Personally I believe that it will be practicable to obtain the 2£ per cent, recommended by the committee. If the supply of records is insufficient for this purpose at the moment, I believe that the records manufacturers in Australia will soon meet the position. tralian Broadcasting Commission manufacture its own records ? one firm in Australia is making records at present. Although tbe Postmaster General's Department has facilities for making recordings for the commission of speeches and otber broadcasts, it does not manufacture records in the ordinary sense in wbich we understand the term. I wish to refer briefly to the two systems of broadcasting in Australia. I shall deal first with the national system. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, wbich controls tbe national broadcasting stations, bas proved itself to be most efficient and, in my view, it has done excellent work. I speak in the broadest sense when I say that since its inception the commission bas done an excellent job. Personally, I give to the",26,Beasle Y

He bas endeavoured to place broadcasting on a high plane and, to a considerable degree, be bas succeeded. In this respect he and his fellow commissioners deserve our congratulations on the progress that tbey have made. Particularly good work has been done in tbe educational sphere. But whilst tbe commission's educational broadcasts have undoubtedly been most efficient, I regret to say that tbe facilities in educational, institutions for receiving and making use of the broadcasts are appallingly inadequate. practically free. Educational institutions are required, in certain instances, to proconnexion with appointments to the cure booklets to use in conjunction with the broadcasts, and these publications by the Australian Broadcasting Commission are also, excellent productions. It is not have an eqiual chance. Employees of the too much to say that the six members of the committee were deeply impressed by the quality of the educational broadcasts of the commission. They -were impressed, too, by the interest that has been aroused amongst school children in the performances of the symphony orchestra conducted by Professor Bernard Heinze. The committee attended several symphony concerts arranged in Melbourne by the commission,, and we were surprised to learn of tbe competition among children for selection to attend those concerts. Extraordinarily fine work has been done by the commission in this connection. Tbe organizing of these symphony concerts is a monument to the leadership of thc chairman of the commission. One clause of the bill provides for tbe establishment of the head-quarters of the commission at Canberra. The committee made a recommendation to that effect.. I consider that tbe head-quarters of our government services, and quasi-government services, should be at the National Ca.pital. The committee does not suggest that the Government sbould take immediate action to give effect to this recomPersons who are competent to speak on mendation. We are in the middle of a war-we hope beyond the middle of ifcbut we bave to look at everything with the war in mind. The committee considers that when tbe Government is in a position to make provision on the Estimates for the expenditure of a large, sum Sir Charles Marr. of money for the. establishment of tbe permanent bead-quarters of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission, the necessary buildings sbould be erected in Canberra and not in one of the State capitals. Tbe committee was told that undue influence was sometimes brought to bear on the commission to make appointments to its staff 'by back-door methods. For that reason, the committee recommended-and I am glad that tbe Government has accepted its recommendationthat in respect of all except the higher positions appointments to the Australian The broadcasts are made Broadcasting Commission shall be subject to the same procedure as obtains in Commonwealth.

Tbe report shows that the committee took some pains to set oufc for tbe information of honourable members the ramifications of the Department, particularly in connection with technical matters. contains a map of Australia, giving this information. Investigations were undertaken in order to ascertain where broadcasting stations should be placed in order to give the best results. The area served by each station is shown on the map. Honourable members may be interested to read in the report that whenever a national link-up of broadcasting stations takes place-and bhat happens several times each day-approximatel y 21,000 miles of wire is utilized, and 150 officers are in attendance. It was for that reason tliat the committee thought that the technical services of the commission should remain with the Postmaster General's Department. the microphone. sound arguments could be advanced in favour of the commission having its own technical service, it was thought that the opportunities for the promotion of talented men. would be small, and that there woulcl he too great a proportion of deadend johs. On the other hand, as the Post Office controls telephonic, telegraphic, and other technical services, not only are men able to receive good training in technical matters, but also opportunities many of the for advancement exist. From ibe Postmaster-iGeneral'is Department, trained men are frequently sent to various commercial broadcasting stations, as well as to national stations. These men are not debarred from rising to higher positions in the Postmaster-General'B Department. In this connection, I quote paragraphs 183 and 184 of the reportThe Post Office is a Commonwealth-wide W h a t about bringing organization. It has highly trained professional officers in all the main centres and it possesses a large staff of competent technicians who are also widely distributed. Because of the size and similarity of other technical work which has to be done by the Post Office, tliere is a reservoir of personnel on which to dramto meet all sorts of emergency conditions, providing also for holiday and sick relief. In addition, the Post Oflice has an extensive research organization in which problems presenting special difficulty are examined to find a solution, and a large proportion of these necessarily have a great similarity to those which have to be dealt with in the other technical branches of the department. Postmaster-General's The committee paid several visits to the laboratory of the Postmaster-General's Appendix 12 Department, and met the department's experts. Some day, this Parliament and the public of Australia may learn a little of the wonderful work that these men are doing in connection with the Empire'a war effort. Some of their achievements have been outstanding; they are of great value to the Empireand its allies. The activities of the department are not confined to Australia, If I were to single out one officer from, a body of men who greatly impressed every member of the committee, I should say that the officer in charge of tbe research laboratory, Mr S. H . W it t , is a man of outstanding ability. In saying that, I have no desire to do a wrong to otber capable officers. The department contains men who know inchiding their jobs and are a'ble to impart their knowledge to others. The report is not correct when it states that these various services are rendered free to the commission. I do not think that the Postmaster-iGeneral's Department supplies anything free. Tbe honourable membei' for Lilley( Mr Jolly), when giving evidence before the committee, emphasized the importance of the Postmaster-General's Department presenting to Parliament each year a financial statement which can be understood hy honourable members.

A portion of the revenue so obtained is placed in a trust fund, from which tbe Australian Broadcasting Gommission draws month by month. Tbe balance of the fund-about 50 per cent. -is paid into Consolidated Revenue. Each year tbe Postmaster-iGeneral's Department prepares estimates of expenditure for the ensuing year. Those estimates, which have to be passed by tbe Parliament, include payment for services rendered to tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission. tions that were made by me personally and by my coUeagues on the committee, I have come to tbe conclusion that the whole of tbe cost bas been borne by tbe listening public. It has paid tbe amount required to continue the extraordinarily efficient and, indeed, brilliant work that is carried on by the research laboratory of tbe Postmaster-General's Department to which I have already referred, for the examination of ships' licences at sea, for tbe examination of the operators, and for the general administration of the Radio Telegraphy Act under the department. Having discharged tbe whole of these obligations, the Consolidated Revenue has an unexpended balance of approximately £70,000. If tbe payment by the public be for a specific purpose, the expenditure should be devoted to that purpose. If it be unnecessary to charge £1 ls. for the payment of these services or programmes, the fee ought to be reduced, and the charge sbould be merely sufficient to meet the required expenditure. master-General's Department charges the commercial stations a flat rate a mile for the use of land-lines. Tbat, too, is in some degree a charge against the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The commercial stations themselves have to meet the payment, whereas tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission makes it out of the proportion of tbe listeners' fees wbich it derives from Consolidated Revenue. I agree with the evidence given by tbe honorahle member for Lilley( Mr claim was made by representatives of the Jolly), and hope that he will amplify it during tbe passage of the bill. Experts of the Postmaster-General's said in evidence that the accountancy staff would have no difficulty in. preparing a financial statement Sir Charles Marr. showing clearly what had been received and expended, and the manner in wbich tbe expenditure had been made. I i that could be achieved, it would be a step in tbe right direction. I blame not tbe department so much as all governments for the rotten system that is associated with tbe presentation of, not only the accounts of that department, but also all other accounts that are presented to Parliament, and are frequently camouflaged in order that honourable members and tbe public may not underErom all the investigastand them. Our accounts should be set out in a business-like way, so that the taxpayer may be able to understand how the money has been expended. This should be done also in regard to listeners' fees. Rightly or wrongly, the practice of having Commonwealth trust funds bas grown up. In the old days, when Parliament voted money for expenditure on the erection of buildings or lines of railway, any amount unexpended at the 30th June reverted to the Treasury, and a fresh appropriation had to be made for the continuance of the work, with tbe result that frequently six months of the ensuing financial year had elapsed before further funds were available. That was overcome by the payment into trust funds of the unexpended balances of funds voted by Parliament. In relation to broadcasting, trust funds sbould be established into which money could be paid and from which it could be drawn for whatever services were required. The PostI shall now deal briefly with tbe commercial stations. Evidence was placed before the committee of the excellent service provided for listeners by these stations. Tbeir primary function is to provide entertainment as an alternative to the programmes broadcast by the national stations. Much information was received regarding tbe coverage of the programmes broadcast by the commercial stations, demonstrating tbeir acceptability to the Australian public. Although no commercial stations, evidence given by impartial witnesses was to the effect that Department as many as 85 per cent, of the listeners regularly tune in to commercial stations. We had no means whatever of verifying that estimate, and it may be said to have been arrived at purely by guess work. Lt would be to the advantage of these stations to be able to say tliat tbey bave the patronage of 85 per cent, of the listening public, because advertisers would naturally he inclined to do business witb such a valuable advertising media. Mr .SCULLIN -Did the commercial stations advance anything in proof of chat statement? had conducted polls, which did not convince us that tbe percentage was either right or wrong. Tbe committee was given a great deal of information, apart from ihat in relation to lighter entertainment, of the varied nature of the programme matter which emanates from these stations. Many sessions are devoted to cultural music, drama, and the like. In addition, an extensive variety of programmes of educational value is broadcast. In tbe field of charity, the commercial stations of Australia have a highly creditable record. Statistics were .submitted showing the wide range of charities that have been assisted during recent years. These referred particularly to tbe aid given to the Eed Cross and otber war charities since the outbreak of war. Tbe estimate of the amount raised directly during that period 'is £272,000, hut that does not include the many appeals that have been assisted by these stations by means of free publicity. Tbe national stations cannot appeal over the air for money except in connection, with such national funds as war loans. The I'ommercial stations are not similarly restricted, and tbey have assisted appeals on bebalf of war loans and the Eed Cross to a marked degree. It is difficult to assess the value of the help that they have rendered to sucb organizations. Tbe evidence placed before us showed, as I have said, that tlie amount raised directly was approximately £272,000. The. Government has been assisted in many ways by tbe commercial stations, which bave willingly offered to it tbeir full co-operatiou. An estimate of the value of tbe free time voted to governmental services nlone is £250,000 per annum. If the commercial stations were nationalized, a greater amount of time could not be devoted to these purposes tban is already sriven. Apart from this support, the commercial stations have at all times assisted public departments, sucb as the Police and Health Departments; and they have also been used on many occasions for giving warnings of bush fires and floods. In all, their record of public servico has been very high. They bave formed themselves into a voluntary organization with the title "" The Australian Eederation of Commercial Broadcasting 'Stations"". The value of this body is shown by the fact that, with the exception of two small stations, all commercial stations are members of it. The committee was greatly impressed with tbe work done by this body in devising standards of broadcasting practice and, in general voluntarily imposing a system of programme regulation in the general interests of listeners. It published for the guidance of its members a brochure which insisted upon the observance of a very high code in the procedure followed by the different stations. It was most helpful to the committee, not only in submitting evidence on its own behalf, but also in assisting to procure evidence from otber sources. The commercial stations were just as keen as the commission to prevent anything of an objectionable nature from being put over tbe air. At the same time, tbey bave endeavoured to raise the standard of B class programmes to that of tbe national stations, which ia recognized to be very high, indeed. Members of the present Government as well as of tbe previous Government will recognize that the federation has always been prepared to give assistance whenever it has been asked to do so. Glowing tributes bave been paid to the federation's co-operation in that respect. Tbe committee was very unfavorably impressed with the general class of commentator engaged by all classes of stations. Tbe evidence was that very few commentators were worth their salt. Although the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) is present, I recall that some witnesses said, in effect, "" Since you left the Adelaide station, doctor, tbe whole service has gone to the dogs "". All members of tbe committee, representative of the three parties in tbe Parliament, worked in tbe greatest harmony witb the one objective of examining the subject of broadcasting thoroughly and devising the",30,Beasle Y
125,Sir Chables Maee,"No. They-best possible system in the interest of listeners. Tlie opinion of the committee -was that only experts should be engaged as commentators. they are experts. Sir CHARLESMARR W h i l e the committee was sitting it was impelled to recommend to the Government that certain classes of broadcasts by commentators sbould be rectified. I am glad to say that sucb action was taken immediately. Eor instance, we took records, for a certain period, of short-wave programmes, and found that portions of those programmes were very discreditable to the Commonwealth. They were not worth r.wopence. One of these programmes, which countries, including the United States of America, contained the effect that Canberra was being overrun by hares; that there was a plague of bares in Canberra, and that the rich coastal areas were infested with rabbits. [Extension of time gram,t,ed.\ The committee took exception to such programmes, and on its recommendation the Government immediately took steps to improve them with a view to broadcasting only matter wbicb would be of definite benefit to Australia. Generally, the committee was of opinion that the British Broadcasting 'Corporation's system of handling commentaries sbould be. followed, that is. that the matter broadcast be attributed not to any individual but to the particular government department concerned. For instance, such commentaries could be commenced witb the statement that tbe Department of the Army, or tbe Department of tbe Navy, reported such and such a thing. I can see no benefit in Mr Jones, OT Mr Smith, reporting something. Mr Jones's opinion is not of interest to the nation in regard -fco matters of national concern. Therefore, we have suggested that commentators sbould be very carefully selected, and that names should be eliminated wherever possible. For instance, tbe views of the Department of the Army, or the Department of the Navy, in respect to the recent attack by the enemy in Sydney Harbour, is of much greater interest, and, certainly more authoritative, individual. Mr .SPENDER -I s the committee of opinion that a statement should be broadcast not as a statement made by an i ndividual who is named., but as that of a member of the Government party, or tbe Opposition party? member of this Parliament speaks, say, at an afternoon gathering which is broadcast, and his speech is referred to that evening in tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission's news session, the gentleman is referred to as a member of the Opposition. Surely, it was never intended to extend anonymity so far? appeared to the committee that at one time members of tbe present Governare broadcast to overseas ment were vieing witb each otber to get on the air. I am not blaming only an item to members of this Government in that respect. bers' of the previous Governinent also do the same thing? Sir CHARLESMARR No t to tbe same degree. Our idea is that important statements dealing witb government activities should be broadcast as official statements; and that comment made by any honourable member in this House should be .given as that of a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. Does tlie particular party to which an honourable member belongs really matter in this .respect? honourable member think that every member's statement should be copyright? given by the committee to the nasal in tonation of certain speakers in children's broadcasts from both the A and B class stations ?

134,Sir Charles Marr,"As a matterconsideration to tlie character of children's broadcasts, not only from the educational aspect, but also from many other aspects.. Asmi l beseen from the committee's report, the committee takes a very serious view ef the broadcasting of doubtful jokes and stories. Such passages sbould be entirely prohibited; because broadcasts generally go right into tbe home. I agree with the. honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). Even up to as late as yesterday, I beard a children's broadcast, portion of which was to be deplored. Some doubtful jokes which are pufc over tbe air are, to say tbe least of them, discreditable to tbe stations concerned. The committee heard evidence from representatives of all church organizations throughout, the Oommonwealth. It fan be said to the credit of those bodies that not one witness who appeared on their behalf displayed bias of any kind. Tbe churches, generally, took an extraordinarily liberal view of our system of broadcasting as a whole, and unanimously declared that they had received fair treatment at tbe bands of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in respect of religous broadcasts. The committee took a serious view of tbe broadcasting of advertisnients on Sunday. It will be generally admitted that Sunday evening is the most popular time for listening in. grammes of the week are usually put over on Sunday evening. submitted to the committee was that all stations endeavour to put over their best programmes on Sunday evening. If good programmes are to be provided by commercial stations, tbey must be sponsored by some one, because advertising, revenue constitutes the only income which those stations receive. The committee was of opinion, however, thatdetailed advertising sbould not be permitted on Sunday. It should be sufficient to announce that the programme was sponsored by such, and such a firm. Mr SeTjT.r.iN -And there sbould not be too much reference to the sponsor, either. It was also felt that, in deference to relithe advisory committee recommended in gious bodies, advertising should not take place on Sunday mornings and evenings during church liours. Of coursein a free democracy such as ours, it is right that the people should be allowed to select their own programmes, and in Australia there are plenty to choose from. Tbere were, until quite recently, 98 commercial stations, and 29 national stations. AlthoughI have no interest in horseracing or dog-racing, I realize that I am not compelled to listen to broadcasts dealing witb those matters; I can switch over to something else. The present choice is very wide, and it should be allowed to remain as wide as possible. The committee did not spare itself, and travelled widely in order to bear witnesses from all parts of the Oommonwealth. It sat mornings and afternoons, and very often in the evenings as well. The work was most interesting, and I am sure, that all members of the committee found it so. We weire particularly well served by tbe officials of the Postmaster-General's Department and by thesecretary of tbe comanittee, Mr Groves, a quiet and efficient officer, who got through an extraordinary amount of work. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to him for the part which be played in tbe work of tbe .committee. We also received valuable assistance from officials of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and from the chairman:, Mr Cleary, who gave evidence for 32 hours. I do not think that we missed anything in our examination of him, and he had at his finger-tips all the information wbich we required. He demonstrated that he was a man of outstanding ability., wbo was filled with a desire to keep broadcasting on a high level. Mr Dooley, secretary of the Eederation of Commercial Broadcasting StatioiiSj. accompanied tbe committee to the various States, and was very helpful in supplying whatever information was required, particularly the balance-sheets of the commercial slatious.

We must remember that broadcasting touches the daily life of every man, woman and child in the country. No otber development of recent times is charged witb such power for good or evil as broadcasting, and we should consider very carefully before handing over all stations, both national and commercial, to the control of the State lest we bring about tbe position which now obtains in Germany. pened in England. small in area, and, Hke Canada, gets a great deal of its broadcasting matter from beyond its own borders. however, is not the case here.

( Mr Watkins) -Tb e honourable member's time has expired. gratulate tbe Joint Committee on Broadcasting upon its report, and upon tlie work which it has accomplished during tbe last eight months. The bill now before the House, which is based upon that report, places both the A and B class stations under tbe one legislative control. Previously, only the national stations came under the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act, tbe commercial stations being controlled by regulations. The honourable member for Parkes (' Sir Charles Marr) referred extensively to the report of the committee, but did not have a great deal to say about the bill itself. Tbe bill contains some novel provisions which should make for the better control bas not hapof broadcasting in Australia.

However, there is a proper time to concentrate administrative offices in Canberra, and the present is certainly not the proper time to transfer to this city the administrative offices of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because chat body is still in the experimental stage. There is a desire in certain quarters paid £650 and the other four members to transfer all Commonwealtb departments to Canberra but, no doubt, a number of departments can function more efficiently in tbe capital cities in -which receiving £300 each could hardly be exthey are now established. Tbat applies particularly to tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission because, being established in Sydney, it has ready access to leading theatrical agencies and artists. Another clause provides that tbe general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall attend all meetings of the commission. If bis office is in Sydney or Melbourne, the duty of attending meetings of the commission in Canberra would make a big demand on his time. I consider that Canberra would be the most unsuitable place in Australia for tbe establishment of the administrative offices of tbe commission while it is in the developmental stage. The office of the Commonwealtb Commissioner of Railways is not located at Canberra, because, I suppose, the railway system is developing, and greater efficiency can be secured by his office being situated nearer to tbe centre of development. If the commission is to be active in carrying out its duties it will need to meet at least once a month, otherwise the remuneration proposed to be paid by tbe Government to its members will not be justified. "" remuneration"" because payments to members of the commission are described in the bill as remuneration due, no doubt, to the fact that all will be employed part time on the commission's work. If the chairman of the commission is to be paid £1,250 a year and the commission is to meet only once a month, he will receive £100 for each meeting. The vice-chairman is to receive £500 a year and the other three members of the commission £300 a year each. As the bill provides that a majority of the five members of the commission is to prevail, the three members each receiving £300 a year, or a total of £900, could outvote tbe chairman and vice-chairman receiving a total sum of £1,750 a year. The total amount of remuneration proposed to be paid to tbe five members of the commission should be allocated more evenly, and I intend to move an amendment when the bill is in committee that the chairman shall be £500 each. If the administrative beadquarters of the commission were located in Canberra, the three commissioners pected to live in the Australian Capital because it is almost impossible to live here on £300 a year. Therefore, the commission would become a one-man show, tbe chairman dominating it and the otber four members merely waiting for him to summon tbem to Canberra. Therefore, as tbe other four members will perform almost tbe same class of work as the chairman, I consider that the amount of money to be provided as remuneration sbould be spread more evenly amongst the five members of the commission. present chairman of the commission? has recently been accepting reappointment for periods of four months on that basis. Under the terms of the bill, he is ""to be paid £1,250 a year, and appointed for a term of five years. As I said, three commissioners receiving £300 each would be able to outvote the chairman and vice chairman.

After the warwe should encourage famous artists to give performances in this country, and the commission should be permitted to charge admission to the concerts. Clause 24 prevents the commission from broadcasting advertisements, but I see no reason wby advertisements relating to charitable and patriotic activities sbould not be broadcast over the national stations. The same thing applies to hospital appeals.

The clause should also be amended by eliminating the words "" and the licensee of station because commercial stations are conducted for profit, and they sbould be dealt with separately in a special clause not grouped with tbe Broadcasting Commission. If amended in tbe way I bave suggested, sub-clause 1. would readThe commission shall give encouragement to the development of local talent and obviate restriction of the utilization of the services of persons who are competent to make useful contributions to broadcasting programmes. It is a pity that sub-clause 2 was included in. the bill, but as it bas been, it sbould be re-drafted to provide for a much greater proportion tban 2£ per cent, of the time devoted to the broadcasting of music. The national broadcasting stations are on tbe air for about 18 hours a day, and of that time about 11 hours is occupied in the broadcasting of musical items. Two and a half per cent, of eleven hours is about 15 minutes. The playing of "" Advance Australia F a i r "" occupies about 10 minutes a day. That leaves only 5 minutes in which it shall be compulsory for tbe broadcasting stations to encourage local talent. I now come to matters contained in the bill of which I approve. I agree that the Australian Broadcasting Commission's share of tbe listeners' licence-fee should be increased from 10s. to l is . per annum. I approve of the issue of free listeners' licences to tbe blind and to schools witb fewer than 50 pupils. I do not approve, however, of tbe extortionate prices that the schools bave to pay for their receiving sets. But that has nothing to do with this measure. I also approve of the granting of licences at half rates to old-age pensioners living alone. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. was started by the commission because certain interests desired to compel the commission to pay advertising fees for the publication of its radio programmes. Although the journal has resulted in a nnancial liability, there is no reason why it should remain so. It could, in fact, be made of great value to the national broadcasting system. Already it has proved a valuable adjunct to tbe activities of the commission, because it bas made known to tbe public happenings in the broadeach commercial broadcasting casting arena. By the introduction of new features, it could be made more attractive to the general public than it has proved in the past. If it were published on Friday nights in the capital cities, and included features sucb as a racing supplement, it would become most popular. As the commission now feels safe from political interference for a year or two, I trust that it will not suddenly stop tbe publication of the journal. I draw tbe attention of the House to the section of the report of the joint committee, at page 70, beaded "" Copyright"". In paragraphs 488 to 499 a resume is given of the historical position regarding copyright in Australia, and the effect of the copyright law on both tbe national and the commercial broadcasting stations is outlined. The subjects of copyright and of performing right bave been mentioned in this Parliament on many occasions, and a great deal of interest bas been shown in the matter. Having considered the activities of tbe Australasian Performing Right Association witb respect to broadcasting, I am convinced that some misunderstanding has arisen in the past with relation to the real functions of this organization. At present every commercial broadcasting station in Australia j>as a fee to tbe Australasian Performing Right Association in respect of each performance. Tbe rate is determined by the association, and each station is affected differently. The smaller stations in tbe country pay about 6d., and the rates range up to about 3£d. in respect of each performance broadcast by a metropolitan station. Tbe commercial stations are working under a harmonious agreement witb tbe association that was arranged without recourse to law. Thia mutual agreement is now operating satisfactorily, and it will continue in force until 1944. A different arrangement exists between the Australasian Performing Right Association and the national stations. Under an agreement reached by arbitration the commission pays a fee of",39,Beasle Y
173,Mr Sheehan,"The A.B.C. Weekly6d. in respect of each listener's licence. The association is required to receive only that sum and to distribute it amongst those who ure entitled to performing right fees. I consider that tbe arrangement macle with the commercial stations could easily be made with the national stations, and that thus a more satisfactory agreement than that now in operation could be reached. Sucb an arrangement would do justice to both the composers and the owners of tbe copyright in ihe performances broadcast by the commission. Tbe commission, claims that it is not possible to get sufficient Australian records because tliere are no establishments in Australia capable of recording performances suitable for broadcasting. The manufacture of a certain percentage of Australian records should be compulsory. Performing right associations are found in most countries, and tbey collect performing right fees under the various copyright acts. Those fees, less expenses, are paid to tbe owners of the copyright. It appears to me that the existence of such a central organization is of great benefit to authors and composers. Otherwise tbey woulcl not be able to collect their copyright fees, owing to tbe heavy expense that woulcl be involved, and, indeed, tbey would liave no knowledge of where tbeir productions were being played. At the committee stage I shall seek to have amendments inserted in several clauses of the bill. I favour the nationalization of broadcasting in Australia, but, as the Government has seen fit to introduce a bill dealing with both the national and the commercial stations under one nieasure, we sbould endeavour to make it as workable as possible. Parliamentary Committee is to be congratulated on the comprehensive survey that it has made of broadcasting generally. Its report, will be helpful in dealing During tihose five years the Postmasterwith this bill, and will provide valuable material for future reference. It is unfortunate that "" Mr Moms, tbe general manager of the commission, was not available to give evidence when the committee was making its investigations, because I believe that lie would liave been able to give testimony of much value. He was then engaged ou active service abroad and I am sure that I"" express the feelings of all members of tbe House when I say that we are delighted that he has returned to Australia safe and sound, after his trying experiences in Malaya. ""Wireless broadcasting has now passed the experimental Stage, and, in view of tbe important, part it plays in the life of the community, its control should be placed on a sound permanent basis. Australia, witb its wide spaces, is vitally interested in broadcasting. I shall confine my remarks on the bill to matters of finance and administration. I regret that this measure does not provide for an improvement of the financial set-up of the commission. At present financial control is divided between tbe commission and the Postmaster-General's Department. A portion of the revenue from licence-fees is paid to the commission, ancl tbe Postmaster-General's Department gets tbe balance. To ascertain tbe true financial results of broadcasting activities, it is necessary to amalgamate the profit and loss accounts of the commission with those of the Postmaster General's Department. Eor instance, for the year ended the 30th June, 1940, tbe latest year for which I have the official figures, the commission showed a net profit of £47,254. Tbat is not tbe whole story, as tbe department also made a profit of £13,256 from broadcasting. It would be interesting to review what has happened in recent years in the financing of broadcasting. The following table shows the profits made by tbe Postmaster-iGeneral's Department and the commission Tespectively, from 1936 to 1940:PostmastorAustralian year. Gcneral's Broadcasting Department.

174,Mr Jolly (Lilley) [8.7],The Joint,41,Beasle Y
175,Dr. Priok,Not wholly from wireless,41,Beasle Y
176,Mr Jolly,"That is so. I amI have previously urged that a comprehensive statement should be presented to Parliament annually setting out the total revenue received from licence-fees and details as to how the money is expended. At present it is impossible for the Parliament to review the accounts in connection with broadcasting, because it is not given an opportunity to do so. Tbe British Broadcasting Corporation shows in its annual report the total revenue received from licence-fees, and also tbe total expenditure, including technical expenditure; but in Australia we have two separate divisions of broadcasting. Personally, I advocate that this undertaking should be subject to tbe same budgetary control as other governmental activities, and that the commission should submit estimates for the approval of tbe Parliament each year. The practice of granting a lump sum to the commission and saying to it, in effect, ""Do tbe best you can with it "" , is unsound. I appreciate the fact that the commission, as now constituted, has a special charter, but I can see no justification for that. same way as every other governmental activity. I draw attention to tbe marked increases of tbe administrative expenses of the commission since the outbreak of the war. Tbe staff salaries, for instance, amounted to £42,000 in 1938-39, £56,000 in 1939-40, and £65,000 in 1940-41, showing an increase in two years of 33 per rent. On the other band the cost of programmes, including artists' fees, which represent the chief business of the commission has practically not been increased. The marked increase of administrative expenses calls for explanation, and emphasizes tbe need for a review by the Parliament of expenditure of this kind. Probably tbe increase is due to the cost of the A.B.C. Weekly, but that is not clear from the accounts. Tbe joint committee that investigated tbe matter bad something to say about the administration as far as tbe permanent staff is concerned, and suggested that there should be an investigation; but I think that it would be in the best interests of the commission, and of tbe service generyear, according to tbe parliamentary ally, if the permanent officials were brought under the Public Service Act. Thare is no reason wby there should be any differentiation between the commission's employees and public servants. This state of affairs may create precedents wbich will cause difliculties and friction within the public service. I now draw attention to clauses 36 to 38 of the bill, which provide that tbe commission may issue debentures, subject to the approval of the Government. Tbis provision should be deleted from tbe bill. It is unnecessary, because any loan money required by the commission could be provided through the loan estimates in tbe same way as funds for other governmental activities are provided. There should not be any distinction between tbe loans funds required by the commission and those required by the Postmaster General's Department, tbe Commonwealth railways, and other trading concerns of the Commonwealth. The fact that tbe commission is working under a special charter does not affect tbe matter. I sbould like to be informed whether tbe issue of debentures vn this way comes under tbe control of the Loan Council, which exercises control over both Commonwealth and StateI t sbould be treated in tbe borrowings. In my opinion, the special powers to be given to tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission by this bill will place it beyond tbe control of tbe Loan Council. I concede that there may be good reasons why the commission sbould borrow money in order to carry on its work and provide expensive capital assets, but this loan expenditure should come under tbe supervision of Parliament. I refer now to the A.B.C. Weekly. 1 appreciate the circumstances which led to tbe publication of this journal, but tbe experience of tbe last two and a half years impels me to call for close scrutiny of its affairs by this Parliament. After investigating its finances and the results that it bas achieved, I say without hesitation tliat it has been a costly and futile experiment. It bas utterly failed to fulfil tbe purpose for which it was established. Tbe loss sustained on its publication to the 30th June, 1941, was £70,144. ancl tbe estimated loss for the current committee's report, is £30,000, which will make a total loss of £100.144. Tbis works out at the rate of £750 a week since the inception of the journal. understand that the rate of loss has now been reduced to about £600 a week, but, unfortunately, the circulation bas also been reduced This shocking loss would not be so serious if tbe journal were an effective means of keeping listeners in touch with the programmes. However, owing to the limited circulation, it is practically useless for this purpose. Fewer than 3 per cent, of licence-holders receive the journal. Tbere are 1,300,000 licensed listeners in Australia and, according to the committee's report, the journal's circulation now amounts to 37,000 copies weekly. How many honourable members of this House, or their families, ever refer to this journal in order to study the wireless programmes? However, assuming that every person who subscribes to the journal uses it for the purpose of studying tbe radio programmes, the faet remains that only 3 per cent, of licence-holders subscribe to it . ness who was heard by the parliamentary committee favoured the continuation of the journal. were interested parties. member consider that it is good business to spend this tremendous sum of money on a journal wbich only three out of every 100 licence-holders ever read? money in that way than to pay it to the newspapers in advertising charges for the insertion of programmes. cost of advertising tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission's programmes in the leading newspapers of our capital cities and principal country towns would be £90,000 a year.

I bave confined my remarks on this occasion largely to tlie financial aspects of the commission's operations, and I greatly regret that provision has not been made for an improvement in its financial "" set-up"". Apparently the present arrangements between the commission and the Postmaster-General's Department in respect of financial matters are to be continued, under which the commission receives a part of the licence-fees, and the Postmaster-General's Department the balance of tbem.

I regard this as an essential reform. support, the bill and congratulate tbe Government upon having introduced it. I also congratulate the joint committee upon whose comprehensive and exhaustive report the measure is largely founded. Broadcasting has made remarkable progress, as we must realize when we remember tliat tlie first public broadcasting demonstration was given at the Melbourne Exhibition building during 1920. were 3,400 licensed receiving sets in Australia; to-day the number is about 1,324,000. Tbat means that in SO per cent, of the homes in tbe Commonwealth radio receiving sets are to be found. Broadcasting in Australia gives employment to 15,000 people, and represents an expenditure of £20,000,000. That is a wonderful development within tbe space of less tban a score of years. When we cast our minds into the future we are astounded at the possibilities; we see in imagination not only television on a much more universal scale than at present, but also telepathy-the transference of thought-by means of radio. At the moment that may appear to be fantastic, but it is something that cannot be ruled out as an impossibility. At first, broadcasting was thought to be a toy; it is now a healthy recreation for the tired body and. jaded mind. It bas become a medium for tlie transmission of news and views. In times of national stress, like the present, radio broadcasting is used to maintain tbe morale of the people. In the Axis countries it is used for propaganda purposes; tbe voice of tbe controlled radio is tbe only voice that the people are allowed to bear. For weal or woe, broadcasting bas come among us; like gunpowder, whicli can be a blessing or a curse, much depends on bow it is used. Broadcasting is a valuable social amenity, especially to people living in remote and isolated places. To many whose lives are spent in tbe far-flung distances of this laud, radio brings many of tlie amenities of life. Most important of all is tbe possibility of using the radio to educate the nation, and it is on this phase that I desire now to speak. I adjunct to education. It is not a substitute for tbe teacher or tbe instructor. The human mind can best be stimulated and inspired by the influence of a greater mind-on e carefully attuned to the mind of the pupil or student. Let us consider broadcasting as an adjunct to education. Among English speaking peoples, there is practically no definite standard of speech, although the recognized standard is usually that of the public school man, and, of course, the Oxford Dictionary. In France, before tbe war, tbe AcademyI n 1924 there decided the correct form of speech. I regard the radio as a means of establishing a satisfactory standard of speech. It should be used more for that purpose. Honourable members know that the impression and tbe expression are complementary. Mental impression and oral expression are the reverse and the obverse of the same shield. 'We should be careful of what is put over the air. At times we hear a lot of rubbish and words which no educated person would, use. In this connection, great care sbould be taken in choosing tbe persons who are to do tbe broadcasting. Tliey sbould bave a sound cultural background ; tbeir speech sbould be beyond reproach; tbe vowels sbould be pure and the consonants distinct; the intonation,",45,Beasle Y

If we want to know a person we have only to induce bim to open bis mouth. Just as the age of a horse or a sheep is ascertained by an inspection of the mouth; just as we prove whether or not a snake is poisonous by looking into its mouth or by putting our finger there; just as we visualize the size of animals which lived thousands of years ago by examining their jaws, so we judge people by what tbey broadcast over the radio. We sbould be most careful that we maintain a high standard of broadcasting in the interests of our young people. We must use the radio as a great purifying for our people. cient to give to tbem just what they would like. Tbe word "" broadcasting"" brings back to my mind incidents of over half a century ago, when I used to watch my father broadcasting wheat. First be made careful preparation; be selected tbe best grain available. Then he sifted it to get rid of tbe impurities. After that, he steeped it in blue-stone-to-day we would say "" copper sulphate ""-and then he broadcast it. He was careful to distribute the seed evenly over tbe ground. Sometimes he was rewarded with a good crop. The purpose of steeping the seed in blue-stone was to prevent smut. Similarly in wireless, I bold that every precaution should be taken beforehand to see that no smut is broadcast. bas wrought a peacef ul revolution. Printturn of the dial should bring to us the ing led to the Eenaissance in Europe; it brought education to tbe people. Someone bas stated, that in printing, ideas are imprisoned behind the bars of tbe printed page. Oral speech may be regarded as the most natural way in which to convey thought from one to another. Speech is more natural than printing. From tbe very dawn of consciousness, oral speech moves us. Speech is used to convey not only our deepest and finest thoughts, but also tbe lowest ideas that come to our mind, as well as all tbe variations in between-tbe overtones and the undertones. members will agree that oral speech has been greatly neglected in our schools, the reason being that educational Mr Baker. standards are tested usually by means of see in the bill that appointments to the staff of tbe commission are in future to follow competitive examinations similar to those held for entrance to the Commonwealth Public Service; but more than that is needed. Tbere should be also a personal interview. Music also is broadcast. I hold that only music of tbe highest standard should be broadcast. There are some who say that the people cannot understand good music, but I bold that such music has .the power to make itself understood by even the weakest and dullest mind. Its rhythm medium is speech that every one. can understand It is not suffibecause it is based on tbe heart beat. A ll this talk about not understanding good speech or music, that it is above the beads of tbe people, should be ignored. I would rather that music or speech be above our heads than under our feet. It has been said that "" Tbe band that rocks the cradle rules tbe world"". What rubbish! In many instances tbe hand that rocks the cradle muddles and addles the brain of tbe child. It is because that has happened in so many instances that the world is experiencing its present troubles. The band that rocks the cradle does not rule tbe world; tbe band that turns the radio dial does so. Just as in Midsummer Night's Dream the fairies came when a wand was waved, so in every home in Like printing, broadcasting wbicb tbere is a radio receiving set a cream of tbe world's thought.

A substantial step towards tbe nationalization of broadcasting services bas been made, because tbey will be placed completely under government control. Tbe Government proposes to implement 35 of the recommendations by means of legislation, and the remainder by reguin regard to the staff of tbe commission, lation, or through tbe administrative machinery that is to be established and the parliamentary committee that will exercise an oversight of broadcasting from time to time. I disagree witb tbe honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) in regard to the appointment of a standing committee. That is a step in the right direction. There should be standing committees to deal with many other matters which come under the jurisdiction of various Ministers, in order that provided by local artists. The spirit of the actions of tbe Administration may be closely scrutinized on bebalf of this Parliament and tbe community. Tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission will not be answerable to tbe people, because its members are appointed for fixed periods. The proposed parliamentary committee, however, will be answerable to the Parliament and tbe people; consequently, the whole of tbe administration in relation to broadcasting will be on a completely democratic basis. In addition tc providing for full government control, tbe bill is designed to restrict the monopolizing of broadcasting stations. In the past, certam interests have owned or controlled a chain of broadcasting stations throughout tbe continent. As a first step in the establishment of tbe administration, the committee recommends that its bead-quarters shall be at the national capital. Tbe committee has thus set a worthy example, which might well be followed in otber directions, with a view to making Canberra the national capital in reality, as was intended by the framers of the Constitution. Clause9 deals with the term of appointend of this financial year. The joint ment of the commission. It is not desirable that persons sbould be appointed to administrative posts at high salaries for long periods; that is not democratic. With an all-party parliamentary committee in control of broadcasting, this administration should be answerable to Parliament from year to year, as tbe directors of a public company are answerable to its shareholders. The bill proMr Morgan. vides for re-appointment in rotation every two years. In my opinion, every member of the commission sbould be obliged to submit himself for .re-appointment either annually or biennially. Clause 17 lays down certain provisions one provision being that only British subjects shall be eligible for appointment to it. That seems a very narrow and parochial attitude to adopt, particularly in a country like Australia, wbich needs more population and the best brains that are obtainable in the world. I appreciate that some consideration sbould be given to local talent. It is provided that a certain proportion of the programmes shall be that prdvisiou should be followed in connection with the administration. Tbe commission should not be restricted to the appointment of Australian citizens, or persons of British descent, particularly as the United nations are fighting side by side for tbe one cause. When peace is achieved, many of the citizens of our allies may wish to migrate to Australia. To enact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall not employ on its staff any of tbe citizens of sucb countries would be contrary to the spirit of tbe Atlantic Charter. The position might well be met by laying down certain general principles, and leaving scope for the exercise of discretion by the administration. I feel impelled to move to have the bill amended in that direction. The honourable memher for Lilley bas analysed the financial position of the A.B.C. Weekly. It is quite proper that be sbould do so, and that this House sbould satisfy itself in regard to tbe basis on wbich that journal is being conducted. As tbe honourable member bas pointed out, thc loss on it may reach £100,000 by tbe parliamentary committee has indicated that it is not entirely satisfied, and has stated that the position of the journal will be reviewed from time to time.

It is not in the general interest of tbe community that advertisements on matters affecting health, or talks of a scientific nature, must be referred to one individual who may have his own ideas on these particular subjects. Tbe committee recognized this fact because in paragraph 434 of its report, it states. . . In making this recommendation we desire to point out that certain unregistered health practitioners, such as osteopaths, have sometimes been in advance of medical practice, and we recommend that there be no prohibition of advertisements by chiropractors, osteopaths and similar practitioners unless their work is prohibited by legislation. So far as I can ascertain, this bill does uot give effect to that recommendation. If tbe Minister is not prepared to do so, I shall submit an amendment those lines. It is important to bear in mind that the trend to-day is to give to orthodox medical practitioners a complete monopoly of health services. Tbat trend is apparent in not only this but also throughout the world. tbe last year or so, a prosecution was launched in the United States of America under against the American Medical tion, wbicb is the equivalent of tbe British Medical Association; number of medical societies and practitioners for certain conduct wbich had tbe object of obstructing tbe operations of certain co-operative medical Similarly, action has been taken in some of the States of tbe Commonwealth place the control of health completely in the hands of orthodox medical practitioners. are entitled to preserve tbeir rights. However, in tbe past, many lay have been well ahead of tbe times in their particular field. This fact is pointed out by tbe committee in its report. in the Australian osteopaths allowed to practise their science, although they are allowed to do so in most of tbe States, as well as in most other countries, and their service is legally throughout the United States of America. 1 admit that in tbe Australian Mr Morgan. Territory no serious obstacle is placed in their way; but tbe fact remains that their operations are not legalized. When a medical bill was introduced a couple of years ago, in the Parliament of New South Wales a provision similar to this was recommended, in order to preserve the rights of these classes of lay practitioners. On that occasion a definite undertaking was then given by the then Minisler for Health, Mr Fitzsimons, that that would be done. However, it was provided that regulations enacted under that measure must be approved by both Houses; and, unfortunately, tbe Upper Chamber so mutilated those regulations that these lay practitioners are now prevented fro m advertising tbeir science through the press. The State was unable to prevent such advertisements from being broadcast, because it has no jurisdiction over broadcasting. It seems to be most undesirable, therefore, that this along Parliament should now prohibit these classes of lay practitioners from advertising tbeir science. ""Within science.

She had to overcome many obstacles in order to explain ber treatment to tbe community. If tbe provision in this measure dealing with medical advertisements and talks be adopted, the work of discoverers of cures of this kind may be seriously hampered. Good health is life itself; it is tbe basis of human existence. Tbe trend to-day is towards the prevention rather than the cure of diseases. I appreciate tbe views which tbe committee apparently had in mind with respect to the advertising of patent medicines and quack remedies. Many years ago, a committee appointed by this Parliament exposed the patent medicine racket. It revealed that quack remedies, wbich actually cost a few pence, were retailed to the public at exorbitant prices. At the same time many remedies usually placed in this class may be efficacious; otherwise, tbey would not be so generally sought after by the public. If sucb matters are placed completely under the control of tbe orthodox medical profession, people may not be able to buy patent medicines without first securing a prescription from tbeir medical advisers. Thus, sucb. medicines may cost the public the usual consultation fee of 10s. 6d. in addition to the usual retail price of from 2s. 6d. to 5s. a bottle. meinber say that tbe safeguard of appeal to the Mmister is not sufficient?

Under this legislation the Director-General of Health will be a virtual dictator, able to prescribe what people may buy and what tbey may not in tbe way of medicine. Only recently, when tbe question of white bread as a healthful food was under discussion, the Director-General of Health said thai be did not regard the issue as important: indeed, tbe Minister for Health said that the Director-General had not given much thought to it, but he inclined to the belief that white bread was a satisfactory article of diet. Nevertheless, we know that Sir Raphael Cilento is of opinion that white bread is definitely harmful, an opinion which is shared by tbe King's physician, Lord Horder. There is also a sharp cleavage of opinion on the vexed question of immunization. Perhaps that is wby this provision has been included in the bill. We know that some directors of health have fixed ideas on the subject, and are anxious that all children sbould be immunized against certain diseases, but a great many people think that the whole thing is just a commereial racket. As a matter of fact, a petition signed by 58 members of the medical profession practising on the Island of Guernsey stated that, in tbeir opinion, immunization against diphtheria was valueless. I do not propose to enter the controversy, or to say whether immunization is good or bad, but I do think that both sides of very well, to say that the Minister will be able to bear appeals, but we know thai in practice be will be guided by his expert advisers. tbe term "" medical"" as used in the bill tain methods of treatment ought not to be Health in New South Wales because be",51,Beasle Y

During 1.93S-39, no fewer than 263 musicians were f u l ly employed on the national network, besides many hundreds of others who received casual employment. One of the greatest achievements of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was the inauguration of public concerts, which have done more than anything else to raise cultural standards in Australia. -concerts cannot be over estimated. Being far removed from tbe cultural centres of Europe, Australians did not develop a high standard of music. We were content to rely on our own products, and we were not influenced as are tbe people of Europe by the penetration of music and -culture from a-country a few miles across the border. When the commission inaugurated the celebrity concerts, it conferred a great boon upon the music-loving people of Australia. The concerts made the appreciation of the celebrities by teachers and students more pronounced ancl gave an opportunity to students and teachers to study tbe technique of musicians who are in the highest class of tbe music world. Moreover, the commission rendered a -distinct service to the music-loving public, who, possibly, would go to see a celebrity at a concert, but would not listen to tbe music of that celebrity without visual contact. Even though these celebrity concerts attracted large crowds, tbe commission made it possible for people to see for themselves the technique of the artists. Tbe concerts also assisted broadcasting itself considerably because the advertising publicity did more to popularize broadcasting than any other effort. The commission provided for tbe listening public something which could not -otherwise bave been given, to it without direct contact with the magnetism and technique of tbe artist. Tbis innovation resulted in huge money surpluses accruing to tbe commission and proved that this field if further exploited by tbe commission would result to its advantage. of celebrity concerts voiced in this chamber it is interesting to note that tbe surplus gained by the commission from the celebrity concerts was £2,000 in 1936, £9,000 in 1937, £17,000 in 1938 and about £32,000 in 1939. These results proved conclusively that the commission had struck a chord in tbe hearts of the Australian music-loving people. This enterprise had another effect. Being so far removed from Europe, we are subject to tbe exploitation of celebrities by entrepreneurs. Formerly tbey brought to Australia from overseas one or two celebrated artists a year, but when tbe comThe educational value of these mission inaugurated this enterprise, it co-operated to a marked degree witb entrepreneurs and succeeded in establishing a demand in Australia for vocalists and musicians, with resultant benefit to this country. I would direct the attention of honourable members who bave criticized the commission for its failure to make use of Australian artists to the fact that entrepreneurs bad neglected to engage local singers and musicians for concerts, -and had thereby failed to give them an opportunity to be heard by the Australian public. Tbe figures that I shall quote ought to convince honourable members that the commission took advantage of this neglect. I shall give the figures for 193S-39, and I bave taken that period because it was the year prior to the outbreak of war, as since then a proper comparison could not be drawn between Australian and foreign artists. During 1938-39, about 90 per cent, of the salaries disbursed by the commission were paid to Australian artists; 66 per cent, of the material, that is the script, for every programme was produced by tbe commission in Australia and 75 per cent, of the musical comedies and revue hroadcast over the national network was the work of talented Australian writers and artists. From 1936 to 193S the commission brought to Australia from overseas a number of Australian artists. There is no need for me to elaborate this point, but I think that tbe figures are convincing. Notwithstanding tbe engagement by tlie commission of local artists, it imported seven Australian artists between 1936 and 1939, and made it possible for In view of the criticism the Australian public to listen to musicians of their own blood playing to them and rendering items that had charmed the ears of cultured music-loving people in Europe. question of transportation than importation? hare been content to remain in Europe where tlieir talents were appreciated and where they received large salaries. artists before they were imported. issue with the honourable member on that fine point. In addition to importing seven Australian artists, tbe commission brought to Australia in the same period twelve foreign artists. When the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) -spoke in somewhat disparaging terms of the artists brought to Australia by the commission and described them as second-rate, I challenged him to name them, but he could not. Among the twelve foreign artists brought to Australia by the commission were Lotte Lehmann, Tauber, Kipnis, and Dupreartists in the front rank of music in Europe. It would have been impossible lor us in Australia to have beard those great artists had the commission not afforded us the opportunity to listen to them and to study tbeir technique. In the celebrity concerts, 24 local soloists were engaged, and tbe commission sent on tours of tbe Commonwealth 190 local artists who otherwise might have languished in their home towns or perhaps have bad tbe good fortune to bave an occasional concert promoted for tbem in a large city. I think that I bave furnished sufficient information to convince critics that the commission has made available to Australian artists tbe whole of its organiunderstood tbe full value of tone, volume zation and made it possible for them to become known in tbeir own country. Therefore, I suggest that before ill informed criticism is levelled against the commission, honourable members should study this trend of the commission's policy. I cannot understand the Joint Committee on Broadcasting passing over, and I! cannot understand wby the Minister has failed to take heed of the necessity for giving the commission more control of the technical side of broadcasting. The technical side of broadcasting in Australia has passed beyond tbe experimental stage, in which it was necessary for tbe commission to move cautiously. AlthoughI appreciate tbe technical knowledge of the technicians of the Postmaster-General's Department, I consider that tbe commission should bave full control of tbe technical service, to the point of output. I bave heard honourable members and listeners outside Parliament criticize the commission's broadcasting performances as compared with those of tbe commercial stations. These critics bave claimed that the technique of broadcasting has been brought to a fine art by the B class stations, but tbe technique of the A class stations has been crude. There might bave been some ground for the criticism in tbe first stage of broadcasting, but a marked improvement has been noticeable in recent years. Until such time as the commission is given control of tbe technical service to tbe point of output, it will be at a disadvantage. Technicians trained in tbe Postmaster-General's Department are not musicians. They do not understand the modulation necessary to get the full expression out of tbe music broadcast. Lacking an appreciation of tone and harmony, they cannot give full expression to the modulation of music put over the air. able member give one instance where the technicians of tbe Postmaster-General's Department have failed? commission can pronounce where tbe technicians on tbe control board bave failed or succeeded. If a person who and harmony were in charge of the control board, much better results would be obtained than if control were left in the hands of technicians possessing no appreciation of tone and harmony. There is that undefinable something which nobody but a musician can achieve, and it is the difference between a musical genius and a musical hack. I am opposed to the method set out in the bill for the setting up of a standing committee and an advisory committee to report to the Minister. In my opinion, the result will be chaos.

Frankly, I do not know how tralian Broadcasting Commission because he administers the act, hut he will exercise no real power over that body. I can visualize what will happen. A standing committee on broadcasting will be appointed witb power to investigate any matter affecting broadcasting, and will submit its conclusions to Parliament. When the Minister receives the report, he might feel it incumbent upon him to make tbe evidence available to tbe advisory committee. Tbe advisory committee, after taking precisely the same evidence as that which tbe standing committee beard, will report to the Minister. be a seer to foretell that the standing committee will investigate tbe conditions in every State. As a former member for Bourke, the late Mr Anstey once said, the committee will go north in winter-time and south in summer-time. It will take evidence here, tbere and everywhere, and tbe Minister will submit its report to the advisory committee concerned. will then examine the conditions in their respective States, and make tbeir several reports to the Minister. Tbe next step will be that the Minister will present the reports to tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission, wbich will examine them and, by an exercise of its powers relating to all matters appertaining to broadcasting, will disregard them. When that occurs, the Minister will be obliged to introduce amending legislation. Thus we can expect a procession of bills, because of the conflict of opinion which must exist between tbe standing committee, which will poke its finger into every matter associated with broadcasting, the advisory committee that will advise the Minister, and the commission, wbicb will exercise its powers under the act. .From the welter of reports and recommendations, absolute chaos will arise. Members of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission will certainly earn their salaries, and tbe unfortunate chairman, who will receive £1,500 a year, would not be overpaid if that sum were increased by £1,000 per annum. I also express my deep sympathy with tbe unfortunate general manager, because he will have tc accept responsibility for the general he will be able to carry on, as the burden will be almost insupportable. The Minister sbould give serious consideration to this subject. If he were empowered to direct the Australian Broadcasting Commission to do all tbe things which will be submitted to him, he would have to bear tbe responsibility. Buti f that power is not vested in him, it is obvious that the commission is not likely to act upon the recommendation of the multiplicity of committees. In my opinion, tbe listeners' licence-fee is satisfactory. Indeed, it is a handsome fee, and will cover everything that must One does, not bave to be met under tbe term ""broadcasting"", both technical services and entertainment. A handsome surplus has been paid into Consolidated Bevenue from the operations of tbe Postmaster-General's Department, and intotbe reserves of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, from which it must raise money to provide suitable studios, a high standard of entertainment and equipment. The imposition of an adTbe advisory committee ditional fee for every additional radio set in the home or in a motor car will not popularize broadcasting. The tendency is for the Government to make more and more use of this essential service, and in the circumstances every effort sbould be made to popularize it. Why should the Government place an additional impost upon any person wbo wishes to purchase another radio set ? It would be interesting to ascertain how many Australians are employed in the manufacture of radio sets, and tbe value of Australian material that has heen used in tbe manufacture of equipment. Yet this Commonwealth Labour Govornment, which is supposed to protect Australian industry and the Australian worker will, by this legislation, impose upon the industry a disability of the first mcignitude that will discourage tbe purchase of additional sets. The average person now resents the payment of tbe present licence-fee of 20s. a year, and will be distinctly hostile towards tbe proposal to compel him to pay an additional 10s. per annum if be happens to instal another set in his home or in his motor car. The additional payment cannot be justified. Tbe Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Drainage Board in Sydney does not base its charges upon the number of taps in a house; the Sydney County Council does not charge for every electric light switch in a building; and a gas company -does not charge for every gaspoint in tbe home. In modern blocks of flats or in hotel suites, people should have the opportunity to tune in to any broadcasting stations that tbey choose. I do not refer to a loud speaker in each room which broadcasts the programme received by a master set in the building. What would happen if the Sydney County Council were to impose a charge for every switch that controlled a refrigerator in every flat in Sydney? the position now? tricity is supplied from the power point, and a flat rate is charged for the electricity that is consumed. The Sydney County Council does not charge for the switch that controls the operation of the refrigerator. The Government will not popularize radio, stimulate the manufacture of sets, and increase the employment of Australian labour andtbe consumption of raw materials if it persists with its proposal to impose this additional charge. Like other honourable members, I am not satisfied with the present national news broadcasts. I agree witb the report of the Joint Committee on. Broadcasting that as soon as possible,' the Australian Broadcasting Commission should obtain a new agreement with the controllers of the news services. Being the national service the Australian Broadcasting Commission sbould bave power to take its news from tlie most suitable sources. I visualize news ""flashes"", not at prescribed times, and of a stilted nature so as 'be paid to the press for a service which, not to interfere witb the sale of newspapers, but of national moment to the people. The control that is at present exercised by tbe press over news services sbould be examined, because tbe sooner a new agreement can be made between the Australian Broadcasting Commission and tbe press, the better it will be for the public. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr tage of the press to discount tbe Jolly) spoke at length about the A.B.C. Weekly, but it is obvious that he did not -appreciate the real, position. He stated that, be did not criticize ihe present Government because it was not in office when tbe journal was first published; but the honourable member could not, witli justification, criticize airy government in respect of the launching of the journal. He should criticize Parliament, because it vested in the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission the right to publish the journal, ancl the .Joint Committee on Broadcasting rightly drew attention to that fact. which the honourable member was a Minister approved of it. given by 'Cabinet. In a statement to tbe House, I said that Cabinet would take no action to prevent the Australian Broadcasting Commission from exercising the powers that Parliament had conferred upon it. The honourable member for Melbourne was not a member of the House at that time, and did not know the circumstances that led up to the publication of the journal. Unfortunately, I was not one of those who gave evidence before the Joint Committee on Broadcasting, but the whole history of this journal is of such moment that it should be thoroughly discussed at this juncture. The first Minister to take any direct action in regard to the A.B.C. Weekly was the former Postmaster-General. He took action because the Australian Broadcasting Commission bad been threatened by the press that advertising rates would be charged for the publication of the commission's programmes on and after a certain date. The commission regarded that threat as a direct challenge, realizing that about £90,000 of listeners' fees would have to until then, had been regarded as having a definite news value. The commission realized that there was something more in the matter than a mere request for tbe payment of advertising rates for tbe publication of programmes; it realized that tbe press had wide interests in the commercial stations and in other similar publications, and that it was to the advannational stations as much as possible ancl thereby increase their own advertising revenue.

I shall not recapitulate the threats that were made to me then, nor tbe action which was subsequently taken by the commercial stations in an endeavour to carry out those threats at election time. Neither 1"" as Postmaster-'General nor tbe Government of wbich I was a member, would take any action to prevent tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission fro m exercising its rights under tbe act, and I venture to say that had I or the Government had the temerity to bow to these magnate?, and to seek to prevent the commission from exercising tbe privilege .conferred upon it by Parliament, Parliament would not bave tolerated it for a moment. "" honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) was that, regardless of the history of the matter, tbe A.B.O. Weekly was operating at a loss and not giving the service that ii; should give. that point. I was merely endeavouring to put the honourable meinber for Lilley right because by saying that be did not criticize this Government be implied that he did criticize the previous Government in regard to tbe publication of this journal. Obviously no criticism can be levelled at any government for refraining from taking action; Parliament invested certain rights in tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission and no government would have taken those rights away. Tbe responsibility rested solely witb Parliament. In. m y opinion, tbe A.B.C. Weekly bas not come up to expectations, due entirely to the commission's inability to produce a journal of sufficiently high standard to command, a ready sale. I recall that at the time when the journal was first publisbed, I had a talk with the chairman of tbe Australian Broadcasting Comniission, and I told bim that I would not countenance the use of licence-fees to finance any great loss sustained by the of programmes the A.B.C. Weekly. I was just as emphatic in that regard as I was in my refusal to bow to the representations made to me by tbe commercial stations in regard to the publication of tlie journal. However, I was relieved of office before I could put my decision into operation. I say without hesitation that, in view of tbe fact that the A.B.C. Weekly continues to be conducted at a huge loss, its publication sbould be reviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I add, however, that although the journal, loses £30,000 a year, that figure is considerably less than tbe £90,000 which the Commission would have been forced to pay had the A.B.C. Weekly not been brought into existence. What is required to place the journal on a sound foundation is somebody witb a knowledge of publication values,, a knowlodge of good articles, and a knowledge of all those things which are: popular in the minds of readers. Incidentally, an important requisite also is a knowledge of the human approach to tbe reading public. If one goes to a news-stand to-day and asks for tbe A.B.C. Weekly, the person who is serving usually bunts around at the bottom of t h e stand amongst some dusty papers, and then produces a copy of the journal, with dust clinging to the edges.' I realize that it is in the I am coming to interests of news vendors to push tbe sales of the journals which provide tbeir main business, but I emphasize that there is a human approach and a value approach wbich should be adopted immediately by tbe new Commission. There is a value in thc publication, and unless that value can be realized I am afraid that Parliament will not tolerate it much longer. In conclusion, I sbould like to refer lo the matter of objectionable broadcasts. Every honourable member of this chamber =hould. register bis disapproval at some of tbe items wbich are put over tbe air. WhilstI was Postmaster-General, this matter was brought home to me unexpectedly on one occasion. My youngsters were giving alittle party at home, and were listening to a broadcast by a certain gentleman who claimed to be a monarch in. bis domain. He broadcast an item wbicb would, not bave been put over in tbe smoke-room of a men's club.",57,Beasle Y
253,Mr Spender,The point made by the,58,Beasle Y
254,Mr Haeeison,"It was a most shocking thing. These innocent youngsters were standing by, listening, and there was sufficient in the item to cause tbem to ask what it meant. Occasionally, when friends of both sexes are being entertained in one's home, items of an objectionable nature are broadcast, to tbe embarrassment of every one present. That sort of stuff may be all right for blase and sophisticated people, but it is not satisfactory for general consumption. I bad a great deal of pleasure in putting tbe fellow to wbom I have referred off tbe air. I insisted that his scripts be submitted for perusal before being broadcast, but he continued to make subtle insinuations and innuendoes, by adding remarks sucb as "" Keepi t clean, girls"". suggest that tbe strongest possible action sbould be taken to keep broadcasts clean and preserve the sanctity of home life from the broadcasting of questionable jokes. To that end, I am strongly in favour of the clause in the bill which relates to that matter. These subtle and sinister stories with double meanings, these unclean jokes emanating like fumes from diseased minds, should not be permitted to find their way into the homes of the people. They sbould be expunged. The air should be kept clean and pure as God intended it to be. It was my great privilege and pleasure to serve on the committee wbich prepared the report on which this legislation is based. It was, indeed, a most interesting mentalities for wbom it is desired to experience to travel around all tbe States make similar provision. A bill dealing of Australia, except Western Australia, whicli bad to be omitted only because of the exigencies of the war situation, and to hear the opinions of experts on every aspect of this most important subject of wireless broadcasting. Broadcasting in Australia more or. less grew up and it was due for an overhaul. The wonder is that a committee of inquiry had not sat upon the subject previously. In Canada, not by any legislative enactment, but by practice, the broadcasting system bas been reviewed on an average of once every two years, and the Canadian system has benefited accordingly. This committee, presided over by Senator Gibson, was tbe first, committee since the inauguration of governmental control of broadcasting in this country to investigate the Australian side of the problem. It was fitting that Senator Gibson, wbo, as Postmaster-General, introduced the first broadcasting bill in Australia, sbould in tbe fullness of time, be the chairman of the joint committee which inquired into tbe whole 'broadcasting system and formulated the report that was accepted in its entirety by the Government. The report itself was unanimous and the Cabinet's decision to implement it was, I understand, also unanimous. It is certainly a unique experience for any Parliament to witness legislation coming so soon after tbe presentation of a report on tbe subject to Parliament. The committee submitted 70 recommendaI tions, of wbich 27 are included in this bill. Eour will need other legislation to give them effect. The recommendations affecting administration or requiring otber consideration total 39. The four recommendations tliat will require other legislation are No. 25j governing superannuation; No. 45, governing the manufacture in this country of records to a minimum limit of 2-J per cent, of all music broadcast; No. 55, governing the licence-fee for commercial stations, and No. 64, governing the question of copyright. I understand that the Government proposes to introduce legislation which will extend superannuation rights, not only to employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but also to all other employees in government instruwith licence-fees for commercial stations is at present before the House. But the otber two pieces of legislation are not yet prepared and, therefore, will not he considered during this sessional period. I sbould like to be sure that the Government intends to 'bring down legislation on the broad matter of copyright, on wbich tbe honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan), bad much to do when the committee was preparing its report in a Victorian country town. I hope that he, too, will deal with tbe question of the manufacture of Australian records. Both matters are of a legal character, of wbicb . 1 , as a layman, do not pretend to bave full knowledge. All governments seem timid about copyright matters.",58,Beasle Y
255,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [10.20].,"The copyright law needs to be brought up to date, not only in respect of its effect upon broadcasting, but also generally. I am advised that for years a bill dealing with trade marks and copyright was introduced every session. It never even reached tbe second-reading stage, because of tbe fear that its complicated character would unnecessarily delay the progress of the business of the House. The committee worked most amicably under its capable chairin ;in, and. it beard witnesses with MS wide a diversity of opinions as could ho imagined. Tbey represented every walk of life. The relationship between the committee and the witnesses was also very amicable. If tbe committee was not able to meet the views or accept tbe opinions of witnesses, it at !""ast satisfied them, in most cases, that tliere was a good answer to their submissions that prevented it from doing so. The work of the committee extended over nine montlis. There were frequent sittings of this House during that period, the war situation was difficult, and it was not possible, therefore, for the commiitee to devote to its task all the time it would bave devoted in days of peace. Tbe committee has recommended that those things with which it could not deal in the time at its disposal be referred to a standing committee before tbe ultimate decision is made. The only matter on which tbe committee did not reach unanimity was that of nationalization of the broadcasting system. Naturally, as a member of tbe Australian Labour party, I support nationalization. It is a plank of our platform. It is part of my political bible. I speak somewhat sadly on the question, because I cannot persuade the Government to nationalize anything. If I could only screw Ministers up to the point, I should nationalize, not only tbe wireless broadcasting system, but also banks and insurance companies. I.' should do a lot of things wbicb, unfortunately, tbe Government will not do. The Government does not intend at this particular moment to nationalize tbe broadcasting system. When I advocate the nationalization, of tbe broadcasting system. I do not do so in a spirit of animosity against the people who manage the commercial broadcasting stations in Australia. I think [00] -and I signed tbe report in common with other members-that the commercial system has played its part in helping to develop wireless broadcasting in this country. Those controlling the commercial system claim that they have played the leading part in popularizing broadcasting. I do not argue as to what side bas conferred the greatest benefit by means of broadcasting, but the commercial stations bave certainly played an important part in popularizing this form of entertainment and education. I agree with my colleagues on the joint committee that the standard of the commercial stations, like that of tbe national stations, is continually improving. Although the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission said that the national stations gave to the people what they ought to have and the commercial stations gave them what they wanted, I am not sure that that description correctly apportions tbe credit for what bas been accomplished. A great deal of good work bas been done by all of those engaged in broadcasting in this country. We live in an age of continual change, and broadcasting on tbe medium wave band will change after tbe war to short wave and ultra short wave broadcasting. There will be frequency modulation, and more channels will be made available by tbe Postmaster-General's Department. We shall probably have all the stations in tbe large cities operating on the ultra short wave hand, whilst country stations will be using the medium wave band. That will result in more stations coming on tbe air, and the equity and standing of the stations abeady established will be affected. What seems to be a valuable asset to-day may not be so valuable when these changes occur. Although tbere was difficulty in the early days of broadcasting in persuading people to take up broadcasting licences, between 192S and 1932 many persons and companies throughout Australia were seeking to use this much desired medium of expression. To-day tbere are 695 applicants for licences to operate commercial stations. Regardless of tbe changes that may take place, tbe vast majority of those persons will be disappointed, because tbe wave hands are not extensive enough to provide channels for all of them. Tlierefore those who hold licences to-day have a tremendous responsibility resting on them to see tliat tbey use their service for the national good. Money must not be the first and only consideration; tbe public good must be ever present in the minds of all entrepreneurs. The history of broadcasting was stated ably by the first Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, Sir Harry Brown, story as told by them will appear in tbe evidence collected by tbe committee, and will be available later to those honourable members wbo desire to know bow broadcasting bas developed in this country. We are all well aware of tbe system of control that operates in Australia. In tbe United States of America the commercial interests own all of tbe stations and another system operates in Canada, whilst a still further method of control bas been adopted in Great Britain. A somewhat different system again is found in South Africa; but, in the light of Australian experience and all of the evidence that tbe committee could gather on the subject, it considered that tbe system of control in this country is suitable under the conditions that obtain here. When I began my inquiries as a member of the joint committee I bad certain preconceived notions. I soon found that some of my views bad to be changed. At first I was under the impression that I knew a good deal about broadcasting; but before long I found that I knew practically nothing about it. The more I heard witness after witness discuss the subject from various points of view, the more I realized how valuable is the system of investigation by parliamentary committees. I hope that when this Parliament is larger tban at present there will be sucb an extension of the system of inquiries by committees that we shall be able to repeat what I believe is a successful innovation in this case, and shall be able to bring to tbe Parliament information on legislation that will be of incalculable benefit to the nation. Broadcasting can be viewed from aspects other than those selected by tbe honourable member for Cook Sheehan), the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) and tbe honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). Mr Calwell. I disagree witb the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Morgan) in some respects, but I am in cordial agreement witb bim that, although tbe committee made certain recommendations regarding medical talks and advertising, tbey bave not been adequately expressed in this legislation. It is true that provision is made for the Minister to be satisfied on tbe subject of medical talks, if be be appealed to; but in my short experience in this Parliament I have found that too many ministers rely entirely on advice given by departmental heads. Tbe honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) will realize perhaps better than most people that ministers are guided by tbe departmental officials who sit at their elbow and put forward various documents for signature. Many ministers often acl merely as rubber stamps and obligingly attach their signatures at the points indicated by tbe officials. It may be said to the credit of the honourable member for Warringah that, when be was minister, I persuaded bim to give directions, and not wait for departmental beads to advise bim. Eeverting to tbe remarks of the honourable member for Eeid, there is a feeling among members of the British Medical Association that we must stand by established practice. Tbis idea arises from an inferiority complex. It is thought that nothing new outside the text books can be found unless it be discovered by doctors or accredited specialists. Osteopathy, and various other forms of bone manipulation, are popular in tbe United States of America, and many people have also benefited from such treatment in Australia. I bave been astounded to bear that an Australian Capital Territory ordinance prohibits the practice in Canberra of this artif it be not a science. science as economics. a science. It bas been called ""tbe disma! science"", but the only true part of that statement is that it is dismal. I hope that tbe Government will take steps to withdraw tbe archaic ordinance which ( Mr prohibits tbe practice of osteopathy in tbe Australian Capital Territory.

258,Mr Calwell,"Economics is hotgive effect to hia desires when the bill is in committee. The honourable member for Cook opposed tbe recommendation of tbe committee, and the provision of the bill, that tbe bead-quarters of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission shall be in Canberra. Two instrumentalities control broadcasting in this country. The Postmaster-General's Department deals witb tbe technical aspects and the Australian Broadcasting Commission with tbe entertainment aspects of tbe subject. At present the head-quarters of the Postmaster-General's Department are in Melbourne and those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission are in Sydney, but both sbould be transferred to Canberra at the earliest possible moment. Tbe arguments used by the honourable member for Cook against the location of the Australian Broadcasting Commission head-quarters in Canberra were entirely unconvincing, and could be used equally strongly against the transfer of tbe Post Office central administration to tbe National Capital. I do not wish to canvass tbe matter further at this stage, extbe commission? cept to point out that the honourable member's arguments in relation to tbe time occupied in travelling by the general manager of the commission were distorted. That officer should travel to tbe various capital cities of tbe Commonwealtb in order to keep himself thoroughly informed on the problems of broadcasting. He should not ensconce himself in an office in Sydney and move only on occasions from there to Canberra or Melbourne and back again. I hope the House will approve the committee's recommendation that the beadquarters of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission sbould be located in Canberra as early as possible. It is not proPostmaster-General, whoever be may be, posed that tbe transfer shall be made immediately, for every body knows that that will not be practicable until some time after the war. As soon as possible the head-quarters of tbe Commonwealth Bank should also be moved to Canberra. In view of the fact that the Treasury is located here, there is every reason wby tbe head-quarters of its principal financial instrument, the Commonwealth Bank, should also be located here. The arguments of the honourable member for Cook in relation to tbe remuneration of the chairman of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission were also distorted. His calculation that tbe remuneration works out at £100 a meeting, assuming that the commission meets once a month, was entirely unsound. He suggested that the remuneration sbould be about £650 a year. I consider that if it would be wrong to pay tbe chairman £100 a meeting for one meeting a month, it would be equally wrong to pay bim £50 a meeting for one meeting a month as tbe honourable member suggests. The fact is, of course, that the chairman does a great deal more tban attend a monthly meeting of the commission. Rightly or wrongly, he has devoted considerable time to tbe detailed work of tbe commission. He spends a great deal of bis time in the office of tbe commission, and concerns himself with many matters in addition to policy. of us having two general managers of possibility. A t the moment I am concerned that the chairman shall be paid an amount which will enable him to come to Canberra and spend some time here frequently after Canberra becomes the headquarters of the commission. If necessary, he sbould be able to maintain a home here, so that he may keep in touch with tbe Minister. It would be a bad thing in my view if tbe Minister had no contact witb the chairman of the commission, and had to rely solely upon advice tendered to him by the general manager. I hope that after the war the will also spend a great deal more of his time in Canberra than Postmasters General have spent here hitherto. able gentleman desires Ministers to spend more time in Canberra he will have to chain them up. member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), I am conscious of the fact",61,Beasle Y

Perhaps they fear that an outbreak of bubonic plague is likely to occur in the environs of the Capital late on any Friday afternoon, and that therefore tbey must get away as quickly as possible. Sucb an attitude will do nothing to deepen the affection of the people of Australia for Canberra as the National Capital. Ministers receive substantial salaries and enjoy many privileges, and they might reasonably be expected to set a good example by spending as much time in Canberra as practicable. I hope that when we have a bigger Parliament, and when we are able to transfer various government instrumentalities to Canberra, there will not be so much ground for Ministers leaving the National Capital on the slightest of pretexts. MT. ARCHIE CAMERON -The honourable gentleman bas been talking a good deal about a bigger Parliament. What about a better Parliament? ment to be both bigger and better. Tbe honourable member for Cook urged that tbe proposed State advisory committee sbould report to tbe Minister and not to the commission. In this regard he had the support of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly). Provision is made in the bill for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to bave a representative on each State advisory committee, and for that reason, among others, I do not think it is necessary that the committees shall report to the commission. There is a fatal objection to that proposal. State advisory committee may deal witb a charge against a commercial station that it has -transgressed tbe code of ethics, cumscribed. In my opinion, the proposal or the rules of decency, wbich sbould apply to broadcasting. It would be improper, in my view, for the committee to report on sucb a matter to tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission, which, in the nature of things, is a rival of tbe commercial broadcasting stations. Such a matter should be reported direct to the Minister, who should have power to review the penalty imposed. I hope that in such circumstances tbe Minister concerned will be sufficiently courageousthough courage has not been obvious in many Ministers in recent years-to impose even a higher penalty than that recommended if he should deem that to be justified. The advisory committees will have power to make recommendations concerning the improvement of broadcasting, and such recommendations should properly be placed before the responsible Minister. An exceptionally effective advisory committee is functioning in Perth, and its work has been of great value to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. commission. intention of tbe joint committee was. that recommendations of tbe advisory committees should be submitted to the Minister for sucb action as he thought desirable. If the Minister considered any recommendation of an advisory committee of sufficient importance, he could deal witb it himself or refer it to the proposed standing committee for further consideration. Tbe suggestion for the appointment of such a committee was made by Professor Bland of the Sydney University, a leading authority on public administration, whose opinions are worthy of close attention. When subsequent witnesses were asked for tbeir views, tbey almost unanimously endorsed bis recommendation. Since then, Professor Bland has written to me expressing his regret that the standA ing committee is not to have the power to initiate investigations. He thinks that in that respect its powers will be too cirshould be given a trial for three or four years. If that he done, I am convinced that it will be found that the system will work well and that tbe advisory committees will do good work also.

Had tbere been a standing committee in operation when a previous Postmaster-General reduced the licensing-fee, that fee would never have been reduced. Evidence was tendered to show that advice to reduce tbe fee was not given by the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs or by the members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

At its inauguration, it had an editor who, because of excessive optimism, issued orders to print large numbers of copies of the first and subsequent issues. The joint committee was told that tbe commission was not properly informed as to the sales of the journal, and was for some time unaware of the losses being made. Later, when it discovered the magnitude of those losses, it attempted to meet the situation. The committee thinks that the commission has shown a laudable desire to publish the journal at as small a loss as possible; and therefore it recommends that the experiment be continued, subject to review by member read the journal, and, if so, what does he think of it? opinion the editor makes the unfortunate must be remembered that the A.B.C.

Newspaper vendors were threatened that, if they sold the A.B.C. Weekly, they would not be allowed to cell other journals which the newspaper proprietors published. These factors must be taken into consideration. If we were to say that the A.B.C. Weekly must be published for only n. certain definite period, say eix or nine months, the commission would have difficulty in arranging advertising contracts. It must have some discretionary power. Moreover, we must trust the proposed standing committee to act reasonably. Should it find that the journal cannot be made to pay, or, at least, that it cannot give value to compensate for any loss which might be incurred, the committee should, and would, be courageous enough to recommend the discontinuance of publication. Every trade union and every organization of manufacturers publishes its own journal and charges the cost of producing it against the general expenses account. Similarly, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is entitled to have its own journal. We should not be too carping in our criticism of the Australian Broadcasting Commission if , in its struggle against the power of the press, it incurs some losses. about the losses, but about the service in New South Wales to come before us, rendered to listeners. room for improvement there, and that not in tbe least helpful to us. We have the whole publication, particularly the format, sbould be made more attractive. It must be remembered that the commission has had to wage a continuous figbt witb tbe press regarding news services, advertising, and other matters. Persons in control of the press of this country foolishly imagined that 3 per cent, of broadcasting would be such a dangerous competitor that newspapers would eventually go out of circulation. They therefore adopted the same attitude as the Luddites did in England, in the days of the industrial revolution. When people found their occupations gone, they smashed tbe machinery which had been brought in to cheapen production. The newspaper magnates had the same kind of mind. However, their worse fears were not realized, and to-day they are more reasonable in their attitude towards broadcasting. For nine years the commission and the newspaper proprietors argued about an agreement. They had not reached an agreement when the Joint Committee on Broadcasting began its investigations. They are now again trying to bring about an agreement. It is extraordinary that these business men who are so prone to criticize others could not, over a period of nine years, reach an agreement upon certain stated points. of view-the attitude of the commission towards outside interests. It considers that it is a law unto itself. the commission from blame for what occurred.

It is very gratifying' to tbe members of the committee to bave had its recommendations accepted in the main by the Government and embodied in this measure. It is not my intention to trace the history of broadcasting, beyond saying that it has definitely passed the novelty stage, and the stage where a piece of galena was tickled with a cat's whisker. It bas now become not only a powerful medium of entertainment, but also a powerful weapon for propaganda purposes. It has been said that the motor car bas brought, the countiy man to the city. Eadio broadcasting has brought the city to the country. As an instrument of entertainment it has proved a boon to the people as a whole, but more particularly to residents in tbe country. In times of peace, it has enabled people living in isolated areas to hear descriptions of important events, including tbe running of tbe Melbourne Cup, which, in most cases, for economic reasons, the average country resident could never hope to witness. Broadcasting bas also proved a valuable educational instrument. Many witnesses wbo gave evidence before the committee testified to tbe value of educational broadcasts, particularly those designed to aid tbe studies of children in outback areas where no schools exist, including principally correspondence students. Voluminous evidence was given to the committee on bebalf of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission by leading educationalists on that aspect of its work. Booklets were furnished to the committee indicating the kind of literature distributed by the commission in order to enable children to participate intelligently in educational broadcasts arranged for tbeir benefit. These broadcasts are now used extensively in Victoria and South Australia, and are being expanded in tbe other States. In Melbourne the members of the committee attended an orchestral concert for school children, typical of the concerts arranged by the commission in pursuance of its policy of improving the musical taste of tbe community. Broadcasting to-day is one of the most powerful instruments wbich any nation can handle. Prior to the outbreak of tbe war, the Government then in control of Germany used broadcasting in order to create a psychology which enabled it to regiment tbe minds of the German people and thus build up, with the tacit consent, at any rate, of that nation, a war machine the like of wbicb tbe world bad not previously known. Since the outbreak of tbe war, broadcasting has been proved to be a powerful instrument of propaganda. We take full advantage of it in that respect in shortwave broadcasting to other countries; whilst Australian listeners with shortwave sets are able to receive entertainment, news and propaganda from overseas. Indeed, some honourable members have queried the wisdom of permitting Australians to listen in to such broadcasts from Tokio. Dealing with broadcasting generally, I believe that when tbe war is over we",66,Cameron I T Was A Tbe Standing Committee

Unless a genins arises to invent an adapter for use on present receiving sets, completely new receivers must be designed for the reception of ultra short-wave broadcasts. Evidence was given before tbe committee that several stations had been erected in the United States of America for the purpose of experimenting witb ultra short-wave broadcasting. Undoubtedly, when tbe war is over, attempts will be made to apply in this country the experience thus gained in the United States of America. ""We may also see great developments in television, although, as one honourable member has said, it is difficult to conceive that television will become very popular because in many respects it compares unfavorably with radio broadcasting. Televised pictures are reproduced on a screen no larger tban ten inches by five or six inches. Therefore, a person must concentrate on the picture; whereas today witb ordinary radio broadcasts, a person may move from room to room and still hear all that is coming over the air. Evidence was given to the committee that great developments will most certainly take place in facsimile broadcasting. I believe that it was the fear of developments in that field that produced the pessimism of newspaper organizations and, perhaps, the overoptimism of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in dealing with tbe problem of tbe broadcasting of news. Station 3UZ Melbourne was granted a licence to experiment with facsimile broadcasting; but as this method did not prove popular, that station abandoned sucb experiments, and returned its licence to tbe department. Facsimile broadcasting also involves the attachment of special apparatus to the present radio broadcasting receiver. It is really a development of radio picturegrams which are publisbed frequently in our daily newspapers. By this means, it is possible t'o receive in printed form on an ordinary radio wireless broadcasting set fitted with a special attachment the priitrr-J news broadcast from the transmitdence from one member of tbe legal proting station. Thus, facsimile broadcasting is a potential competitor with newspaper organizations in the dissemination of news. For this reason, those organizations fear that radio broadcasting might very well become a serious competitor in the news field. The committee has recommended that the dual system of national and commercial stations he retained. Its recommendations, as embodied in this measure, provide for the more rigid control of both classes of stations. Under this measure, objectionable broadcasts will be prohibited. Stricter control will also be exercised over certain classes of advertisements, sucb as those dealing with medicines and advertising broadcasts on Sundays. In future, only what are known as sponsored programmes will be permitted on Sundays. The reason for this innovation is. that Sunday is a day of rest, and on that day more people listen to broadcasts than on any other day. The proprietors of commercial stations have six days of the week on wbicb to broadcast ordinary advertisements. The committee was of opinion that the name only of the sponsor should be announced. Tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission is expected to foster musical appreciation in Australia, and I believe that it bas done a good job in that regard. However, its power in this direction is governed by the amount of revenue at its disposal, and tbe committee, therefore, recommended that the licence-fee, or that tbe amount payable to tbe commission, be increased. Tbe committee also recommended that tbe administrative staff of the commission should be appointed by competitive examination, and that tbe employees should be brought under tbe control of the Commonwealth Public Service Board. I am sure that those recommendations will meet witb the approval of all honourable members. There is a good deal of misunderstanding on the subject of copyright. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) will agree witb me that tbere are in Australia very few experts on copyright. The committee beard evifession who, because be had furnished opinions on copyright to various parties, was recognized as an authority. Most people seem to think that the Australasian Performing Right Association chooses to send overseas the money which it collects in royalties in Australia. It is true that operate a commercial station, his first most of the money is sent overseas, but the thought is to establish it in one of the fault does not lie with the Australasian Performing Right Association; rather does it lie with those who choose the musical programmes which are performed in Australia. Tbe association is really a kind of a trade union which watches the interests of musical composers. Because the broadcasting stations broadcast sucb a large proportion of music, tbe copyright of which is held overseas, tbe Australasian outback districts. These people are conPerforming Right Association necessarily sends overseas much of the revenue it collects. Therefore, the committee came to tbe conclusion that, in order to assist the Australian Broadcasting Commission in its efforts to encourage the performance in outlying districts depend on correof Australian music, at least 2^ per cent, of the time devoted to the broadcasting of music should be reserved for the broadopportunity of receiving broadcast procasting of Australian music. The committee was informed that tbe present proportion was less tban one-half of 1 per cent. Australia's most prolific composer has been receiving less than £80 a year in children are being educated by correroyalties, whilst tens of thousands of pounds have been going overseas. There is one matter which has caused me some concern. The programmes of commercial stations consist mostly of recordings, and there is nothing in the bill to compel the firms which make gramophone records to produce recordings of Australian music. Perhaps provision can be made for this by an amendment of the Customs Act. I am one of those who signed the station were included in the national netminority report of the committee adwork it would be able to broadcast vocating the nationalization of commercelebrity concerts and otber educational cial broadcasting stations in Australia. items which are not now available to I did so, because it is in keeping country people wbo cannot afford to buy witb tbe platform of tbe Australian a high-powered receiving set. Wby Labour party, to which I subscribe, and should a resident of Sydney have because I am convinced that it would be the choice of seven or eight stations in the interests of tbe people, and of when families carrying on essential broadcasting generally. Most of tbe comindustries in the outback districts canmercial stations are concentrated in tbe not obtain a reasonable service unless capital cities. I appreciate the good work tbey possess high-powered sets? As the done by commercial stations, wbicb prohonorable member for Melbourne ( Mr vided a service to the public at a time Calwell) pointed out, 44 per cent, of the when the Commonwealth Government, beMr Riordan. cause of the limited amount of money which it was prepared to devote to this work, was unable to give a satisfactory service. The fact remains, however, that as soon as any one obtains a licence to capital cities. His first consideration when granted a licence is not service to tbe public but where be can make tbe greatest profit. A wireless station is a commercial undertaking. The first consideration of broadcasting policy in this country with its large area and sparseness of settlement sbould be to give the best service possible to tbe people in the tributing materially by tbeir labour to the development of Australia and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that high-clas3 broadcasting programmes are provided for tbem. Many families spondence schools for the education of tbeir children and they are denied the grammes that would supplement the correspondence course. I met recently in western Queensland a man whose home is 84 miles from a railway line and whose spondence. Those children were denied tbe benefit of tbe school broadcasts by reason of tbe absence of a national station in western Queensland. The reception of educational items by such a family would be a valuable amenity. At Longreach, in western Queensland, there is a low-powered station which broadcasts intermittently because the revenue from advertising does not permit a more regular service being given. If that commercial stations are controlled by newspapers or have newspapers financially interested in tbem. The percentage of commercial stations in the hands of newspapers is larger in Australia than tbe corresponding percentage in tbe United States of America, where the stations are solely commercial. In that country tbe network has been developed to a high degree, but in Australia a number of commercial stations are bound together loosely for the purpose of buying expensive programmes. More of these programmes could be put on the air if the income of the Australian Broadcasting Commission were increased. I am in favour of the dual system of national and commercial broadcasting services being adopted in Australia, but I consider that it should be nationalized, as it is in New Zealand. The dual system would enable the commission to provide much better programmes, because, with the commercial service nationalized, more money would be available to the commission. Evidence was collected by the parliamentary committee which showed that in 1940 the. whole of tbe commercial stations made a profit of £81,384 on an actual capital of £860,000, or 9.4 per cent, of profit on capital invested. If the stations were nationalized the rate of profit would be increased because of consequent reduction of overhead expenses. Some commercial stations do not make a profit but most of them earn substantial profits. I shall now quote from a letter written on 16th February last by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Fraser, to the chairman of the Joint Committee on BroadcastingSo far aa users of the broadcasting services arc concerned, there is ample evidence of the satisfactory operation of both services. So far as tlie national service is concerned, since its operations were brought under direct Government control in 1936, the number of registered licence-holders has increased from 183,830 to 306,079, while the last published accounts of the National Commercial Broadcasting Service show that for the year ended 31st ""arch, 1941, that service derived a revenue of £207,764 from sales of Btation time, he, and made a net profit of £52,084. In the annual report of that service for the year, it is stated that the service found difficulty in finding placement in its schedules for all the business offering, and a considerable volume of very desirable business had to be deferred or rejected in order to avoid overcrowding the programmes with advertisements. The figures quoted show that with a revenue that was only one-fifth of that of the commercial stations in Australia the New Zealand service made a profit of £52,000. The number of licences for broadcasting stations in Australia is limited. At present tbere are 98 commercial stations and 29 national stations operating, and tbere are nearly 700 applications for licences. Unless frequency modulation is perfected, only a few of the applications can be granted. The number of licences that can be granted is limited by international agreement, and other factors. In other words, the present holders of B class broadcasting licences enjoy a monopoly. Many of the witnesses who gave evidence before tbe Joint Committee on Broaacasting favoured the nationalization of commercial broadcasting services. The report refers to two of them. In my opinion, the Government should give tbir matter serious consideration because a vested interest is being created, and unless swift action be taken, the Government that ultimately attempts to nationalize the commercial services will be compelled to bear a considerable financial burden. Some criticism has been levelled at the proposal to appoint a standing committee on broadcasting. As the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) stated, this proposal emanated from Professor Bland of the Sydney University, who is a recognized authority on public administration. After he had elaborated his idea when giving evidence, the joint committee took tbe opportunity to ascertain the views of subsequent witnesses, and almost without exception, they supported tbe proposal. As was explained in the report of tbe committee, tbe principal object in establishing a standing committee is to reconcile the independence of tbe Australian Broadcasting Commission with the political conception that all actions of quasigovernment authorities sbould, in the final analysis, be subject to parliamentary control. The standing committee would provide a safeguard against the introduction of hasty or ill-advised legislation or regulations by the political party in power, and would establish a means of ensuring that, before important changes are made in broadcasting policy, there will be a minute investigation of the proposal, and evidence w ill be taken fro m all interested parties by members of both Houses who represent all tbe States. The proposed standing committee w ill consist of nine members, wbo w ill be as familiar with all the major problems of broadcasting as a Minister. As a member of the Joint Committee on Broadcasting, I believe that the recommendation of Professor Bland is an excellent one, and that tbe proposed standing committee w ill prove very valuable to broadcasting. I am gratified that the bill bas received such support from honourable members, and I am confident that broadcasting w ill benefit as a result of this legislation. My only regret is that tbe Government bas not seen fit to nationalize tbe commercial broadcasting services. Question resolved in tbe affirmative. B ill read a second time and committed pro for m a ; progress reported. MAN-POWER : EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS TION-WALE S DIFFERENTIAL-APPLE S AND PEARS : HAIL INSURANCE SCHEM E IMMOBILIZATION OF SMALLCRAFT That the House do now adjourn. When I rise to speak on tbe motion for the adjournment of the House, honourable members may be sure that tbe matter is most important. Last January, I was invited to attend a meeting which was convened by the Returned Soldiers and Airmens Imperial League of Australia, and various road boards in the southern part of Western Australia for tbe purpose of considering the manpower problem in the dairying, potato growing and fruit-growing industries. Speakers pointed out that the sons and employees of agriculturists had been called up for military servico and that the principals were unable to carry on tbeir businesses. For some years, a large number of aliens, including Italians, bave been admitted to that portion of tbe State. Some of tbem have become naturalized and have acquired l a n d ; others have leased Iand. These aliens are now enjoying a regular Christmas, and are making little fortunes out of our misfortune of being at war. The meeting carried a resolution in favour of the conscription of all aliens into labour corps, and directed me to convey it to the Prime Minister( Mr. Curtin). I did so. A t that time, the Government bad under consideration methods of dealing witb tbe problem of alien labour in our midst, but no practical action has yet been taken. A few weeks ago, another meeting was summoned by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmens Imperial League of Australia, in conjunction with other organizations, and the secretary of the Waroona-Harnel sub-branch of the league wrote to me, ou the 2nd May. as follows:At a largely attended meeting of the above sub-branch on Friday last, the following resolution was carried:"" That this meeting disapproves of the inactivity of the Federal Government, aud its dilly-dallying with the urgent, and necessary national safeguard of conscripting all aliens into labour corps"". My sub-branch requests that I place same in your most capable hands. Yesterday I received a copy of the Harvey-Murray Times, the fron t page of which bore in prominent type the following headline: "" W h o le South-West up in Arms over Alien Question"". The Minister for tbe Army( Mr Forde) and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) w ill recollect that 1 have brought this matter to their notice in tbe past, and tbey promised to make Sailors, investigations. When an appeal wan launched for fruit-pickers, tbe Government announced that it would co-ordinate and utilize alien labour for the benefit of tbe country in wbicb tbey bave taken shelter.

This is demonstrated by the fact that tbe chairman of the Waroona Road Board undertook to convey the resolution to similar organizations as f a r soutb as Albany, and since that time, twenty of them bave informed me that they agreed with it . Tbe letter from the Collie Road Board, which is similar to others, readsWith reference to the question of acute shortage of farm labour, and exploitation of the position by aliens, which was the subject of a special resolution of the Drakesbrook Road Board, I am directed by my board to fully endorse the views expressed, and trust the matter will be taken up with the right honourable the Prime Minister, Mr John Curtin, at an early date. Similar letters eame to me from about twenty such boards. Our enemies compel tbe men of conquered countries to work for them, but the aliens in Australia are allowed to earn large sums of money working for themselves. Our own people cannot sign contracts for the growing of potatoes for the A r m y because they cannot get the labour either to sow or to dig. About 75 per cent, of the contracts are going to aliens.

Minister w ill he able to get an idea of the tone of the meeting fro m the report which I will leave with him. I also ask him to refer to tbe file on this matter. On tbe 9tb February, I received the following letter from the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service:My colleague, the Minister for War Organization of Industry, has forwarded me copies of correspondence he received from you relative to tlie shortage of farm labour. I note the terms of the resolution carried at a meeting of primary producers and citizens of Waroona and district held recently, and shall be pleased to take up this matter with the appropriate authority. Since then I have beard nothing. This is entirely a non-party matter. When our boys have gone from the farms and the old people are left there without help, the aliens should be formed into a corps and employed for the general good. Otherwise, why are they in the country? time has come when we should seriously consider the position of the soldiers who, broken in spirit and war . weary, are discharged and return to tbeir homes. We know what happened to tens of thousands of soldiers who returned from the 1914-18 war-th o war which was fought to end all wars and to make tbe world safe for democracy. In view of the fact that many non-essential industries are being put out of they naturalized action for tbe purpose of speeding up the war effort, and in spite of all the talk of the coming new order, there may be another man-made depression.

I hope that action will be taken promptly to provide tbem with allowances until employment can be obtained. Some department should be charged witb tbe duty of attending to the requirements of the men after their discharge. I rose particularly to draw attention to tlie need for a drive for increased war production. 1 have referred to this matter on several occasions, and I again bring it to tbe notice of the Government before tbe conclusion of the present sittings. I should like an intimation that this important matter will receive immediate attention. I do not reflect on any of tbe service Ministers, because they and tbeir officials are doing good work, as are also the men and women engaged in. war industries generally, but we are not obtaining 100 per cent, production. We have a host of boards and governmental directors, as well as a labyrinth of government departments, yet one of tbe most important matters of all seems to have been entirely overlooked by this and previous governments. United States of America steps bave been taken to step up war production by tbe appointment of Mr Donald Nelson as Director of Production, whilst in Great Britain Mr Oliver Lyttleton bas been chosen to supervise tbe work of speeding up and co-ordinating war production generally. Tbe Prime Minister( Mr problem needs proper handling on the Our tin) has pointed out that a production committee of Cabinet bas been set up to deal with the matter, and that is a step in the right direction. That committee was appointed six months ago, but Ministers cannot attend to details of administration. Some board or administrative staff is required to implement decisions reached. The Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) indicated to-day that delay in production will be dealt witb by Mr Chippendale, the Director of War Organization of In dustry. He is busily engaged in the rationalization of industry, which involves the closing down of many industries, and also in zoning the delivery of bread and otber commodities. I have in mind particularly the speeding up of existing war industries. A complete survey of industry is required to ascertain the reasons for hold-ups in industry and to decide what practical steps could be taken to speed up production. Many cases bave come to my notice in which idle men and machines could be put to useful work. In one industry there are twenty machines out of use at present. In another large industry adjoining my electorate, SOO men are employed in supplying equipment vitally necessary for defence purposes. This establishment has bad an order for some time for pistols. After it had manufactured 90 of tbe parts required for the pistol, it lacked certain machine tools, and could not complete the remaining parts. Until recently, it had not produced one complete pistol. Yet pistols are urgently needed by the Army authorities. I believe that a few have been produced lately, but that was not until the factory had held the order for a considerable time. I could tell some hair-raising stories to honourable members regarding aircraft production, but obviously it would not In tbe be fitting for me to go into detail on that subject. The Minister for Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron) bas, however, admitted publicly that aircraft production has been delayed in this country owing to tbe attitude of certain vested interests. AllI can say is: "" Thank God the United States of America is now witb us Tbis administrative side. At a deputation on this subject not. long ago the director of a branch of the Munitions Department said that he bad received many applications from persons with organizing ability for work in an honorary capacity. He said. "" Tbe place is lousy witb people offering their services "". One man who had been receiving a salary of £3,000 a year prior to his retirement, offered his services and when he was told that tbey could not be used be said, "" I was never so insulted in my l if e "" . Many men with organizing ability are prepared to assist in the stepping up of war production. We need both skilled tradesmen and men with executive ability who are able to place men where they could work to best advantage. This week Mr Donald Nelson and Mr Oliver Lyttleton are conferring on tiie subject of the oc-ordination of Allied war industries, in order that a 100 per oent. production output may be reached to give us victory this year. It is certain that tbey will survey tbe situation in Australia. It is vitally necessary that our industries shall be working at f ull capacity if we are to get the assistance from abroad which the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) is seeking. Mr Nelson said in a broadcast address recently that his object was to utilize all existing war industries on a 24-honrs-aday basis, seven days a week. By that means he hoped that the American output of military supplies would be doubled. He said, "" Idle tools work for Hitler "". He bad in. mind war plants which were operating at only 20 per cent, for five days a week, plants wbicb were closed on Sundays, and plants in which second shifts worked at only 40 per cent, capacity and third shifts at only 20 per cent, capacity. Such plants bad idle machinery which could be employed witb much more advantage every week-end and from eight to sixteen extra hours daily. We have plants in tbe same position in this country. I hope that tbe Production Committee will take immediate steps to bring all these plants into full production. It is essential that machines shall be working at the fullest capacity, and that tbey shall be working in the right place. I have visited many industrial plants in my electorate and I know that tbere is a lag in production wbich could be overtaken. The Joint Committee on War Expenditure made certain recommendations concerning the control of machine tools. In particular it advised tbe appointdifferential might mean the partial ment of a committee to control machine tools. In my addendum to the report I expressed the view that a person or persons with engineering knowledge not associated with trades manufacturing supplies for the government or contracting with the government itself, should be itppointed to this office. I hope that that recommendation will be adopted. I wish now to refer again to the unsatisand that he favoured its adoption. factory situation in connection with the Unfortunately the Board of Business manufacture of the Wales differential. Administration made an unfavorable This device, which is designed to overrecommendation in connection with the come single wheelspin, a major defect in device and referred to the fact that it conventional motor vehicles, was brought Mr Morgan.. to the notice of the Army authorities a long time ago. It was thoroughly tested and approved not only by the Army but also by the officers of tbe Department of Supply and Development. All the experts wbo investigated the device have been satisfied witb its technical qualities. Tbey have formed tbe opinion that the device would be invaluable in tbe Middle East and, in fact, in all heavy or sandy country. Our own forces may be engaged in active warfare in tbe not distant future in North Australia and we shall be in grave difficulty if our vehicles become bogged in thc heavy soils in the far north. If the Army vehicles were fitted witb Wales differentials the likelihood of such a happening would be greatly reduced. The Army authorities tested a Wales differential on vehicles which travelled thousands of miles and they subsequently requisitioned for all possible supplies through tbe Department of Supply and Development. The device was examined by the Central Inventions Board wbich was functioning at tbe time it was submitted to the Government, and it was approved by that authority. Tbe Department of Supply and Development placed a definite order for 800 differentials which were estimated to cost about £38 each. I bave little doubt that if the device could be placed in mass production the price would be halved. This differential has also been tested by General Motors-Holdens Limited and tbe Ford Motor Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, which might be regarded, in a sense, as competitors, because tihe adoption of the Wales dismantling of General Motors and Ford vehicles. But this fact did not prevent the experts of those companies from issuing a favorable report. Following a speech which I made on this subject in the House some time ago I received a letter from the Director General of Ordnance, Mr L. J. Hartnett, in which he stated that he was quite satisfied that the device was sound, was proposed that the inventor should receive a royalty of £2 on each differential. It is amazing to me that a man lite Mr Sydney Myer should object to an inventor receiving a royalty on a device which he has spent a lifetime in perfecting. I did not know Mr Wales when this matter was first brought to my notice and C had no personal interest in the matter, but a few days ago 1 received the following letter from him, dated the 19th May I have refrained from writin g to you earlier as I realized that you would be very busy.

302,Mr Abbott (New England) [12.21,"rendered unmarketable uuder the board's regulations although the fruit for the most part is only superficially damaged by hail. Some of these had been record crops, but there were no returns. In some cases storekeepers and merchants had backed the orchardists with credit and supplies for the production of this year's crop. As a result, both orchardists and their creditors were now in a serious position. The policy of the Apple and Pear Board is that no fruit damaged by hail shall be sold, and although it could be disposed of in some centres growers were not allowed to market the fruit. Suggestions were made in some quarters that a system of insurance against damage by hail should be instituted on a contributory basis, or otherwise. It is obviously too late to consider the creation of any such system this season; and the committee considers that some immediate compensation should be made for the loss of this season's crop. Although the growers were told that compensation would be paid to tbem, the only amount that one grower received in respect of 5,800 bushels of f r u it was a payment of £17 after eleven months had elapsed. He and otber growers claim that had tbey been allowed to market tbe damaged f r u it tbey would have received substantial returns. Conditions on the settlement are disastrous; I am informed that spraying has ceased on many of the orchards and codlin moth is taking possession of tbe orchards which are fast going to ruin. Of about 60 growers on tbe settlement, 28 bave already abandoned their holdings. These and other growers in New Soutb Wales bave asked for the establishment of a compulsory hail insurance scheme. In its report the committee recommended a scheme of this kindThat there should be a hail insurance scheme to 'be financed by a percentage levy being made by the board on the assessed value of the crop in each State for the purpose of compensating growers for loss sustained by hail damage. Notwithstanding nothing whatever has been done in the matter, yet the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) External Territories (Senator Fraser) as well as the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson), who is a supporter of the Government, Meanwhile hardship; they and their families practically starving. ment to introduce a scheme of compulsory hail insurance for either the whole of Australia or those States which are ifr. Abbott. willing to participate in it . I shall not be put off by being told that the latter scheme would be unconstitutional. I understand that there is ample power in the insurance provision in the Constitution to establish such a scheme even if one State did stand out. I urge tbe Minister to bring this matter before Cabinet with a view to introducing a scheme to be made retrospective to the date on which the disaster to which 1 have referred overtook the settlement. X refer now to tbe seizure of boats in various ports, particularly in the Port Stephens area. I am informed that many of these vessels bave been placed in Claypot Creek, which contains tbe worse borer-infested waters in that area. The result is that the boats are being ruined, either by borer, or through having been drawn up on the land and left to rot. In some cases, I understand that boats have been returned to their owners, whilst others have been prevented from gaining possession of their boats. Some owners have repossessed their vessels. It would appear that tbere has been discrimination and favouritism. Some of these, wbich are rowing boats, belong to farmers in areas which' are liable to be flooded by the Hunter River, which sometimes rises suddenly. There is some arrangement by which local police constables can release boats when a flood is imminent, but they have first to apply to the commodore in charge of tbe naval establishment at Garden Island. Before a reply authorizing the release of the boats could be obtained from that source, a flood could drown numbers of farmers who could not that recommendation, get away. I ask tbe Minister to cut through the red tape and put some energy into tbe committee wbich deals with and the Minister for these matters.

The graziers who are asked to undertake this work are not raising any objection to their having to do it when they are able to obtain tbe necessary man-power and material. But they ask that, for the present, the regulations shall be suspended. I understand that the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) took the matter up with tbe Government of New South Wales, but was unable to obtain a reply from the Premier of that State. I ask that Cabinet be requested to suspend the regulations until supplies of material are available, and thus avoid tbe use of man-power and timber, which are urgently needed for other purposes.

It was decided that a fortnight would be allowed to friendly and refugee aliens to enlist in one of the services. Those who did not enlist within that period were called up and aliens were drafted into labour units, and were used in non-combatant work. Of course, there are enemy aliens who are above the age at which they would be of service in such units. Similar age categories apply in respect of the call-ups of friendly, refugee, and enemy aliens, as apply in respect of Australians. In one district, 1,800 enemy aliens were drafted into labour units and were compelled to work on roads, approaches to aerodromes, and the like. Western Australia.

Also, whether I had considered a proposal for tlie establishment of suitable plant for smelting and concentrating ores at places where a sufficient quantity of ore is available? On that occasion, I outlined some of the difficulties involved in this proposal. I have now received a report from the Controller of Minerals Production, who has submitted the following replies to the. points raised by tbe honourable member:la) Tin and tungsten (wolfram and scheelite ) : Existing smelting and refining capacity is more than adequate. Concentrating plant is being supplied and augmented where found necessary after investigation. Lead and zinc: Existing smelting and refining plants are more than adequate to produce the quantities of these metals required for war industries in Australia. Erection of a new smelter is contemplated, but tliere is a ready market overseas for concentrates of these metals. Large storks of lead and zinc concentrates are accumulating for reasons given in (b). Copper: Existing smelting and refining plants are adequate for present supplies of concentrates and suitable ores. In addition, a large new plant is about to start operating. All possible sources of supplies of copper ores are being investigated and several are being brought into production. In some cases, new concentrating plants are required and these are being provided as quickly as possible. Others will be provided as development warrants their erection. lb) Transport is a difficult problem for all services. At the present time, lead and zinc concentrates are being produced more quickly at the main centres than they can be moved to ports hy the railways. No special transport problem has yet arisen in regard to transportation of ores from newly opened mines to treatment plants.",79,Soldiers Soldiers On

Solution of the problem of treatment of relatively small parcels of composite ore is to erect small concentrating plants at the point of production or at some centre convenient thereto. As long as such plants are of small dimensions it is believed that the necessary material can be obtained for manufacture in Australia, but the provision of any large-scale concentrating, smelting and refining plants would necessitate the importation of equipment from America.
