Excise is a burden on the sugar industry, but I would point out that the increased value given to the sugar by the import -duty is compensated for only in part by the imposition of an Excise duty. The Excise duty is required to be paid by the producer only after he has received the ^benefit of an increased price to the extent iof £ 6 per ton, owing to the operation of the import duties. Of the Excise duty, we return to the grower ,-£2', as a matter of grace, to encourage him to employ white -labour. I believe that instead of reducing --the Excise duty, we should increase it, and -so take back from the sugar-grower the full amount that he receives from the general public through the operation of the import duty. If we adopted that course, we should not 'b& compelled to ask the farmers and others -wh o have enough to do to earn a living -to pay additional taxes, in order to assist the sugar planters. I am in favour of the -sliding scale, and I think that we should intimate to the sugar-growers that after a -certain time they must do without any bounty.

'.Minister has told us that the. principle of the sliding scale had been adopted in the Senate, and that the amendment now before us had resulted, as if it were a novel proposal. It is scarcely fair to this Chamber to forget that a large number of honourable members, including myself, advocated the sliding scale in this Chamber on free trade principles, and that when the Committee divided, the Government had a majority of only two votes. The honourable member for Bland expressed the opinion that it was premature to introduce the He seems to think that the sliding scale. I quite agree with him that it is premature to bring it into operation at the present time; but I do not share his opinion that it is premature to announce to the sugar growers of Australia as soon as possible that they are not to look for the permanent establishment of the artificial protection which the bounty gives. I suppose that some of the strongest advocates of protection look forward to the time when artificial assistance to industries will be withdrawn, and they will be able to stand alone. when we have a little Heaven below. been trying for 39 years to reach the millennium, and seems to be further off it than ever. AlthoughI recognise the right of the Queensland sugar planters to claim the principle of ""general average"" over the whole of the people of Australia, by way of compensation for the disabilities, which have been imposed upon them by the White Australia policy, I am glad that the Senate has recognised the danger of creating the impression that the bounty is Co be permanent. Although the other Chambonus shall be given, and has made the declivity, from the present state of affairs to nothing, more abrupt than we proposed, the principle it has adopted is a sound one; as the, sugar growers will now have notice that this Parliament will not be a party to according artificial support to their industry in perpetuity. Another amendment has been made by the Senate, and I should like to have an explanation from the Minister as to its practical effect. I have not seen the amendment, but I understand that it is intended to impose upon those planters who participate in the bounty the obligation to pay a minimum wage. they shall pay the wages current for the same class of labour in the district.",15,Sugar Bounty Bill

44,Sir William Lyne,"It is proposed thatmay have a most important bearing upon the employment of white labour on the plantations. Anumber of circumstantial statements have been made with regard to the great disparity of the wages paid in Queensland. Some men receive as high as 35s. per week and their keep, whilst others are paid only 12s. 6d. per week with keep -and , it is alleged, very bad keep at that, However, sufficient for the day is the session thereof, and during the next five years we shall have ample time to reconsider this question, if developments make it seem necessary. gret that the Senate has seen fit to insert this amendment. Parliament is not prepared to accept it nothing can be done during the present session. To my mind, it is all important that the Bill should be passed before we prorogue. learned member for Parkes has scarcely put the position accurately. I would point oiit to him that no bounty is really paid to the white growers of sugar. They merely receive a rebate upon the contribution which they make to the Treasury. to abolish both the excise and the bounty the Commonwealth and the States would receive less revenue than they do now. In my opinion this matter can be better discussed at a later period, because it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the sugar growers of Queensland and New South Wales, that fhe Bill should be passed this session. One point that I want honourable members to recollect is that under this legislation the whitesugar-growers will be required to F y £,4 per ton Excise, and out of that a they will be refunded a sum of ^ 3 per ton to enable them to differentiate between the cost of employing white as against coloured labour. The Bill does not raise the question of free-trade versus protection. It represents an endeavour to settle the northern parts of Australia with an agricultural people, who, when once established there, will not only prove good citizens, but will provide an efficient defence of that portion of this great country. they go, I approve of the amendments of assertions are usually of an exaggerated the Senate. To my mind, the other Chamnature. ber has minimized the evils of a very bad Bill. which the bounty shall be operative from 1907 to 1911. During that term, even upon a fair view of this question has been taken the calculations of the present year, this' legislation will involve the Commonwealth in an actual expenditure of ^600,000, in addition to taxation to the extent of ^900,000, not one penny of which will find its way into the Treasury. This sum of money is to be paid! to insure that some of the richest lands in Australia shall be kept under cultivation. To achieve the desired results, this taxation must be levied upon the poorer lands, and thus we are called upon to sanction the extraordinary anomaly of the occupants, of the poorer lands contributing to the support of those who are in.possession of the richest lands. In the first place, we gave the sugar growers a protection of £ 6 per ton. Then Parliament, in its need for revenue, deI understand that if clared that it would take back ^ 4 per ton by way of Excise. never advanced as a reason for our action. first Parliament. Then we agreed to return a further sum of per ton to planters who employed white labour exclusively. That money could not be returned by way of rebate, and, consequently, If we were it was refunded by way of bounty. The system which has been followed has been most injurious to Australia, because it has been absolutely forgotten that sugar is the raw material of hundreds of industries throughout the Commonwealth. matter this session. that. In conclusion I should like to refer to one extraordinary statement which was made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. He said that we cannot foresee what will take place in connection with the sugar industry, and, therefore, we ought to legislate as soon as possible. A more extraordinary reason for introducing uncertain legislation I have never heard. I predict that the difficulties created by this legislation will be made manifest to everybody during the next two or three years. refer to the wild statements of the honorI t has extended the period during what I said.",16,Sugar Bounty Bill

When it was being discussed only a few days ago I said that I was in favour of adopting a sliding scale under which the bounty would automatically vanish ; but that, in view of the conditions surrounding the industry the term foe which it was proposed to extend the bounty was altogether too short. Had the measure passed provided for a period of 1 live years, and had the other Chamber adopted a sliding scale extending over eight yearsa sliding scale under which the bounty would diminish at, say, 12I per cent, per annum-I should have been quite willing to accept it, because I believe that finality must be reached sooner or later. open to us to graduate the bounty when the time comes. would be willing to have it done now.

I am satisfied that as soon as the shipping combine whose terms are very rigid indeed. In this connection I may observe that on the north coast of Queensland there is a small steamer owned by a private individual, which carries goods from the creeks and rivers along the coast for transhipment south, and the shipping companies even refuse to handle the produce carried by that vessel. Before concluding my remarks, I would point out that the honourable member for Parkes made a slight error when he declared that in one division, which took place in this House upon the Bill under consideration, there was a majority of only two. May I remind him that that division was upon an amendment submitted by the honourable member for Coolgardie, in favour of the substitution of the word "" ten"" for "" twelve."" The actual majority against the application of a sliding scale to the bounty was six. The honourable and learned member implied that it was a free trade victory, when, as a matter of fact, no .'less than seven protectionists voted with the free-traders. I trust that before the measure is finally passed, the Committee will come to some arrangement with regard to the Excise upon sugar. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minis do in regard to the Excise Bill.

If the understanding between the Premiers had been more emphasized in the early stages of the Capital Site controversy, it would have had a very great influence upon a large number of the Members of both Houses of this Parliament. Although that understanding cannot be st'rifctly held to bind more than the parties to it, it will be recognised by most honourable members that the people of New South Wales were encouraged by the statements of the first Prime Minister and others to believe that it would be carried out.

No one can say that country 2,200 feet above the sea level in that latitude has an exceedingly hot climate. The locality possesses the further advantage that in the winter time the climate is not so rigorous, as that of Dalgety. The lowest thermometer reading at Bungendore is 21.5 degrees, while the lowest' reading at Bombala, which would be slightly higher than Dalgety, is 15.3 degrees. tion of the site and the thermometer readings are not the real tests,. Dalgety has an exposed situation, and is one of the bleakest of spots in the winter time. Honourable fmembers who have Igone through Blayney in the winter time will remember that, notwithstanding the fact that its altitude is, if anything, a little below that of Orange, the climate is very much more severe, owing to the fact that it is, situated on the apex of a swelling, elevation, which is exposed to the wind from all quarters. In like manner, Dalgety is exposed to every wind that blows, and the conditions in the winter time must be most severe. Lake George, however, is surrounded by chains of hills, whicli break the severity of the winter winds, and those who have lived there tell me that the climate is reasonably equable. people living there. merely a pastoral holding. It is not the fault of the district that it has remained in pastoral occupation. It was granted years ago to one family, which has held it ever since. The late owner, who recently, died, informed me that he was absolutely opposed to its being acquired for the purpose of a capital s.ite, because he needed it as a home station to be worked in conjunction with his Darling River properties. It is at prairie value, and therefore the fact that it has not been improved beyond ringbarking is in its favour. Undoubtedly there at Dalgety. At Dalgety we find decomposed granite, which does not seem to have decomposed long enough to have been converted into soil. In some parts of New South Wales there are granitic soils which are' excellent fbr wheat-growing and for agricultural purposes generally, but certainly that remark does not apply to Dalgety.

130,Mr Watson,"Quite so; but, otherwhich a number of honourable members of both Houses lay much emphasis is the proximity of Dalgety to a port. What they fear in this connection I cannot quite understand. I do not see any real necessity for a Federal port, because the provisions of the Constitution, in my view, sufficiently protect the Federal territory against any improper attempt on the part of a State to circumscribe or hinder the trade with that territory. sympathize with the suggestion that a port -is a sine qua non in connection with the permanent Seat of Government. 'But even if it werei the idea of selecting Dalgety because of its proximity to Eden, and of voting against Lake George, which is much closer to a better port, does not appeal to me. Jervis Bay, which is within sixty miles by a direct line of Lake George, is infinitely superior to Eden as a natural harbour. jnrison between the two. At Jervis Bay there are 120 square miles of anchorage foi deep shipping. that it is almost completely landlocked. It would require practically no expenditure to make it a first-class harbour. As a matter of fact, the vessels of the Australian Squadron, some of which draw 28 feet of water, visit Jervis Bay for practice, and experience no difficulty in manoeuvring all over it. Further, it would require a much longer line of railway to connect Dalgety with Eden than it would to connect Lake George with Jervis Bay. I frankly admit that Dalgety is superior to Lake George from the point of view of its water supply. The Snowy River is, in one respect^ the greatest river in Australia. It is the only large stream which is always flowing. But that, in itself, is not sufficient to warrant us in selecting that site, provided that a reaficult questions in regard to riparian rights sonable water supply can be obtained elsewhere. If it were not possible to get a supply at Lake George, which would be sufficient for all ordinary purposes, and at the same time to maintain the Lake at a reasonable level, I should not be prepared to support the choice of that site. would be ridiculous to establish the Seat of Government alongside a mud flat, even if it were only a mud flat once in a hundred years. But I am assured by engineers, who have made surveys, and who have gone into detailsI refer to such men as Captain Gipps and the engineers of the Water Conservation Department of New South Wales-that not only are there no engineering difficulties in the way of turning the waters of the Molonglo, and, if necessary, the Queanbeyan Rivers into Lake George, but that the cost of such an operation would be comparatively small. rights 'in connection with the Queanbeyan River? sary to take a smal 1 proportion of the waters of that river. It is a big stream, and the waters of the Molonglo and the Queanbeyan Rivers could be turned into Lake George by making a very short cutting. sized area for the watershed. situated in elevated country-som e of it is more than 5,000 feet above the sea level. ' It is steep, and has a good rainfall and a quick "" run off."" Consequently -we could conserve a much greater proportion of the rainfall there than we could upon flat country where the "" run off"" is slight. I admit that in considering this matter, it is wise to look carefully into the question of a water supply. But I have it upon the authority of men who have made a study of it that an ample water supply could easily be secured in the Lake George district. I would remind honourable members that this is not the"" first occasion that the question of filling Lake George has received attention. Years ago, when the honourable member for Hume was Minister in New South Wales, a proposal was made to turn the waters of the Murrumbidgee into that lake, and to use it as 1 a vast reservoir in connection with an irrigation scheme to supplv the country for TOO miles or so towards Young. as between the State and the Commonwealth. sequently abandoned, but the proposal had the effect of securing a thorough survey of the whole district. Thus the feasibility of It diverting the waters of various streams into Lake George was established.

Mir. WATSON , I do not know: that we should insert finally in this Bill the words "" Lake George."" I would prefer to declare that the Seat of Government shall be "" in the neighbourhood of Lake George,"" because I am assured that there are in that locality quite a number of eligible sites. For instance, there is Lake Bathurst, which has never been known to be dry, and which, I am informed, is a magnificent sheet of water. It is only about ten miles distant from Lake George. Then we also have the Yass site, within a very short distance, and I think that in that elevated country, with its network of creeks But the country around and other advantages,, there must be almost innumerable sites suitable for the establishment of the Capital.

155,Mr Watson,"I am prepared to admitto the question of the Capital. the very fact that this irritation exists is a substantial reason why we should postpone the final determination of the question until we can approach it in a calmer spirit, and at a time when there will be no feeling of resentment, so far aS one of the principal parties are concerned. here. orable members are excited; but there is in the Federal Parliament to-day a certain feeling of resentment towards the attitude of the Premier of New South Wales. Some honourable members feel that he has unjustly accused them of political dishonesty. torians as being unfriendly to New South Wales. Victoria, who for the most part voted against the selection of Dalgety, have been branded by him as taking up an unfriendly attitude towards New South Wales. It would be most unfortunate .for the Federal Parliament, while this feeling prevails, to come to a decision with regard to this Biil, the passing of which would mean the affirmation of the previous decision of the Legislature. I think that I am speaking for most of the representatives of New South Wales when I express the hope that the Government will see their way to refrain from taking any further step before next session. If that be done, we shall be able to approach the matter in a more reasonable spirit. I think that the interests of Australia are likely to be better served when this bitterness of feeling has died away than they would if we dealt finally with the question at the present time. Mr ""FULLER (Hlawarra) I do not propose to make a lengthy speech upon this question. That determination has been strengthened by the address just delivered by the honourable member for Bland, who has criticised the Dalgety site so severely that, out of consideration for the feelings of the Postmaster-General, I am disposed to refrain from repeating the dose. I regret that this Bill has been introduced in the closing hours of the session, when many honourable members are absent, and when those who are present are anxious to leave for their homes. I agree with what has been said, not only by the honourable member for Bland, but by the leader of the Opposition, as to what the Biill really Still, means. We must all recognise that the selection of Dalgety as the site of the Federal Capital at no period during the time that the question was under consideration had the support of more than one-third of the members of this House. I deeply regret that at a time when there was a distinct majority of honourable members of this. House in favour of the striking out of the word ""Dalgety,"" with a view to provide for the selection of a site in the vicinity of Lake George, the Premier of New South Wales should have come upon the scene, and have made statements which hav; caused a feeling of resentment amongst a number of honourable members. I may say, in passing, that I am not disposed to vote straight out for the insertion of the Lake George site in the Bill, because those who had an opportunity to take part in the parliamentary tour of inspection know that in that district there are several picturesque sites that would be suitable for the Capital. Therefore, when I speak of Lake GeorgeI refer not only to what is known as the Lake George site, but to others in the same locality. There can be no doubt that the recent, utterances of the Premier of New South Wales have aroused a feeling of resentment, not only among the members of this House, but also among certain honourable senators, who felt that New South Wales was not being properly treated, and that the carrying out of the original determination of the Parliament would not be in the best interests of Australia. Those honourable senators were honestly prepared to recede from the position originally taken up by them, and it was! most unfortunate that at this juncture the Premier of New South Wales should have made the utterances to which I refer. I feel that if this question is to be properly considered, we must regard it not alone from the stand-point of New South Wales, but from that of the whole Commonwealth, taking care, of cours,e, not to lose sight of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers that the Capital should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. It would be well if time were given for the feelings of resentment to which I have referred to cool down. Mv view of the matter is that it might well be deferred until next session, when it would receive the consideration that it deserves.

But how can it be said that the selection of DalThat gety would be a fulfilment of the compact? One of the reasons advanced for the selection of that site is that, if Dalgety were selected, the Commonwealth would have a port of its own at Twofold Bay. I do not see why the Commonwealth should have a port of its own. But, in any case, Twofold Bay could not be brought within the Federal territory without disregarding the arrangement which induced a large number of persons in New South Wales to vote for the acceptance of the Constitution, which otherwise they would have voted against. I took advantage of the facilities given during the first Parliament to visit all the suggested Capital sites, with the exception of Tooma, The which was visited after the others, and, having given careful consideration to the whole matter, felt bound to cast my vote for Lake George, which seemed to me better than any of the other sites, supposing that a good water supply could be Sir guaranteed.

I intend to deal with a new matter, which has come to light since I last spoke on the question. As honourable members know, I expressed, very decidedly, my preference for the Tooma site, and I do not go back on what I then said. I believe that, there is no better site in New South Wales, and it is a site which might well be selected by all who are actuated by the spirit of patriotism, and desire the welfare of the whole Commonwealth. But, since the matter was last discussed, the right honourable member for East Sydney and others have placed new facts before us, in the light of which I cannot accept the interpretation placed by the Attorney-General on the arrangement come to byi the Premiers of the States. Much as I should like to stand by my original vote, I feel that we are strictly bound by the promise made to the people of New South Wales, and.,for my own part, I intend to do what I can to have it carried into effect, just as if it were a. procompiled with' iregard to that and other mise made by myself. I cannot say that I have changed my opinion with any great Sdegreef of pleasure as to how I should act on this question; but I cannot escape doing my duty in regard to it. and the interpretation that has been placed by the right honourable member for East Sydney on the agreement of the Premiers seems to me to be the right one. while the statement which he made last night as to the determination of the Victorian representatives, that the Capital should not be within 200 miles of Sydney, clinches the argument. I feel bound, under these circumstances, to endeavour to obtain strict compliance with the agreement; though I regret that the important facts which have The Postmastercaused me to somewhat alter my attitude were not brought to light earlier. To my mind, the right honourable member for East Sydney has committed a serious offence in hot referring before to the facts which were mentioned last night. He surely will not urge that matters of such moment have escaped his memory, though that is the most favorable interpretation to place on his conduct. The delay in the settlement of the question lies largely at his door, because of the incomprehensible manner in which he has allowed these important facts to remain unknown. North Sydney quoted every word of the * agreement between the Premiers in the debate on the Capital Site question last year. gentleman knows, as well as I do, that it is impossible for any honourable member to listen to all the speeches that are delivered here upon any given subject. I did not hear the statement of the honourable member for North Sydney, and I rarely have time to read Hansard in order to find out what honourable members have said during my absence. If the right honourable member for East Sydney had made a similar statement, it would have riveted the attention of the House, and we should have long before this realized clearly the position in which we stood . 1 I have not changed'my opinion of Tooma, but I realize that we must honour the bond entered into with New South Wales. Now it appears that some compromise is likely to be arrived at. I am not prepared to vote, at this juncture, in favour of Lake George, because I do not know sufficient about it.

I do not look for guidCarruthers' action as merely a piece of political pyrotechnicsa class of exhibition in which that gentleman is an expert. He has engaged in a political manoeuvre with the idea of diverting the attention of the public from more serious matters, and of escaping the censure which might be attached to him, owing to his action in connection with them. I shall not be guided by the prejudices of the people of New South'Wales, nor by the inclinations of honourable members of this House. I shall be influenced by the Constitution and the terms of the arrangement entered into between the Premiers,, and I shall have to withhold my final judgment until more information is available with regard to Lake George.

The Attorney-General has argued the matter in a very able speech. He applied his logical whip without mercy to the back of the right honourable member for East Sydney. No such castigation has ever before been administered to any honourable member in this House. He exposed the right honourable gentleman's inconsistency, lack of attention to duty, and want of appreciation of the higher responsibilities of public life.

The duel between the right honourable member for East Sydney and the AttornevGeneral was most entertaining, viewed from that stand-point. But I am forced to reject the interpretation of the Minister, and to do what I conceive to be necessary in order to abide by the compact entered into with New South Wales.

MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) -A t this late hour of the session it is not my intention to. refer to the respective merits of the different sites. It appears to me that ihe time for such references has long since passed. I remind honourable members that we have already had f u l l reports as to the -merits of the sites submitted to us by two Royal Commissions-on e of which was appointed by the Government of New South Wales and the other by the Commonwealth Government. We have also 'had the views of experts in regard to all the essentials of a Federal Capital, and in addition, honourable members of both Houses of the Legislature have made various pilgrimages to the different sites. Having obtained all the information that we could collect upon the subject, we dealt exhaustively with the whole matter. During the first session of the first Parliament the two Houses failed to _ agree upon the question, and consequently it had to be revived in the occasion both the Senate House, by absolute majorities, decided in favour of Dalgety, and it appears to me that unless it can be' shown that in so doing we committed a grave error of judgment, we should regard the matter of tlie selection as having, been finally settled. Personally, I am not aware of any fresh information which would justify us in reversing the decision at which we previously arrived. It is true that the Premier of New South Wales, in the exercise of his undoubted right, and I presume of what he deemed to be his duty, has administered a very smart "" s c o l d in g "" I cannot apply to it any more dignified term-to the Parliament of l h e Commonwealtli. Why? Simply because we have selected a site for the Seat of Government which 'was offered to us by his predecessor in office. It is no reply to my argument to say that the Ministry which made that offer are not now in office. I do not think that anybody will seriously contend that the present Government will always be in office. The actions of any Government should be reasonably binding upon their successors. If in the absence of any better reason than the objections of the Premier df New South Wales we reverse our former decision in regard to this matter, it appears to me that we shall afford the best possible justification for the Castigation that has been administered to us, and that our action will be regarded as an open confession that we are not fit to be intrusted with the important issues committed to our care. So far as 1 can judge, the only matter which it is sought to emphasize upon the present occasion has reference to what is alleged to have been a bond entered into by the Premiers of the various States at the gathering, at which it was decided that the seat of Government should be in New South Wales. If the signatories to that bond had attached any special importance to it, it is a remarkable thing that they have never referred to it when speaking upon the subject in this House. MrM c LEAN I am speaking of the Premiers who were responsible for the insertion in the Constitution of the 100-miles limit. We are now told that there was a bond within a bond. Assuming that the matter is worthy of serious consideration on our part, I would point out that the resolution does not define what is meant following session. Upon that by a "" reasonable distance "" of Sydney. and this Honourable members must recollect that when we speak of a "" reasonable distance "" the term is used in a relative sense. limit qualify that view of the matter? MrM c LEAN It merely indicates that the Seat of Government must not be too near the capital of any State. The Constitution itself describes accurately the area within which we are free to select a site. What is that area ? It consists of the whole of New South Wales outside of the ioomiles limit. If fhe Premiers had seriously intended that! that resolution should further circumscribe the area within which we were free to select a Federal Capital, would not the Premiers have embodied that fact in the Constitution? Is it to be seriously contended that there was an implied compact amongst the Premiers which further restricted the area prescribed by the Constitution, within which we are at liberty to make our selection ? Does any one argue that it would have been a proper thing to withhold that information from the people of the Commonwealth when they were asked 1 to accept the Constitution ? If when a Constitution had been placed before them, stating in clear language the area within which we were free to select a site, there had been a secret understanding that that area",30,Groom

I cannot believe that any of the Premiers responsible for the insertion of the 100-miles limit in the Constitution would be capable of misleading the people in that way. If there had been any understanding amongst them that the area available for the selection of the Seat of Government should be less than that prescribed by the Constitution, what' would have been easier than for them to specify in that document, say, that our choice should be limited to an area not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and not more than 200 miles? Under the circumstances, I attach no importance whatever to the resolution which has been referred to. I think it was adopted in its broadei sense, to show that the Capital, be1 ing within New South Wale's territory, would be within ""a reasonable distance of Sydney. Another argument urged during this discussion is that the Federal Capital should be so located that the whole of its trade would necessarily pass through Sydney. To my mind, that is a most extraordinary contention. In order to realize its full effect, I would ask honourable members to bear in mind the sacrifices imposed upon the other States by the Constitution. We all know perfectly well that the establishment of a Federal Capital, which ihcludes making provision for a proper water supply, for the construction of railways, and for other requisites, will involve an expenditure Of several million pounds. tablished on some sites it would. select will within a very few years involve us in an expenditure of several millions sterling. In addition to that, we all know that great inconvenience and disability will result from establishing the Seat of Government in a bush capital. Every official connected with the Commonwealth, 1 who will be compelled to reside there, must reconcile himself to living in a remote locality, with all its attendant disadvantages. Why are we asked to submit to all these sacrifices? The one and only reason is a desire to prevent any of the existing States capitals securing a monopoly of the benefits accruing from !the establishment of the Federal city. ton had no right to mislead the people of New South Wales. for his statements. people. cient of Sir Edmund Barton to satisfy me that he would not wilfully make a misleading statement.

To contend that the Federal Capital should be so situate that the whole of its trade and all the material advantages accruing from it must necessarily pass through one citv is to urge that we should make it impossible to attain that for which we are to spend millions of pounds, and to submit to immense disabilities and inconvenience.' We are to give to one city all the advantages flowing from the establishment of the Capital, so that it will be in the same position as it would be if the Capital were established there. Had we been asked tq arrange for an amendment of the Constitution, which would make it possible to establish the Capital in Sydney, there would be some reason in such a proposal; but to ask us to give up to Sydney all the advantages accruing from the Federal Capital., and at the same time to submit to the inconvenience and heavy expenditure invblved in the establishment of a bush Capital, ostensibly for the express purpose of insuring that no city shall enjoy a monopoly of the advantages of that Capital is to ask us to do something that would be unworthv of this Parliament. will find one-third of the cost of establishing the Capital! at issue. ber will not mention that fact. will find the money, and New South Waleswill have to bear her proportion of the cost. of the total. to pay one-third of the cost, and she asks for all the advantages. in matfers of detail to make any reasonable concession to the wishes of the people of New South Wales.

187,Mr Mclean,"I should be preparedstill believe, that the Federal area should be a very considerable one. I strongly supported the 'proposal that the territory should comprise 900 square miles; but, since that is a matter in respect of which it may be reasonably conceded that New South Wales has a special interest, I should be quite willing to make a fair arrangement with her. The site of the Capital itself should be determined in the interests, not of one State, but of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. It appears to me that if , in deference to a demand from any one State, we abandoned the interests of the whole of fhe people, we certainly should not prove worthy representatives of those who have sent us here; and, as I hold these views very strongly, it is my intention to support the Bill as introduced by the Government. Monaro-Postmaster-General) agree with the remark that has just been made by the honourable member for Gippsland, that the question seems to have narrowed itself down to one of Commonwealth versus State. It appears that we have to decide Avhether one State is to dominate the Commonwealth, or whether as representatives of the different States of the Union, we are prepared to carry out the duties imposed upon us under the Constitution. I think that the honourable member for Gippsland put the position fairly when he said that, if we submitted to the domination of any one State, we should openly confess our inability to discharge the duties intrusted to us. I regret that the stage of the session we have reached precludes the possibility of dealing with this question at that length which its importance warrants, and of giving it! that attention which it undoubtedly deserves. I should have liked, had time permitted, to discuss the relative merits of the different sites, especially as some of those who have preceded me have deemed it wise to make comparisons. There is a well-worn saying that when you have no case you should abuse the other side. Evidently that is the course which the Opposition have determined to pursue. Why is it necessary for honourable members to invariably fall back upon the device of denouncing the Monaro district? Why do they make such exaggerated assertion's in reber to say that they have succeeded in gard to it ? If they sought to compare the climate, soil, water supply, and accessibility of Dalgety with those of other sitesif they entered upon a comparison of the main essentials to a great Capital we should be able to disprove their statements by well-ascertained facts. But they content themselves by saying that the winds which sweep across the Monaro district are keener than those experienced anywhere else in New South Wales, and are prepared to make other statements of the same kind that cannot be reduced to the basis of solid fact. These are the tactics which they pursue. The Opposition to-day are in a very curious position. For some time < pas,t they have been lobbying, and resorting to all the methods known to old parliamentarians to induce the supporters of the other sites to combine in creating a blank in this Bill, their object being to defeat the selection of Dalgety. . But what do we find? Although the Opposition have gleefully told us during the last week that they I quite have a majority-in fact, some of them have the supreme audacity to say that they have a majority to-day-agains t the selection of Dalgety, we know that they are not prepared to test the position by proceeding to a division, notwithstanding that every, honourable member is either present or accounted for in the pair list. orable member knows that the most extraordinary tactics have been resorted to by the Opposition. We have had the leader and deputy leader of the Opposition, the late Postmaster-General, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, frantically whipping with a view to secure the rejection of Dalgety. We have also had the leader of the' Labour Party making appeals to his supporters on personal grounds to vote with him; he has appealed to those who have no strong predilections in this regard to give a vote for the Lake George district. These are the representatives of New South Wales who for the last two or three years have been pretending that they wish this question to be settled, and yet when the opportunity offers itself they are afraid to avail themselves of it. Does not this savour of hypocrisy? What has been the result of the almost superhuman efforts of the leader of the Labour Party, and his supporters on the Opposition benches?

M.r. AUSTINCHAPMAN battle, I am almost alone, fighting with my back to the wall, facing a very formidable contingent, and surely I am not to be expected to fight with my fists, so to speak, when others are armed with tomahawks ! It is a difficult task for me, unaided, to meet the tactics of the honourable .members to whom I have referred. But, after all, it would seem that there was no ground for my anxiety, since no change has been wrought in the views of honourable members. I believe that the honourable members to whom I have referred have been ably assisted by my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, but, notwithstanding his extraordinary threat that he would not speak to certain honourable members if they did not vote with him, not one vote has been shaken. No one accuses the leader of the Labour Party of being influenced by anv improper motive, but I find that in one respect he is only second to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has. never been able to make up his mind as to the most suitable site to select. My honourable colleague has voted for every site except that in the Monaro district, and the leader of the Labour Party has also voted for four different sites, and now proposes to drag in a fifth. It has been suggested that I stand by the establishment of the Capital in the Monaro district simply because it forms part of my electorate. I repudiate that suggestion. I stand by it because I honestly believe it to be the best site, and those who make the suggestion should not lose sight of the fact that Lake George, under the new boundaries, will probably be included in EdenMonairo; if .not, it will form pant of the new electorate, the representation of which will be contested by the leader of the Labour Party and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. No doubt the. people of that district will be saying, "" Conroy has been representing us for years, and little has been done. Look at what Watson is, doing."" I do not wish to impute motives, but if the honourable member for Bland were influenced by such a consideration, his position could be easily understood. The honourable member made an elaborate statement this morning as to the accessibility of Lake George. It is worthy of mention, however, tliat DalgetyI think that the honoris, nearer Sydney than Tumut is. cessible. be at present, as Tumut has railway communication; but with a railway from Cooma, about twenty-five miles, easily constructed,, it will rival Tumut, in fact, beat it on the score of accessibility; besides, there is the magnificent port of Twofold Bav, which will he brought into touch with the Capital at Dalgety, by railway, and then it will be easily first as far as accessibilitv is concerned. Another point is that the climatic conditions of Dalgety are more favorable than are those of other suggested sites. When I attempt to put that fact before honourable members, I am met, in some cases, by the suggestion, fhat the winds which blow over the snow there are colder than those on the other side of the mountain; that the water on .the other side is purer, and so forth. Any statement which cannot be met by registered ascertained facts is thought good enough to use against the Monaro site. It is. absurd for the Opposition to contend that the rich Monaro country is poor soil; and I ask if it be true that the soil of Southern Monaro is inferior to that of other sites, how is it that the Commissioner's estimate that the cost of resuming land there will be much greater than it would be in the case of other sites, especiallv wben manv of the other sites are highly improvedl, while Monaro is almost virgin country, and valued at its prairie value? It is all very well for the leader of the Labour Party to urge that Jervis Bay would be a far more suitable nort than is Twofold Bay, but the difficulties in the way of Teaching Jervis Bay from anv southern site are twice as great as are those in .the way of connecting Dalgety with Eden. is that I am familiar with the district, whilst the honourable member for Lang has never been there. interjection I have inquired from every speaker what site he favours.

I am not foolish enough to think that we shall come to a division on this question, because honourable members who are opposed to Dalgety are afraid to do so, knowing that the numbers are against them. Bill will have to go over until next session, though, if I could have my way, honourable members would have to spend their Christmas here, or come back directly after Christmas, in order to settle the matter. New South Wales has been weeping and wailing for a long time because there has been no settlement, and has had a great deal to say about the selfishness of Victorians, who desire to keep the capital in Melbourne ; but now I am the only representative of that State who wishes to press the question to a division. thinks that the numbers are with him. that they are. The leader of the Opposition, when in office last year, told us that l.e would oppose, by every means in his power, the rescinding of the vote arrived at by Parliament. This is what he said in answer to a question asked by me, which the honourable member for Parramatta advised him not to answerThat is a question of seiious importance, which I hope will never have to be considered. I hope that those who have this matter at heart, w i ll rest At any satisfied that the Government will loyally regard the decision of this Parliament, unless it is rescinded, and, so far as I am concerned, any attempt to rescind it will meet with my strongest opposition. Minister. as Prime Minister he should be looked upon as a man whose word may be taken, but if he goes back on what he stated then, he cannot be absolutely relied on again. In his memorandum to the Premier of New South Wales, he stated that the decision of this Parliament was final and conclusive; but now he is entering into an intrigue for opening up the matter again, although, like other representatives of New South Wales, he has been protesting that he wants the matter settled, and has been crying out against the wicked Victorians. It seems to me that the policy of the Opposition in this matter is one of win, tie, ar wrangle. The Capital must be located where they wish to see it located, or not chosen at all. Time will not permit me I know what is to go into the history of this matter, and show how it has been dealt with by conferences, conventions, and meetings of Premiers. The leader of the Opposition is responsible for the ioo-mile limitation which exists in the Constitution, and we, in MonConsequently the aro. owe him our thanks for it, because, without that limitation, Sydney would have been chosen. "" A reasonable distance from Svdney"" is a very different thing from "" within a reasonable distance of Sydney."" The New South Wales Government appointed an able man, in the person of the late Mr Oliver, to exhaustively inquire into and .report upon the sites suitable for a Federal Capital, and. he placed the Monaro site first. Then a Commission of experts, was appointed, and honourable members visited the various sites, with the result that this House selected Bombala, and the Senate, Tumut. It is beyond doubt that the Dalgety site was included in the Bombala site, and the plans now on the table show it included within an area marked -round by a red line. If it was not intended to offer Dalgety as a site, why did the State Government reserve the land there,",34,Groom

No doubt, honourable members wlio are opposed to Dalgety will say that it is the fault of the Government that there has been further delay in this matter; but if they do say so, they will brand themselves as political hypocrites. The Senate is determined to stand by its selection, and nothing will be gained by delay. I do not intend now to deal with the special report on Dalgety, or the method in which that site was -chosen. opinion, the Parliament having determined that the Seat of the Federal Government shall be at Dalgety. cannot go back upon its determination. If it could do so once, it could do so as often as it pleased, no matter what expense may be incurred. Under section 125 of tihe Constitution Act we have determined the Seat of Government. We have filled the blank in the Constitution, and I contend that before we can alter that we should have to amend the Constitution. Of course, I speak only as a layman; but my opinion is backed up by that of some of the most eminent constitutional lawyers in the country, and, if an attempt were made to go back on the present determination, the point will certainly be tested in the High Court. The Premier of New South Wales, when in Opposition, supported the Monaro site, and wished the Parliament of New South Wales to accept it, but they refused, and passed resolutions offering us certain sites, of which Dalgety was not one. The dispute now has come to be, not about the relative merits of available sites, but one between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales. Are the representatives of the other States going to submit to that? New South Wales is fully represented in this Parliament, and expression was given to the views of her people before the Dalgety site was chosen. In the first instance, five out of the six senators repregold buttons, and States public servantssenting the State had a good deal to say in favour of the Dalgety site, though I do not propose to quote their remarks. It will be better done by the friends of Monaro in the Senate. The Premier of the State, instead of continuing to support the Monaro site, is opposing it merely in order that he may be on the side of the big battalions. How and when were the resolutions which were recently passed by the State Government concerning the treatment of the State by the Federal Government carried through? First of all. the resolutions were submitted to the House of Assembly at the fag end' of the session. After a few honorable members had spoken in favour of them, and one or two honourable members against them,, the Premier, for some reason or other, applied the ""gag,"" shut up the leader of -the Opposition, and would not allow anything to be said on the other side. As aconsequence, a number of honourable members trooped out of the Chamber, and not half of the total number voted for the resolutioni. Mr Carruthers has the big batIn my talions behind him, and if he considers that he has achieved any victory he is welcometo all the satisfaction that may be derived from the thought. NowI wish to say a word or two as to the circumstances under which the resolutions were submitted to the Legislative Council of New South Wales. At 9.30 o'clock in the evening, the Hon. Dr. Nash asked the leader of the Government in that Chamber whether it was proposed to proceed with any other business, and he was told that only another Bill had to be considered. After Dr. Nash had left, the resolution to which I have referred wassubmitted, and was supported mainly by strong anti-Federalists, such as the Hon. Dr. Maclaurin. A number of members had gone away, under the impression that there was practically no more business to be done, and the Government apparently warned only their own supporters to be present. Therefore, the resolution was carried without division. Now, let us inquire as. to the reasons for this treatment on the part of Mr Carruthers. One can easily understand that he is in earnest, if he believes that thosehonorable members of this Parliament whosupport the Dalgety site are, as he hasdescribed them, escaped lunatics. If that be his opinion, he must have very strong objections to our legislating upon any subject. Mr Carruthers also mentioned something about Federal public servants having silver buttons. He remarked further, "" The cup of iniquity is full to overflowing ""whatever he may mean by that. In effect, he says: ""You must give us the Capital where we want it, or we shall, secede from the Commonwealth."" The honourable member for Dalley recently told us that unlessNew South Wales was allowed to do as she pleased with regard to the Federal Capital -unles s we obeyed the instruction of the State Parliament-the representatives of that State in this House would walk out of the Chamber in a body. We are told! that the Dalgety site will not* be granted under any circumstances, and that New South Wales has not yet begun to fight. Mr Carruthers intends to submit some questions to the electors by means of the referendum. Some of us will have a word or two to say with regard to the answers to be given to those questions. I suggest that we might also be allowed to have a voice in the framing of the questions. We might ask the people what Mr Carruthers has done to carry out his promises with regard to reform. He has accused us of hustling the State Governor out of his quarters in Sydney, and we might ask the people whether they require a State Governor, or a huge State Parliament, such as they now have. These are among the questions that I would recommend Mr Carruthers to submit to 1 -the people. Mr Carruthers has accused this Parliament of extravagance, and has attempted to show that it was not fit to 'select a site for the Capital. In every case, however, his charges of extravagance have recoiled upon himself. Whatever his object may be, he is endeavouring to drag a red herring across the trail, and his satellites here have evidently made up their minds to talk out the B i i l. They find that they cannot coerce this House into doing what is required by the Premier of New South Wales. I ask thcwe honourable members who are prepared to do Mr Carruthers' bidding-wh o stand to attention when he lifts his finger, listen to what he says with great respect, and then hasten to carry out his instructions-whethe r they are prepared to endorse his statements with regard to the High Court? Some time ago, 1 Mr Carruthers asked us to refer a case to the High Court. He sent his Attorney-General over here, and after the matter had been gone into between him and my honourable colleague the Attorney-General, with a view to paving the way for submitting a case to the High Court, the negotiations fell through, owing to the indisposition of the New South Wales Government' to pursue them to a conclusion. Now Mr Carruthers says that the High Court is not to be trusted. He maintains that our Justices are not honourable men. He makes a statement which I am sure that even his unblushing followers in this House are not prepared to endorse. ing-ar e they not capable of blushing? orable member is now one of them. I hope that, .as a supporter of Mr Carruthers', he will play a more noble. part than he has done as a leader on this occasion. It is beneath his dignity as a great party leader to beg of his supporters to back him up in the choice of another site. Notwithstanding his great influence, and the respect 'and liking which his supporters have for him, they were not moved by his representations. All his efforts resulted in miserable failure. It is not very pleasant to have to say these things, but this is the time at which it is necessary to speak plainly. We respect the honourable member for his high qualities, but his best friends must recognise that he has made a great blunder. Success will excuse many things, but when a man descends to tactics such as those pursued by the honourable member, and fails miserably, nothing is to be said in his favour. I am sure, however, that notwithstanding the mistakes he has made, he is not prepared to endorse the statements of Mr Carruthers with regard to the High Court. At this stage, it is necessary for us to ask whether New South Wales really wants to have the Capital Site fixed. "" no."" and nearly all the representatives of New South Wales in this House say the same. They are in no hurry. But I would warn them that the gun may be loaded. If it be possibleI maintain that it is not, because we have already determined the matterto create a blank in the present Act, honourable members who are seeking to secure the selection of Lake George will find themselves left in the lurch. Already many honourable members who are absent, and who have been urged to vote against the measure, have stated specifically by wire that they are in favour of knocking out Dalgety, but that they are not prepared to fill up the blank at present. They want delay, and they are not prepared to make any definite selection. I assure honourable members that if Dalgety is knocked out, the Tooma site will find strong support. tralia. e orable member had not a word to say when that site was being condemned by his leader last night.

The irritation Avhich has been engendered by the delay which has occurred in the settlement of this question is well warranted. For the benefit of honourable members who express astonishment at the statement made by Mr Carruthers, I quote the folloAving extract from the Age neAvspaper of 8th October, 1903: It is very well that the public can look on and thoroughly understand the squalid meaning of this nefarious game as it is being played by the New South Wales members. The public interests are as nothing. The finances of the Federal States aTe a bagatelle. Queensland is told that its Federal revenue of next year will be ,£100,000 short of this year's return, Victoria's share w ill show asimilar falling off, and. Tasmania and I only South Australia are in a like proportionate plight. In all the States every £1,000 of reI venue is of particular value; and yet at the instance of one miserably jealous and greedy State, intent on feeding its vanity at the expense of all others, this project of launching the Federation into millions of useless outlay is persisted in. If anything could add to the disgust which an average patriot must feel at this senseless and sordid rush into an immature choice of a national capital, it is the spirit of levity which Mr Reid and Sir William McMillan brought to the question of procedure yesterday. Honourable members will note the use of the term ""miserably jealous and greedy State."" Upon this question I do not think that the Age represents the opinion of the people of Victoria. I believe that they are just as anxious to see effect given to the compact Avith New South Wales as are the electors of that State themselves. No honourable member AVIIO knoAvs anything of the situation will deny that the people of New South Wales are irritated by the delay in the settlement of tliis question.

It is just as well that' I should say the worse that can be said about myself. If because of the attitude I take up on this question I am to be regarded as a member of the "" Cabbage-tree mob,"" let it be so. If , on the other hand, it be said that I belong to "" the Geebung push,"" let it be so. Some of our so-called comic journals would so describe those who fight for the settlement of this question; but I am not afraid of such opprobrious terms being applied to me. I am fighting for my native State. It is admitted that the Conference of Premiers agreed that the Capital -should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney, and I would remind the House that the parties to that agreement are rapidly passing out of the public l if e of this country. To-day we have with us but three of them-the Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava, and the leader of the Opposition. Two other parties to that agreement have passed away from this mundane sphere, whilst the right honourable member for Adelaide, the remaining party to it, is unable just now to take an active part in politics. Two out of the three who are in the House to-day agree that the arrangement arrived at was that the Capital should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. leader of the Opposition have said so. contradicting another statement. statement made by the leader of the Opposition that that was the agreement. a statement to which .the leader of the Opposition was referring. -"" a reasonable distance from Sydney"" bore the interpretation that might ordinarily be attached to them, and I am told that the right honourable member for Balaclava takes the same view. Everv day we are drifthimself did not know until a day or two ago ing farther from a proper comprehension what was in the agreement arrived at by the of this agreement, and unless this question Premiers. be speedily settled we shall have new politicians stepping into the arena, and saying that they are not responsible for an agreement made by others. This Bill simply proposes that the Commonwealth shall ask for that which the original Act demands. In the Seat of Government Act we have a clear demand for a certain site and certain territory, but in this B ill we simply propose to ask the Parliament of New South Wales to grant the site and territory. This is the result of the action taken by the New South Wales Legislature, and I think it is an admission that' the people of that State are entitled to be consulted. The honourable member for Gippsland has a strange conception of what is the meaning of the words ""a reasonable distance."" Apparently he would say that' a site on the Murray was within a reasonable distance of Sydney. The views of some honourable members appear to be determined by those of the Age. The idea of the editor of that journal is that his front window should overlook the Capital; he seems to think that he must take care that it is close to the editorial window lest it might suddenly pass away. When the proposal that Tooma should be selected was und'er consideration, the Attorney-General moved an amendment extending the area down to the Murray. That was another source of irritation. My reading of the feeling of the people of that State may be bluntly stated. Others might be disposed to use more diplomatic language, but I say, plainly that the view of the people of that State is such that if an agitation for secession were properly conducted by public men, 220,000 out Of 300,000 votes would be cast in its favour.

239,Mr Kelly (Wentworth),"In the firstthis Parliament. He admitted that the people of that State were very strongly opposed to Dalgety, and relied on the mistakes which he asserted had been made by the Premiers of New South Wales, as sufficient reason to ignore the present agitation in that State. His advocacy of the Bill savoured strongly of partisanship, as did also that of the Attorney-General, who spoke as an Age leader, apparently because he is not able to speak as a leader in this Chamber. The Postmaster-General endeavoured to engender a great amount of heat in regard to Dalgety, but he could not induce anything more than an artificial glow with regard to that notorious freezing chamber. He told us that only those who had a bad cause need abuse the other side, and he forthwith proceeded to violently denounce every other site than that within his own electorate. We can all admire the earnest advocacy of the Minister, but we cannot admit that Dalgety would be an acceptable site for the Federal Capital. It does not commend itself to the good judgment of two-thirds of the members in this Chamber. Under these circumstances, we should pay no regard to any mistakes that may have been committed by the State Ministers or by the people of New South Wales, to the aspiration of the Age or its creatures, or to the very natural indignation of the Postmaster-General. It is our duty to 1 consider the bond, which we have to honour not only in letter, but in spirit. That bond was entered into under peculiar circumstances, which I do not propose to recapitulate. But for the arrangement embodied therein New South Wales would never have agreed to enter the Federation. Therefore, it behoves us to consider, not only the provisions of the Constitution,"" but also the circumstances which led up to their adoption. Honourable members have had before them during the course of this debate the actual resolutions arrived at at the Premiers' Conference. It was the spirit of those resolutions which induced NTew South Wales to enter the Federation. led the Federation. honourable, member knows, did not enter the Federation until those resolutions had been adopted. Mr .KING O'MALLEY -It was the South Wales Premier who submitted the first motion in favour of Federation at Hobart. [248]2 that matter. The particular resolution to which I am alluding readsIt is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left for the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause so that, while the Capital cannot be fixed in Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. The Constitution substitutes for "" at a reasonable distance from that city ' ' the words "" not less than 100 miles from Sydney."" The resolution declared that the Seat of Government should not be at Sydney or in its neighbourhood. The words of the Constitution clearly express that idea, bull explain how near it may be. That is the bond to which we must give effect. What is the position at which we have arrived ? We are now told that "" not less than 100 miles from Sydney"" may mean 300 miles from that city. In the same way we are assured that "" not less than 100 square miles "" of territory may mean 900 square miles. Under such circumstances, is there not considerable reason for the very strong flame of discontent which is burning in the mother State? Some honourable members have made a very great point of the necessity for access to the sea from the Capital. We have been told that if it is located in the centre of New South Wales, that State may unduly influence the Commonwealth by refusing her people access to it. The Attorney-General originally supported the Welaregang site for that reason. Dalgety were out of the way. General agree to put it out of the way? member will agree to the substitution of Welaregang. General agree to excise the word "" Dalgety"" from the Seat of Government Act, and to allow honourable members to fight for the selection of whatever site they may choose ? At the present time, I would point out, the Commonwealth is absolutely dependent upon the good-will of the States to carry on all its agencies. Our Customs and postal officials would find it absolutely impossible to discharge their ordinary duties New if anv State refused to permit them to do s,o.

The Government have approached this matter as if they were dealing with a hostile Power. The Minister of Home Affairs has asked for a report upon the best means of securing access to the sea from Dalgety, the strip of land to be fifteen miles wide. Surelyi f what is required is merely legal access, the Commonwealth does not need more than a fifty-foot roadway. In conclusion, I say that it is our duty to settle this question as quickly as possible, and to settle it in such a way as will secure for New South Wales a proper recognition of the spirit of the band. In this connection, honourable members should recollect that they are the trustees of the word of honour of the States' to the people of New South Wales. That fact should induce us to hesitate before we disregard the attitude taken up by one of the parties, to that compact. All the world over the word of an Englishman is accepted as the hall-mark of honour. I trust that as Britishers we shall endeavour to prevent the word of honour of the States being violated, and ithat iwe shall' give effect to the constitutional compact in a way that will be worthy of the best traditions of the race to which we belong. that some of the attacks that have been made upon this Parliament by a section of the Sydney press and by certain New South Wales politicians have been entirely without justification. So far as I am concerned, I have never exhibited the slightest disposition to shirk a proper consideration of the Capital site question. When the matter first came up for discussion, I was willing to allow the Constitution to be amended, so as to permit of Sydney being made the Seat of Government. That, however, was not. acceptable to honourable members, and consequently I voted for a site which, in my judgment, is the most accessible one. I hold that accessibility must be regarded as a most important factor in determining the selection of the future Federal Capital. It seemed to me that Lyndhuist was by far the most'accessible site available, and hence I supported its claims. At the same time, I do think that Lake George is a most suitable locality from the point of view of accessibility, climatic conditions, character of the soil, &c. I intimated that opinion upon the occasion to which I refer, and the honourable member for Darling and myself discussed the wisdom of moving an amendment in that direction. We found, however, that it was then impossible to test the question. Now that the matter has been revived, I intend to give effect to my opinion by voting for the selection of Lake George or some other site in the vicinity. I read with very great pleasure the temperate letter signed by the honourable member for Bland, whicli appears in the Age this morning, and I listened with exceeding interest to the speech which he delivered today. It seems to me that he has made out an unanswerable case in favour of the selection of Lake George. From a Victorian stand-point, Dalgety is about as inaccessible as is the South Pole. The same remark applies with equal force to Tasmanian and South Australian conveniences. As a matter of fact, it is not readily accessible, even to the representatives of New South Wales. During this debate, a great deal has been said in reference to the need for the site whicb we select possessing an ample water supply. T'""do not attach so much importance to that question as do some other honourable members, because I believe that as a rule it is cheaper to take the water supply to a people than it is to take people to a water supply. That is the experience of the world. 1 would further point out that the expense of constructing a railway to Dalgety from Victoria would in itself amount to nearlv £2,000,000. I shall not detain honourable members any longer, but whenever the question is tested, I shall vote for Lake George or some other site in its vicinity. External Affairs) -It is with very great reluctance that I take part in this debate, because I am obliged to address myself to the question of the Federal Capital Site under adverse conditions, or else to forfeit any opportunity I may have of uttering some, at all events, of the views which should be expressed in this connection. I had hoped That the discussion would have proceeded for a sufficient time to enable me to extricate myself from the tangle of obligations which are incidental to the closing days of a session, in order that I might giVe consideration to a few aspects of this question which would enable me to deal with them in the manner in which they ought to be dealt with if they be referred to at all. But as both leisure and",44,William Have Been Preaching Secession But It Would
247,Mr Robinson (Wannon),I think,45,William Have Been Preaching Secession But It Would
248,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister ofStrength have failed me, I can only offer an apology to honourable members for the limitations within which J. shall be confined when treating a question in which I have always taken the deepest interest, and upon which,it seems to me there still remains something to'be said. The request has been preferred more than once during the debate, that we should no longer revive the past, or delve into its records, but that from this moment we should begin afresh, ""look only at the future, and consider the question of the selection of a Capital Site upon its bare merits. That would be ai most pleasant course to pursue, if it were possible to take it. But, unfortunately, this subject comes before us associated with' recent criticisms of our acsent as a malignant attack upon our own tion-criticism s which render it necessary simply for the purposes of defence that we should point"" out that the accusations levelled against us-on e and all of them can be met by a simple citation of the circumstances which have led I do not propose to detain the House by attempting to tell that oft-told tale, but it degree reflecting upon ourselves in common is unfortunate, having regard to the short memories of the public, that the hasty and partisan views presented to them obscure the essential details which go to show that the invidious reflections that are cast upon the Commonwealth Parliament and its Government are. not warranted by the plain facts. Indeed, were I to undertake the task, I should require to occupy no inconsiderable time in disposing of the fictitious and unjustifiable charges that are now accepted as fair statements in this case. We are told that in connection with the choice of the Capital Site there has been deliberate delay. That statement is absolutely unjustifiable. We are warned that there is opposition to the establishment of any Capital, and that charge, again, with some minor exceptions that do not call for notice, is equally unsupported. It is alleged that the representatives of Victoria are responsible for procrastination in determining the question. Tliat is a statement which, if it be true of any individuals., is not true of the great majority of the representatives which Victoria has or ever had in this Parliament. We are also told that the aim has been to retain Melbourne as the Seat of Government. That certainly has not been the object of tlie great bulk of the representatives of Victoria, although it may have been the aim of individual Victorians outside. Finally, we are assured that the obstacles that have strewn the path to the choice of the Federal Capital Site have been due to hostility to New South Wales. That charge, I repudiate more absolutely, and with more warmth, than any other. I am not conscious of such' a feeling, either among those who have supported sites that I , myself, have approved, or among those who have opposed them. On the contrary, it a.ppears to me that we have always felt that slander or censure upon the people of New South Wales,, or of any other State, are slanders and censures upon ourselves; that we are so allied that, just as we claim to share any qualities deemed worthy of honour which they possess, we should repeople any such censure as we are supposed to have passed upon the people of New South Wales. Australians are in blood, breeding, manners, habits, traditions., tastes, and aspirations, one people, and it is not possible for us to point the finger of scorn up to the present a position. at any section living within the boundaries of any one State, without in the same with the rest of the people of the Commonwealth. A simple consideration of the facts will disprove each and every one of the allegations, now so commonly and so lightly made. Had my physical strength and leisure permitted, I should have undertaken to offer to honourable members some of the mass of evidence that goes to support that contention. But my present purpose will be served if I invite honourable members for a few moments to look the facts in the face, putting aside any prepossessions that may exist concerning them; and endeavouring to view them in something like propel proportion. At present, matters that are perfectly irrelevant have been exalted, and a consideration of the particular question that we have before us to-day has been obscured, I regret to say, by the introduction of a number of points that have no real association with the Capital Site. A detailed reply to these would in itself occupy the whole of the time that I feel warranted in taking up. The Premier of New South Wales, in recently moving certain resolutions, avoidedand this ought to be frankly admitted-per sonalities of all kinds. He made no attack upon any member of the Federal Parliament, or any individual. Had he excluded' from his criticism his references to a number of matters affecting our relations 7406 with his State, some of them trivial in themselves, but all incompletely stated, or wanting in supplementary information, he would have aroused less feeling, and enabled us to concentrate our attention more closely upon matters that are really serious. These irrelevant allegations-allegation s which were intended! to show some prejudice against New South' Wales, some willingness to do an injury to that State, ortotreat it uncidental, accidental, and unjustifiable fairly-ar e numerous and of mixed quality. Some of the causes of complaint have admittedly ceased to exist. They have been removed by the Commonwealth without pressure from outside. And yet these relics are added apparently to swell the sum total, as it seems to me, without any just plea that could be urged in defence of such a course. Some others, such as the charges made with reference to the Customs Department, have been answered by authentic documents, and statements. Others, again, are due to misapprehensions. I do not for one moment suggest that the Premier of New South' Wales has wilfully misstated the facts. But in the story which he tells, even of so simple ferent mamner of dealing with that great a matter as. the case at law between the Commonwealth and the State, with reference to State imports being dutiable, he conveyed an entirely erroneous impression. the States. but his statement of the circumstances connected with the case, which we did not pursue-because , in the meantime, the High Court had been established, and we held that it was the tribunal which should finally determine that question if it thought fit-is, unintentionally, no doubt, of a misleading character. The papers from which I have refreshed my memory, serve to show that this is so. If time permitted, and if it were necessary, at this juncture, to deal with the complaints made against the administration of different Departments in relation to the Government of New South Wales, I have no doubt that I could satisfy not only this House, which may be considered biased, but also the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales itself, that they were due either to misconception or misconstruction, or that they form part of regulations that have to be dealt with by us upon a Federal basis and on Federal principles. Where that course has to be followed, it may at a particular time appear to bear more harshly upon one State than upon another. In a great Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. continent like Australia, with its communities reared, so to speak, under different, policies, and subjected, therefore, in different degrees to the influences of the legislation which has been passed by the Commonwealth, that is inevitable. No task would be easier, although it"" is one in which I do not desire to engage, than topresent a complete refutation of the incharges that have been associated with the main question embodied in the measurenow under consideration. For obvious reasons, I have to brush these aside, witb hardly a word of explanation. I am perfectly willing, either this session, if it be possible, or next session, to lay uport the table of the House particulars in regard to every one of the matters alluded to that will, I venture to say, disclosein no single instance a trace of biasagainst New South Wales. I am surethat those particulars would not indicateon the part of the Commonwealth a difState than has been adopted by us in regard to every other State of the Union. At times we have to take action that is not altogether palatable to the States Governments. It may be that sometime* we take action when it is unnecessary, but in many instances our duty requiresus, in spite of our inclinations, to follow the course which we think necessary to give effect to Federal principles. If that annoys any of the constituent States, no one regrets it more than we do; but that regret would not be a sufficient excusefor our departing from the course that we believe to be marked out by true regard for our duty. May I say that in this particular, so far as I am aware, there has been no alteration in the attitude I have adopted since the first proposals in regard to a Federal Capital were laid' before the Conventions. The personal reference I am now making, is due to the fact that quotations from speeches of my own have been made by the Premier of New South Wales, and others, which I to-day endorse as cordially as when they were uttered. I was always of the opinion that it was necessary that a FederalCapital should be established; was always convinced that it could not be anappanage to any metropolis, to any city, without injury to the Federal principle and"" to Federal legislation. I was equally opposed to any attempt to place it in my",45,William Have Been Preaching Secession But It Would

If the choice had been left,to a council of dispassionate sages, they might well have found themselves embarrassed by the plethora of excellent sites put forward. It has been my privilege to visit a number of them, of which the poorest has, many excellent qualifications, so that the choice has always been between better and best. Our responsibilities were not to be met merely by the selection of a good site. We had to seek the best available, and to weigh the merits, of all.

The clioice did not rest with us. The Premier of New South Wales had no doubt properly caused us to consume the whole of the session in negotiations, in the course of which we pursued him with offers to meet his wishes in any way that we could. While seeking to meet him, we were driven 1 on to the last month of the session, with all its work and responsibilities-apar t from the struggle in this House, which is fresh in our memories, but which has left us anything but fresh. Surely, then, it is most unfair to suggest that there has been any delay in bringing forward this Bill. right honourable member for East Sydney nor the Premier of New South Wales has any right to complain because we have been compelled to deal with this Bill in the closing hours of the session. A similar course was pursued in the State. The reason for adopting that course was given, and it appears to be sufficient from ithe point of view of the New South Wales Government. But our reason was even' a stronger one. The discussion of the question in this Parliament has been fuller and more direct, and has not been interrupted by any action of the Government. So that, in every respect, we can challenge comparison so far as our methods are concerned with those adopted in dealing with fhe subject by the resolution passed in New South Wales a few days ago. I do not wish to indulge in any recriminations, _ or to make any charges. I am accepting as justifiable the course followed across the border; but, by way of defence of this House and the Government, think I can fairlv claim to have established the fact that neither this Parliament, nor the present Government, nor its predecessors, has ever delayed dealing with this question more than the circumstances have rendered necessary. If we are discussing this question just before the prorogation, it is due to our having pursued, out of courtesy and consideration for New South Wales, the line of conduct suggested to and pressed upon us from that State. Thealternative which has been put to us to-day by one or two honourable members, and which they say is presented by the action of the Parliament of New South Wales, is -one that I am loth to accept. Yet, as it has been put as a -summary of the actual situation, and Mr Deakin. as indicating to us the only possible way-of escape from the difficulties surrounding ity I feel bound to make some reference to it. We are told by at least two of the representatives of New South Wales that the position is this: It is admitted that the Commonwealth has a free power of choice, subject, of course, to the Constitution. It is granted that we are entitled to pick our . own site, but it is claimed that it is the function of the State Parliament, not merely to consent or refuse to give effect to that choice, but to make a choice of sites for itself,, and to submit those sites to us. Furthermore, whilst admitting our right of choice,, they declare that they have the authority tb tell us how we are to choose-in other I venture to say that neither the words, that they can choose how we must choose. Of course, this announcement is accompanied by a repudiation of any attempt at dictation on the part of the New South Wales Parliament. We are free to choose, but we are only to be free to choose if we choose what they choose for us. That is the alternative that has been presented to us, and I venture to say that it is one that this Parliament cannot and will not accept. It could not accept it with any regard for its own dignity, or for the Constitution, and is not to be required t'o do so, either by anything in the Constitution or out of it. We are in one breath censured for not making a choice, and in the next for making one that is not approved. Now the question is, what are we prepared to concede to New South Wales? We were prepared from the first to concede to them the right or privilege to select the sites which we should take into consideration. I do not know that they need be considered to have exhausted that right even now. If they have more sites to suggest, or circumstances in connection with sites already suggested, which they think should be brought under our consideration, I see no reason why we should close our ears and refuse to listen, or close our eyes and refuse to see. to take. under the complex section of the Constitution to which I have referred, there is a double method of procedure open to us by grant, or by acquisition. Possibly it was the intention of the framers of that section that both methods should be brought into operation before the Capital was finally established. <But, whether that be so or not,",50,William Have Been Preaching Secession But It Would

It is a happy enough climate for me to live and die in, but from the ideal stand-point it has defects. If the sessions of the Commonwealth Parliament are to be held in summer, we must seek a site with a high elevation, and where' coo] breezes prevail. the civil servants in the winter. thinking entirely of the civil servants. There are public servants who are not styled civil, but who have to be considered. The first question which we have to decide is as between a summer and a winter city. It is noticeable how honourable members are divided into two sections in that regard. Those who would avoid the heat if they could support one site, and those who would avoid the cold if they could support another. Many of those who favour the claims of Dalgety have been governed in their choice by a consideration, not only of an adequate water supply, but by its picturesque surroundings -its , proximity to the greatest mountain in Australia. Besides, we believe that, in future, summer sessions will be necessary, and while we are associated with the finances of the States,-as I think we shall always be, indirectly if not directly-it is desirable that the financial year of the Commonwealth should terminate at a time prior to the States Treasurers being called upon to frame their Budgets. That, in practical politics, is a very important matter. It seems to me that in future we shall require to hold summer sessions, and therefore we should hold them in the coolest spot that we can find. If honourable members can suggest a cooler place than Dalgety, I have not yet had an opportunity of discovering it. For summer sessions, it seems to me to be as good a place as we can hope to obtain. If , on the contrary, we are aiming at winter sessions, I admit that forcible arguments may be employed against what has been termed a "" wind swept locality "" in the neighbourhood of the snows of Kosciusko, which, however picturesque they may be, would not be admired, perhaps, in June or July. But when we come to consider water supply and climatic conditions, whicli are expected 1 to minister to health, I venture to say that, though other places may equal, we can scarcely find one which will surpass Dalgety. It may not, perhaps, attract those who reside for the greater part of the year in the warm climate of the north, or in the dry, high temperatures of the north-west, but, looking to sanitary conditions generally, I doubt whether Dalgety can be surpassed. With me, the question of accessibility hold's a very much smaller place than it does with the honourable member for Bland and the honourable member for Dalley. In choosing a site, I do not think that we should merely consider ourselves, or the next or the succeeding generation. We must recognise that the Seat of Government will certainly not be more than a small township for many years. I do not know that it will ever be a great city, no matter where we may place it. The question of"" its accessibility appears to me to be a minor matter, for the reason that if we carry out the original anticipations of many members of the Federal Convention, the establishment of the' Capital in the interior will be followed by very short but hard sessions. We shall meet for three months, or, at the outside, for four months during the year. Three months ought to suffice, because we shall sit all day, and practically every day, though I hope we shall not sit too late at night. quire some time to attend to administrative matters. think that they will have to bear their burden in the unsatisfactory manner that we have had to bear it during the past few weeks.

The more I see of the working of Federal institutions, the smaller, I think, is the number of public servants whom it would be necessary to retain all the year in. the Federal Capital for many years to come.

I do not think that there is any obligation in the bond, so to speak, forcing us to select the Federal Capital, now, but there is a strong obligation upon us, as representing Federal constituencies, to go into our Federal household as soon as we can. We are at present depending on generosity, most handsomely extended to us by this State, ancl also an. the generous treatment of other States for the accommodation of Parliament, and of some of our officers. We must remember that we are occupying buildings that are the property of other legislators, and to which, for all I know, they may desire to return. At any rate, it becomes us ?is guests not to remain longer than necessity requires. I fail to sfee any reason why we should remain longer than the time required for choosing a site, laying it out properly, procuring a sufficient water supply, and erecting the necessary buildings, which should be of a temporary character. form the kernel of other buildings. That is the way in which this great building was constructed. In the first place, the two Chambers were erected, then both were connected with the Queen's Hall. Subsequently, apartments in the basement and the front elevation were added. It is quite possible that our buildings in the Federal Capital could be constructed on the same system, but even that may not be .necessary for some years. What is desired on every side is economy, and economy should be observed. The Government have submitted this Bill, as affording both the simplest and most conciliatory method of dealing with the question at this stage. We have been reminded that the Parliament of New South Wales passed certain resolutions about a year ago, and that those resolutions were intended to furnish the basis for negotiations with the Commonwealth. But most inadvisedly, as it appears to me, that basis excluded even from consideration the very site which both Houses of this Parliament had already chosen. That was not only an ill omen for the success of the negotiations, but was in itself depriving the approach of the Parliament of New South Wales of that friendliness and fair consideration that we might fairly have expected. Then, again, in connection with the resolutions carried by the State Parliament only a few days ago, a number of other complaints were introduced, which, as I have said, might easily be disposed of, but which must have inflamed the minds of those who heard them, against the attitude of this Parliament in regard to the question of the Federal Capital. We, on the contiary, when called upon to act, have taken the only course open to us consistent with the previous determination of this Parliament. We have assumed, and feel entitled to assume, that this Legislature has not altered its mind as to the site which should be selected. Moreover, with the exception of the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Government are of opinion that it ought not to be asked to alter its mind. That being so, the Bill submitted proposes to delimit distinctly in metes and bound's the particular territory at Dalgety within which the Federal Capital should be established. We have not endeavoured by this Bill to exercise the full power we possess under the Constitution. We have not raised the question of the authority of the Parliament to proceed on its own motion, and in its own way. Qn the contrary, we have paved the way. for the exercise by New South Wales of the power which that State undoubtedly possesses, to offer to grant to the Commonwealth such an area, within the boundaries set out in the",54,William Have Been Preaching Secession But It Would

The Senate have struck out that amendment, and I do not think that the point is a very material one. They have also re-inserted the provision allowing persons in charge of contract post-offices, as well as justices of the peace and legally qualified medical practitioners, to witness postal votes. I can see no objection to that. contract post-offices are tp be allowed to witness postal votes that will be in contravention of-the principle laid down by the Minister, that only those under the control of the Government should have such t>ower.

I feel very strongly upon this question, because shortly before the session opened I attended a man who was in sore straits, as the result of the development of a disease consequent upon privation and exposure endured while on service in South Africa. I remember when he left these shores-whe n the flags were flying, drums were beating, and women were waving their adieux.

This is one case. and I undertake to say that I could find many others in my electorate who are deserving of favorable consideration. I appeal to the Minister to make some effort to assist this unfortunate man in a way worthy of as great nation. I have only to repeat that I have no objection to the passing of this Bill, although I do not think it should be regarded as a precedent. We should have some proper system of assisting those who suffer in the cause of their country, and I hope that a system will be established that will be a credit to the Ministry and to the Commonwealth. understand that it is proposed to move an amendment providing that the officers to whom this Bill relates shall each receive a pension of £ 2 per week, instead of a lump sum.

All they ask is that he may be paid a gratuity for injuries received, on the testimony of a Medical Board. The matter has already been twice before us. A former Government promised to give it consideration, but would not undertake the responsibility of recommending the payment of an honorarium. I have nothing to say against that decision J but had I come to a similar decision in regard to an officer who had done admittedly good service, T should ha.ve been only too glad if the House had felt disposed to view the matter more favourably, and had determined to pay a gratuity.

It has beenstated publicly that Colonel Price has threatened to write a book, but no attempt should be made to appease him, or to prevent such action, by granting, him £500. If the Government have fhe numbers, of course they will carry this measure; but, to be consistent, they should include all similar cases. duce a Bill to deal with similar cases. consideration for men who have no political or social influence to bring to bear.

Moreover, we know that when one Minister refuses point blank to grant a request, his successor always considers he is justified in following his example. many appeals that have been made to Ministers of Defence on behalf of men who were crippled as the result of injuries received in South Africa. Their applications have invariably been referred to the States authorities, and any appeals made at the present time would be treated in the same way. Honourable members have the fullest justification for opposing this proposal, because, according to the statement made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, one of the most careful Ministers of Defence that we have ever had, Colonel Price received special -consideration. -extended beyond the retiring age, and he was paid in full, notwithstanding that he was unfit for duty for a considerable period.

External Affairs) -The honourable member for Moira does not appear to be so well Are the Government prepared to acquainted as we aie with the history of these cases. In the first place, it was proposed to pay compensation to certain officers upon their compulsory retirement from the Forces. Colonel Price was included among the officers who were entitled to a gratuity, but he elected to accept an appointment in Queensland,, his term of service being extended beyond the retiring age to permit of bis doing so. Upon his retirement from the service it was proposed to pay him an amount of .£800, which, in v?ew of all the circumstances, was regarded as a fair sum. That proposal, however, was withdrawn. It was suggested in this House that if the amount of the gratuity were reduced to the sum recommended by the Medical Board, honourable members would approve of the grant. When the Medical Board recommends that compensation shall be paid to privates who have been rendered unfit for further duty owing to injuries received whilst on duty, the Executive makes the necessary grants without any previous reference to Parliament. tablished their claims? I know of in which gratuities have been paid to privates, even during the short time that this Ministry has been in office. The honourable member asks why we should introduce the Bill at this late stage of the session. On a former occasion, the discussion which took place led us to suppose fhat if the proposed gratuity were reduced to the amount recommended by the Medical Board as compensation to Colonel Price for injuries received whilst on duty in Australia, the grant would be made without demur. I would point out that the injuries for which compensation is to be given are altogether apart from those received His term of service was by Colonel Price in South Africa.

However, the Minister now assures me that they will be paid out of the Commonwealth funds. That fact makes the wisdom or otherwise of their payment an Australian question. I hold that Colonel Price-and I am speaking with no enmity whatever-was , in receipt of .a large salary for a very long period, and that he should have been able to save a certain sum of monev. I regret that he was not able to do so. The party to which I belong have always advocated that when a person becomes too old to earn his livelihood he should be granted an old-age pension. The State of Victoria occupies, an almost unique position in that connection. Her Public Service old-age pension claims amount to more than those of the rest of Australia and New Zealand combined. bearing on the rights of these officers. that those who have not been, privileged to obtain a pension should be assisted to get one. New South Wales does not pay half the amount which Victoria annually disburses in pensions. If we are going to grant pensions to persons who are unable to work, they should be granted upon an equitable basis. The honourable member for Darwin has suggested an amendment for the payment of the grant of £ 5 0 0 in each case in yearly instalments, or, failing that, 2 that we should provide for the payment of a pension which would keep the recipients from want. I should have no objection to the payment of a pension if it were placed upon a fair basis. Eveni f I were lacking in feelings of humanity, I certainly should not object to assistance being granted to Lt -Col. Bayly, who is suffering from one of the I understood that a most painful diseases known to the medical world. But the point remains that there are many others suffering from the same disease, contracted under circumstances It is Commonwealth expenequally as honourable as those under which Lt -Col. Bayly became a victim, ancl I am sure that the Minister will agree that the most generous consideration should be extended to these people. Society, unfortunately, is most brutal in its treatment of the young and the old, and the party to which I belong is seeking to make life a little easier for those who have had the roughest times. The Treasurer said very truly that Colonel Price followed a very dangerous calling. I agree with h i m ; but I have here a small pamphlet, entitled The Tragedy of Toil, written by John Burns, a member of the present British Ministry, in which it is shown by figures that cannot be controverted, that the profession of the Army is less dangerous than most other occupations. Mr John Burns points out that, as compared with the dangers of mining, those attaching to service in the Army are a mere bagatelle; and that, as compared with tbe dangers associated with any calling in which ""lachinery is required, they are as nothing.

T h a t fact has no I feel confident, however, that the Minister will extend as much sympathy to thosf. in It has. It is time the lower ranks as any other honourable member is prepared to do.

432,Mr Maloney,"I know of many priIt has been stated by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that the agreedebate on the Estimates of the Department between Colonel Price and the authorities was fair and square, and that when he went to Queensland, Colonel Price absolutely understood the terms and conditions upon which his appointment was made. I admire the man for determining to go to Queensland, notwithstanding that he might gain but little by doing so. The desire to fill the post of commanding officer in one of the States, before finally retiring from the service, was certainly a most laudable one. But, so far as I have been able to examine the papers, 1 am not prepared to say that he was entitled to the sum of ,-£1,160 to which reference has been made. I believe that two successive Ministries refused to entertain his claim for £400, in respect of an accident suffered by him whilst on his way to Queensland. When Major-General Hutton said that Colonel Price was entitled to something like £1,600, I think that he was under a misapprehension-that he included in the total sum of ,£1,160, the amount of ,£400, in respect of which a further claim has been The honourable and learned member for made. On the 14th May, 1902, an offer was made to Colonel Price to become Commandant of Queensland. At that time the colonel was in his sixtieth year, and, by the rules governing the Defence Department, he would have been retired at a certain date. Major-General Hutton, however, permitted him to have two years' extra service. Had he remained in Victoria, that permission would not have been extended to him. but it was allowed in order that he might have an opportunity to secure the higher post of State Commandant of Queensland. rubbish is good enough for Queensland. thing of the kind. I have more reason than has any other honourable member to know that nothing can be said against Colonel Price so far as his physical courage is concerned. At one time. I had a very serious quarrel with him, but I never questioned his personal courage. I believe that lie is possessed of those qualities that go to make good soldiers and leaders; but I certainly object to the suggestion that he is the bravest of the brave. He may lie amongst the number, but some of the rank and file are as brave as any who -ever handled a rifle or marched a step. I i was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, during the ment of Defence, that I n June OT July, 1902, Colonel Price actually proceeded to Queensland, and the CommonweaUh Gazette of 18th July, 1902, contained the notification of his appointment as dating from ist JulyPrior to that, the General Officer Commanding had written the following minute: Please assure Colonel Price that I can only regret that under the regulations of retirement for age it will be impossible for him to hold any active command under the Commonwealth after the age of 62, which he w ill , I understand, attain on the 21st October, 1904. It will thus be seen that Colonel Price is now sixty-three year9 of age. The General Officer Commanding went on to state that I propose to recommend Colonel Price as a special case, to be retained in the service for two years, from the 21st October next, when he, in accordance with the date of his birth given in the gradation list, attains the age of 60. Corinella went on to point out thatSix weeks after Colonel Price had entered upon his command in Queensland, the honourable and learned member for Corio asked the honourable member for Hume-wh o was then acting as Minister for Defencea question as to whether any compensation was to be granted. The Acting Minister replied that he was then considering the question. The importance of this fact lies in the circumstance that at the time Colonel Price went to Queensland, the most that could have taken place was that Major-General Huttonand Colonel Price alleges that this is so-ha d said that the retiring officers were , to receive gratuities. I may add that Major-General Hutton contradicts that statement, and asserts that what he promised was that he would do his best to obtain the gratuities, but that the question of granting them would depend upon Parliament. understands that we are not now dealing with that point. All that has been abandoned. that, if the question of these gratuities does not come up in one way, it must come up in another. It reminds one of the legend of the hydra with the many heads, any one of which when cut off was immediately succeeded by two others. Major-General Hutton's recollection of thc incident is different from that of about five or six omcers.",66,Price And Bayly Compensation Bill Second Reading

437,Mr Crouch,"It, is unfortunate that of memory. Colonel Price carried on from die ist July, 1902, and in October of that year he raised the question of gratuities. The honourable and learned member for Corinella pointed out on the occasion to which I refer that on the 29th October, 1902, the right honourable member for Swan, who was then Minister of Defence, wrote the following minute:I consider that, so far as the Government is concerned, Colonel Price's case is the only one in which the Government is committed, and in his case only to a limited extent. to avoid any misunderstanding in cases like that of Colonel Price, it is absolutely necessary that the General Officer Commanding should not make any promises to recommend officers for advancement, & c , until he has obtained the approval of the Minister. The Treasurer interjected that that was a general statement. to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.""] pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Corinella that, as the result of further correspondence, the then Minister addedI am unable to make any promise as to whether any gratuity will be paid to him on his retirement, as the present appropriation of gratuities to retiring officers and men was made on the distinct understanding that it should not form a precedent. That is a fair answer to the statement that, if he had not gone to Queensland, he would have been entitled to a larger retiring allowance. On the 30th October, the right honourable member for Swan wroteA copy of my minute should be sent to Colonel cases quite as hard as that of Colonel Price. Price, so that there may be no misunderstanding Let me mention one which was referred to on the retirement question. That minute was communicated to Colonel Corio in 1903. Price, who, on the 5th' November, wroteI also note tliat I am given the opportunity of retiring on gratuity on 31st December. Apparently, hacl he retired on that date, he called attention to his case, and I have no desirewould have received' his salary right up to to be bringing it up constantly, but I find that it the time of his retirementFrom a sordid point of view the latter would have been the course which I should have accepted, but careful consideration has caused me Major Coffey, because he is dead; but he has to feel that so long' as I am able to give my serleft a widow and five children, who are deservvice to my country pecuniary considerations ing of some consideration.

The Minister wrote on the 16th' NovemberI have told him that no promise can be made, so that he can have no cause for grievance with me if his hope is not realized. To that Colonel Price repliedNotedI shall have no cause of grievancei f I do not get compensation on retirement, but seeing how small the addition to my salary has been, I retain the hope that when my time comes to retire I may receive generous treatment for my past services.

Neither he, when alive, nor his widow could get the slightest compensation from the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth authorities insisted that he was a State man.

I was one of the first to object to the breaking of them. They have been broken disgracefully. Victoria. these promises should cover those responsible for it with infamy. The party to which I belong regarded the South African war as an infamous one, and I think that the consensus of good opinion is now with us. That, however, does not justify the scandalous treatment which our soldiers have received. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said that the amount proposed to be voted is only a small sum, but a similar amount would go a good way if distributed amongst men of the rank and file, and I ask him to assist us in widening the scope of the measure. I shall have to vote against the' Bill as it stands, though I recognise that the case of Lt -Col. Bayly is a very sad one, and. should the Bill be thrown out, would be willing to contribute mv share to prevent his being in want until the end of the recess. But is 'it right to vote money to these officers when there are so many thousands in want? I have come to-day from a dying mother, who absolutely needs food for herself and her children, and whom it is hard to get into an institution. Colonel Price was paid a large salary, and if he is not now able to maintain himself that is a misfortune which is common to many. He should not be allowed to want. No officer or private, and no member of the larger army of toilers outside, should suffer in his old age. The annals of among the workers than among the soldiers. Miners, run many more risks of injury and death than do military men. Therefore, if we are going to make any provision for the officers of our Defence Forces, we should extend the same consideration to others. As the honourable member for Darthat the £500 proposed to be granted to Colonel Price will serve to keep him for more than two years. Therefore, it would be better to make him an allowance that would extend over, say, five years. If fhe House desires to grant pensions, I shall not object, provided that all classes of the community are treated on the same footing. In Victoria, it is considered a crime to apply for a State old-age pension. Some justices, of the peace make it as difficult as possible for the old and helpless to obtain the pensions, which should be granted to them without putting them to any more trouble or inconvenience than is absolutely necess.ary to safeguard the interests of the community. No doubt Colonel Price is a brave man; but the same thing may be said of thousands of others who went from Australia to South Africa. I give him full credit for the fact that whilst he was in command of the Mounted Rifles he insisted that all his officers should graduate in the ranks. He is also to be commended for disapproving of the absurd frill which so frequently characterizes military officers. I think that it would be well for the Government to withdraw the Bill and introduce a more comprehensive measure next session. tend to support the Bill. I have listened very carefully, and with an open mind, to all the speeches which have been made with a view to showing that this is an unjust measure, but I have not heard one argument which belies the statement made by the Minister.

All such cases cam be dealt with by the Executive. been similarly dealt with, because the regulations cover them; but the Minister did not care to accept the responsibility. the case, there is no harm in submitting a Bill in order that honourable members may have an opportunity of judging whether or not the claims made are just. I trust that the honourable member will be able to give some more logical reason for voting against the Bill. Government. hear it. The debate has revealed a weak spot in the Defence administration. I have frequently noticed complaints in the newspapers that just claims have been bandied about between State and Commonwealth because neither authority would acknowledge its responsibility. I have heard of cases without number in which the State Government has met claims bysaying, "" The Commonwealth has taken over all military matters, and, therefore, the State is not liable."" In respect to the very same claim the Commonwealth has returned the answer, "" The matter is one for the State, and the Commonwealth authorities are not responsible.'.' I have long come to the conclusion that the military affairs of this country are managed in such a way that there is little encouragement for men of spirit to enter our service. If the present policy is to be continued, and just obligations are to be ignored by the State on the one hand and by the Commonwealth on the other, very few thinking men will care to enter, or allow their sons to enter our military service. The amount involved in the present case may be small; but an important principle is at stake. It has been clearly shown that private soldiers have not been receiving the same treatment as omcers. never been accused of posing as a Democrat, but I yield to no man in my desire to see equal treatment meted out. could be demonstrated to me that private soldiers were being placed at a disadvantage as compared with officers, by being accorded different treatment, I should be one of the very first .to join with the honourable member for Melbourne in opposing the Bill. I should like the Minister to go further than he has done. I know how easy it is to say that consideration will be given to this or that matter. Consideration is very cheap, and means nothing. I should like to feel assured that every private soldier will not only ""receive consideration"" but -wilt be accorded the same treatment as is being extended to officers; and that they will be compensated in proportion to the pay to which they were entitled whilst they were in the service. It is a matter of great gravity that we should not induce men to enter our service and send them forth to do battle for us, and afterwards neglect them because of some paltry squabble of a constitutional character beI intend to support the tween the Commonwealth and the State. If there is any merit in a claim, and the question is merely as to who should meet it, the Commonwealth Government should ask Parliament to authorize the payment. If the State endeavours to escape from what this Parliament conceives to be its just obligations, we ought to be liberal enough to take upon our shoulders the burden of payment. I should like the Minister to s.ay that he will do his utmost to see that the same treatment is accorded in every case. Question-Th'a t the Bill be now .read a second time-put . The House divided.

No invidious distinction should be made between the two omcers concerned. like the names of the two officers mentioned in this clause to be struck out, and a provision substituted which would empower the Government to pay compensation to all who may be entitled to it throughout the service. It has been suggested to me that the substitution of the word "" Defence"" for "" Price ancl Bayly"" would be a desirable amendment. I think that we should be just as well as generous in this matter. It is admitted that a number of other men in the , Defence Force are entitled to similar consideration to that which it is proposed to extend to Colonel Price and Lt -Coi. Bayly.

The honourable and learned member for Parkes, and one or two others, desired to know to what cases the Bill will apply. There are only two of importance, namely, Nos. 342 and 389. The applications for sealing the patents concerned in those cases can only be validated by the amendment of section 2 of the principal ,Act. The Commissioner gives particulars of the applications on which the acceptance fees were paid too late to permit of advertising and sealing within the prescribed time, but in which no request has been received from the applicants or their agents. These applications are likely to lapse. There are three cases coming within that category. There are also a number of cases in which applications were made, uponi which acceptance fees were paid, and notices of acceptance advertised in the Australian Official Journal of Patents, but in which the applicants, or their agents omitted to pay the sealing fee of £ 5 within the statutory period allowed by section 67 of the Patents Act period allowed by regulation 16 of the Patents Regulations 1904, No. 70. There are twenty-two applications under section 29 which have been refused, abandoned, or withdrawn, & c , 407 in which letters patent have be<n issued,' and fourteen which may yet be complied with.

I wished to sav a few words before the Bill had been finally disposed of. My purpose was to draw attention to a statement made by Mr Denham, the Minister of Agriculture of Queensland, at a banquet held in Brisbane on the ist September last. These remarks by Mr Denham illustrate the ingratitude of certain public men and people in Queensland in regard to the Federal Parliament. The remarks to which I refer were made in the presence of the State Treasurer, the Minister of Education, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Lands, the Home Secretary, and the Chief Justice.

This is the incendiary utterance:Mr Denham, in replying, said he was confident that Queensland would prove one of the most prosperous States of the group.

Perhaps, before that stage was reached, some one of sufficient power and character might arise who would be able to free them from their bonds.

I take this opportunity, perhaps the last that will be afforded to me for some time, of expressing to you, sir, and to the Chairman ot Committees, who is associated with you in presiding over our deliberations, pur appreciation of the invariable courtesy which you have exhibited towards us during the session. It will be admitted on all hands that the conditions under which we. have carried on our work, and the character of the work we have had to perform, has imposed the greatest strain upon this Housea strain unequalled in any preceding session. During the whole of that most difficult and trying and wearisome time, you, sir, have held the scales of parliamentary justice absolutely even, and by your perfectly impartial demeanour, have commanded the confidence of the whole House. May I express also to the Chairman of Committees, who is associated with you, our thanks for his services, and our earnest hope that neither he nor you will suffer from the duties that have been imposed upon you. Nor is it possible for us to forget the officers of this serious obligation when we assured House-thos e who ""sit at this end of the table, and who are of such constant assistance to us; and those who sit at the other end of the table, whose serious task it is to record our proceedings, and' who have during this exceedingly trying time discharged their duties with marvellous fidelity. imposed by constant sitting, during which their whole attention has had to be concentrated on every incident, upon the pro* cedure of the House, and upon the speeches of honourable members, often during periods of excitement and confusion, has been such that fhe accuracy of their record has been really a triumph of their art. Then, sir, we cannot forget the other servants of this House, who, on their part, have been obliged to work for many extra hours, and for long periods, often discharging painful and toilsome tasks. ing of the House? am properly reminded that during these long sittings we have discovered the defects of the qualities of this House. can remember that on the first occasion when I had the honour of holding Ministerial office in the Legislature of Victoria, and sat upon this bench;-it must have been very nearly twenty-five years agoI was questioned by an honourable member sitting in the Opposition corner, who was an expert in ventilation, and who called attention to the vitiated state of the atmosphere. He received on that occasion the usual Ministerial reply, that the subject would be inquired into and the evil corrected. If I have to repeat the same assurance twenty-five years afterwards. I venture to say that there has not been that ""raw haste,"" which the poet says, is ""half sister to delay,"" nor will my effort at improvement be described as one of those radical measures with which I am sometimes associated. May I say one other word to the members of this House. May I venture to thank those associated with me for the part they have taken in one of the most trying, tedious, but fruitful sessions within my experience. I need hardly allude to the utterly unexpected events of the early part of the session which led to a transformation, and threw the responsibilities of government upon us. But we assumed a His Excellency the Governor General by resolution that we were prepared to do the work that lay before us, alleging that there was work to be done, and that we were prepared to do it.

I would like to add a word No occasion has occurred in the history of this Parliament, and certainly of this session, in which any honourable member on this side has had reason to doubt the absolute justice and impartiality of your decisions. We acknowledge not only your justice, but your great patience and consideration for those who in moments of anger or disappointment may have sometimes exceeded legitimate limits. We feel as the Prime Minister does, not only,in regard to yourself and the Chairman of Committees, but in regard to the great assistance and care, beyond what is demanded of them, of the Hansard staff, and! also in regard to the officers of the House. It is scarcely in my province, I think, to join in the congratulations of the Prime Minister on the splendid legislation which he claims to have been passed. There is some of it to which we should feel inclined to take strong exception; but the Prime Minister'and his colleagues are quite entitled to enjoy those conput forth. I shall be pleased now, if I gratulations, seeing that they_ have fathered most of the measures which the House has passed. It is a matter for great congratulation that, although the House has passed through a trying experience in this session I was not here myself to see it, but I know from experience of five-and-twenty years what it must have been, because I have fought and slept through many nights in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales-in view of the trouble there has been over certain measures, it is matter for congratulation that the House is now dispersing with such goodwill amongst all its members. There is apparently not an atom ofpersonal ill-feeling between the members of one side and the other; and it augurs well for our work next session that we should be parting now on such friendly terms. if I may be allowed to do so, that I am exceedingly obliged to the honourable the Prime Minister and to the honourable and learned member for Parkes for the words which they have spoken. I can only add to those words these: .That no Speaker would ever be able to do his duty in the Chair unless he felt he had the support and confidence of the House. That support and that confidence I have always felt that I have had, and in their.possession I have studied to do the best I could for the advancement of the business of the country, in fairness to all those who are members or two iri recognition of the very excellent help rendered to me by the Chairman of Committees, whose aid during the recent prolonged sittings enabled me to pass through hours of great strain. The good work of the officers of the House is known to us all, as is the good work of the officers of the Hansard staff. There ore some persons connected with our duties here who are engaged in offices upstairs. They are not seen, but they have also done very much to facilitate the work of the House in She preparation of its records. To the messengers of the HouseI am sure our very best thanks are also due. I may say that, in response to many requests made to me privately by honourable members, and in response also to some remarks uttered-on the floor of the House, arrangements have been made tq double the usual leave of absence granted to these officers of the House during the coming recess, as some slight recognition of the efforts they have may be permitted to do so; to wish all honourable members the compliments of the season. hend that it is quite out of order for me to make any remarks at this stage, but I feel that perhaps I might be accused of a want of courtesy if I did not acknowledge the very kind things which you, sir, the Prime Minister, and the acting leader of fhe Opposition have been good enough to say. I desire to thank honourable members very sincerely for the. courtesy and consideration! with which they have always been good enough to treat me, and without which it would have been impossible for me to carry out my duties in a way which I could regard as satisfactory. I recognise that during the trying times through which we have passed some irritation has been caused, but I am very glad to believe that it has been of a purely temporary character. I have especially to thank the Temporary Chairmen of Committees for the valuable assistance they have so readily accorded me throughout the session. I re-echo the feelings of indebtedness which vou, sir, have expressed towards the officers of the House, the Hansard staff, the messengers, and all concerned in the carrying on of our business.
