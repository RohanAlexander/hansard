2,Mr Conelan,"Has the attentiontouring Japan, which appeared in thia morning's press, to the effect that the late President Roosevelt, on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, approved of a plan to purchase New Guinea and give it to Japan for its surplus population? Will tiie right honourable gentleman ask the American authorities to' answer that allegation immediately? Sid he also notice the even more serious allegation that President Roosevelt, in addition to making such an offer to the Japanese Government, discussed the matter with the Australian and Dutch Governments? Will the Prime Minister nail this lie, at least insofar as it involves the former Curtin Administration, and examine the departmental files in order to ascertain -whether time evacuees who are liable at any any previous administration' took part in any such negotiations? the statement to which the honourable member has referred, although it was mentioned to me this morning that some such allegation had been made. I can assure the honourable member that neither the Curtin Administration nor the present Government has had any consultation with any one concerning the sale of New Guinea to Japan or to any other nation, and so far as I know there is nothing on record of any previous administration having conducted any such negotiations. Of course, I would have no knowledge of any negotiations that might have taken place with the Dutch authorities concerning Dutch New Guinea. So far as ' the allegation concerns Australia, ' I repeat that I have no knowledge of such a proposal ever having been discussed. If President Roosevelt had made any such proposal I am reasonably certain that it would have come to my notice during the years I have been a member of the Government. I assure the honourable member that there is no danger of the present Government entertaining any such proposal. the extraordinary statement referred to in this morning's cable news. I never cease to marvel at the ingenuity of those who invent such nonsense. Neither the Government of which I was the leader, nor any Australian administration of any political COIOUT whatever, would dream of considering such a proposal. O'KEEFE FAMILY. the Minister for Immigration been drawn to the list of subscribers to the O'Keefe fund sponsored by the Sydney Daily Telegraphi Can the Minister say which of the following subscribers to that fund are natural-born or naturalized British subjects and which are aliens:J. Cassidy, J. O. Cramer, Dr. Maguire, Ah Fat, Lee Jan Sing, William Liu, Soo Hoo Lock, Lee Moon, Sim Hon, Lee Park and Darby Munro? Can the Minister say whether of the aliens who have subscribed to the fund any are warmoment to be repatriated to their native land? of the oriental gentlemen mentioned are liable to be repatriated at any moment, as the honourable member has suggested, because they were war-time evacuees. Some di them are natural-born Australians, but I suspect that a number of the people who subscribed to the fund did so' for political reasons. I . cannot interfere with their rights in that regard. Dr. Maguire, Mr Cassidy and Councillor Cramer are three such, persons. They are members of the executive of the Liberal party, and have used their position for political propaganda. I do not know why Darby Munro, by associating himself with a fund of this .sort, wants 'to get into more trouble than he has been in lately. I have also noticed in the list of subscribers the name of a gentleman who is an alien. I refer to Eugene Goossens, the conductor of the Sydney -Symphony Orchestra. Although he has not been here for very long, he. has apparently been foolish enough to allow his name to he used in this matter. I would have quite an interesting story to tell, if the House, would allow me and I had the time to do so. The subscription list does not contain the names of many people whom the DaUy Telegraph would have liked to include.

Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House what hidden subsidies are being paid by the Commonwealth to meet the losses made by the government-controlled Trans-Australia Airlines? Will he direct the Auditor-General to give special attention to that phase of government activity when making his next report? matter is that the operators of private airlines have received a large percentage of the subsidies. Honourable members would be well advised to study the total amount that is paid to private enterprise. I know of no hidden subsidies that are being paid to Trans-Australia Airlines. Trans-Australia Airlines has made? direct the Auditor-General to inquire into subsidies paid to Trans-Australia Airlines. The duties of that official are specified, and he knows his job and does it thoroughly. I do not propose even to direct his attention to the matter that the honourable member for' Wentworth has raised, because he is quite competent to examine the position. The British airlines have made some losses. On the general subject of subsidies I remind the honourable member that, prior to World War II . , heavy subsidies were paid by the Government of the United States of America to privately controlled shipping lines. It is not unusual for a government to subsidize an enterprise which it believes is operating for the national benefit. Some American shipping lines were heavily subsidized before the war. It is true that the operations of British airlines have resulted in fairly heavy losses, but that is a matter for the British Government and not for the Australian Government. lines has made heavy losses. direct the Auditor-General to inquire into the matter that the honourable member to request him to carry out work that he is quite capable of performing without being asked by me to do so. I repeat that I know of no hidden subsidies that have been or are being paid to Trans-Australia Airlines.

19,Mr Chifley,"I have not heard ofKingdom to-day-wit h the object of discussing a number of matters with me and with the Prime Minister of New Zealand. I. do not know exactly what matters are listed for discussion, and if I did I problimited number of roneoed copies preably would not inform the honourable member in any case. I hare merely been informed that he will visit Australia and New Zealand to discuss a number of matters which the Prime Minister of Great Britain thinks ought to be the subject of personal consultation. for Information say whether the royal commission on the press in Great Britain has yet furnished its report to the Government of the United Kingdom? When the report is published, will the Minister consider the advisability of appointing in Australia a royal commission with similar wide terms of reference to inquire into the actions and unhealthy activities of the press, or at least of a certain section of the press, in this country? the royal commission in Great Britain has not yet furnished its report to the Government. Erom time to time, I have read reports of the evidence submitted to the commission. terms of reference of that body are very wide, and it may be some time before it presents its final report. I am watching the position with great interest because a good deal of what has happened, and is happening, in England has happened, and is happening, in Australia. As soon as the report is published, I shall take the matter to Cabinet in order to see whether it would be wise for the Australian Government to follow the example of the Attlee Government in the United Kingdom, and institute a searching inquiry into the press in Australia. asked the Treasurer when the report of the Auditor-General would be published, and I was informed that it was in the bands of the Government Printer. I again ask tbe Treasurer when the report will be tabled in this House? Will it be done before the Parliament goes into recess? If the report cannot be tabled before that date, will the Treasurer have a pared and made available to the Leader of the Opposition and myself? after the honourable member asked his previous question on this subject, and an attempt is being made to speed-up the publication of the report. I understand that it will be available before the recessperhaps to-morrow or the day after. As many copies as possible will be obtained for the use of honourable members. over the national broadcasting stations that members of the Royal Australian Air Force who are operating in the Berlin air l if t are to be withdrawn. In view of the Prime Minister's promise when he was in Berlin some time ago that Australia would do all it could to assist in the air lift, what is the reason for the proposed withdrawal of Australian airmen? Is it due to any easing of the blockade through the intervention of the Minister for External Affairs; or are the Australians engaged in the air l if t merely to be relieved by The reinforcements? If the announcement to which I have referred is correct,, is the proposed withdrawal due to a. shortage of personnel in the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia? been made that Australian airmen operating in the Berlin air l if t should be withdrawn. It may be that the British authorities who are in charge of the air l if t are making some local arrangement for the purpose of affording leave to those men, or for some other purpose of that kind. The honourable member can rest assured that there is no suggestion of a Government proposal to withdraw any of the Australians who are operating in the Berlin area.

26,Mr Fuller,"Can the Minister forValley will have to vacate their holdings under the Snowy River scheme? Many settlers in that area have made inquiries to me about this matter. to say definitely when settlers in the Blowering Valley will be required to vacate that area. Such a decision will depend upon the recommendations which will be made from time to time by the advisory committee of representatives of the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian which is to be set up in conjunction with the administering authority to co-ordinate work on the various phases of the scheme. Those bodies will plan the work in order to ensure that the -scheme will be developed in stages which will best serve the national interest and enable the fullest use of the power and water that becomes available. I should say that it will be at least ten years before settlers in the Blowering Valley will be required to vacate their holdings. Minister whether it is a fact that applications have been called in the Gazette of the 24th February for female clerks according to the following classifications:--Universit y graduates up to the age of 25 years, ex-servicewomen who are not over 30 years of age and females who have passed the leaving certificate examination but are not over twenty years of age? Does not the right honourable gentleman consider that such discrimination between university graduates and women who hold the leaving certificate but could not enlist in the defence forces is unjustifiable and that equal opportunity should be given to graduate and non-graduate applicants for such positions ? mendation from the Public Service Board the Government decided recently that provision should be made for admission to the Public Service of certain classes of females, particularly for professional work. Applications have been invited along the general lines approved by the Government, so as to ascertain the numbers offering and the qualifications of available applicants. It must not be thought that, because special scholastic and academic qualifications are asked for in certain instances, people without such qualifications have no opportunity to enter the Public Service; but it would not be of much use to talk about improving the standard of education in Australia if the people who receive improved education are not to receive some consideration as a result. I repeat that the stipulation of certain special Governments qualifications does not mean that other divisions of the Public Service are closed to people without those qualifications. It does mean, however, that in respect of certain professional work applicants with the highest scholastic qualifications will receive preference, and thus a standard will be set. The same procedure is followed by banks and other businesses. To avoid taking up the time of the House any further I shall arrange to have a full statement prepared for the honourable member. I can assure him that no unjust discrimination is intended by the stipulation of qualifications of applicants in the particular instance referred to. tion to the Prime Minister which arises from a news bulletin recently broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the effect that the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Dr. Evatt, was reported to have said that the United Nations had adopted a Declaration of Human Rights that included the right of every person to full employment, irrespective of colour, religion or politics. Will the Prime Minister state whether the Australian Government has adopted that declaration ? Does the declaration express or imply the right to full employment of every person, whatever his religious, political or industrial affiliations? Will the Government take action to prevent any person or organization from interfering with such a right? ber knew very well before he asked his question that Australia was a party to the Declaration of Human Rights and took a prominent part in the framing of that particular instrument at each of the",13,Snowy River Scheme

31,Mr Chifley,"The honourable memconferences concerning it that have taken place. I think I can say without fear of contradiction that f u l l employment has been a slogan of this Government and, in fact, through this Government it has become a political slogan in Australia. The Australian Government also led the way in inducing other nations of the world into making f u l l employment almost a plank in the general platform of the United Nations. The Australian Government's activities in the international sphere in regard to f u l l employment go back as f a r as the days of the last appearance of Mr J. A . Beasley at the International Labour Conference, when he fought a very strong battle to have a policy of f u l l employment included in the Charter of the United Nations. A t other international conferences Australia has pressed for the adoption of a policy of f u l l employment as a principle for all governments and all nations that have some regard for human welfare. It would appear as if the honourable gentleman desired to introduce propaganda into the latter part of his question. stated the position very clearly in my answer to the earlier part of the question. The Government stands for f u l l employment for all citizens in the community, irrespective of their associations. People whose associations are not such that they are entitled to employment should be in gaol. to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General by stating that I have received representations from residents of Beauty Point and Sandy Beachi n the west Tamar district of Tasmania who complain that radio station 7 NT Launceston is drowning important broadcasts which emanate from 3LO, Melbourne, including that informative variety programme, the broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament. In view of the increased interest being taken in national affairs that are raised in this Parliament, will the Postmaster-General endeavour to improve the reception of parliamentary broadcasts for listeners in the two places that I have mentioned? If he is unable to do that, w ill he set up another national station in Tasmania, as has been contemplated? Broadcasting Control Board w ill hold its first meeting in Melbourne on the 15th March. B y an act recently passed by this Parliament the board is empowered to re-allocate frequencies, to make investigations into tbe wattage of each broadcasting station and to alter the wattage where necessary so as to bring for the first time in the history of broadcasting in Australia some order out of the chaos that has resulted from the haphazard manner in which the whole system has developed since its inception. I point out parenthetically that the stations in Sydney and Melbourne which were first established have the best frequencies and are very powerful. They have a very great advantage over stations in country areas and stations which later were granted frequencies on the same medium wave band. It may be that listeners in the districts of Beauty Point and Sandy Beach and in other parts of I think I have already northern Tasmania are suffering in consequence of this unfortunate haphazard growth of radj., broadcasting. I am sure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board w ill report in due course on a more logical distribution of frequencies and w ill maka other changes designed to protect the interests of all Australian listeners. All that I have to say about any radio station that blocks out or attempts to block out any transmission from this ParI preface a question liament is that its action is almost treasonable and ought to be dealt with under the Crimes Act. throughout Australia are publishing huge advertisements, which contain the line ""Issued under the authority of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth"", which refer to current high prices and shortages. The advertisement which appears in to-day's press states-If there are 20 articles and 30 people are scrambling to buy them, there's a shortage . . _ But if 10 of the 30 people aire content to wait a little while until 10 mure articles are made, the shortage disappears.",14,Human Rights

That honourable gentleman, I am sure, would have told a different story from that recounted by the right honourable member for Cowper about the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The right honourable member's speech was unparalleled for unscrupulous audacity. He did not tell the facts, but indulged mainly in superfluous nonsense quite unrelated to the measure now under discussion. I shall deal with that matter later. I intend first to say something about tbe sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) in his second-reading speech on this about free measure, assumed the same role as he played when the Australian National Airlines Bill and the Commonwealth Bank Bill were before this House. It was the role of a well-briefed lawyer pleading a case for his client, in return for a fat fee which, on this occasion, of course, will be a fat contribution to party funds. The Government, he said, should pay bounties to shipping companies; but he does not want the Government to have any say in the control of shipping. He wants tbe Government to follow the example of past anti-Labour administrations which poured out bounties and subsidies to private industry. In tbose days, with generous government assistance, huge monopolistic undertakings were established in this country, and were able to pay rich dividends to shareholders whilst the success possible received nothing in return. That is what will happen, and must happen again if the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is followed. The payment of subsidies and bounties to shipping companies would lead to the establishment of shipping monopolies which would pay substantial",16,Australian Nation Al University

Earlier to-day, reference was made in this chamb.er to the cost-plus contract system. Under that system, huge sums of public money were paid out to private individualsCaptains of industry in this country refused to accept contracts except on the cost-plus system. Under that system, of course, a contractor does not care whether his job takes a month or six months, because he is drawing a profit on every £1 that is paid in wages to tbe workers. The payment of bounties or subsidies to shipping companies would be similarly abused. The companies would have no incentive to keep costs dojvnWhat would a shipbuilding organization care how much it cost to produce a ship in its yards so long as the work was being liberally subsidized by the Government? High production costs would be a charge not to themselves, but to the Government. Much has heen said about the great private shipping companies. I invite honourable members to past their minds back to the conditions that existed in the shipping industry immediately prior to the 1914-18 war. At that time no white seaman could get a job on a British ship. The British mercantile marine was almost solely manned by black labour. When British ships were torpedoed by the Germans during the early part of the .1914-18 war, the black crews trampled on white men, women and children in their haste to save their skins. Because of the submarine menace the ships had to be manned largely by whites. That was the state of affairs that existed prior to and during World WarI . correct statement. member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) knows nothing about the subject. I admit that prior to the outbreak of World WarI . the captains, some of the chief officers and some members of the crews of British vessels were whites, but in the main British ships were manned by black crews. That was the great shipping industry established by the private shipping companies about whom honourable members icpposite are so much concerned. If , during ithe 1914-18 war, the black crews .of British ,ships had not been replaced by whites, not a British ship would have -remained on the high .seas .within six months. No fewer than ,60,000 British seamen lost their lives during that war ; but the British shipping .companies made enormous profits. During World WarI . , when Great Britain was fighting for its very existence, and when the allied nations were engaged in a bloody struggle in the cause of democracy, the British shipping companies were bleeding their country and earning huge profits. In the House of Commons Mr Bonar Law said that the shipping companies were making scandalous profits. He said that he held some shares in shipping companies and that in the previous year every £100 he had invested in Shipping shares had returned him £64. sunk as the result of enemy action the shipowners received far more than its original value. vessels were of more value to the shipping companies at the bottom of the sea, than when they were sailing the oceans of the world. Last night the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) had something to say about the British seamen's strike. Notwithstanding the profits made by the private shipping companies during the war and since, and notwithstanding the sacrifices made during the war by British seamen, the shipping companies, without prior notification and while the ships were on the high seas, reduced the wages of seamen by £4 a month. That was the sole reason why British seamen walked off their ships. The seamen however, were starved into submission and were forced to return to their ships and accept the lower wages which the shipping companies had decided to pay. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that the best thing the Bruce-Page Administration had done was to sell the former Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In the course of the justification which he advanced for its action he accused the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr O'Connor) of having been mistaken in",17,Dedman

59,Mr Lazzarini,"That is so. Thethe assertion which that honourable gentlethe Public Accounts Committee in the man had made that the Public Accounts Committee had praised the operation of the line. The right honourable gentleman said that the report from which the honorwas then chairman of the Public able member for West Sydney had quoted was only a minority report, but that is not so. I shall furnish further details presently to demonstrate the correctness of the assertion made by the honourable member for West Sydney. For the moment, however, I shall deal with the assertion of the Leader of the Opposition that the best thing done by the Bruce-Page Administration was to sell the Commonwealth shipping line. Of course, the record of that Administration is so marked by reprehensible deeds that I concede that the sale of the ships may have been the best of a number of bad deeds. The fact remains, however, that the Bruce-Page Administration sold for less than £2,000,000 an enterprise which was worth considerably more than £7,000,000. The disposal of the line was not in reality a sale at all; it was a gifta gift to a criminal, as events proved. The right honourable gentleman endeavoured to show that the line was sold on the advice of the Public Accounts Committee. I was a member of this Blouse at the time, and I recall very vividly the course of events between the time the Bruce-Page Administration was formed and the eventual disposal of the ships. Every Labour member of this House at that time opposed the proposal to sell the ships, and attacked the Government for sponsoring it. Members of the Australian Labour party in this chamber used every constitutional means, including a motion of censure, to try to prevent the Government from carrying out its iniquitous proposal. members of that Administration had been ordered by their political bosses, the people who contribute substantially to party funds, to get rid of the line, and they were determined to do so. Prime Minister, was not prepared to accept the responsibility, on a mere decision of the Cabinet, for such an unjustifiable abnegation of duty. He wanted to ""get out from under"", and he determined to refer the proposal to belief that that committee would furnish an excuse to justify the sale of the ships. Sir Granville Eyrie, who Accounts Committee, twice refused to vote in favour of the sale of the line. WhatI am saying now accords with the official public records, and any honourable member who was associated with the National Parliament at that time knows that what I am saying is true. Sir Granville Eyrie voted with the Labour members of the committee in opposition to the proposal to sell the line. The Prime Minister then sent for him and asked him to go to London as Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. It was well known at the time that the reason for General Eyrie's appointment to that post was the Government's determination to remove him from the Public Accounts Committee. In fact, at the valedictory function tendered to Sir Granville Eyrie before his departure for tbe United Kingdom, he almost said that that was so. Every one knows that had he not been a stumbling block to the aims of the Bruce Page Administration, in his capacity of chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, he would never have had the ghost of a chance of being appointed High Commissioner. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) will recall the circumstances to which I now refer. Sir Granville Eyrie said quite frankly that hie appointment to London was the surprise of his life. He explained that when Mr Bruce, as Prime Minister, asked him to accept the appointment, he replied "" I have not the qualifications for a High Commissioner "". However, he took the view that the Prime However, the Minister had virtually ordered him to go. and since it was a command he felt that he should go. I do not think that the Bruce-Page Government waited for Sir Granville to arrive in London before it resubmitted its proposal to sell the ships But Mr Bruce, the then to the Public Accounts Committee, which had then, of course, acquired a new chairman. However, even under the new chairman, the majority of government supporters on the committee wavered in their recommendation to sell tbe ships, as the honourable member for West Sydney pointed out. Even they had to admit that the line had saved the Australian community substantial sums of money during its operation because it kept shipping freights down. Einally, the committee recommended that the line should be sold because of the hopeless muddle in wbich it had become involved by its managers. The board which had been appointed to control the operations of the line included many incompetents, and the Public Accounts Committee commented particularly on the hopelessly contradicbeen sufficient to send them to the bottom. tory attitude on policy displayed by, and the antagonisms existing between, the members of that board. The shocking mismanagement of the line was one of the main reasons advanced by the majority on the Public Accounts Committee in justification of their recommendation that the line should be sold. That is briefly the story of the events that culminated in the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The right honourable member for Cowper practically admitted that if his Administration had not sold the ships to the shipping line, to which it was ultimately sold, it would have been almost compelled to purchase the vessels then owned by that line because that concern was about to discontinue operations. Talk about ominous threats !Anti-Labour administrations have done everything required of them by vested interests. When the Inchcape shipping combine applied pressure to the Bruce-Page Government either to sell its ships to them or to purchase the vessels operated by Lord Kylsant's line, which was about to discontinue operations, members of the Bruce-Page Administration wilted at the knees. They decided to accept the first alternative, which was to sell the ships, but they endeavoured to camouflage the nature of the transaction and the real reason for it. The right bonorable gentleman also contended that the construction of shipping in this country would be carried out much more efficiently if left in the hands of private enterprise. falsity of that assertion I propose briefly States no longer let contracts to private to recall another incident from the past. member the "" coffin"" ships built by the Kidman and Mayo organization for the Bruce-Page Government. Mr Laezivrvni. Labour members of the Public Works Committee examined those vessels they discovered that the holds had not been properly riveted. For every bolt used to fasten the plates in the hull, twenty dummies were used. It was possible to move a thin batten between the steel plates of the hull without encountering the slightest obstruction. Shipping experts expressed the emphatic opinion that the impact of only one heavy roller on the vessels while they were at sea would have Notwithstanding those revelations the contractors were not placed in the dock to be tried for attempted murder, but instead they were given £80,000 by the Bruce-Page Government to compensati' them for tbe financial loss which they were supposed to have incurred in the construction of the two vessels. We have only to remind ourselves of the protracted struggle that had to be waged by Samuel Plimsoll against the British shipping companies, to persuade the authorities to insist on tbe loading of vessels being restricted to a safe maximum, to realize the ghastly avarice of shipowners. I wonder whether members of the Opposition realize the story behind the introduction of the "" Plimsoll line I shall not relate it in detail here, but merely remind honourable members that Samuel Plimsoll encountered bitter opposition before he was able to prevail upon the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass legislation that prevented avaricious shipowners from overloading their ships to such a degree as to endanger the lives of the crew. In all the ghastly history of unrestricted private enterprise, the most ghastly chapter is that relating to private enterprise in shipbuilding and shipping. Many tragedies at sea may be traced to the cupidity of shipowners, who constructed inferior vessels, and overloaded them. The Labour Government will not tolerate such conditions in Australia.

It statesWhereasi t is desirable in the interests of the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States' to establish the shipping industry in the Commonwealth on an adequate scale and to maintain those industries in continuous operation: I emphasize the word "" adequate"". In both the preamble and the second reading speech which the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) has delivered, the Government has stressed the aspect of defence. It says, in effect, "" We want to maintain a Commonwealth shipping line, and a shipbuilding industry in Australia, because the defence of the Commonwealth requires that those industries be developed and maintained on an adequate scale "". Is that the true reason why the Government has presented this bill to the House? In the past, the Labour party has not been notable for its enthusiasm for defence measures. Prior to the outbreak of World War II . , members of the Labour party resisted attempts by the government of the day to increase the defence capacity of this country. With an impudence and a brazen effrontery which is astonishing, honourable members opposite accuse us from time to time of having left this country unprepared at the outbreak of the war. Yet those who make that charge against us to-day are the very people who resisted our efforts at that time to improve our defences. They voted against the defence estimates, and opposed such measures as the construction of a graving dock in Sydney harbour, and proposals for the introduction of universal military training. Having defied and resisted the efforts of another government to improve the defences of the country in peace-time, honourable members opposite return in later years with a cowardly charge that we neglected the defences of the nation and left Australia virtually unprepared at the time of the outbreak of war. This is the Government and those are the people who to-day display so much enthusiasm, in terms of lip-service for the cause of defence. If honourable members will examine that section of the federal platform and objectives of the Australian Labour party which deals with defence, they will not find any reference to the maintenance of a shipping line for jVr. Holt. defence purposes. None of the matters covered in this bill! have hitherto been included in the policy of the Australian Labour party as part of its defence programme. We must look a little deeper if we are to ascertain tbe real reason why this measure has been brought before us at the present time. The Government's emphasis on defence is to bring this measure-if it can be brought-withi n the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. The real reason for its introduction is to be found in the statement of Labour's platform and objectives to which I have just referred. We must go back a few years-bac k as far as the honourable member for Werriwa went if we are to ascertain the real purpose behind this legislation because it is necessary to look back into the history of the Labour movement in order to find the true explanation. In November, 1920, the Communist party in Australia was formed by Mr J. S. Garden, a gentleman who has achieved certain notoriety in other directions. That party immediately began to gain such influence in the unions that the federal executive of the Australian Labour party was compelled to make concessions to it. At the 1921 congress, which was presided over by the president of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, the present Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who was also president of the Australian Labour party at that time, the socialization of industry became an objective of the Australian Labour party. The socialization of industry, production, distribution, and exchange is still set out as the first plank in the platform and objective of the Australian Labour party. I shall try to bring closer to our times the many developments that occurred in the intervening years. Ignoring those earlier developments, we come to the federal Australian Labour party conference of 1943. Although during most of the intervening period Labour had been in opposition, and had had no opportunity to implement this federal objective, it was always in the forefront of its platform, and at election time each of its candidates was required to pledge that he would support that objective, and would implement it when lie had the opportunity to do so. Following the general elections-of 1940; when Labour' was elected to office with the support of two independent members, tbere was an evenly divided Parliament and ifr lacked tbe authoritynecessary to go ahead with its programme at. that time-. But in 1943 there was a landslide vote to Labour and the opportunity to carry this part of the programme into effect arrived^ Labour party conference of 1943, a resolution was carried that a nation-wide campaign for socialism be started immediately, and that the implementing of the campaign be left in the hands of the federal executive. Then events moved faster. The following' year further decisions were made and' on the 15th June, 31944, the Standard', the official paper of the Australian Labour party, reported that the annual' Australian Labour party conference of New South Wales had decided to draw up a ten-year plan for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and' exchange in logical stages'. In November, 1945, at another federal Australian Labour party conference in Canberra, it was agreed that the Australian Govern1 ment, ih co-operation with the State go^ vernments, should giveconsideration to the Despite the specious protestations of the Government that this' measure has been introduced in the interests of Australian -defence; and to keep Australian industries going, it is to the fulfilment -of the pledged objective of the Australian Labour party that we must look for the true explanation of the measure before the Parliament. Under the heading "" Methods as to how that objective is to be achieved, nationalization of shipping has been given a very high order -of priority. It follows closely the statement about the nationalization of banking. Developments with regard to that important aspect of nationalization are fresh in the minds of honourable members. That has a direct bearing on the legislation now before us. Before the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), his Cabinet, and the Labour caucus adopted legislation to nationalize our banking system, they knew as clearly as could be known that the people of Australia did not want, that legislation, and, in fact, that they were bitterly opposed to it. Despite the clear indication that the people did not want it, they pressed on with the legislation in this Parliament. tion:? At the Australian State election which was fought entirely upon the issue of the nationalization of banking, and as a result of which Labour was annihilated in Victoria. There was also a clear indication at every public opinion poll conducted! in this country. I do not think that, even the Minister for Defenee( Mr Dedman), who is notorious in this House for his own misrepresentation and misstatements of fact, would' be so brazen as to allege that the people of Australia wanted' the nationalization of banking. with shipping ? The Government, knows* f u l l well that the people of Australia do not want, nationalization, of shipping, and Government members have been at great pains; during, the course of this debate to assert, nationalization of industries'. that this measure will not result, in the nationalization of the; shipping industry. that as I continue. As I have, already said, set out in the forefront of the. policy of the Australian Labour party,, and given a high order of priority,, is the statement that nationalization of shipping is one of the methods whereby the pledged objective of the Australian Labour party shall be effected. Yet now it is brought under the heading of defence to counter Opposition arguments that this proposal is for the nationalization of the shipping industry. The word "" adequate"" has been used frequently. The Government refers to the maintenance of shipbuilding on an adequate scale, and the establishment of a shipping line on a scale adequate for defence purposes. However, when we analyse the legislation we find that the word "" adequate"" has no meaning unless it means, in effect, to have a monopoly, a",21,Dedman

Honourable members opposite have boasted of the effect of the Australian -Commonwealth Line of Steamers in keeping down freight rates. The honourable member for Werriwa and others -claimed that it was only by promoting one of the members of the Public Accounts Committee that the government of the day was able to obtain from that committee a report recommending the sale of thc line. I have thc report before me, and 1 find that, during the period the matter was under consideration, there were on the Public Accounts Committee at various times thirteen members of tbe Senate and House of Eepresentatives. There was a minority report, it is true, by three members, but the majority report recommended as follows:Wliiistf u l l y recognizing and appreciating the invaluable service rendered to Australia by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers during the war years and thc immediate post-war period, and the influence which it has throughout exercised in reducing and restraining freight rates, the committee considers that the benefits now accruing to the country by its existence as a governmental concern are more than outweighted by the heavy losses already sustained, and which, it must be reluctantly admitted, are likely to continue. Moreover, if any shipping line is tn remain in business, it must progress, and new and up-todate tonnage must be acquired. A t present the seven ships comprising the Commonwealth fleet are being run little short of their utmost capacity-and yet, no provision has been, or can be, made for their replacement, or for additions to the fleet, unless by a special vote. Tlie expectations of Parliament when it passed the Shipping Act iu 11)23 have been far from realized, and the results of the trading of the Hne serve to prove how unreliable forecasts and estimates are in the shipping business. Raving regard to all the circumstances, therefore, the committee is of opinion that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers should not be retained as a direct governmental activity. The best thing that could be said about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers is -that it had some influence in keeping down freight rates. The line was operated under a government drawn from parties which now sit on this side of the House. However, when we have shipping operations conducted by a Labour Government, that Government has to admit losses by the Commonwealth Shipping Board of £10,000,000 in the last three years. But have we had a corresponding benefit in lowered freight rates? On the contrary, freight rates have soared to phenomenal heights since the Australian Shipping Board commenced its operations. Whereas in 1939 the freight rate from Melbourne to Sydney was 22s. a ton, to-day it is 67s. a ton; and people living in Western Australia now have to pay for the transport of manufactured products from the more highly industrialized State of New South Wales, a freight charge of S8s. a ton. compared with 43s. a ton in 1939. Yet, the Government brings before us legislation for the continuance of shipping services which have shown those colossal losses and have found it necessary to continue to increase freight rates to the levels I have indicated. It is a tragic record; and one would have thought that rather than perpetuate it the Government would have taken the speediest action to wipe it out. The shipping shortage and the high freight rates which we are experiencing at present cannot be laid entirely at the door of the instrumentalities to which I have referred; and my criticism is not directed primarily to them. If we were obtaining the same rate of output and effort from those who are manning the ships and working on the wharfs as we got in 1939-and I do not believe that anybody with knowledge of the conditions at the time would claim that that is a fanciful standard-w e should have very little difficulty in conducting our shipping operations on u proper basis and reducing freight rates very considerably. It is in that respect that the Australian Government must accept its full measure of responsibility for the conditions which we are now experiencing. I propose to deal briefly with several specific provisions in the measure which are illuminating, as they reveal the kind of thing we can expect in relation to not only this industry and the coal mining industry but also other industries as the Government's policy of socialization sweeps wider and wider. Clause 15 sets out the powers, functions and duties of the Australian Shipping Board. The board is to establish and operate shipping services in general terms, but, particularly I invite the attention of honourable members to the many occasions on which the Minister is to be brought in to give a determination on some matter which is likely to arise. There are numerous sub-clauses of that clause and practically every one of them makes requisite the approval and authority of the Minister before the Australian Shipping Board can act. No doubt we have our own notions as to the capacity of individual members of the Parliament and of the Government to carry out their duties as parliamentarians and as members serving for lengthy periods in the Cabinet and, at the same time, attempting to do a day to day job of administration in connection with our maritime services. ""Without elaborating that aspect at great length, I shall place on record a comment made in relation to another industry, but with respect to a similar problem by a very experienced and distinguished public servant in this country. I quote from a statement made by Mr A. B. Corbett, who was formerly Director-General of Civil Aviation, in a letter which he addressed to a number of public bodies after the Government had decided, in 1944, to nationalize the airlines of AustraliaSpeaking as one with over 44 years' experilosses which it expects will be incurred ence as a civil servant who, for many years held executive positions in two great Commonwealth departments, I say that political interference and control of the detail work of airline operations and management must inevitably lead to disaster arising from delays in his second-reading speech but to which in decisions, lack of funds provided promptly at the right time, lack of knowledge, and permitting political expediency to override efficient management. Nothing can prevent political interference and disorganization in any industry owned by the Government in which untrained and inexperienced ministers assume the role of managing directors, and override the advice of trained executives. That is a statement with which all of yards elsewhere in the world, particularly us who have had any experience in these English shipyards. The Minister said matters will whole-heartedly agree, but tbe Government has completely ignored that a subsidy of up to 25 per cent, will it in this instance. Far from giving be given in order to meet the differenceto the Australian the authority it requires to carry do not know why a limit of 25 per cent, out the great responsibilities which was fixed, because it is quite clear that will devolve upon it, the Governthe difference between the cost of ships. ment in almost every instance gives to be constructed in this country and that to the Minister authority to decide what of ships which will be obtainable elseis, or what is not, to be done. Clause 15 where will be very much morecontains another interesting provision than 25 per cent. That statement isMr Holt. which is without precedent 4n my experience of legislation. Although a similar provision may have been included in legislation of which I am not aware, it is sufficiently rare at any rate to be unfamiliar to me. The provision to which I refer empowers the Australian Shipping Board to recoup the losses which it will sustain from time to time. That provision is made in anticipation of the losses which the board will incur. It gives, in effect, a blanket cover to the board in respect of any failure which may arise as the result of its operations. One can readily appreciate that the Government has good cause to take action along those lines, particularly when it has before it the losses incurred in governmental trading activities during the last three years. But what a shameful confession of failure! What an abject acknowledgment by the Government that it is beaten before it starts, that it will be virtually impossible to conduct shipping operations at a profit, when, instead of following the normal practice of asking the Parliament to make appropriations to meet losses incurred from year to year, it gives a blanket indemnity before the event for hereafter! I come now to an important provision which was mentioned by the Ministerno reference is made in the bill itself,, that is, the provision dealing with thesubsidy to be paid by the Government to shipowners who purchaseships built under the Government's programme but have to pay a priceconsiderably in excess of that for which they could buy similar vessels from shipShipping Board between costs in such circumstances.

I wish merely to confirm all that previous speakers on this side of the House have said. socialism by stealth, by backdoor methods, without even the common decency and honesty of giving reasonable compensation for what is to be acquired or ultimately destroyed. The Government is establishing another costly government department, and perpetuating its system of government control. It already has special tribunals for stevedores, special tribunals for sailors, a special board to control shipbuilding, and a special board to conduct the servicing of ships. I say that the people of Australia, including many good Labour party supporters, are alarmed at this trend of Government policy. They are alarmed to discover that one in every three male employees in Australia is now employed by one government or another. An honourable member opposite has interjected that the figure is one in four. I am referring to male employees only, and the figure is one in three. member desire a diminution of postal and other services? me off the trail by mentioning some government activities in which labour is absorbed. I do not challenge what has been done to provide government utilities, because the need for such provisions must be faced realistically, and because governthe protection and security of the people ment utilities are here to stay. I do say, however, that the time has come to call a halt in the present expansion of government activity, and in the grabbing by Commonwealth departments of the labour and materials so urgently required by the community for other purposes. Not only are there so many men employed in the Public Service who might otherwise be engaged in productive and developmental work in the community, but also 30 per cent, of the total national income is now passing into the hands of the Australian Government and is being disposed of by governments. That fact stimulates the inflationary trends that we are now experiencing,, and forces up the prices of commodities in Australia. It denies the opportunity for money to be spent on developmental services. What return do we get, as a This particular provision is community, from the Government's hugeexpenditures on various activities? We get a loss experience that has becomealmost universal-losse s on our airways,, losses on the control of shipping operations, and even losses on our railways,, which have enjoyed a monopoly for so many years and which, having all the advantages attached to government ownership, instead of improving their financial position are moving further downhill. In the last year for which I have been able to obtainfigures,the aggregate losses of Australian railways amounted to £7,700,000, a figure more than double the losses of the previous year of operation. ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! The honourable gentleman has exhausted his time. Honourable members opposite, from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) down, have demonstrated Iby their opposition to this bill that if they were in office Australian shipyards would again decay and die as they were allowed to do by Liberal governments before the last war. Our primary producers would then be again left unprotected against exploitation by the shipping combine. Honourable members opposite have also shown that tbey are more concerned with protecting the privately owned shipping companies and bank monopolies than they are with in war-time, and their economic welfare in peace-time.

That is why it has introduced the present measure. The Government intends that never again shall we experience the appalling conditions that existed in Australia at the outbreak of the last war, when this country faced a dangerous situation. I am astonished that honourable members opposite are again taking up the old attitude that it is not the Government's business to interfere in anything at all. They say that everything should be left to irresponsible bodies and groups over whom there is to be no control. But in time of trouhle-and the Leader of the Opposition often prophesies war at any moment-the y make no preparations to meet such trouble. It is rather unfortunate that the honourable member for Fawkner has stressed his view that the present Government is not notable for having taken defence measures in the past. I shall remind him of a few instances in the past when defence measures were not taken at a time when his party was in power. I remember his party's opposition to a project for the defence of this country-the establishment of an air force. An election was fought on that issue. I remember the stories that honourable members opposite told the people. Tbey said that we were cutting the painter with Great Britain. ""What was their motive in saying that? They uow accuse the Government of concealing the motives that have impelled it to introis contemplated as part of a defence duce this bill. They say that the real motive is socialization, not the defence of Australia. ""What was the motive of the Opposition parties in opposing the establishment of aerial defences for this island continent, the only logical method of defence, which was proposed by the late Mr John Curtin? air force in Australia. parties did no such thing. I publicly supported the formation of an Australian air force, and the Opposition parties hurled at us the accusation that we wanted to cut the painteT and drift away from Great Britain although the establishment of an air force was obviously within our financial capacity, whereas we could not have afforded to build a fleet to match the only fleet that menaced us. The Japanese fleet was very strong, and we could not have hoped to develop a comparable naval force. The Labour party's policy was vindicated. The anti-Labour parties wanted to buy aircraft overseas, just as they now want the Government to buy ships overseas. in Australia. that if the Opposition parties ever return to power in Australia they will allow the nation to drift back into the state of unpreparedness which they tolerated before World War II . In spite of their past record of neglect, members of the Opposition parties now brazenly proclaim that they are the only ones who are prepared to defend Australia. What aerial defence did they provide for Australia before World War II . ? They arranged for the purchase of about twelve seaplanes, which were never delivered because they were needed in Great Britain. When Australia was cut off by sea during the war, we were left unprotected. We had practically nothing with which to defend ourselves. In the light of tbe facts, it ill becomes the honourable member for Fawkner to describe as a specious plea the Government's assertion that the establishment of a shipbuilding industry and a strong mercantile marine measure. We want the proposed shipping authority to be established so that we shall have a good standard of vessels and an adequate fleet should the need to defend Australia arise again. Honourable members opposite are trying to confuse the issue by declaring that the Government's plans are not related to defence. Its motive is a good and genuine one that will have the support of the people. Have honourable members opposite no vision, apart from the prospect of profits for those people who provide their party funds and support them politically? Have they no concern for the future development of Australia? Mr Archie Cameron interjecting.",28,Dedman

79,Mr Mcleod,"I warn the peopleber for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) prophesied that the aeroplane would never be of ,any use for the defence of Australia. The less that he says on this subject the better it will be for himself. Members of the Australian Country par,ty are equally guilty with members of the Liberal party in opposing this measure. They should be fighting on the side of the Government to secure the passage of the bill. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), for instance, who claims that he represents the interests of the primary producers, wants to hand shipping over to a private monopoly so that the primary producers can be exploited. the Australian Country party. Many years ago, the organization to which the honourable belongs opposed the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. member gave his support to that movement. Nevertheless he is now prepared to rise and say that the line was of no use to the farmers. He will have to account for that to his farmer friends. Another unfortunate statement made by the honourable member for Fawkner, from the political point of view, was that the Government envisaged financial losses from the operation of the proposed Commonwealth shipping line. The honourable gentleman based his assertion on the fact that the bill provides that any losses sustained by the new shipping board will be made up by the Treasury. There is a very good reason for that provision. The test to be applied in the controversy regarding the respective merits of government enterprise and private enterprise is the question: Which system will give the best service to the people? The answer lies in the fact that private enter_ where such a course is necessary to serve the prise will give no service unless it can draw handsome profits. The honourable member for Barker knows that and will agree with me. Private enterprise will never willingly undertake any unprofitable business. We must plan for the development of Australia, but private enterprise will not assist us to do so if it cannot make profits. That is one of the main reasons, apart from defence considerations, for the introduction of this measure. We need great shipyards in the South Pacific. Honourable members opposite would be eontent if the nearest shipyard were somewhere in the vicinity of the North Pole. Of course the people will have to pay for any financial losses sustained by the new snipping line, but they will be moTe than repaid by the results that will accrue from the development of our continent. We must provide shipping services for people who live in isolated parts of this great land. Such services would not provide profits for private enterprise. Nobody would expect them to be profitable. Nevertheless, we cannot isolate such people from the rest of Australia if we are to develop the it finances nation. There must be financial losses, and the Government must bear them. They will be a cheap price to pay for member for Gippsland the development of Australia. Honourable members opposite complain No doubt the honourable that all government enterprises operate at a loss. The fact is that private enterprise refuses to operate unless it can make profits. It will not provide essential services otherwise. It wants to have the cream of everything. The Minister for Defence statedThe existence of the Commonwealth line will enable the Government to provide shipping services to areas that have not previously been adequately served or that may need additional services for developmental purposes. Vessels of the Commonwealth line may also be used, if necessary, where they can assist in the policy of decentralization which has been agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States. The use of ships in trading of this nature is not financially attractive in the early stages, and private interests are often reluctant to provide ships for such purposes. The Government does not intend that financial considerations alone shall prevent shipping services from being provided where it can be shown that they are necessary, and provision is therefore made in the bill that the Minister may direct the board to establish a service 'requirements of a particular area and is desirable in the public interest. Therefore special provision is made for the financing of such services. The honourable member for Fawkner objects to that and is already forecasting financial losses.

If one believed everything that honourable gentlemen opposite said one would think that private enterprise always flourishes and government enterprise languishes. Let us examine how private enterprise fared in those days. The Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was not the only shipping line that incurred losses. The committee reportedTo show tliat the Commonwealth was not alone with regard to the position of its shipping activities, the Prime Minister pointed out that many shipping companies which had been formed in Great Britain when abnormal freights were being earned had not only lost their capital, but, when wound up, had owed to their banks two, three or even four times as much as the value of the asset upon which the banks had advanced the money. All the old-established shipping lines, notwithindicate the source of the information, and standing their strong reserves, had had to refrain from paying dividends or had paid them by drawing on reserves accumulated over many years. opposite have argued that the Australian shipping line should have been disbanded because it was incurring losses.

Press Criticism -Unfai r press criticism and a tendency to give undue publicity to any matters, adversely affecting the Commonwealth Line and its operations, exercised, it was stated, an influence on its business. Instances were quoted in evidence of the prominence given in the press to happenings of a detrimental nature on Commonwealth steamers, whilst similar episodes on other vessels were not mentioned. The Committee itself had specific example* during its investigation. In one case a paragraph appeared in a Melbourne paper that passengers on a "" B a y "" steamer had complained that the food was poor during the voyage. The editor was asked if he could whether the names of the passengers were u va ilable, but a reply was received regretting that, although he had inquiry made, no such particulars could be furnished.

94,Mr Bowden,"We 'should not heshould answer some of the comments that have been made in regard to it. Last night the right honourable member for Cowper completely answered every false statement in regard to it that had been uttered by honourable members opposite. Those statements were not merely about something of which they had just thought. Indeed, I have listened to statements of that kind for the last twenty years. Last night they wore proved, as they have been proved repeatedly during the last twenty years, to be false. They are used again only to provide favorable election propaganda for the Labour party by which it is hoped' that the people will be deceived. Commonwealth line had rendered invaluable So long as such statements lead to the reservice during the war in the transport of turn of the Labour party to the Government benches, in the view of honourable members all will be right with the world. The right honourable member for Cowper, in a devastating expose, replied' to every false statement made by honourable members opposite in this debate. In one glorious over the right honourable gentleman bowled, caught and ran out every man on the Government side. When the right honourable gentleman cited statistics that he had obtained from the Department of the Treasury only on the previous night honourable members opposite were silent. One could at least have expected them not to reiterate the false statements that had characterized their contributions to the earlier stages of the debate, yet this mornas much as the value of the asset upon which ing the same old stories were again "" dished "" up. Honourable members opposite take the view that only a few people will have heard the facts as recounted by the right honourable member for Cowper, and that the great masses of the people will believe what they themselves have said. I have no doubt that the Australian' Commonwealth Line of Steamers performed a useful service and made substantial profits during the period of World War I. substantial and continuous losses in the post-war period. Those losses were incurred mainly because, at the end of World War I., so much tonnage was available that all the ships in commission could not be gainfully employed. That is the reason why many of the great private shipping companies ""went broke"". trade was offering in which the ships Mr Bowden. could be engaged. That point is made clear by a couple of extracts that I shall read from the report of the Public Accounts Committee relative to statements made by a former Prime Minister, now Lord Bruce. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr McLeod) was honest enough to quote one extract from the report, but those who preceded him only quoted the statements of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and the then Mr Bruce, that they thought would favour their argument. The first extract readsI n placing this measure before the Parliament the Prime Minister (the Eight Honourable S. M . Bruce) indicated that, although the men, munitions and foodstuffs, its post-war losses were steadily increasing. These losses could be ascribed to the return of troops to their own countries, to the release of tonnage, due to the cessation of hostilities, to trade depression generally, and to the disastrous conditions prevailing in the shipping world. It had also been found by experience that a great part of the tonnage of the line was quite unsuitable for Australian trade, and was expensive to run. The second extract readsTo show that the Commonwealth was not. alone with regard to the position of its shipping activities, the Prime Minister pointed out that many shipping companies which had been formed in Great Britain when abnormal freights were being earned had not only lost their capital, but, when wound up, had owed to their banks two, three, or even four times the banks had advanced the money. All the old-established shipping lines, notwithstanding their strong reserves, had had to refrain from paying dividends or had paid them by drawing on reserves accumulated over many years. Yet in the face of that clear-cut statement, and of the facts recited by the right honourable member for Cowper last night, the honourable member for Parkes characterized the sale of those ships as treachery to the Australian people. his friends opposite will have to stand up to that statement, wbich is tantamount to saying that the government of the day was composed of traitors. I remind them that that Government had just completed a successful campaign against the enemy No without, as well as against the enemy within, which was constituted in a large measure by members of the Labour party.",35,Dedman
95,But It Also Made Mr Scully,It was a treacherous act.,36,Dedman
96,Mr Bowden,"The Minister andYet honourable members opposite have the temerity to call the members of that Government traitors to their country. The honourable member for Parkes went on to paint a picture of tens of thousands cf Australian people holding up their hands in supplication, begging the Government to restore to them a shipping line of which they had been deprived so treacherously. That is sheer fantasy, because I am s-ure that at least one-half of the present Australian voters had not then been born or were too young to know anything about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Indeed, it would be hard to find one voter in ten to-day who cares "" a hang"" whether or not the Commonwealth ever possessed a shipping line. Supporters of the Government have been letting loose a lot of "" hot a i r "" in their attempts to revive tlie controversy that arose out of the sale of the former Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Members of the Australian Labour party do not want the people to view the matter objectively, and many of those who now attack the Bruce Page Government on the ground that the sale of the ships weakened Australia's defensive potential were sheer pacifists during the war. Theni t is alleged by supporters of the Government that the old Commonwealth line benefited the nation by preventing increases of shipping freights in the coastal and overseas trade. I believe that contention to be perfectly sound, and it is more than probable that the benefits that had accrued to Australia during World WarI . more than counterbalanced the loss of £3,500,000 that was incurred before December, 1923. I do not include the losses that occurred after that date. Although the value of the line to this country during World WarI . more than compensated for the loss of £3,500,000 that was subsequently made on its operations, the fact remains that that money had to be provided by somebody. In the result the Australian taxpayers certainly contributed to the general saving on shipping freights and the particular benefit obtained hy primary producers. as it may, the continued operation of the line was not warranted after it had become redundant. The inquiries made by the Public Accounts Committee show that it made profits during World War I. and incurred losses thereafter. For twenty years I have been listening to the old catehcry that the ships were given away, or, as one supporter of the Government said this morning, were presented to a criminal, who had never paid even the nominal price placed upon them. Because the shipping firm that bought the vessels subsequently went into liquidation it does not follow that its debts will not be paid; in fact, figures released by the Treasury this year show that Australia has received from it £131,000 in dividends. Yet supporters of the Government have the temerity to utter the falsehood that the ships were given away. the people can do for the honourable member for Wannon is to give him a long holiday so that he may acquire a little more realism in his mental processes. Supporters of the Government have contended that the payment of a subsidy to a Commonwealth shipping line would be perfectly justified in the interests of the community. We do not disagree with that point of view because we believe that in certain circumstances it is quite sound practice to pay subsidies. For instance, we believe that the Government was not justified in lifting the subsidy on coastal shipping recently. The Government, of course, did not really dispute that the payment of the subsidy was warranted, but it removed the subsidy deliberately so as to convince the people who had voted "" No "" at the recent referendum on the control of rents and prices that they had made a vital mistake. talk. perience cf the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) has been of the kindergarten variety. The contention of bonorable members opposite that the establishment of a CommonBe that wealth shipping line will reduce freights and fares, and so 'benefit the entire community, is contradicted by our recent experience of the establishment of another State enterprise.

98,Mr Bowden,The best thing that,37,Dedman
99,Mr Dothie,That is kindergarten,37,Dedman
100,Mr Bowden,"Most of the exjustification advanced in the favour of the establishment of that particular enterprise was that it would reduce fares and freights for air travel. The event proved that Trans-Australia could not compete with the privately owned airlines, and the Government then endeavoured to compel those concerns to raise air freights and fares so as to justify an increase by Trans-Australia Airlines. our experience of the operations of ""Trans-Australia Airlines provides with the claims now made by the Government on behalf of the proposed Commonwealth shipping line! If we are to have a repetition of our experience with a government-owned airline, what can we expect? The bill contains a provision which has obviously been included for the express purpose of eliminating any competition. After its plans for its own airline had been frustrated by Ansett Airways Government, which had taken the lesson to heart, determined that there should be no more "" Ansetts"" to interfere with the execution of its plans. Therefore, the provision was made in the measure now under consideration that all shipping companies must operate under licence, and any private shipping line which ventures to cause the Government any trouble will do so at the risk of losing its licence. As I hftve said, the Government is determined that no one will interfere with its cherished plans. Clauses 29 and 30 of the measure propose to confer such power on the Minister to control private competitors of the Government line that the Minister will have no difficulty in driving any of those competitors out of the coastal trade. I do not think that any honourable member who has examined those clauses will deny that. The inclusion of tbose provisions in the measure probably explains why the shipping companies have not been very vocal in their opposition to the. bill. probably, take the view that he who makes the least noise will live the longest. They believe that if they do protest with any vehemence at all they will incur the penality of victimization.. The Government. wiU have; in its hands a weapon which, it. may usej as ruthlessly as could he* expected, from, any of the Mr Bowden. totalitarian countries in oTder to enforce complete submission to its will in matters connected with shipping. That weapon is the provision that all shipAirlines owners must operate under licence. Obviously, the shipowners will be intimidated into accepting something that they do not want. They realize, of course,, that if they are too vocal while the present Government is in office they may be put ""What a contrast out of business at any time after the bill becomes law. And their fears are well grounded, because some competitors of other government enterprises have heen put out of business. Therefore, the shipping companies are "" going quietly "". Apparently they hope to receive licences for the maximum period of four years, provided in the bill, and they obviously want time in which to consider their position. Clause 28 may have repercussions which cannot be foreseen. Every one will Proprietary Limited, the agree that in the past Great Britain has been our biggest customer, and undoubtedly it will continue to be so in future-no t because Great Britain particularly desires that it should remain our biggest customer, but because Australians believe that Great Britain has a right to be our best customer. Great Britain must pay for the goods that we export to that country, and if we deny it the right to pay by preventing it from earning sufficient from its exports to this country, we shall merely be worsening our own position. A t the moment we have a favorable trade balance with Great Britain of £300,000,000. That means that the United Kingdom has an unfavorable trade balance with us of that amount. A trade balance of: such proportions gives little satisfaction to. either of the two countries, and, under the provisions of this bill, the amouunt may easily increase to £1,000,000,060. In the final analysis, it. means that Australia has not been paid for thegoods that it They bas exported to, the United Kingdom-. The debt is accumulatingin Great Britain, because that, country is not allowed to repay it by means of exports to Auslralsa. The Australian Government pretendb, that it is endeavouringto keep down inflation,, but the goods represented by the amount of £300,000,000, which w,e-have sent tp. the United. Kingdom, have ( been paid for in this country by money that has heen advanced by the Commonwealth Bank. That money is released into circulation within the Commonwealth, and we refuse to accept imports from the United Kingdom that would absorb it. Therefore, we have a greater volume of money in circulation to absorb the comparatively few goods that are for sale here. That situation definitely aids inflation, and the Government is making the position worse by introducing prohibitions against imports from the Mother Country, which ie the principal market for the bulk of our exports. ""We are denying to Great Britain the right to pay for Australian goods in the only way in which it can possibly pay for them, namely, by exporting goods to us. What have we to fear from the establishment of a Commonwealth shipping fleet, even though it ultimately becomes a socialist monopoly? My reply to that question is that we can judge the possi* bilities of the future only by studying the mistakes that have been made in the past. I recall our own -unhappy experienco of State socialism which has incurred losses so heavy that the sponsors have been First, I shall refer to the coal industry, obliged to sell the undertakings in order to avoid mortgaging the State itself to meet the loss. I shall take the Postmaster-General's Department as an example. The employees of that department are trying to do a fine job, but are labouring under many handicaps. Tbe Post Office itself is trying to do its job well, but is handicapped by having to support other socialist concerns, such as the railways. I am able to cite instances of the Post Office being unable to deliver mails because it is obliged to use the railways, even though they may not be operating. Private enterprise, which is willing to deliver the mails, is not permitted to do so, being frustrated by another socialist concern, the Transport Department. those conditions obtain? bers opposite desire to know how successful the Post Office is, I cannot use words a short one. better than those of Senator Katz, who has saidThe Post Office .brings in the revenue, and so great a job has it done that to-day it is impossible to supply the demand for telephones. In the opinion of Senator Katz, that position illustrates the success of the Post Office as a business undertaking. According to that reckoning, railways that are not operating are tremendously successful because they cannot deliver the goods or render the services for which they have been established. I am not condemning the Post Office, because it. is interlocked with other concerns that will not allow it Has the honourable member any opinions about tbe .Shipping Bill? about the Shipping Bill than have most honourable members opposite put together. To prove what we have to fear from the proposed socialist shipping experiment, I shall recite a few facts about certain socialist experiments in the United Kingdom. I shall be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker, so that you will not be able to get your second breath and stop me. which lost £20,000,000 in its first year of operation under socialist control. The British Government was obliged to use its precious dollars to import coal, instead of expending them on food. Secondly, the British Government took control of the airways, and lost £8,000,000 in the first year of operation. Thirdly, and this is the piece de resistance-and I should like honourable members opposite to jeer at this if they can-the railway system and services of Great Britain, which used to be noted for their efficiency and courtesy to patrons, are incurring substantial losses.

106,Mr Bowden,"The extract is onlyhonorable member is not in order in discussing the railways of Great Britain at this stage. I ask him to return to the bill. is to state the reasons why members of the Opposition are objecting to the establishment of a socialist shipping service. The Standing Orders provide that the honourable member must relate his remarks to the bill under consideration. honourable members opposite, who will follow me in this debate, are required to relate their remarks to the bill. I am sure that the honourable member does not mean that remark to be a reflection on the Chair. However, I shall refer briefly to the British railways without reading the extract. Under socialist control, the British railways have lost £30,000,000 in their first year of operation, and their method of meeting that loss has been to dismiss 25,000 employees. I remind honourable members that the United Kingdom now has a socialist government, which is conducting socialist experiments by nationalizing the railways, the airlines and the coal-mining industry. The dismissal of employees must lead to restricted services and less efficiency, much to the delight of the Commo-Socialists, who hope, out of chaos, to apply the hellish doctrines that they propound in Australia and in other countries. They are able to disseminate ttfeir propaganda in this country without let or hindrance. I shall now give a few reasons why members of tbe Opposition consider that this bill should be rejected. The preamble of the bill states that the Government considers it necessary to establish a shipoccur, it will operate a totally inefficient ping fleet on an adequate scale. Our shipping difficulties at the present time are related to the activities, not of the shipThe Australian people will have to take ping companies, but of various gentry on the waterfront who from time to time prevent ships from sailing. In other words, the turn-round of ships will not be improved by the establishment of a Commonwealth shipping line. Before the outbreak of World War II . the freight charge between Melbourne and Sydney was 20s. a ton, and the period between the time of loading and the time of discharging the cargo was approximately one week. bulk or general cargo? a ton of cargo. To-day, the period between the time of loading and the time of discharging the cargo is between two and three weeks, and the freight charge has risen to £3 7s. 6d. a ton. The cost of shifting cargo from the wharf door into the hold of the ship is £1 a ton. private enterprise? Labour government that allows the unions, dominated by Communists, to dictate its policy not only on the wharfs, but also in international affairs. One of the reasons for the increase of the freight charge i9 that the employees do not now perform one-third of the work that they did before the war, and even then they did not work hard enough to raise a sweat. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Eraser) is well aware of that, but he knows that a few votes may be gained by blaming private enterprise for a situation that is due solely to government neglect. If honourable members opposite were to devote careful attention to these matters instead of authorizing the expenditure of tens of millions of pounds of public money to establish a plaything for the Healys, Elliotts and Sharkeys of this country, they would render to the public a much greater service than they will by voting for this bill. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government intends, by this bill, ultimately to eliminate all competition on the Australian coast. Should that service. I guarantee that the service will be inefficient from the start. it or leave it ; there will be no alternative.

116,Mr Bowden,"It occurs under athat the Australian Shipping Board is running 26 ships which it owns, and fifteen others which are under charter, and that during the last three years it had lost £10,000,000 on its operations. Judging by that record, what hope is there that the Government will run a shipping service successfully when it enjoys a monopoly on the Australian coast? There is no hope at all, and that is the answer to the fantastic claims of honourable members opposite who direct their arguments to those who do not think for themselves. The right honourable member for Cowper continuedYesterday, I was furnished by the Assistant ping service would not be a socialistic Secretary of the Treasury with particulars enterprise. It would not, he said, eliiif the present financial position in respect of minate private shipping companies, but the contract of sale. They show that the line was intended to stimulate competition. was sold for £1,900,000, and that, despite the statements by honourable members opposite We have heard that sort of thing on many that the Government received nothing, the occasions. It is interesting to observe amount outstanding to-day is only £300,265 how fearful are members of the Governin respect of the principal and £104,480 representing interest. Those details also show that ment of the possible reaction of the public the Australian Government also holds 23,920 to any proposal which can be shown to "" B "" shares of £1 each fully paid, in Ocean be socialistic. As I have said, we have -Steam Navigation Realization Company before us the spectacle of Socialists nonLimited.

This is one of a sequence of bills which the Government has brought forward, in the interests of the people, it claims, but actually in order to complete the pattern of socialism. Therefore, it was no surprise to us to hear the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who introduced tbe bill, declare that the setting up of a government shipThe party to which I belong has no objection to government services as such. failed should we fall back on outright Can it be said that private enterprise",40,Dedman
117,Mr Mcbride (Wakefield) [3.0],"I nthey have not proved their case. The Minister for Defence mentioned the difficulty experienced during the war in -connection with shipping services, but he -did less than justice to the private shipping companies when he had such scant praise to offer for the magnificent effort which they and their staffs made at that time. If , when war broke out, there had not 'been in Australian an efficient coastal fleet, our position would have been much worse than it was. It cannot be denied that, up to the outbreak of war, the shipping service provided to Australian ports was adequate and efficient. I suggest that, even at the present time, despite the shipping losses that were caused by enemy action in the war, there is adequate efficient shipping on the coast of Australia to carry all the necessary trade expeditiously from port to port. Eigures that I shall produce concerning the shipping position before the war compared with the position at the present time, will prove conclusively the correctness of that statement. For the year ended the 30th June, 1939, shipping on the Australian coast totalled 410,650 tons deadweight. made up that tonnage carried 8,952,000 tons of freight during that At the present time, despite what honourable members on the Government side of the"" House have said during this debate, shipping on the Australian coast, including overseas vessels under charter to the Government, 5S6,050 tons deadweight. The vessels that make up that tonnage carried, during 8,304,000 tons of cargo. In other words, with an additional 42f per cent, of deadweight tonnage on the coast, ships making up that tonnage carried during the last twelve months, wa9 carried by the lower tonnage in the year prior to the war. That is the actual position, and I suggest, with due deference to the Government and the Government speakers who have debated this measure, that this bill will not solve the shipping problem, which is simply a problem of a slower put-through of shipping trade. The time spent by ships at sea between ports is not greater now than it was in 1938.1 understand that it is, in fact, less because we now have newer vessels that travel faster. The shipping delay occurs at the wharfs. As honourable members on this side of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) have said, the point is that, instead of a ship spending two-thirds of its time at sea it now spends two-thirds of its time in port. If the waters Government is sincere in its expressed desire to assist the sea-going trade of this country it has a remedy for shipping delays very close at hand. After all, it is well to remember that, although the passage of this measure may lead to the establishment of a board with statutory powers to control shipping, there will be no substantial relief for a very long time through the entry of Australian-built ships into the coastal trade. I am informed that if all the shipyards in Australia at present were given contracts to produce 6,000-ton vessels the best that could be achievedand it might easily be worse-woul d be twelve 6,000-ton ships in three years. In other words, at the very best we should get four new ships, or a total of 24,000 tons deadweight placed on the coast The vessels that every twelve months, i In any event it would be a very slow process before the year. shippers of freight would get the expeditious transport that is so necessary to the proper conduct and development of this country. I suggest, therefore, that the Government, instead of rushing this bill through an establishing a board totals with the very wide powers proposed, should consider taking some action to encourage greater effort by the workers the last twelve months, on the waterfront. I know that from time to time the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley, the Minister for Defence and other senior Ministers have told honourable members and the public per cent, less cargo than generally, in answers to questions, what they are going to do about this or that waterfront dispute. They say, ""We are using every effort to settle the dispute "". The cold fact is that disputes are increasing in number every year by leaps and bounds. That increase has been going on since the war and it is causing an ever greater loss of time and efficiency on the waterfront.",41,Dedman

A more abject admission has never been heard in this House. honourable member later. very definite falling off in the loading rate of ships. I shall cite figures to prov? that statement. The average discharging rate of all vessels during the three year period 1937 to 1939 inclusive was 804 tons a day. In the three-year period 1945 to 1947 inclusive the average was 355 tons a day, or less than one-half of the pre-war average. The average loading rate in the three-year period from 1937 to 1939 inclusive was 434 tons a day and in the three-year period from 1945 to 1947 inclusive it was 321 tons a day, a drop of 50 per cent., or slightly less than that which occurred in the discharging rate, although that is nothing to be proud of. That applies not only to the handling of general cargo but also the the newer methods of handling cargo by mechanical means, for instance, wheat loading a! Glebe Island, in Sydney, where there are elevators and no great effort by wharf lumpers is required. The loading rate by mechanical means was 37.6 tons an hour in 1939, and 21.3 tons an hour in 1946. The matter is not one of the shipping companies or stevedoring companies having installed mechanized equipment of less efficiency. The same equipment that was used in the pre-war period is still being used, yet the loading rate is continuously falling. Is is not astonishing that the loading and discharging rates have fallen and are still falling, since one shipping companies. They would be comof the curious features of every key authority that the Government has established for the purpose of speeding up loading on the wharfs and production generally is that its membership has included individuals who are avowed asserted in no uncertain terms that they are determined to destroy the production of this country. The Stevedoring Industry Commission is an example. The Government established that commission to speed up loading on the wharfs, and to improve the conditions and amenities of wharf labourers, so as to institute the use of mechanical appliances, to reduce the human effort required. It appointed, as one of the representatives on this commission a Mr Jim Healy, whose one purpose in life is to destroy production in this country. Waterside Workers Federation on the commission. ment established the Maritime Industry Commission and appointed to it another Communist in Mr Elliott. Then, too, a Communist was appointed to the Joint Coal Board. What all this adds up to is that we do not achieve greater production and that, more importantly, should we, by some unfortunate circumstance, find ourselves engaged in war again, those-Communists will be in key positions, ablpto gain vital information, the disclosure of which to our enemies might well; destroy our war effort. Those appointments have been made by a government that claims that it is not communistically inclined or even tolerant of Communists. It is not astonishing, therefore, that we have a slow turn-round of ships and increased fares and freights in the coastal trade. Indeed, it would be astonishing if fares and freights did not rise. Apparently honourable members opposite do not realize that a substantial part of the cost of transporting goods by sea lies in the cost of loading and unloading ships. Since 1939, freights between Sydney and Melbourne have risen from 22s. to 67s. a ton and between Sydney and Fremantle from 43s. to 88s. a ton. It is well to note that the freights are made up of costs that are beyond the control of the pletely beyond the control of any government shipping line. In 1939 the cost of loading interstate general cargo in Sydney was 3s. lOd. a ton and the rate of loading was 24^ tons an hour. Honourable members may be astonished to learn that the Communists, who have cost of loading general cargo in that port is now 17s. 4d. a ton. That increase accounts for 13s. 6d. of the SydneyMelbourne freight rise from 22s. to 67s. a ton. In 1939, the cost of loading general cargo in Melbourne was 3s. 3d. a ton",42,Dedman

I d . a ton, which is less than in Sydney but is substantially more than it was before the war. In Adelaide, wharf labourers really work. They are a credit to their union. In 1939, the loading cost was in that port Is. lOd. a ton and the rate of loading was 27.4 tons an hour. Unfortunately, the Adelaide wharf labourers also have been bitten by the bug, with the result that the loading cost has risen to 8s. 7d. a ton and the loading rate bas been reduced to 14 tons an hour. In Fremantle, the loading cost has risen from 3s. Id. a ton in 1939 to 9s. 7d. a ton. Honourable members ought to realize that cargoes have to be loaded and unloaded and that loading costs have risen from 3s. lOd. to 17s. 4d. in Sydney, and from 3s. 3d. to 13s. Id. in Melbourne. The difference of 30s. 5d. a ton is a substantial proportion of the freight charge of 67s. a ton that is now charged. Very nearly one-half of the additional cost is incurred on the wharfs, and the shipping companies have no control over it. Stevedoring is not now a matter for private enterprise. Let honourable gentlemen not deceive themselves into thinking that it is. The Stevedoring Industry Commission and its port officials decide everything that shall be done on the wharfs and how it shall be done. What kind of assistance can we hope for from the Government in the solution of this immediate problem ? It is one that ought to be tackled immediately. No need exists to wait three years or so until wcan get more ships. Plenty of wharf labourers are available. It is astonishing, therefore, to read in the Melbourne Agewhich, I understand, is Labour's paperthat the Minister for Defence, referring to the matter of the loading and unloading of vessels, saidMuch of the difficulty in the stevedoring industry was caused hy the fact that employers had not provided the necessary equipment for handling cargo and that port equipment was not up to date. That statement is not only contrary to the facts; it also overlooks entirely the real factors that have been responsible for the slow turn-round of ships both during and since the war. Mr Moliride. Since the war, more equipment has become available. Yet, when stevedoring companies have endeavoured to improve their equipment, in order to speed up the rate of loading, they have been confronted with demands by the Waterside Workers Federation for the employment of the same number of men as previously, notwithstanding that the installation of the equipment had reduced the effort required by from 50 or 60 per cent. The wharf labourers have gone even further than that. Truck lifts almost entirely remove the laboriousness from loading. One could expect that the men would be willing to let them handle the loading of cargoes to the fullest extent, but the equipment may be ""used only in the shed to shift cargo from one side to the other. Its use on the wharfs is forbidden. The wharf labourers insist on man-handling cargoes from the wharf into the ships' slings. I speak with deep interest on the matter of shipbuilding because I was the responsible Minister when the shipbuilding programme was started during the war. During my term of office contracts were let for the construction of the "" River"" class of vessels and the keels of some of them had been laid when the Labour party took office. Subsequently that party merely carried out the programme that had been laid down by the Menzies Government. We realized that the most up to-date equipment possible should be installed in those ships in order to endow them with greater efficiency and to require less effort from the men employed on them. It was wisely decided to install mechanical stokers in the stokehold of one vessel. When the manning of that ship was under consideration, the firemen demanded the employment in the stokehold of the same number of men as was required in the stokehold of a handfired ship. The Labour Government put up a sham-fight, and said that the demand was outrageous, but it wilted, and the firemen had their way. That represents the kind of "" assistance "" that sea transport has been getting, is getting, and will get from the Labour Government. It is obvious that if the Government is desirous of better sea transport services being provided for the people of this country, it should tackle now the problem that confronts it. Instead of doing so, it has thrown out a smoke-screen in the attempt to delude the Australian people into believing that all is well on the ships and the waterfront and that all that is needed is more ships. The Government has decided to establish a board that will have very wide powers, although it will be under the control and direction of the Minister. Does the Government suggest that it will be able to accelerate the building of ships? At the present time the Australian shipbuilding yards are working to the full capacity of which they are capable having regard to the men and materials that are available to them. There is no lack of orders. All the shipbuilding yards in Australia have orders for ships. Not one of them could deliver a ship within two years if an order for one were placed to-day. All that we shall have during the next two years, if that be the correct period, as I believe it to be, is the use of ships which are at present under construction. The only factor that would prevent those ships, when completed, from being used immediately for the transport of sea-borne freight would be the refusal of the shipping companies to take delivery of them, and T understand that so far the shipping companies have not done that, although they have encountered difficulties in coming to a firm agreement with the Government. When a ship has been completed and made available to them, they have been prepared to purchase it. It has already been stated in this chamber that two ships that were built recently, Barrigun and Balarr, have already been taken over. It is worthwhile to remember that if shipping companies take delivery of new ships and incorporate them into their fleets, the cost of the ships will not have such an effect upon freight charges as it would have if the vessels were concentrated in one organization. Two expenses in connection with the running of ships are the provision for depreciation and the maintenance costs. panies have made proper provision for depreciation and have maintained their ships in the best possible state of efficiency, having regard to the exigencies of the war. The simple fact is, and it is just as well to realize it, that when a ship is purchased by an existing shipping company it becomes one of a number of ships. The provision for depreciation in respect of it is pooled with that in respect of each of the company's other vessels. It is that pool which affects freight rates. Eveni f Australian-built ships are subsidized, the fact remains that, despite the assistance that may be given to shipping companies by the Government, the cost of construction will, by and large, be three times as much as it was before the war. I do not want to be unfair to Australian shipbuilders. I admit frankly that ships that are under construction now are different in some respects from those that were built before the war. Changes in regard to accommodation, amenities and construction have undoubtedly increased costs. But I suggest that the increased costs that are attributable to those changes do not amount to a sum approaching the difference between 1939 and 1948 costs. Whatever the reason may be for the higher cost of ships, the ships go into a fleet. Whether they are run by the Government, or by private enterprise, the shipper must pay according to what they have cost. If new ships are allocated to one line the cost of running that line will be substantially greater than would be the cost of running existing lines if the ships were distributed amongst them. There are provisions in this measure which will have a deadening effect upon the willingness of shipping companies to add to their existing fleets. One clause of the bill provides that before a company can let a contract for the construction of a ship it must submit the plans of the vessel to the Australian Shipping Board, or in other words, to the Minister. If the plans are satisfactory the Minister may, if he be so inclined, issue a licence for the construction of the ship, but the company will have no guarantee that it will be granted a licence to operate it on All provident shipping comthe Australian coast when it has been built. That is an extraordinary position. Shipping companies are being asked to expand their fleets and to provide better shipping services for the community, yet it is proposed that a shipping company shall be required to obtain approval of the plans and specifications of a proposed vessel, then secure a licence to build it, and, having committed itself to an expenditure of £500,000, which is the approximate cost of a 6,000-ton vessel, will have no guarantee that it will be allowed to use the vessel on the coast. If , when a vessel has completed its trials, a company wishes to incorporate it in its fleet, it will have to go to the board and .apply for a licence to operate it. The board, with the concurrence of the Minister, may issue such a licence, but it will be for a period of only four years. In spite of what may be said about what will happen in the future, experience proves that the most expensive period during which to build ships is that which immediately follows a war. I shall not attempt to forecast the reductions of costs that may occur in the future, but shipping companies are well aware of the high cost of ships at the present time. Does the Government imagine that private shipping companies will be prepared to order at a cost of £500,000 vessels which before the war cost £150,000 or £200,000, when licences will be issued to them to operate the vessels for only four years ? There is another clause in the bill which provides that after 24 years vessels must be scrapped, which means that companies must base the provision for the depreciation of their ships on an expectancy of a useful life of 24 years. useful life of a ship ? to the trade in which the vessel is engaged. There are many ships over 30 years old which are rendering such good service that the Government has refused to allow them to be sold to companies outside of Australia. The licences that are to be issued to the companies will allow them to operate their vessels for a period of only four years. Although they will probably be granted further licences, that is not the way in which to encourage private enterprise and the expansion of industry. There is in the bill the extraordinary provision that a company shall not be aUowed to dispose of a ship, except with the approval of the Minister, even though it may have decided that trade has declined or a different class of trade has come into being for which the ship is not suitable. There are a number of ships at present operating on the coast which are uneconomic to run because their useful life has passed. It is perhaps justifiable to operate them at the present time, but if that is to be encouraged in the future it will have a strangulating effect upon the enterprise of shipping companies. I want to know whether the present practice of refusing permits to sell ships at the appropriate time-the appropriate time being, I suggest, from the viewpoint of the company, and, I believe, from the viewpoint of the Australian people, the time when that ship is no longer in a fit condition economically to continue in the coastal trade-is to be continued. Because of the great shortage of tonnage outside interests are now prepared to pay very much more than the true value of a ship if they can obtain immediate delivery. When an offer is made for a vessel that is perhaps 30 or 35 years old, an application to sell will have to be submitted to the board. The board may refuse permission to the owners to sell and may direct them to continue to operate the vessel. Eventually, when permission is given to sell, the owners may lose from 40 to 80 per cent, of the present value of the ship. It is outrageous that such a policy should be pursued at a time when the shipping companies are called upon to pay three times the former cost of building a new vessel. How' can the Government reconcile such a restriction with its expressed intention to assist sea transport and shippers generally? The bill contains a most extraordinary provision which empowers the Minister to determine the class and specifications of ships that may be built. In introducing the measure the Minister for Defence said that it is the Government's objective to have standardized vessels operating in Australian waters. That objective is surely the very antithesis of progress. Very rarely do shipping companies build vessels of standard design. Improvements of design are made from time to time and the specifications of vessels are frequently substantially altered in order to embody equipment of new types and to provide",43,Dedman
125,Mr Anthony,What is the normal,46,Dedman
126,Mr Mcbride,"It varies accordingfor the most economical transport of particular cargoes. Therefore only on very rare occasions do shipping companies order ships to be built to the same specifications as those of their existing fleets. The power given to the Minister in this bill will enable him to stone-wall progress in the shipbuilding industry. I have no desire to misrepresent the position. In interpreting the purpose of the measure in his second-reading speech the Minister for Defence said that it will ensure that standardized ships shall be provided for the Australian coastal trade. This bill and its onerous provisions will not awaken any enthusiasm on the part of the Australian shipping companies. Willy nilly the people are to be shouldered with the expense of supporting another government department, the activities of which will not provide more efficient or more frequent shipping services. In the eyes of the Government, what is good to-day should be quite good enough for the next 20 years. That is the kind of thought that has gone into the planning of the Government's shipbuilding policy. As I have said frequently this, measure can lead only to loss of efficiency in sea transport and the imposition of higher freight rates for the carriage of goods. Much has been said by honourable members opposite about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers and the benefits conferred on the people as the result of its operations. I do not want to become involved in an argument about what happened 24 or 25 years ago. Apparently the members of the Labour party live in the dim days of the past. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has referred to "" the light cn the h ill "" . It is apparent that "" the Australia Airlines or its failure to provide light on the h ill "" is seen but dimly by the members of the Labour party. opportunity to decide whether or not that is so before very long. will be couched in no uncertain terms. There are still some government activities operating in Australia which were established by non-Labour governments notwithstanding the suggestion by honourable members opposite that the nonsocialist parties in Australia are biased against government enterprise. Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited is a concern in which the Government has the controlling interest. Have the operations of that company provided a more efficient service for the motorists, of this country or enabled them to buy cheaper petrol? Have honourable members, opposite been able to purchase a gallon of Commonwealth Oil Refineries motor spirit for Id. less than they pay for ""Plume"" or "" S h e l l "" brands of petrol? Yet the profits of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, which is completely under the control of the Government, have been stepped up by from 200 to 300 per cent. Are those profits passed on to the consumer? Of course not. Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited represents a good example of the effect of government enterprise on the welfare of the community. Amalgamated Wireloss (Australasia) Limited is another example of government enterprise. A l though that company performs very useful work, I have not heard it said that as the result of its operations the price of wireless sets has been kept down. Its profits are not passed on to the public. A dreadful example of government enterprise is Trans-Australia Airlines which has not yet got into the profit-making class. Indeed, Trans-Australia Airlines has been a drain on the taxpayers and if I am any judge of what the future holds that instrumentality of the Government will become an increasing drain on the pockets of the people. I am not concerned about the manner in which the Australian National Airlines Commission manipulates the balance-sheets of Transfor depreciation. I know that it is almost certain that when the true story of the operations of Trans -Australia Airlines is told, it will be found that that instrumentality, instead of conferring benefits on the people of this country, will compel the Government to maintain taxes at a very high rate in order to finance its losses. From every aspect, from the viewpoint of necessity as well as of the services that may be rendered to the people, this proposal is a thoroughly bad one.",46,Dedman

They show that in 1939, no fewer than 7,500 ships, carrying 7,600,000 tons of cargo, went in and out of Sydney Harbour, but that in 1947, only 3,600 ships with 7,200,000 tons of cargo entered and sailed from that port. Therefore, I claim that the figures that the honourable member has given to the House are incorrect. The statistics that have been supplied by the Maritime Services Board indicate that the number of ships that entered and left Sydney Harbour in 1947 carried nearly as much cargo as twice as many ships had carried before the war. The honourable member for Wakefield also complained of the slow turn-round of ships. If he were to discuss the subject with some of the men who handle cargoes on the wharfs, he would be given the answer to that complaint. The slower turn-round of ships to-day is not due entirely to a change of attitude on the part of waterside workers, strikes or stoppages. A part of the explanation is that most of the ships that enter port to-day are fully loaded, whereas before the war, most of the ships entered port half empty. In the circumstances, it is no wonder that vessels are in port longer to-day than they were before the war; ber's contention is correct, the ships should be discharging their cargoes more quickly. carrying full cargoes, but before the war tbey were only half-loaded. Obviously, unloading must take longer to-day than it did before the war. tons an hour. bill is threefold. It proposes to establish a Commonwealth shipping line, which will be operated by a board of five members to develop our mercantile marine and to develop further a shipbuilding programme in this country. Members of the Opposition have read into the purposes of this bill all the bogies that they read into nearly of 586,000 tons every bill that the Government introduces. I invite the If they are unable to produce direct evidence, they pretend to discover indirect evidence that the Government is dominated by red influences, and that bills have been drafted in Moscow, The people of Australia have heard that story so often that they were becoming sick and tired of it. Members of the Opposition should raise a new bogy, because their red bogy is so old, and has so many whiskers on it, that it does not frighten any one. For the purposes of the record, I desire to relate the history of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In doing so, I may cover some of the ground that previous speakers have traversed, but when an honourable member speaks towards tbe conclusion of a debate, be must inevitably repeat some of the earlier remarks. Prior to World WarI . , overseas shipping combines that bandied Australian primary produce perpetrated n form of brigandage. In 1910 the British shipping combines skimmed off £4,500,000 in freight on wool, wheat and meat exported from Australia. That stranglehold had to be broken in the interests of Australian primary producers, and, therefore, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) sponsored the establishment of a government shipping line. That new policy was announced by the Governor General to the Parliament on the 8th October, 1914J, but one year and eight months elapsed before tbe necessary legislation was introduced to enable the ships to be purchased. In the meantime, following the outbreak of war, freights jumped from £2 7s. 6d. a ton to £5 5s. a ton. Late in 1916, an honourable member made the following statement to the House:Owing to the enormous increase in freights the returns from one short voyage have been sufficient to cover the cost of a vessel previous to the war and a vessel valued at £7,000 before the war now sold for £47,000.",47,Dedman

Freight on wheat rose from 25s. to 30s. a ton to £15 per ton "". Ln June, 1916, the right honourable member for North Sydney took action, through the Commonwealth Bank, to purchase ships. Fifteen cargo vessels of between 3,500 and 4,500 tons which had been built in England between 1906 and 1915, were bought, and were called the Austral Line. Tn 1917, they were augmented by 21 vessels, ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 tons, that had been seized or captured from the enemy powers. Thus the strength of the Commonwealth's mercantile fleet rose to 36 ships, which operated at a profit until tbe end of the war. The details may be read in a report by the Public Accounts Committee, of which, at the time, Sir Walter Kingsmill was the chairman. Mr Poynton, speaking on the budget in 1919, said that the fleet had carried to and from Australia more than 1,000,000 tons of cargo, and that the receipts of the Austral Line had exceeded the expenditure by £2,221,000. The net earnings of the ex-enemy vessels between 1914 and 1919 totalled £3,576,901. Two facts emerged from that venture. Wheat freights charged by the Commonwealth line were from £6 to £7 a ton, whereas the private shipping companies charged from £10 to £12 and even £15 a ton. The Commonwealth line saved the primary producers of Australia approximately £2,000,000 per annum in freights. At times, in the national interest, profits were sacrificed. For example, a consignment of 123,000 tons of phosphate was carried to Australia at a ridiculously low freight when the fertilizer was urgently required. When the Commonwealth-owned ships could have been carrying cargoes in other parts of the world for £15 a ton, they were engaged in carrying cornsacks to Australia for £5 a ton in order to assist the primary producers. The government of the day also started shipbuilding at Williamstown in Victoria, Walsh Island and Cockatoo Island in New South Wales, Maryborough in Queensland and Port Adelaide in South Australia. From 1919 onwards, about 20 "" D "" and "" E "" boats ranging from 3,300 to 3,350 tons were built. Five"" B a y "" liners of 13,800 tons, such as Esperance Bay, Jervis Bay and Moreton Bay were built in London in 1921. The two "" Dale"" liners, Fordsdale and Ferndale, each of 9,700 tons, were launched in Australia in 1924. That was a magnificent achievement for the new shipbuilding industry. In 1921, 3,000 men were directly engaged in constructing and repairing ships. By 1923, the seamen, mechanics, shipbuilders and their families dependent on the Commonwealth line numbered 15,000 persons. Then Lord Inchcape stepped on to the deck and helped to torpedo the Commonwealth line. His shipping conference controlled at that time 7,000,000 tons. After World WarI . , he set out to strangle tbe healthy Commonwealth line which, by then, had become a thorn in the side of his combine. He employed torpedoes of three types for the purpose. The first was the deferred rebate systema vicious system that required shippers to sign a declaration that they would not send cargo by the Commonwealth line. If they did so, they would forfeit their rebates. The second torpedo was a campaign in the Australian press against the fleet. The Kingsmill report refers to that matter. The press did everything possible to smash the Commonwealth line. The third torpedo was the use of parliamentary influence to have the ships engaged on unprofitable work. By those three methods, the combine torpedoed the Commonwealth line. In 1921, the Parliament refused to sell the line to Lord Inchcape, who desired to purchase it. A farmers' conference, which was meeting at that time, protested bitterly against Lord Inchcape's proposal. Primary producers will protest with equal vehemence in future, sbould a shipping combine seek to purchase the Commonwealth shipping fleet that will be established under the provisions of this bill. Members of the Australian Country party are out of step with primary producers whom, they say, they serve in this Parliament. At last Australia's "" D "" day has arrived. I describe it as "" black February"". In February, 1923, the Bruce Page Government came into office, and Mr S. M . Bruce, made the following statement :I do not think that what has been, done' bjj to the. shipping conference.. the Commonwealth. line justifies its continuance as a government venture. So, at the beginning of his administration,, the writing was on the wall for the Australian Steamers. The fleet and the dockyards were transferred to a Commonwealth shipping board, which had power to dispose of any of its assets, subject only to the. approval of the Commonwealth Treasurer. In return for the property received, the board was obliged to issue debentures £4,750,000, bearing interest at 5 per cent. That transaction meant, in effect, that, the Commonwealth Treasurer virtually acquired over the shipning line a mortgage that could be foreclosed at any time., should the board default on its interest payments. The Bruce-Page Government also imposed vicious taxes on the line as another indirect way of making its work more difficult. Committee also was asked to inquire into the advisability of selling or retaining the line. Eleven, ships of the Austral line were sold for £248,000, although they were valued at £550,000, 21 ex-enemy ships were sold for £197,000, although the British Government valued them at. £337,000, the ""D"" boats, which had cost £271,000 to build, were sold fbr £84,000. and the ""E"" boats, which had cost £2,600,000 to build, were sold for £3S0,500. Only the five "" Bay"" liners and the two "" Dale"" ships remained. Even Mr Bruce was not "" game "" at that time to sell them to Lord Inehcape's combine. However, the assets that I have mentioned were sold for £909,000, although they had been valued at £3,758,000. In May, 1926, the Public Accounts Committee reported that the line had been responsible for the reduction of shiping freights, and should be continued in the interests of Australia. chairman had received his appointment in London, the committee held a meeting behind closed doors to consider what should be done with the line and, in November, 1927, it reversed its former decision, although a majority of its members were the same as those that had if r . Duthie. sat on. the committee in the previous.yeas. The result was that the ships were, sold That, briefly,, is tha story of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Members, of the Opposition still have the audacity, however, to defend the action of©bmmonwealth Line of the government of the day in selling the ships, but they will never be able to efface from the history of Australia the record of that tragic period from .1923 to 1928. Since 1941', a considerable, number of ships, has been built in Australia for the Commonwealth, and it is interesting to to the Treasurer for note their tonnage, the gear they carry and the amenities provided for the crew, as compared' with ships in the possession of private companies. Eight"" D "" class ships of 2,500tons have been built, their names being Dalby., Dayl'esford, Dubbo, Dandenong, Dorrego, Dulverton. De Lungra and Delemere. They carry a crew of approximately 40: Thirteen ""-River""' class ships, each of 9,000 tons, The Public Accounts. and carrying a. crew of 53 have been built. They are oncharter to privatecompanies. Their names are, River Clarence, River Glenelg, River Burdekin, River Fiszroy, River Murrumbidgee, River Murray. River Mitta, River Hunter, River Norman, River Derwent, River Burnett, River Loddon, and River Murchison. They are doing great work along the Australian coast, and twoof them are on the overseas service. Two"" E "" class ships, Ev>gowra and En-field, of 500 tons have been constructed. They are handy ships for small ports, such as Stanley in Tasmania. In addition, two "" B "" class ships of 6,500 tons have been built and sold to private shipping companies, and nine more have reached various stages of construction. Nine more ships of various kinds are under construction, including "" B "" class motor ships of 6,500 tons of the most modern design. All the government ships have a speed of at least 12 knots. On the otber hand, The next year, after the the average size of the ships operated on tbe Australian coast by private companies is 3,000 tons. With few exceptions, they are over 20 years old, and their average speed is 8 knots. It is most important that comfortable quarters should be provided for the crews, and the quarters on Commonwealth ships are in every way superior to those on ships owned by private companies. It might be claimed that that is because tbe Gommonwealth, ships are new, and that is true, none of them being more than about eight years old. whilst some are not more than two years old. However, the new motor ship Karamba was recently delivered to the Australian United Steam Navigation Company in Australia, and it was found necessary to alter the crew's quarters, which were of a standard far below that of Commonwealth ships. Conditions on Commonwealth ships are superior to those on other ships trading on the coast. This is also true of the gear, which is an imporfrom ashore are invited on board to enjoy tant factor in the handling of cargo. The Commonwealth "" D "" class ships, and the new "" B "" class ships will be ideal with two sets of gear to each hatch, for quick loading and unloading. The"" E '' class motorsbips are also excellent for the interstate trade. class ships, because of the very large load amounting to 10,000 tons, which they can lift, are very suitable for the overseas trade. Indeed, River Mitta and River Norman are at present on the overseas run. Some of the "" River"" class ships have refrigerated holds, and all "" D "" class ships have refrigerated space for limited, cargoes of from 80 to 90 tons. Speed is an important factor if the ships are to compete successfully with air traffic. Because of the saving of time many people are disposed to send light freight by air, even though the cost is somewhat greater. As I have said, no Commonwealth ship has a speed of less than 12 knots, which is considerably faster than that of at least 80 per cent, of the shops owned by private companies. Here is an example of the effect of speed. A slow ship belonging to a private company leaves Hobart eight hours ahead of a "" River"" class ship, say River Murray, but it arrives at Hobart from twelve to fifteen hours after River Murray, the difference in their speed being 4 to 5 knots. This is an important factor in the cargo and passenger trade. So far as I know, the provision of amenities for crews has not been discussed during this debate. I believe that it is essential to provide happy conditions for seamen. It is they who man our merchant navy, and they constitute the reserve upon which we have to draw in time of war. I have nothing but admiration for them. On Commonwealth ships, their living conditions are very good, and their spirit is high. On most of the "" River"" class ships a space about 40 feet square in which the naval gunners were quartered during the war, has been converted into a recreation room, and furnished with equipment for table tennis, darts, and othor,games. Indeed, equipment is provided for many other kinds of sport, including cricket and boxing. This recreation room is also used for the holding of social evenings, when guests entertainments mapped out by a committee. Members of the crew pay 5s. to join the sports club, and they contribute 2s. 6d. out of each pay for the purchase of equipment and sporting gear. I am familiar with conditions on River The"" River"" Murray, because my brother-in-law is an able seaman on that ship. He has served in several Commonwealth ships, and also on ships that are privately owned. The chief officer of River Murray, Mr Reid, holds navigation and seamanship classes on four nights a week for all who are interested, and he was responsible for eight members of the crew getting their lifeboatmen's certificates, making a total of ten out of twelve deck department members to hold certificates-a n unbeaten record for any ship. Among the crew, there is a keen tennis club of nine members, and also several keen golfers. It may be asked why all these amenities should be provided. Ships of the "" River"" class are of 10,000 tons, and may be in port from three to five weeks, loading and unloading. What are the men to do if no amenities are provided in order to beep them contented? Members of the crew consider that the amenities on River Murray provide them with as near tbe comforts of home life as it is humanly and physically possible to provide on any ship. During the week-end, I received a letter written by Mr Cliff Blake, on behalf of the crew of River Murray. After referring to the losses sustained by the Australian Shipping Board, as the Minister for Defence mentioned the other day, the letter says that such losses are to be expected, but could be reduced if there were a competent Australian shipping board office in every port.

Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) says "" Hear, hear! "". He and his supporters realize the electoral value in their being able to say that they are not seeking to nationalize shipbuilding or shipping. Yet, they know that they have all signed the Australian Labour party's platform, a plank of which is the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and shipping is certainly a means of distribution. They know that they are trying to delude the people into believing that they would not nationalize the Australian shipbuilding and shipping industries. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) said that fiscal policy -entered into the consideration of this measure. on the sincerity of Opposition members. I tell him that I have always been known as an extreme protectionist and that, insofar as the bill is intended to protect the Australian shipbuilding and shipping industries, it is to its credit. I have always supported the manufacture in Australia under Australian conditions by Australian labour of everything that Australia needs, taking into consideration costs and benefits; but I have never supported embargoes against British shipbuilding, and I do not regard it as equitable to place an embargo on the importation of the ships that Australia needs. If the importation of ships is prohibited and ships are built here only at the rate contemplated which is three ships a year, we shall never make up our leeway, especially if 24-year-old ships are sale of the Australian Commonwealth to be consigned, as the bill provides, to the scrapheap. does not believe in embargoes? present conditions I do not believe in an -embargo on the importation of ships to Australia, more decidedly when labour, iron and steel are so scarce. It is a dasmania and the mainland of Australia. tardly claim that to-day we can build all the ships needed for the Australian trade, because we have not sufficient iron and steel to 'supply the industrial sand personal needs of the Australian community. At one time, we could export iron and steel, but to-day we have to import steel. Why import steel on foreign ships Australia ? Until the Australian iron and steel industry is producing to the necessary degree, it is ridiculous for the Government to say that all our ships must be built in Australian shipyards. The demands on the Australian iron and steel industry are immense. The great Snowy River scheme, of which we have been informed, and also the standardization of our railway gauges, will require thousands of tons of steel. Yet, to-day, we are confronted with a bill, the effect of which is that we shall not have ships, unless we build them in Australian shipyards although we have insufficient iron and steel to meet all the other demands for those commodities which the Australian people already require. The He cast reflections Australian iron and steel industry is unable to cope with demands because it has been sabotaged by the Australian Communist party against which the Government has been afraid to l if t a hand. Government supporters have complained that the Bruce-Page Government sold the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. That shipping line was sabotaged by the waterside workers and a few merchant seamen. No one can gainsay that. The honourable member for Wilmot spoke most disdainfully about the action of the Bruce-Page Government in disposing of the line and claimed that Lord Inchcape and his combine would have bought it. He either knows or should know that nothing is further from the truth. Against his criticism of the Line of Steamers by the Bruce-Page Government, however, I place my criticism of the action of the Labour government of Tasmania which sold the Tasmanian shipping line that had been established by a non-Labour government in that State. The non-Labour government bought four ships, two to trade between Tasmania and the neighbouring islands and two to trade between TasThe ships were operated by the Tasmanian",54,Dedman

167,Mr Bernard Corser,"Unde rGovernment for a year at a loss, naturally, because all State enterprises lose money. When the Labour party took office in Tas-' mania the two larger vessels, the ones tnat traded between Tasmanian and Australian mainland ports, were sold. One of them was Poolta, which was practically a new ship. It had cost £68,181. The other was Melbourne, an older vessel which had cost £59,468. The Tasmanian Labour Government sold them three years after taking office for £26,000, at a loss of £101,649. A total loss of about £201,000 was made. The loss sustained by the Commonwealth in the sale by the Bruce Page Government of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was proportionately less than that sustained by the Tasmanian Labour Government in the sale of its ships. I marvel, therefore, that honourable gentlemen opposite, especially a representative of a Tasmanian constituency, can have the temerity to criticize the Bruce-Page Government for its transaction, especially as the sale of the line was forced on that Government by the sabotage of the ships by the wharflabourers and the seamen. The other two vessels owned by Tasmania were kept in operation at a loss of about £40,000 a year. The charge has been laid by honourable gentlemen opposite that the Bruce-Page Government ""gave the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers away "". The Tasmanian Labour Government gave its line away. It may be said with equal truth that the Labour Government in Queensland gave away its State enterprises. Every one with any knowledge of politics must know that the then Premier of Queensland, of Queensland, Mr Theodore, were determined to bring about socialism in their time in Queensland. They set out their objectives in their little Red Book. been compelled to sell those State enterprises, tried to explain their failure. The State Government had its own trawlers, fish shops, produce markets, butcher shops, sawmills, metal works, brickyards, and a coal mine that produced nothing but water, which even cows would not drink. Apologizing to the conference of representatives of trade if r . Bernard Corser. said, in effect, "" The people whom we sought to serve will not give the social service that is necessary to make a success of these ventures. Then, there is no policy left but for the Government to abandon these things until the people are willing to give the social services necessary to make them a success "". So great were the losses sustained by the State enterprises that, in a few years, we found that the experiment had cost the people of Queensland about £4,000,000. No wonder the people of Queensland are loath to see the re-establishment of State enterprises! Maryborough, in the Wide Bay electorate, is a Queensland city that for years has been a centre of engineering and shipbuilding enterprises as well as other enterprises and I hope that, in the application of the policy laid down in this measure, fair treatment will be accorded to such shipbuilding firms as Walkers Limited to allow them to continue their operations, not under nationalization, but under existing private enterprise. Such shipbuilding firms have been established for years, and they have rendered great service to Australia. Their accomplishments have been praised on all sides in this debate. I remind the House that Walkers Limited built the only two steel vessels that were built in Australian shipyards during World WarI . I trust that that company and other companies like it will be given a free hand to build the ships necessary for the Australian shipping trade and that they will not be hampered by sabotage. I hope, too, that the firms that operate those ships will not be held up by unnecessary strikes of ships' cooks and the like. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) said that the Bruce-Page Government, in disposing of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, had given away a valuable asset. The original capital value of that fleet of ships was £14,750,000, but it was found necessary to write off £8,000,000. In the year ended the 31st March, 1927, the line lost £595,000 and in the next year it lost £559,000. What an asset Australia had in a line of ships that suffered such losses! The line cost approximately £14,750,000. Although £8,000,000 was written off, it incurred a",55,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

I am sure that the -company which was "" given"" the line wished that it had never had it. The losses incurred by the Commonwealth line were due chiefly to maritime disturbances. Evening Sun, referring to the Australian Commonwealth statedNo shipping company had such trouble with -organized labour. For long every Commonwealth liner, on its arrival back to Australia from a voyage overseas, was held up by some petty dispute in the face of warnings that there was a. limit to loss on the Line to which the country would submit. The public was constantly told that the Government would not tolerate such a condition of affairs. On no occasion were the strikes against the men's own shipping line caused by complaints regarding hours, wages or industrial conditions. The men enjoyed the highest wages and the best conditions that were then known in the shipping world. Nevertheless they struck, and they did so in order to sabotage a shipping line which was being controlled by an anti-Labour government. The Labour party has claimed that the sale of the vessels owned by the line deprived primary producers of convenient, safe and cheap transport. It has claimed further that the "" B a y "" liners carried 80 per cent, of the coastal passengers. The facts are that, of the 362,148 coastal passengers carried in 1926, 12,350. or 3.4 per cent, of the total. In 1927, over 6,796,159 tons of freight was carried on the Australian coast, of which 4,283 tons, or .06 per cent, of the total, was carried by the Commonwealth line. The coast was not, however, left unserved. In the last two years during which the Commonwealth line operated, 174 coastal licences were issued. Overseas ships are not allowed to engage in our coastal trade, which must be carried by ships on the Australian register. The vessels of the Government line were on the Australian register, and the crews worked under Australian awards and conditions. Compliance with those awards and conditions involved the line in an expenditure of £200,000 a year more than the expenditure of its competitors. The first invitation for tenders for the purchase of the line, which was issued in 1925, specified that the ships should remain on the Australian register, but no tenders were received. In 1928 the Bruce-Page Government, In 1924 the Melbourne which had been reluctant to sell the vessels, advertised them throughout Line of Steamers, the world. The Minister for Information has said that the vessels were given away. the Minister for Defence reconcile that remark with the fact that the ships were sold at so high a price that the company which bought tbem became insolvent? That fact provides a complete answer to the suggestion that the vessels were given away. The Minister will probably admit that he has lost that round. No tenders having been received in 1925, the vessels were advertised for sale again in 1928. This asset had cost the country £14,887,000 and its capital value had been written down by approximately £8,000,000. The financial position of the line on the 31st March, 1928, was that it had liabilities of £5,780,250 and assets and investments of £2,976,900. The shrinkage of assets was £2,803,350. That amount had gone in overhead costs and losses due to strikes. The Labour party has claimed that the primary producers were sacrificed. Any one the "" B a y "" liners carried who says that obviously does not know the real position, and certainly was not a primary producer at that time. The records prove that, the primary producers made little use of the line and that they were not concerned with the safety or other advantages that it was said to offer. The only absolute condition that was imposed when the vessels were offered for sale in 1928 was that they should remain on the British register. No tender had been received when the Government insisted that they should remain on the Australian register. The Government indicated that it would require the maintenance of a service equal to that which was being provided by the "" B a y "" and "" Dale"" steamers and that preference",56,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

172,Mr Bernard Corser,"Ho w canwould be given to any tenderer who submitted proposals for safeguarding shippers to and from Australia and/or submitted proposals for .services to Australia over and above tbose that were being provided by the line. Three tenders were received. the White Star Line, which first offered £1,800,000, and later £1,900,000. Later still, the company offered to expend £50,000 to repatriate sailors from Britain. There was to be a payment of £250,000 in cash when each vessel was delivered and the balance was to be paid in ten equal yearly payments, the interest rate being 5$ per cent, a year. Runciman's, of London, and Sir James Connelly submitted tenders which were not accepted. The Government decided to accept the tender submitted by the White Star Line, which was required to take over the unexpired liabilities of the line, to purchase office furniture at valuation, to employ the personnel who were then employed, and to pay the costs of repatriating Australian seamen to Australia. Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual for 1928 states that in June, 1919, the price per ton deadweight of a 7,500-ton steamer was £26; in March, 1920, it was £34 5s.; in January, 1921, it was £14; in June, 1921, it was £8 5s.: and in June, 1927, it was £8 4s. gard to the decrease of the cost of ships, the price at which the Commonwealth steamers were sold was reasonable, especially as at that time there was 4,000,000 tons of shipping lying idle and it was very difficult to sell old ships. It must be conceded that the vessels were not given, away. sold occurred, and the White Star Line, which had bought them, lost the whole of its investment. Government have obtained more for the ships ? Was anything done by Australians working in the ships and on the wharfs to get more for them? Was anything done by the supporters of the Labour party in Australia at that time to obtain more money from the White Star Line or from any other tenderer? On the contrary, the workers made it known that if tlie White Star Line purchased the vessels and began to operate them it would be boycotted. Sir. Bernard Corser. A threat such as that would mitigate against the possibility of obtaining a higher price than was in fact obtained for the vessels. It has been claimed iby the Labour party that during the life of the Australian Commonwealth Line of The first was from Steamers primary producers received! the benefit of a 50 per centdecrease of freight rates. That decrease occurred during the period when freight rates were falling throughout thi* world. They fell by more than 50 per' cent, on routes where there was no competition between privately owned and State owned vessels. In 1920 the freight rate per ton from the port of Tyne to Port Said was 41s. 3d., to Barcelona 34s., to Oporto 46s. 6d., to Bordeau 38s. 10d., and to Rotterdam 17s. 3£d. In 1926 the comparable rates were 17s. 3d., 12s. 10d., lis., 5s. 9d., and 5s. It is apparent, therefore, that the reduction of freight rate was not due to the operations of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, because government-owned ships were not onerating between the ports to' which I have referred. The reduction was general throughout the world. The Commonwealth line incurred great losses because of the direct action tactics of men employed on the wharfs and,, Having rein some instances, on the ships. In the 1924 conflict Ferndale and Moreton Bay were boycotted by the waterside workers. Valuable cargoes were lost owing to illegal strikes and the action of the maritime unions in holding vessels upby refusing to supply crews. A valuable meat shipment had to beThey were transferred to the steamer Rarango, just before the depression which sailed under the flag of the White Star Line. That was the line which tbe waterside workers bad threatened to Could the declare black if it assumed control of the Commonwealth line. Five hundred tons of meat was left behind to be lifted by foreign ships. Carina was delayed inMelbourne, and it thus lost the profit that it would otherwise have made on the cargo that it had brought from Europe. Let us consider the case of Fordsdale. Fordsdale was built in an Australian shipyard for an Australian government enterprise by Australian workmen working under Australian conditions and awards, which are the best in the world.. When the vessel was launched arrangements were proudly made to man it with an Australian unionist crew on its maiden voyage. The vessel was all-Australian, and was built for a State-owned line, a form of government activity wbich has been sc* loudly advocated' by Australian socialists and which is so much emphasized in this bilH. ""When the vessel, returned maidenvoyage, to London the Seamen's Union declared this all-Australian vessel black. They claimed that they had the right to pick up the original crew which took the vessel away.. The management refused to agree tothisdictation and ultimately secured ai unionist crew that waschosen, by thecaptain. Great losses were incurred by thisproud, true a-nd all-Australian vessel because of the refusal of the unionists to give. Lt and the line a fail"" go. It has been, said that the government of the day refused to accept, cargoes. Let. us consider the facts. No cargoes were refused by the government of the day because it did. not accept or. reject cargoes. Cargoes were not refused by those in. control of. the Australian Commonwealth. Line of Steamers. Goodscargo represented 80 per cent, of the. shipping business offering in Australia., Excellent offers) were made to return the vessels to Australia, fully laden from. Great Britain.. Delays,, due toi strikes: in Australia) held, up the vessels on many occasions. Australian register and. were operated, under Australian conditions. The observance of Australian conditions, was perfectly proper for vesselsengaged in Australian watersbut the. high wages paid! to officers and men prevented the shipsof the line from, competing against vessels, because they wanted them for the benefit registered in other countries;. It is notof. Australian, workers but because they true: to say, as? honourable members opposite have done,, that Australianprimary, producers obtained great advantages from, the existence of the line. Taking Australian wages at the baserate of £100 for crews employed, on vessels of 6,000 tons gross register, the comparative British wagewas £32.4, or less than one-third, the Swedish wage was £24.51, or approximately one-quarter, and the Danish wage was £15.44, or approximately one-seventh, of the Australian wage. Australian primary producers were expected to pay freights based on Australian rates of wages and conditions and to sell their products in countries) the workers of which received only a fraction of tbe prevailing Australian wage rates. The iron and steel industry was the only 1 Australian industry that was able to export under those conditions. To-day, to Australia after its no iron and steel is exported from this country. Australian wool-growers shipped approximately 2 per cent, of their wool in the Commonwealth-owned vessels, the beef industry shipped about 3 per cent, of their output on the vessels and the wheat growers about 1 per cent, of their crop. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was of great value to our primary producers or that itssale was a. loss to them. The line was disposed of to a wealthy British shipping company. It was purchased by the. White Star Line which had. a capital, of £stg.9,000,000, of. which the original shareholders held preference shares, to the value of £5,000,000, and the well-known British, shipping companies,, the. Union Castle Company,. Elder Dempster and the Royal Mail Company each held. 1,000,000 shares,, and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company and the Nelson Company each held approximately. 5.0.0,000 shares. It will thereforebe agreed,. I think,, that all the arguments, advanced by honourable members opposite ih support of the The. ships were on, the retention of the Australian. Commonwealth Line of Steamers have been completely refuted. It has been claimed that Australian, workers had to fight for the conditions, that, applied toseamen employed on the ships of the line. They fought for those conditionsnot so much wanted to. embarrass the government which owned the line. According to the report, of the Public Accounts Committee, the total complement of. the line numbered 1,034' men, of whom. 514 resided in Australia and 520 in other parts of the world, chiefly in Great Britain. It will be seen, therefore, that if a fight were waged for the good conditions that obtained, hi the service: of the line it was waged more in the interests of other than Australian, workers. Of diet masters employed by the line, five resided in Australia and two in the United Kingdom. Of the pursers, 57 lived in Australia and 19 in the United Kingdom. Of the engineers, 60 lived in Australia and 27 in other countries. All of the apprentices appointed to do the job, and, secondly, were resident in Australia. It will thus be seen that the Australian conditions of employment about which honourable members opposite have said so much were enjoyed in the main by people who were not residents In considering proposals of the kind contained in this bill, we mu9t profit by the experiences of the past. The proposals now before us should be considered in the light of the dismal failures which have marked State enterprises in thv past. The ships owned by the Tasmanian Government had to be sold because they could not be operated except at a hugp loss. The socialist experiments of the Queensland Government have met with similar failure. The State timber mills and brickyards which were established by the Queensland Government proved absolute failures. The operations of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers resulted in a total loss to the taxpayer of approximately £13,000,000. Many of the people in our coastal cities and in the hinterland served by our ports are suffering severely, not only because of the shortage of shipping, but also because the cargoes carried by the few coastal vessels that are now in service are frequently sabotaged. Let the Government forget its nationalization proposal and let it co-operate in every possible way with private enterprise in the building of ships so urgently needed for the maintenance of our coastal trade. But for the efforts of private enterprise in the past the shipping programme carried out by the Government during the war years would not have been possible. Such progress as has been made in the shipbuilding industry in Australia is entirely due to the efforts of private enterprise. I appeal to the Government not to do anything to kill Australian enterprise. these proposals turns out to be a good or a bad move will depend on the contents of the bill now before the Parliament. The Government's success or failure in« this move will depend entirely upon the job given to the new organization and: how it does that job. The two decidingfactors will be, first, the calibre of the men the policy of the Government and itsability to plan for the future defence of Australia. This problem should not beapproached on the basis of petty war between private interests and a government of Australia. shipping line. That is only a side issue. The real consideration is that of defence.. This Parliament has to face the position as it exists to-day. In the event of another war this country would not have the merchant shipping necessary to maintain the flow of essential supplies to and from this country and,, shipping to bring troops to Australia if that became necessary. Both of theseare defence responsibilities. We must make up our minds regarding the future of sea transport in an air age. We shall have to decide whether emphasis should be given to the development of air orsea transport. Air transport is now skimming the cream off the passenger trade. Air transport is developingrapidly. The Government is already engaged in the overseas air transport business. Soon, the number of air passages will outnumber the total ship passagesto and from the Commonwealth. That means that passenger ships must becomeuneconomic. The problem then, is not merely restricted to possible competitionbetween a government shipping line and private enterprise. The Government willhave to decide whether it will subsidize private ships as a defence precaution, or whether it will assume responsibility for the entire burden of transport. What is the position to-day? Great Britain isalready back in the shipping business. It has remodelled and reconditioned many large passenger liners and is buildingnew vessels. It has an expanding shipbuilding programme that should take care of traffic between Australia and the United Kingdom. According to the preamble of this bill this is purely a defence measure, but I remind the House that any vessels that tbe Commonwealth may own will, in wartime, he placed under the control of the British Admiralty, and rightly so. They",57,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
173,Mr Lang (Reid) [5.7],"Whethe rwill not be available to Australia. We cannot expect to compete with British ships that are now engaged in the trade between the United Kingdom and Australia. What is the position in the Pacific? The Pacific is our principal artery, and we must be prepared to defend it. United States shipping is now lagging. Costs have prevented the restoration of the Matson line service to this country. Apart from Aorangi, the ships plying between Australia and North America are, at the best, only cargo vessels. The United States Maritime Commission refuses to pay sufficiently large subsidies to induce the Matson line to restore its pre-war service; it will not compel it to do so. The huge flotilla of ships that the American Government built to transport troops and supplies in wartime is now rotting at anchor. According to recent reports, more than 700 ships are tied up in the Hudson Eiver and will never be used again. Thc 10,000-ton olass of vessel is not a satisfactory propoand Queen Elizabeth. We hear a good sition, because it is too small for long distance passenger traffic. As the result of higher costs, American vessels are not able to compete with those of other -nations in the cargo trade. In particular, Atlantic. In the event of another war, American seamen have had to compete with ships under the Panama register. Their owners are unscrupulous and cut not only freights but also the wages and conditions of tbe toilers who work the vessels. Australia has exactly the same problem. I should like the Government to consider what use it will be to build and operate ships of 10,000 tons if vessels on the Panama register can undercut freights, because their owners do not pay reasonable wages or observe the International Shipping Code. We shall be left with useless vessels upon our hands, and they will be tied up at the wharfs or in tbe Lane Cove River. We must have the ships that are necessary for any war-time requirements. No Australian will dispute that point. The only sound policy is that which saved Great Britain in the hour of its greatest peril. We should base our policy on Great Britain's experience. British foresight, not of a few months but of many years, saved the United Kingdom and democracy in World War II . Great Britain had built two ships for peacetime commerce in the knowledge that, in war-time, they would become an important arm of its defence system. Those ships, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, have more than justified that belief. Defeating the submarine menace, they transported troops, not by the handful, but by divisions to various theatres ol war. Wherever those ships appeared, they became symbols of victory. They brought back to Australia from the Middle East the troops that saved this country from the Japanese. Had Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth not been available, there would never have been a Kokoda trail victory. The Japanese would not have been halted before they had established themselves at Port Moresby. I say to my fellow-countrymen that nothing else could have saved Australia. Australia and Great Britain owe everything to the magnificent troop shuttle service provided by Queen Mary deal of humbug talked in this House, but no honoraible member will deny that both those great ships are again dominating the passenger service in the North they will immediately revert to their former role of troop transports. Is not that a lesson that should have impressed itself upon this Government? There is room for argument about the role that, battleships will play in any future war at sea. We know how long Prince of Wales and Repulse lasted against air attack, yet the cost of those capital ships was probably much greater than the cost of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. When the Government decides to expend £20,000,000 on the Royal Australian Navy, no honourable member raises any objection. During the war, the cost of the Navy rose to £40,000,000 per annum and now, in peace-time, it costs approximately £20,000,000 per annum. But we have no guarantee that it can provide a satisfactory screen for this country. Buti f we had two ships of the same carrying capacity and performance as the "" Queen"" ships would not our position be much more secure? If the new shipping board merely goes into the coastal trade with small vessels to compete with the existing companies, we shall be no better off from a defence viewpoint. steamers for tbe Pacific trade, it will be merely competing with the ocean tramps; but, if it takes the bold course, and builds for the future defence of this country, it can perform a real service. What is the use of making Manus Island a defence base, unless we can man it quickly? What would be the use of a defence pact with the United States, unless troops could be moved quickly in the event of another threatened invasion? In addition to their war-time use, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth have proved excellent peace-time investments, not only for their owners, but also for the nation. They are earning the dollars from the American tourist traffic that are helping Sir Stafford Cripps designed for war, as well as for peace? to check the dollar drift. They carry to Britain thousands of Americans who buy British goods, spend money on British tourist attractions, and help to create new markets for British exports. That is all sound business. Why should not we follow that example? Let the new shipping board have a definite target-to build two counterparts of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, for the Pacific. Let the two vessels be built in Australia, by Australian workmen. Tbat would be a project to fire the imagination and enthusiasm of the entire industry. Private enterprise could not afford to take the risk. As a strictly commercial proposition, it could not be jusified, but, as a defence measure, it would be more than justified. We are told that the Soviet is placing submarines in the Pacific. The war proved that high-speed ships are the best and most effective counter to submarines. Small, slow ships are "" sitting ducks"" for the modern submarine. Australia could take the initiative in establishing a big tourist trade in the Pacific. Two ships of the "" Queen"" class could do much to solve our dollar problem. Why should we be dependent on other countries to provide the ships fOT that traffic? If we built two such ships as danger. It leaves the door wide open for T have suggested, they could be nsed to bring the right kind of migrants from the Pacific West Coast. They would probably 'cost more than £25,'000,000, but they would represent capital assets, as Mr Lang. well as security. There is no reason why If it builds 10,000-ton they should not be built in Australia. When Queen Mary was begun, the builders had no previous experience with ships of that dimension. The British Government would, no doubt, be only too happy to co-operate with Australia. Key marine engineers could be obtained for such a programme. When we built the Sydney Harbour Bridge, we had to call in outside engineers, as well as utilize the services of our own men, but the work was done by Australians. We had never built a bridge of that size before, either. There were those who said it could.not be built or that it would be too costly; but it is there to-day as an advertisement throughout the world for Australian workers. Why should not our workers be able to build the world's biggest liners, The building would provide employment for tbe proper kind of migrants, for engineers from the Clydeside, for our own Australians. We have the steel. We have the skill. The Government has the money. All that we need is the courage and foresight to tackle tbe project. We could start using the Captain Cook Graving Dock, in Sydney, as it should be used. We could then keep ontraining men, and provide for our Navy with a first-class floating recruitment centre. Once the ships were in service, we could maintain our own lines of communication across the Pacific. We would be in a position to move sufficient troops wherever they were needed in the event of attack from the north. The cost, properly capitalized, would be much more economic than comparable expenditure on vessels for the Navy, which, to-day are obsolete before they are placed in commission. If the Government is prepared to tackle such a project, it will find the people right behind it. It is of no use tinkering at the building and operating of small ships. Tbe proposal to subsidize the building of ships for private shipowners is also fraught with great the payment of a premium on incompetence, and worse. Until such time as theshipowners are unable to provide anadequate service and to maintain sufficient ships for defence purposes, no justification exists for the granting of such indirect Government subsidies. The job of the Government is to see that ships operating in Australian waters observe the maritime codes governing safety and working conditions. It may be that a ship built in 1925 is still capable of excellent service. Had it not been for such vessels, the British Army would never have been evacuated from Dunkirk. The efficiency of a ship 24 years old would depend upon the quality of its original structure. Many ships built within the last ten years would not satisfy a rigid test. But the Government Should see to it that ships using the facilities of Australian harbours comply in every respect with the approved standards. The Minister for Immigration has been most evasive in his replies to questions regarding the use of ships that are on the Panama register for bringing migrants to this country. We do not want nondescripts trading with this country and undermining the conditions of Australia, British and American seamen. That is a job that the Government should see to immediately. Much will depend upon the calibre of the men appointed to the proposed board. They should be, above all, practical men. It would be a good idea for the Government to disclose the names of the proposed appointees when submitting a measure of this nature to the Parliament. There is no danger that the measure will not be passed. Then tbe House could judge the proposal with a complete knowledge of all tbe facts. In a recent instance, this House was misled regarding the qualifications, of a certain person for a particular appointment. -one of the appointees possessed the major disqualifications set out in the legislation. A frank disclosure of the Government's intentions would enable this bill to be discussed realistically. If the Government is sincere, it will not just add another piece of legislation to the statute-book. It does not desire to make any sacrifices will get down to the real job. It has placed the defence clause in the preamble to the ""bill. It may regard that as an excellent legal alibi, but that is not what is wanted. Let us make this a real defence measure. Let ""us provide this country with the finest ships in the world. The present position in the Pacific is a real challenge. Tf we believe that our future depends upon our maintaining sea communications with the North American continent, then it is up to us to tackle the real task ahead. Let us build and operate ships of our own, comparable with Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. There is no reason why they should not be equipped as emergency aircraft carriers for war. There has been too much talk about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers that expired after the first world war. That is ancient history. The honourable gentleman's time has expired. was a very unusual experience to hear the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) putting the case for increased defence so forthrightly to the Government. Defence is a subject that honourable members on this side of the House frequently bring to the Government's attention without the Government taking very much notice of them. Now that the same advocacy has come from one who has been so closely connected with members of the Government, who has been for many years a prominent Labour leader, and who trained and introduced into politics, many bonorable members at present on the Government side -of the House, it is to be hoped that a change of heart will be evidenced in the Government's general attitude towards the problem of defence. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) was saying ""Hear, In actual fact hear! "" to his own old leader. The honourable member for Hume once .said that he would die for that gentleman, the present honourable member for Reid. Mi-. DEPUTY SPEAKER -The honourable member for Hume, I take it, at the moment. remarks made by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie). He told the House that the turn-round of ships in Australian ports now took longer than before the war because nowadays ships are fully loaded whereas before the war they were not. He .said that that was the .sole rreason for the slower turnaround.",60,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

176,Mr Gullett,"I turn now to theI say that that is a deliberate piece of dishonest nonsense, and that the honourable member knows full well it is not the truth. As the honourable member for in unmistakable terms, supporting his assertions by figures that any one can check, ships take longer to turn round to-day because the volume of cargo per man hour is less than ever before in the history of the country. In fact, I believe it stands at the lowest figure now standard of efficiency on government ships for the whole world. That is the reason why the turn-round of ships is so slow. It takes longer to turn round ships than it used to take because, not to put too fine a point on it, there are too many -Communists in control of tbe shipping industry and too many loafers in the industry. It is because the Stevedoring Industry Commission has permitted tbe presence of these Communists and loafers to continue that we have the present state -of affairs on the wharfs, which is well known to all honourable members. In the eyes of shipowners throughout the world, Australia is a place to be avoided because they know that they will not be able to get their ships loaded or unloaded expeditiously and that work on them will be held up on some pretext or other. That is one of the major reasons why we cannot get even the minimum amount -of shipping in Australian waters to enable us to carry essential goods between the States. The honourable member for Wilmot made a great noise about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. He said that that line was a remarkable asset in view of its work on behalf of the farmers and other primary producers. The honourable member for Wakefield answered tbose remarks. The truth of the matter is that those ships did not carry more than 2 per cent, of the wheat crop of Australia. The Government has criticized previous governments for the sale of that shipping line. Surely all honourable members realize that if a government undertakes a major enterprise which costs the taxpayers millions of pounds and produces no benefit of .any consequence to the community it is the clear duty of succeeding governments to get rid of it. .Such action was followed by a Labour government in Tasmania, and the same course was taken Mr Gullett. with respect to the Commonwealth shipping line by the Bruce-Page Government. I was very glad to hear from the honourable member for Wilmot a reference to the very high standard of amenities on government built and operated ships at the present time. It is pleasant to hear that that is the case, because all honourable members know that it has not always been so in the shipping industry. I should also have liked to .hear that the is also high, because after all we can point to plenty of government undertakings in this country where the standard of amenities is high and the standard of work and service is relatively low. The first job of ships is to carry passengers and cargoes at a freight rate that the people can afford to pay and that will not unnecessarily increase the cost of living. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the proposed government shipping line is not intended to be a floating rest home for seamen. Its primary job is to carry cargo between the States at reasonable freight rates. Then we heard a pathetic bleat from the honourable member for Wilmot to the effect that government ships could not get a "" fair go"" and could not get gangs on the wharfs. Whose fault is that? Everybody knows that the stevedoring industry, including the allotment of gangs, is in the hands of the Stevedoring Industry Commission that was established by this Government. So let not the honourable member try to get away with deliberate distortions of that nature. The same position applies to the wharfs themselves. The allocation of wharfage has practically nothing to do with the shipping companies at all, and to say that the government ships cannot get a "" f a i r go"" because everybody is against them is completely untrue and the honourable member was dishonest when he sought to mislead this House on that matter. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. ber for Wilmot made great play on the situation on the wharfs and implied quite clearly that shipping delays were, in some roundabout way, the fault of the shipping companies and that private enterprise was to blame. It is time be",63,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
177,Wakefield ( Mr Mcbride) Told The House,,64,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
178,Mr Gullett,"The honourable memrealized and said quite honestly that thc whole of the stevedoring industry ia no longer in the hands of private enterprise, but is entirely under the direction of a government instrumentality, the Stevedoring Industry Commission, a member of which is a man called Jim Healy. I do not intend to deal with him at length, but I can say that he is a Communist and that all Communists desire that ships be uot turned round more quickly in Australian ports. Every Communist must be glad to see the hold-up of shipping in Australian ports and the rotting of the wharfs of food that should be sent to England. Healy was appointed by this Government. So long as delay occurs at Australian ports the Government is responsible, because it was the authority that set up the Stevedoring Industry Commission. [n this debate, honourable members opposite have attempted to tell the House that the issues involved in the bill are purely local and sectional and that it is simply a bill to set up a Small government shipping instrumentality. That is another point on which we cannot agree. Although the attention of the honourable member for Reid was drawn to the point, he rather passed it off; but the point is that this legislation unhappily complies with the pledge that honourable gentlemen opposite have to sign that they will socialize the means of production, distribution and exchange in Australia. The honourable member knows that very well. Our objections to the bill are primarily on that basis. We are not opposing the measure because we have to any degree the interests of the shipping companies at heart. But we object to socialist tor McKenna) and the Prime Minister agencies wherever they appear. Certain honourable gentlemen opposite deny that this is an attempt to nationalize the shipping industry, but they know that it is their intention to nationalize the industry. We have only to look back on recent history. We have seen them try to nationalize the airlines. I hope that no one denies that nationalization of the airlines was their original intention. They have tried to nationalize the banks. They have been prevented from doing both only by the Constitution and the f aci shipping industry, we oppose this bill. that we have a High Court to protect us. Honourable gentlemen opposite know that they cannot nationalize the shipping industry directly, because they .tried to nationalize the airlines and failed. They know that they would meet with no greater success in any attempt to nationalize shipping than they met with in their attempt to nationalize airlines. So they propose the indirect method of bringing the Australian shipping industry under direction and control. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) pointed out, there is in this bill every weapon calculated to put out of business every shipping agency in Australia except that of the Government. There are to be, for instance, licences. Every ship must have one before it may operate. There is the cost factor, over which no authority other than the Government has control. There are to be licences to build ships, and licences for new ships and, finally, there is to be a retiring age, as it were, at which ships must be put off the seas. So the Govern-, ment will have every power necessary in the operation of the legislation to nation-, alize the great Australian shipping industry. I have yet to hear any honourable gentleman opposite deny that nationalization of the snipping industry is the Government's intention. There is an attempt also to try to tell the people that this is purely an issue between the Government and the shipping companies, just as, when the Banking Bill was being debated, we were told that it was a matter between the people and the great trading banks. We now have a similar plea in respect of the nationalization of medical services. The Minister for Health (Sena( Mr Chifley) have claimed that that is an issue between the people, that is the Government, and the British Medical Association. Nothing is further from the case. I make it very clear, speaking as a member of the Opposition, that we do not particularly care for the shipping companies, the banks, the airlines, the British Medical Association, or any other similar bodies. Our objection is to nationalization and socialization. As a scheme for the nationalization of the Every one in Australia should realize that that is the issue involved in the bill. Yesterday, as it were, we dealt with a bill to nationalize the means of exchange, that is the banks; to-day, we have before us a bill to nationalize the means of distribution, that is the ships; and tomorrow, very clearly-and let honourable gentlemen opposite deny it if they canwe shall be asked to deal with a bill to nationalize the means of production. We have heard occasionally, in unguarded remarks of Labour supporters, that the coal mines should be nationalized. Indeed, some of them bave said that the primary industries, or certain of them, should be nationalized. It is all a part of the platsupport of the bill the fact that to have form that they have signed and a part of their policy. Of course, they have picked the easiest industries to nationalize first. have come to a nice pass when honourable They hope that the public will not strongly oppose them, and that they may attract a little public support. For example, bonorable gentlemen opposite hoped that tbe banks would be so unpopular that there would not be a public outcry if the Government took them over. Tbe Government hoped that its offer to pay a half of people's bills for medical attention would blind them to the fact that a great section of their lives was to be brought under socialist control. It has similar hopes in connection with, this bill! Any person in this country who does not want to see a socialist state should, oppose every socialistic measure brought before the Parliament. That is where we stand on this legislation. I propose to say a word or two about how this bill will affect the industry that it sets out allegedly to benefit. The first thing that impressed us is that it. will have the immediate of forcing up prices and adding to the rising prices' that have been so marked a feature of the life of this Government. Indeed, this is the sort of legislation that can do nothing but create further shortages. If the Government has plenty of money to spend, and desires to give some service, there are. plenty of outlets for its energies. If it wants to bring more, people here and employ them, in a. great government industry, let it put tbem to work' on producing more steel, bricks and timber, and all those other materials the pro: vision of which would help to alleviate' the housing' shortage. Butj far from Mr Gullett.. doing anything of the kind, this legislation will only take more men out of various industries that can ill afford to lose them. The great majority will not be employed in productive work. They will be on the Government's pay-roll and the taxpayers will have to foot the bill, but they will not add one jot to tbe wealth of Australia. This is tbe sort of measure favoured by the Government and a reason why there is a shortage of everything and why prices are continually rising. The honourable member for Reid offered, of all the strange reasons, as the reason for his our own shipping industry would be most useful in the defence of Australia. We gentlemen opposite, particularly the honourable member for Reid, sbould have a good word to say on the subject of defence, because we on this side know that so far as defence is concerned Australia, under the present administration, has nothing toshow but a paper army, unfulfilled promises, unfulfilled quotas, schemes that are never brought to fruition, unrealized plans and all that sort of thing. If the Government really wants to do something to help to make us secure, there are obvious means that it could adopt to develop the armed forces rather than indulge in this kind of legislation. That is the feeblest and most insincere of all. the arguments that has been advanced in support of the measure. As I said at the outset, I have no particular interest in defending, the shipping companies, but the Minister effect for Defence, in introducing the bill, made certain remarks that were not correct. He implied that, before the war, the Australian coastal shipping was obsolete and inefficient, but the honourable made it clear that that is far from the considered opinion of. any one in. posses^ sion of any of the facts. On the contrary, we had a most emcient shipping service before the war. If not, what did honourable gentlemen opposite do about it? I did not hear one honourable gentleman opposite, including the Minister' for Defence, claim at that time that there was'anything wrong, with the Australian shipping service . 1",64,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

183,Mr Gullett,"The. ""Spirit ofnew train has been built for 50 years, let alone fifteen years. Having regard to the great shipbuilding industries of other countries and the conditions under which they operate, it is very doubtful whether we shall be able to build any other than the most strictly standardized ships. Our industries are dispersed. There is no place in Australia where all the work on a ship from the laying of the keel to complete fitting out of it can be done. Parts have to be brought from all over the country, and at various stages of its construction a ship has to be moved around the coast. Apart from that, there is the question of cost. If we wish to know what the cost of Australian ships will 'be, let us consider the motor car that is now being built in Australia. The Holden car is a triumph for everybody connected with it, but it cannot be denied that it is being produced at a price which the workers of this country cannnot afford. I assume that the object of producing a cheap car is to produce one that everybody can afford, but it is obvious that the Holden car could not compete with imported American cars, upon which a high duty is imposed, if those cars were being imported in large numbers. It has been said frequently that a venture such as the production of the Holden car is well worthwhile to Australia, but the Government is now proposing to embark upon the establishment of a really great industry in this country which will absorb a tremendous amount of man-power. When the Australian Government entered this field of activity previously, the government instrumentality incurred huge losses year after yeai. That fact should be taken into account. There is not the faintest indication that this venture can possibly be a success in regard to the construction, operation and management of ships. It is common knowledge that during tbe war there was a considerable reduction of shipping tonnages throughout the world and that Australia has been forced to carry its share of the difficulties that have resulted from that reduction. Those difficulties are particularly apparent in the central and northern areas of Queensland as well as in Tasmania and Western Australia, where importers, retailers and producers have encountered considerable difficulty in obtaining the supplies that they need and which must be carried to the nearest ports by ships. The Government has taken advantage of those difficulties and has used them in an attempt to justify the necessity for this bill. Before it can be claimed that any situation is being met by provisions made for that purpose, the reasons for that situation must be fully understood. As far as Australia is concerned there are two main reasons for the present shipping position, with which the bill is designed to deal. The first is that there is a shortage of ships and a dislocation of shipping services as a result of the war. The shortage of ships, however, is not so great as it is generally claimed to be. If there were no other factors contributing to our present difficulties, the position could have been met without the introduction of such an extensive measure as this bill. The second reason for the present shipping situation is, in my opinion, causing a great deal more trouble than the first one. It is the policy of the Communist-dominated Waterside Workers Federation pf Australia and other trade unions. For years those unions have pursued a deliberate policy of strikes and goslow tactics on the waterfront. Strike after strike, hardly one of which has had any justification, has held up the transport of essential material and prevented the quick turn-round of ships. The goslow tactics that have been adopted on the waterfront throughout Australia have also had their effect. The loading ratee at Australian ports are at least 50 per cent, lower than the pre-war rates. It cannot be argued that the reason for that is lack of equipment and loading facilities, because the equipment that is now available is at least as good as that which was in use prior to the war and. in many instances it is better, particularly in Queensland, where new equipment was installed during the war. As a result of the slow turn-round of ships that has been caused by this go-slow policy, ships now expect to spend one week at sea and three weeks in port out of every four weeks, instead of three weeks at sea and one week in port, as tbey did",67,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
184,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [8.20].,"previously. It is apparent that, if the position facing Australia with regard to shipping services is to be properly dealt with, the second factor to which I have referred must receive the attention of thc Government. Any attempt to deal with the problem without taking positive action to remedy the position on the waterfront will be doomed to failure, no matter how many ships may be built. It is evident that the shortage of ships and dislocation of shipping services is being used by this Government in an attempt to justify the introduction of this extreme measure which is now before the House. T use the word "" extreme "" advisedly because if the powers that are contained in this bill are fully utilized they can only result in the ultimate squeezing out of all companies that are at present engaged in the provision of shipping services, or, in other words, nationalization. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, has disclaimed that that is the Government's intention, but there is a short reply to his disclaimer. If the Government does not intend to squeeze out tbe private companies and nationalize the shipping industry, what is the necessity for the provisions which are designed to give the Minister complete control of the industry? The full use of the provision -? of the bill must lead to the squeezing out of difficulties ? I say that it cannot. Clause private shipping companies. If that is not the Government's intention, there is no necessity for the provisions. The fact that they have been put into the bill gives a much greater, clearer and more reliable indication of the Government's intention than does the Minister's second-reading speech. Let us examine these provisions. First, the Australian Shipping Board is to be appointed, presumably, to replace the present board. Clause7 of the bill provides that the board shall consist of five members to be appointed by the Governor General, which means the Minister. It is apparent that a body appointed in that manner will carry out the dictates of the Minister. The board will not be composed, as it could well have been, of representatives of shipping companies, importers, exporters, primary producers and other people who are interested in shipping. It is to be composed of men appointed by the Minister. Having regard to our experience of government boards in other spheres of industry in Australia, we can form a good idea of its probable constitution. It will be a board that will immediately carry out the wishes of the Minister. The board is to be given very wide powers. Clause 15 provides that it shall have power to do the following things:To establish, maintain and operate, or to provide for the establishment, maintenance and operation of, shipping services for the carriage of passengers, goods and mails( i ) between a place in a-State and a place in another State; ( i i ) between a place in the Commonwealth and a place in a Territory of the Commonwealth; ( i i i ) between a place in a Territory ot the Commonwealth and a place in the same or another Territory of the Commonwealth; (iv) between a place in the Commonwealth and a place in another country; and (v) between a place in a Territory ot the Commonwealth and a place in another country. It is to be given a world-wide scope. It will be able to operate wherever and whenever it wishes. Can it be contended that such wide powers are necessary for the adjustment of our present shipping 15 also provides that the board shall have power to act as an agent for shipowners. Shipowners have been able to carry on their business up till now with a government-controlled shipping board, acting as agent for them. Is this a subtle method of ensuring that shipowners shall be brought under control by virtue of the fact that the Australian Shipping Board will act as their agents? It is provided, further, that the board shall be empowered to lease, charter and sell ships, to train a mercantile marineI shall have more to say about that later because it is not entirely a bad provision-to design ship and to determine the design of ships to be built in Australia. It is evident that if the powers vested in the board are fully utilized the private shipping companies will become completely subservient to the board, and therefore to tbe Minister, even in regard to the design of the ships that they may be permitted to build if they are "" good boys"". Finally, it is provided that the hoard shall advise the Minister limiting provision it is aurlikely that the on any matter pertaining to shipping.

185,"( Mr Mcbride), Seems To Be One Of The Tain A Licence To Purchase A Ship; Then","This recital of the powers contained in the bill definitely establishes the fact that the control of shipping will be taken from rhe bands of private enterprise and will be placed solely in the hands of the Government. The history of the new government enterprise will probably be as unhappy as that of earlier government enterprises. In considering legislation of this kind I am struck by the fact that tbere has been a noticeable similarity in much of the legislation that has been introduced by the Government during the short period in which I have been a member of this House. There is a significant similarity between this legislation and, for instance, the banking legislation. When the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) was dealing with the nationalization proposals embodied in this hill the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) interjected and said, "" Y o u say the same thing about all legislation "". That is perfectly true. In almost every piece of legislation that has been introduced by this Government an attempt has been made to give effect to Labour's objective of nationalization. It was because of that fact that the honourable member for Gippsland pointedly referred to , the nationalization aspect of the bill now before us. The banking legislation, which was introduced last year, was another notable example of this trend. Tbe Banking Act 1945 was subjected to a successful challenge in the High Court. That challenge could have been met simply by the Government agreeing to amend the legislation, but it did not follow that course. The challenge of one or two provisions of the Banking Act' 1945 was seized upon by the Government as a justification for the introduction of a measure which provided for complete nationalization of banking throughout Australia. looked for a convenient peg on which to hang a proposal for the extension of its socialistic programme. The same trend can be seen in the Government's action in amending the Electoral Act to provide for the redistribution of seats. Every honourable member in this House admitted that there was some justification for an alteration of parliamentary representation in the Commonwealth sphere, particularly of country areas; but that admission did not justify the Government in introducing such far-reaching proposals as were contained in the recent legislation. The Government seized upon the opportunity to introduce a bill which made provision for a very extensive increase of the number of seats in both Houses of this legislature, thereby involving the country in enormous additional expenditure. The reason for that move was obvious to every member of this Parliament. The action of the Government was prompted by a desire to make safe for its supporters certain seats which were doubtful. The same pattern is being followed in the bill now before us. There is, I admit, need for some governmental assistance in the establishment of additional shipping services throughout Australia, particularly to ports remote from the large centres of population. It is the function of the Australian Government to make provision for the establishment and maintenance of services which cannot be profitably provided by the shipping companies. The Government, however, is determined to go ahead with its policy of nationalization and has seized upon this opportunity to introduce a measure which will provide for the nationalization of the shipping industry throughout Australia. This measure follows the pattern of other socialistic measures which have been introduced by the Government. I have said that there is some justification for the provision of shipping services to outlying ports. The only reference I can find to that matter in the bill now before us-and I have studied it assiduously-is contained in sub-clause 2 of clause 15, which readsWhere, in the opinion of the Minister, a shipping service is necessary to meet the reThe Government merely quirements of a particular area and it is desirable in the public interest that a shipping service should be provided for that area, the Minister may direct the Board to establish, maintain and operate, or to continue to maintain and operate, a shipping service for the purpose of meeting those requirements. If the bill provided only for the establish-, ment of such services and for the assistance of the shipbuilding industry I should not complain about it. Such provisions are justified, but unfortunately the remaining provisions of the bill will enable the Government completely to control the shipping industry. Another reason advanced for the introduction of this measure is the need for the establishment of a mercantile marine. In introducing the bill the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) said that one of its aims was to provide for an adequate and efficient mercantile marine which was essential for defence purposes. We all agree that we need an adequate and efficient mercantile marine, but very little reference to that matter is made in the bill. The sole reference to a mercantile marine is contained in a small sub-clause dealing with the powers of the board which empowers the hoard to establish and to train men in a mercantile marine. After listening to the Minister's second-reading speech those who knew nothing of the position would assume that the development of an Australian mercantile marine was something new and that it was necessary for the Government to introduce a bill such as this in order to bring about its establishment. Is it not a fact that the Australian mercantile marine did a magnificent job during the war ? Did not the Australian mercantile marine have a magnificent record prior to the war? The Australian mercantile marine was established by private enterprise and not by the Government under conditions that prevailed long before this bill was ever thought of. Was a measure such as this needed for the establishment of the British mercantile marine, which is the admiration of the world? Certainly not. Therefore, the contention that a government shipping service is necessary for the purpose of establishing the mercantile marine in the interests of defence, is humbug. Defence considerations have been dragged into this debate apparently at the last moment in an endeavour to justify the introduction of the bill. The matter is referred to principally in an amendment that the Minister for Defence has circulated since making his second-reading speech. I propose briefly to examine , the provisions relating to the defence aspect. Proposed new sub-clause 2A of clause 29 readsThe powers conferred on the Minister by the determines will be of the kind to last two preceding sub-sections are conferred have a defence value? for the purpose of ensuring, in the interests the bill or in the proposed amendof defence, that thc shipbuilding industry is ment is such provision made. established in the Commonwealth on an adeMr Davidson. quate scale and is maintained in continuous operation, and, in particular, for the purpose of ensuring(a) the use of the labour of persons engaged in the building of ships, and of the facilities of shipbuilding yards, to the best advantage ,What is there in this bill that ensures that the labour engaged in the construction of ships will be used to the best advantage? Is it contended that, as the result of the establishment of a government shipping line, labour engaged in shipbuilding will be used to better advantage than it would be used under private enterprise? Those who attempt to justify that statement completely ignore the results of all government essays in controls of this kind in the past. Honourable members on this side of the House have pointed repeatedly in this debate to the unfortunate results that 'have always followed the intrusion of a governmeni into matters of this kind. Therefore, th? contention that, by establishing the shipping industry under government control, we shall use labour to better advantage than it can be used by private enterprise, is ridiculous. Let us remember that the history of industrial trouble throughout Australia during the last few years has shown clearly that more industrial* trouble has developed in government controlled undertakings than in those conducted by private enterprise. Therefore, it cannot be contended either from the defence or any other standpoint that under this legislation, labour can be used to better advantage. The proposed amendment also states that the powers conferred on the Minister are for the purpose of ensuring(b) the adoption of standard designs 'of ships and of the fittings and gear of ships; (c) the adoption of appropriate standards. and efficient methods of construction of ships. It is admissible that if ships are to be constructed with an eye to their use in wartime, that is to say, to their defence value, some special features in design are advisable. But who will ensure that such standard designs as the board' Nowhere in No provision is made for obtaining expert opinion in tbe designing of ships in order to make them of defence value in war time. The proposed amendment also provides that the powers conferred on the Minister are for the purpose of ensuringid) the building of the tonnage or design most urgently required in priority to the building of other ships; That proposal may be interpreted by some honourable members as being of defence value, but to me it seems much more likely to operate as a power in the hands of the Minister over the private shipping companies. specifies that the Minister may exercise control over the tonnage or design of ships and may give priority to such ships over the construction of other ships. In other words, private companies will be forced to take second place to the requirements of the Minister in the building of ships for the Commonwealth line. The proposed amendment states finally that the powers conferred on the Minister are for the purpose of ensuring(e) economy in the construction of ships and of the fittings and gear of ships. service outlying areas where, for the That is the unbindest cut of all. The Government tells us that, under the cloak of defence, we shall have the advantage of economy in the cost of constructing ships. The position at present is that the British shipbuilding industry, in spite of the terrific drubbing that it received during the war, is producing ships that ean be landed in Australia at a cost which, expressed in Australian currency, is 40 per cent, less than the cost of building similar ships in this country. Under this bill, the Government proposes to provide a subsidy up to 25 per cent, of the cost of building a ship in Australia, so it is evident that the shipping companies that require ships will still be required to pay a considerable amount in excess of the sum that they would pay for a similar British ship. However, the Government assures us, in the proposed amendment, that the powers conferred on the Minister will be for the purpose of ensuring economy in the cost of the construction of ships. It appears to me that defence considerations are being regarded as of only secondary importance, as they have been in all other measures that this Government has introduced, and as a means of enabling the Government to withstand a challenge to the validity of the bill on constitutional grounds. That, I regret to say, seems to be the real reason for introducing the defence question into this measure. In passing, I must say that I consider that defence is an important element in the Government's activities, and it is regrettable that the same enthusiasm for defence was not evident when ithe Government introduced the Papua and New Guinea Bill, which related to matters The provision definitely of far greater importance in the defence of this country than the establishment of a Government shipping line. The Papua and New' Guinea Bill provided for tbe transfer of the former mandated Territory of New Guinea, which is of vital importance to our defence, to the control of the United Nations. Summing up, 1 admit that some need does exist for Government action to assist private enterprise in rehabilitating the shipbuilding industry, and, possibly, in establishing certain snipping lines to present at any rate, private enterprise cannot be expected to provide a service. After all, the ships owned by the private companies, and the men that they have trained in the mercantile marine, were freely used by the Government in war time. Therefore, a definite obligation devolves upon the Government to do everything in its power to assist the private shipping companies to recover their pre-war standards. However that necessity, I say definitely, does not justify the introduction of a bill that takes away from shipping companies the control of their own affairs and sets out to establish a national venture in shipbuilding which must place on the already over-burdened shoulders of tbe taxpayers an onerous load for which there is not the slightest justification. regret to say that I regard 'this bill as one of the most dishonest measures that this Government or any of its predecessors has ever introduced into the Parliament. Although the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who moved the second reading of tbe bill, bas professed that the objeiyt",70,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
186,Mr Itlancts (Moreton) [8.52],"Iof the measure is primarily to establish the shipping industry in the Commonwealth, the obvious purpose of the legislation is to enable the Government to nationalize the shipping industry. According to the Minister, the bill has three main features. The honourable gentleman delivered a speech similar to that which the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (.Senator Ashley) made in the Senate when he moved the second reading of the bill in that chamber last year. The Minister for Defence has explained that the first objective of the bill is to provide for borough, have constructed ships for a long the maintenance of an Australian mercantile marine. This bill is not required for that purpose. Great Britain and the United States of America have not passed similar legislation, and, in the past, the Australian Parliament has not found it necessary to do so, for that purpose. We in Australia have a firstrate mercantile marine, which did a splendid job in World War II . Every one has loudly praised the work of the men of the mercantile marine, who faced untold dangers and rendered extraordinarily good service in conveying our troops to various theatres of war, and in carrying our products to many parts of the world. We do not need this bill to provide for the maintenance of the mercantile marine in Australia. According to the Minister for Defence, the second purpose of the bill is to maintain the shipbuilding industry in this country on an adequate scale. I again challenge the necessity for the legislation on that ground. We have had in Australia for a long time an excellent shipbuilding industry. in World War II. has taught manage-, ments, engineers, shipbuilding architects and skilled artisans how to improve the construction of ships in many ways. I have no doubt in my mind that the reasons which the Minister has given for the introduction of the bill are not genuine. They are intended to camouflage the objective of the Government, which is to nationalize shipping in Australia. Obviously, the purpose of the bill is to enable the Government gradually to squeeze tbe private shipping companies out of business. As I have stated, shipbuilding in Australia has been carried on for a long time. It developed greatly Ur. Francis. during World War II . as the result of the efforts of the honourable member for Minister for Supply and Shipping in the first two years of the war. Evans Deakin and Company Limited of Brisbane, came to the aid of the Government, and constructed many ships that have given valuable service. Those ships were, in tbe main, built at Rocklea and assembled on the banks of the Brisbane River near Bulimba. Walker Brothers, of Marytime. Because of the experience gained during the war, and the plans laid down by the Menzies Government and carried on, I am pleased to say, by the Labour Government, shipbuilding in Brisbane and Maryborough has developed by leaps and bounds. Shipyards in Sydney, Melbourne and, in particular, Whyalla in -South Australia have also greatly expanded. When I was in Whyalla during the war, I was amazed at the development in the shipbuilding industry there. We do not need this bill to give us an incentive to build ships. Vessels were constructed in Australia long before this Government came into office. The socialist Government at Canberra has only continued the good work of antisocialist governments in previous years. At this point, I desire to emphasize a particular matter. After the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) had condemned this bill in a devastating speech last Thursday, the Government foreshadowed a long amendment in an endeavour to withstand a challenge to the Experience gained validity of the legislation on constitutional grounds. For the last few days, honourable members opposite have been stressing the importance of this bill in the interests of defence. When the Minister for Shipping and Fuel moved the second reading of the bill in the Senate last year, the defence aspect was almost completely ignored. Therefore, I say that the Government's approach to this bill is dishonest in the extreme, and utterly unreal. Obviously, the sole object of the Government in introducing the bill is to nationalize the shipping industry. I remind honourable members opposite, in case they have forgotten, that the objective of the Australian Labour party.",73,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
187,"Wakefield ( Mr Mcbride), Who Was","as amended on the 1st February, 1949, isThe socialization of Industry, Production, Distribution and Exchange. Every honourable member opposite has signed 'the following pledge:I also pledge myself to actively support and advocate at all times the Party's objective-the socialization of Industry, Production, Distribution and Exchange. tn addition to this general objective, paragraph 4 of the "" Method"" section of the federal objective and platform calls for the nationalization of(a) Banking, credit and insurance (includranean methods. By claiming that its ing sick, accident, life and employnew shipping proposals are bound up with; ment), (b) Monopolies, (o) Shipping. Obviously, the Government, in introducing this bill, is endeavouring to give effect to paragraph c of the federal objective and platform of the Labour party. The Government has received (instructions to go ahead with the nationalization of the shipping industry. Knowing that it does not possess the power to nationalize the shipping industry directly, it is employing tbe backdoor method of squeezing the private companies out of the industry, although they have done so much to develop it. Another general objective of the Australian Labour party is the nationalization of public health. Honourable members are fully aware that the Government is endeavouring to give effect to that objective, and is meeting with obstacles in doing so. The people of Australia are opposed to the nationalization of industries. Therefore, the Government cannot proceed in an honest and nationalize the shipping industry and must resort to subterranean methods. Of course, it will fail. The Government proposes to nationalize banking, credit and insurance, monopolies, shipping and public health. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The bill does not contain any reference to public health, banking, credit and insurance. honourable member is not entitled to wander all over the globe in debating the bill. have every right to indicate that the nationalization of shipping is one of the objectives of the Australian Labour party, and 'that indicates clearly -Order! The honourable member must obey the Chair. of many industries which the Government is seeking to nationalize. It would like to nationalize radio broadcasting and sugar refining also. Of course, the Government is not game to do these things openly, and so it has resorted to subterthe defence of the country, the Government is attempting, in an indirect fashion,, to achieve its purpose, but such bluffing; will not deceive any one. The Government has no mandate or authority to nationalize the shipping industry, anymore than it had for its attempt tonationalize banking. The statement of the Minister for Defence that ti® Government does not intend to nationalize shipping is unconvincing. If the Labour party believes that industry should be nationalized in accordance with the party's platform, the decent thing would be to come out in the open, and say frankly that it is now intended to nationalize the shipping industry. Instead of doing that, however, the Government has resorted to dishonest methods. For instance, it has adopted the novel method of providing that ships 24 years of age must be deregistered. It is known that very few shipping companies have been able to build ships during the last ten or twelve years, so that straight-forward' manner to most privately owned ships are getting old. It will not be long before most of them are 24 years old, and some of them have already reached that age. The bill provides that they cannot be sold or transferred, and so they must be written off. No ship can be built in Australia under this legislation unless a licence is obtained. The conditions attaching to the issue of a licence are designed to make The it very difficult for private shipping companies to carry on. Those companies which wish to buy ships, even under the conditions laid down in the bill, will have to queue up behind the Government* which will take what it wants, leaving",74,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

Supplies are being sought from overseas because of the shortage of supplies in this country. How on earth can we hope, in such an atmosphere, to develop a shipping industry? If the Government would focus its attention for a little time on trying to settle industrial disputes and on dealing with the Communists who are running this country, instead of forcing us to go overseas for our raw materials, it would be doing much more useful ?ervice than it is doing by introducing this measure. We have the example of the nationalization of the coal-mining industry of Britain.

The Chair has ruled that the honourable member for Moreton may not canvass the coal-mining industry of Britain during a debate on a bill dealing with the Australian shipping industry. That ruling stands. the remarks made by my leader during the debate. That is all I propose to do. He said in his speech that coal was of vital importance to both Australia and Britain.

206,Mr Francis,"I repeat that thedollars; in 1922 it lost 9,368,670 dollars; in 1924 it lost 8,836,608 dollars; in 1925 it lost 7,667,512 dollars. After this long run of losses the Canadian Government did what the Bruce-Page Government did in Australia. It wound up its shipping line. Just as nationalization of shipping failed in Canada and has failed once before in Australia, so it will again fail in Australia. I could give the House a hundred and one examples of the effect of the nationalization of various industries. There are many such examples in New South Wales and otber States. I shall -quote examples in the State of QueensHand. In that State the Government set -out to run State cattle stations and lost £1,647,817. It ran butcher shops and lost £46,936. It tried to run State fisheries :and lost £39,297. It tried to run canneries and lost £112,627. It tried to run a ^produce agency and lost nearly £20,000. vernment could not have tried very hard in the last instance. tial losses the McCormack Government in Queensland found it impossible to run these enterprises, as the Australian Government will find it impossible to run its proposed shipping line. The Queensland Government liquidated those enterprises that had cost the State of Queensland £5,000,000, but the Queensland taxpayers are still paying interest on the amount of money that was lost. In New South Wales, losses on State enterprises were colossal. The Rozelle joinery works lost £28,000, the Botany brick works lost £31,000, the lime works lost £20,000, the timber yards lost £324,000, the power station lost £23,000, the saw mills lost £65,000, and the State trawlers lost £314,000. total loss of £805,000. go into every State of the Commonwealth and find similar losses in State £1.000,000 in State coal mining enterprises, and Western Australia and South Australia also suffered losses in State enterprises. Even the Tasmanian shipping line was operated at a loss. The Australian Government has spent £600,000 on an aluminium works and has got nowhere. It has laid out £4,370,000 through the Australian National Airlines Commission. In the first year of the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines the loss was £505,927 and in the second year it was almost £300,000. We have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds already on overseas airlines. Let honourable members turn wherever they like, and they will find that on every occasion when the State has interfered with business its interference has cost the country hundreds of thousand of pounds. Whenever a government meddles in a commercial enterprise it is invariably a costly matter for the taxpayers whose money if squandered and who have to pay additional taxation to make up the losses incurred through the Government's folly. When the Commonwealth shipping line was established by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) during his term as Prime Minister, it had every chance of success. Nevertheless many millions were lost on this venture. The Bruce-Page Government did everything possible to try to save the line. It reduced the cost of running the line and installed a new management. Despite all this re-organization the losses continued. The Government claims that the present proposals are designed to keep down costs. But let us turn to the example of Trans-Australia Airlines. Wheni t had been running for only a short time it, in concert with the Government, tried to force Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited to raise fares and freights. That was done in an effort to make the government owned airline pay. The Government's claims are grossly dishonest. The proposals in this bill are nothing but an effort by the Government to carry out the instructions that it has That was, in all, a received from the Australian Labour One could party, to implement a policy of nationalization. The Government has not the courage to tell the people straight forenterprises. Victoria lost wardly and honestly that' its desire and intention in these proposals is to nationalize the shipbuilding industry. Instead, the Government is attempting to nationalize the shipbuilding industry by squeezing out of business, without compensation, the shipping companies of Australia, and I regret that so far the shipping companies have not protested as",77,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

208,Mr Francis,"Afte r those substanmuch as they should have done. I am opposed to the proposals because I believe that the nationalization of any industry means that that, industry will be a dismal failure from the start, as the whole history of State enterprises the world over, and particularly in Australia, shows. This Government appears to be unable to learn from experience. It stands condemned of being grossly dishonest in not telling the people the true design of this measure. T believe that nothing will more seriously prejudice the Government in the eyes of the public at the next general election than its dishonest and lying approach to legislation. well as, I do that the design behind this legislation is not a simple proposal to build ships and to establish a mercantile marine. We already have a shipbuilding industry and a mercantile marine in Australia, and we have had them for a long time. I am quite satisfied that the Government, when it goes before the people at the next general election, will be called upon to defend this present proposal. -On the face of it, this bill proposes to establish a national shipping line and also to maintain the shipbuilding industry of Australia. From the point of view of the primary producers the bill is very sinister indeed, for it definitely will estabpanies, which was operating on the Auslish .a complete monopoly in shipping around the Austrahan coast. primary (producers .are very .greatly interested in the .freight rates .operating on our coasts, not only because they have to send .their produce to market by sea, but also because they must bring in by sea the agricultural machinery .and other ir-equrrements 'that come from the capital cities of '.the 'Commonwealth -Shipping freight rates have .already had, in the past, a considerable effect on -railway 'freight ""rates in Australia and -anybody .who desires 'to see an example of the operations of as'hipping company breaking 3own freight urates on the railways'has only to study the freight rates that qperated on the Newcastle-'.Sydney .railway -line, which .was ..operated in -competition with tthe Newcastle and Hunter Biver Steamship Company Limited for many years. Primary producers believe that this bill will make shipping a government monopoly, but they fear a far greater danger, which is that, because othershipping companies will not be able to come into competition with the government ships and force down freight rates, there will never be a reduction in rates. I would remind you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that I heard you this afternoon discoursing about lascars manning tbe whole of the shipping of the British Empire prior to the World WarI . I heard you say that there were no British sailors employed on British The Government knows"" as cargo-carrying ships, and in fact, I think that you went so far as to say also on passenger lines.

211,Mr Abbott1 Am Not Reflecting On,"bill being designed to prevent undue rises of shipping freights, experience has shown that the Australian Board has not had that effect. The board's operations have resulted in neither reduced freights nor economical shipping. Iu fact, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) presented figures which showed that the general cargo rate for freight between Sydney and Melbourne rose from 22s. a ton in the year ended the 30th June, 1939, to 67s. a ton in the year ended the 30th June, 1948. That completely refutes the claim of the Minister that governmental control of shipping tends to reduce freights. The honourable member for ""Wakefield shipping operating on the Australian coast that are a sad commentary on the inefficiency that occurs through a cause completely beyond the control of the shipowners, that is, the slow turn-round of ships in ports owing to the operations of the Stevedoring Industry Commission and of the Waterside Workers Federation under the direction of the chief controller of the union, the Communist, Healy. Healy, it will be remembered, went to Brisbane when the Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, had a fight of his life on his hands to settle the railway strike, and, contrary to the law and the wishes of the Stevedoring Commission, member, Healy called out the waterside workers in that city. challenged at a meeting Stevedoring Industry Commission, Healy gave the same reply as we bave become accustomed to from others like him, such as Mr Sharkey, the general secretary of the Communist party of Australia, that his first loyalty was to the Communist party and not to the Australian nation. Healy's loyalty in Queensland was to the Waterside Workers Federation and not to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. So long as the Government allows men of his type to sit on its boards and comiwissions, it will be impossible for a government shipping line or a private shipping company to maintain efficient shipping services. The Minister for Defence, who draws all sorts of deductions from figures, ought to draw the proper deduction from the figures given by the honori f r . Abbott. able member for Wakefield, who pointed out that in 1948 there was 42 per cent, Shipping more dead weight tonnage in the Australian coastal trade than in June, 1939. The tonnage in June, 1939, was 410,650 compared with 586,050 tons in June, 1948, an increase of 175,400 tons. Yet, notwithstanding the 42 per cent, increase of the tonnage of the Australian coastal shipping, cargoes carried have fallen by 7.62 per cent, a year. In addition to the increase of shipping tonnage, facilities for handling cargoes in Australian ports were greater than in 1939, largely because of tbe impetus of the war and the introduction of American methods into the loading and unloading of ships. But the waterside workers, who are controlled by Healy, have imposed a darg on the loading, unloading and stacking of cargoes. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Wakefield, the Government, has allowed infiltration of notorious Communists into instrumentalities supposedly designed to facilitate the loading, unloading and transport of cargoes. We have Healy on the Stevedoring Industry Commission and Elliott from the Seamen's Union, on the Maritime Industry Commission. Others like them are in key positions. Yet the Government always claims to be bitterly opposed to Communists. If it were genuinely opposed Industry to them, if would cull them out of their of which he is a positions of trust in which they are able without hindrance to prevent the smooth When operation of the stevedoring industry and of the the shipping industry in Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson) has already shown that whereas before the war ships engaged in the Australian coastal trade spent three weeks at sea and one week in port every month, to-day they spend one week at sea and three weeks in port. If ships were turned round more quickly in the Australian ports, there would be not only a saving of freight to shippers but also a saving of £2,500,000 a year to the Australian Government. The Government was paying that much up to the end of June, 1948, for the fifteen ships that it chartered for the Australian coastal trade. The main reason for the inflated freights on the Australian coastal trade is the inadequate supply of labour in the port* of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla.",79,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In
212,( Mr Mcbride) Presented Statistics Of,"If sufficient labour were provided by tbe Waterside Workers Federation in tbose three most of the cargoes pass to their destinations, ships could be turned round much more quickly. If the Waterside Workers Federation would open its books, more labour would be available, the ships would be turned round much more speedily and operational costs would greatly be reduced with the result that the need to charter ships would disappear. Time and time again the Waterside Workers Federation has said that if certain concessions were given to its members, it would provide the labour needed to enable a quick turn-round of ships. At one time, Healy promised tbe Stevedoring Industry Commission that adequate labour would be provided if the waterside workers were granted appearance money. Wben it was granted, there was no improvement. His promise, like all promises by Communists, was mere humbug. Then it was said that if annual leave were granted to the waterside workers, the necessary labour would be provided. Annual leave was granted to them, but the promised additional labour was not forthcoming. The granting of tbose two amenities produced nothing but sadness amongst the people who were forced to foot a bill of £650,000 a year for them. That money was not paid by the Government. It was passed on by the shipowners to the public in increased freights. If that is typical of what we shall have to face in Australia as the result of the introduction of this legislation, we can have no hope of a reduction of freights. Ships operated by the Commonwealth Shipping Board in three years lost more than £10,000,000. Had additional ships not had to be chartered, £7,500,000 of that sum would have been saved. There would have been no reason for the chartering of those ships had the waterside workers worked as well in 1948 as they did in 1939. Clause 29 of the bill provides(1.) The Minister may, in his discretion, grant licences for the construction of ships to which this Part applies. (2.) A licence under the last preceding subsection may be granted subject to such conditions relating to the tonnage, design, fittings, gear and time, place, standards and methods of construction, of the ship as the Minister determines. The honourable member for WHlmot described the various classes of steamers key ports through which constructed for the Commonwealth Shipping Board during and since the war. He described the "" D "" class ships and mentioned one vessel, Dorrigo. Dorrigo was, I understand, one of the first class "" D class vessels turned out. On its maiden voyage from Newcastle to Wyndham, which should not have lasted more than a fortnight, this argosy was at sea for about three months. The reason was that tbe Minister for Shipping and Fuel, who musi have known nothing at all about shipbuilding, and the gentleman who designed the vessel, were not content to install a boiler manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox Limited, or any other boiler that had stood the test of time and experience, but insisted on a boiler made to the order of the designer of the vessel. The complacent Minister, who knew no more about boilers than he does about primus stoves, was content to allow the 'boiler to be installed. Owing to continual breakdowns, the ship took three months to travel from Newcastle to Wyndham. I understand that ultimately the boiler had to be removed from the vessel and replaced by one of the tried modern boilers. gentleman that fairy story? and the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) knows that it is not. It is true, and not like the stories that the honourable gentleman has told us in the past about, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and some of its employees. He can make inquiries to ascertain who designed the boiler and who was responsible for its installation. I have referred to that case in order to illustrate what may happen when a ship is designed in government yards, where a person is allowed to experiment with boilers and to install in ships, with disastrous results, gear that is inefficient or that has not been tested. Clause 31 provides(1.) A person shall not, except with the consent of the Minister (proof whereof shall lie upon h i m l (a) transfer a ship to which this Part applies and which is registered in Australia or is owned, managed OT controlled by a person resident in Australia or by a body corporate",80,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

214,Mr Abbott,"It is not a fairy story,whose principal .place -of business is in Australia, or any share in any such ship, to a person not resident in Australia or to a body corporate whose principal place of business is not in Australia; (6) mortgage any such ship or share, or transfer a mortgage of any such ship or share, to a person not resident in Australia or to a l o d y corwill prevent freight rates from being porate whose principal place of business is not in Australia.; or (c) make application for the transfer of the registration of any such ship from a port of registry in Australia to a port of registry outside Australia. That is one of the -most vital clauses .of the bill. It will mean, if it is passed, that wben a ship on the Australian register reaches the age of 24 years the Minister may refuse to consent to its sale overseas or refuse to issue a licenoe in respect of it. If he did so refuse, the unfortunate shipowner would have no means of disposing of the vessel other than by selling it to a ship-breaker to be broken up for -scrap iron. The clause is designed deliberately to smash existing Australian shipping companies and any other companies that may enter the industry later and to evade the requirement of the Australian Constitution that property shall not be acquired by the 'Government other than on just terms. A clause such as this must inevitably drive private shipping companies from the Australian coastal shipping trade and prevent them from competing against the -Government monopoly. Clause 30 deals with the licensing of ships and the routes on which they may operate. Under its provisions, the Minister could force the Australian Shipping Board to grant licences only to the ships to which he desired them to be granted. He could favour government owned vessels by granting licences for them to operate on the more lucrative shipping routes and by granting to private companies licences to operate only on uneconomic routes. It is another clause which, if passed, will sound the death-knell of the private shipping companies of Australia. The intention of the Government is, Only a negligible quantity is transported by means of this measure, to create a by air. In the course of his speech, the government monopoly of interstate shipMinister for Defence( Mr Dedman) ping and to drive the privately-owned went to great pains, as did the Minister shipping lines out of business. The memfor Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) bers of the Australian Country party in another place, to show that this bill Mr A.bhott. are violently opposed to the measure. Tf a government monopoly is established, there will ibe no likelihood of freight rates being reduced. The hidden forces which exert such pressure on the Government, to which the Government salaams and to whose wishes it always accedes, reduced. They will continue to delay transport services in Australia by all possible means in order to create chaos. Tn those circumstances, freight rates will not be reduced. The operation of the bill will be -detrimental to the Australian primary producers because it will eventually .eliminate the competition that now exists between the private shipping companies and the railways. I hope that the next Australian non-Labour government will act in the same way as the BruceJBafre Government acted. before there is a non-LabouT government. the weather prophets, usually wrong. When such a government comes into power I hope that it will relieve the Australian people of this burden which is to be imposed upon them and allow once again free competition in the Australian coastal trade so that freight rates may be reduced to the .lowest possible figure. -This bill provides for the establishment of a government shipping board, a government shipping line and a government shipbuilding industry. It is of tremendous importance to the people of Tasmania, whose life-blood is shipping. Ninety-five per cent, of the goods transported from the mainland to Tasmania is carried by ships. The bill is of vital interest to Tasmanian primary producers, because it is essential that their perishable or semi-perishable products which have to marketed on the mainland should arrive at their destinations as soon as possible.

It will be remembered that at a conference of the Labour party which was held in Canberra recently the main plank of .the .party's .platform, which is the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, was strongly reaffirmed, and also that shipping was specifically mentioned as being one of the immediate objectives of the party. It has often been .said by honTasmania and Western Australia. The orable members opposite that the Australian G overnment has -no constitutional power to nationalize a particular industry. That is true, but there are indirect means of doing so. One of them, which is now being adopted by the Government, is to apply a gradual squeezing process to the industry to which attention is being directed. The first step towards tbe nationalization of an industry is to eson the waterfront handled approximately tablish a government board. The penalties, ministerial powers and licences wbich follow upon that step tend to give the Government undertaking a distinct advantage in that industry. We have seen examples of that process recently in regard to such industries as banking, wireless, and air transport. I contend that the Government, by means of this measure, is taking the first major step towards the complete nationalization of tbe shipping industry. I should agree completely with the bill if it provided for cheaper freights, the quicker turn-round of ships and the provision of more ships, and if the Government instrumentality could be operated with reasonable economy. I have used the word "" reasonable"" advisedly. With regard to cheaper freights, tbe answer of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) to a question that was addressed to him by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) recently was very illuminating. According to the Minister, on the 2nd October, 1939, the freight rate from Sydney to Melbourne was 26s -4d. .a ton .and -on the 1st -May, 1941, :it'was 2.6s -lid. a ton. .In two years there was ""an .increase of only 7d. <a ton. 67's. a ton. It had increased by -considerably more than 100 per cent. On the 2nd October, 1939, the freight rate from Sydney to .Fremantle was 51s. 7d. a ton, on the 1st May, 1941, it was 5 O.s. 6d. a ton, and on the Sth November, 1948, it was 88s. a ton. .In Ute last annual -report of the Tariff Board, it was .stated that the cost of freight to and from Tasmania had increased by 100 per cent, since before the war. The point that I wish .to -emphasize strongly is that that increase occurred when shipping was under government control. Cheap sea transport is essential to the people of present high cost of sea transport is one of the reasons why the cost of living in Tasmania is very high. The problem of the quicker turn-round of ships has not been tackled properly. Before the war Talune made 23 round trips a year, but now tbe average number of trips a year is six or eight, or roughly one-third of the pre-war number. Before the war gangs 25 tons an hour, but now larger gangs handle only an average of 14 to 16 tons an hour. In 1939 the wage rate of waterside workers was 2s. lOd. an hour and the total cost of handling was 4s. to 4s. 6d. a ton. In 1948 the wage rate was-4s. 2£d. an hour and the cost of handling Was approximately 12s. 6d. a ton. Although the wage rate increased by approximately 50 per cent., the cost of handling increased by 300 per cent. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) has said that one of the reasons for the slower turnround of ships is that the majority of ships now carry twice the amount of cargo that they carried in 1939. The real reason for the slow turn-round is the position on the waterfront, the difficulties of which have been considerably accentuated by the actions of men such as Healy and Elliott, who are well known to all of us in this chamber. It is noteworthy that Mr Healy, who is one of the members of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, a body that was established by the Australian Government, recently engineered a stop-work meeting in Brisbane and then flew to Western Australia. That in itself was a most reprehenfrom 1915 to 1920 are now in the final sible action. He is a known Communist who was appointed to the commission by this Government and he has deliberately flaunted the commission of which he is a member. Most of the strikes that have caused havoc in our general industrial setup have occurred in the transport industries, notably in the railways and tramways. As the result of those strikes, primary producers in particular have been severely hit and housewives and business people generally have been subjected to great inconvenience. It is noteenterprises conducted by successive goworthy that on many occasions private enterprise has been called in to help the State governments out of their dilemmas. Private bus-owners have been approached to assist in solving the transgovernment-owned cannery the loss port chaos arising from the actions of government employees. Because in the past strikes have prevented government instrumentalities from continuing in operation no one can really believe that nationalization of industry is the cure of our industrial ills. This bill contains two most restrictive clauses. Clauses 29 and 30 provide that no ship shall engage in interstate trade except under licence from the Minister, that no licence shall be granted for ships more than 24 years old, and that a licence may not be granted for a ship to engage in the Australian coastal trade unless it has been built in an Australian shipyard. Even if a cheaper and better vessel were available in Great Britain an Australian shipping company might not be permitted to buy it if this bill becomes honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle law. It is difficult to understand why such a restrictive provision has been inserted in the bill when it is generally known that at present Great Britain is building 50 per cent, of the world's shipping. We surely owe a debt of gratitude to the people of Great Britain for the tremendous help they gave to us during the war. If every dominion adopted the attitude taken by this Government in relation to the shipbuilding industry, a very substantial part of Great four small steamers, two of the vessels Britain's overseas market for ships would be lost. Let us consider what has happened to other government enterprises in the past. State enterprises which were begun under the control of a Queensland Mr Falkinder. government corporation during the period stages of liquidation. The latest available figures show that the total net investment of Queensland Treasury funds in such enterprises at the 30th June 1944, including all amounts written off, and all investments from trust fund, and afte? deducting certain profits paid into revenue, was £2,087,236. The remaining assets of these enterprises are now valued at £301,079. The net indebtedness to the Treasury was £1,029,441. Here are some of tbe actual losses incurred by vernments in Queensland. On government-owned cattle stations the losses amounted to £1,647,871; on butcher shops tbey amounted to £39,538; on a amounted to £112,627; and on a government controlled produce agency the loss amounted to £19,529. The total losses on current enterprises to the 30th June, 1948. were as follows:£ State mining enterprises .. 471,786 Bowen Coke Works .. 92,166 Trvinebank State treatment works 142,376 The list of State enterprises which I have quoted covers a very wide field of industry. In every case the State enterprises established in Queensland have resulted in a most substantial loss to the taxpayers. Honourable members opposite have said a good deal about the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers which was established after World WarI . Their extravagant claims were very ably rebutted by the right Page). As that line has been so extensively dealt with during this debate it is, I think, only right that I should mention some facts about the Tasmanian Government's experience in the shipping industry in the late 'twenties. The history of that venture was recounted in the Senate some, time ago. The honourable senator who told the story said that in the late 'twenties a non-Labour Government of Tasmania had bought a fleet of being intended for use in the trade between Tasmania and Flinders and King Islands, and the remaining two for general use as freighters in the Australian trade. He indicated that the Government had operated the vessels for nearly three years at a loss, and that when a Labour government came into power two of the ships were immediately sold. In fact they were almost given away. He said that rhe two ships sold were Poolta, the largest of the four vessels, and Melbourne, an older ship, but still practically new. He said that Poolta had originally cost £68,000 and Melbourne £59,500 but that both vessels had been sold by the Labour government for £26,000, or one-sixth of their original value. In that transaction, on the basis of the original value of the ships, the Government lost £101,600. In addition it sustained a trading loss of £100,000 in rhe three years of their operation, making a total loss of £201,000. The remaining two ships continued to operate for from three to five years, the average loss incurred on their operation amounting to £40,000 annually. I say frankly that there are some aspects of this bill with which I agree but that on the overall view I regard it as a dangerous measure. The Government would have done better to have devoted its energies to solving the real problem of assisting the shipping industry by granting subsidies to the private shipping companies instead of kicking them out of business as it apparently intends to do. This bill conforms to the socialist pattern that has been of shipping, especially of British shipa noteworthy feature of the legislation introduced by this Government in relation to banking, airways, broadcasting and other matters. At long last the people are being given a clear and convincing indication of the direction in which the Government is relentlessly heading. The Government is pledged to implement the socialization programme of the Labour party to the fullest degree and it will do so if it remains in office. If , at the the shipbuilding industry left that field next election, the people again return the Government to power it will be a sorry day for the people of Australia. for the Army) [10.8] -Honorabl e members opposite have made a remarkable approach to this bill. They have skilfully avoided dealing with the real purposes of the measure. It has been said by them that if this bill is passed private enterducers and other exporters, and if it is prise will be ruined, the Shipping Board will be controlled by Communists and freights will rise to unprecedented levels. The history, of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, which operated after World WarI . , proves how erroneous those statements are. The fears expressed by honourable members opposite about what will happen if the bill is passed are completely answered by the history of the Commonwealth's earlier venture in the shipping industry. The Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was not controlled by Communists. Its operations did not, as honourable members opposite have said, result in a general increase of freight rates. On the contrary, it conferred great benefits on the primary producers of Australia who represent the section of the community which should at all costs be protected against increased freight charges. In their efforts to attack this bill honourable members opposite have completely disregarded the facts. It has been said that if the Commonwealth enters the shipbuilding field the British shipbuilding industry and the British people generally will be adversely affected. On the contrary, a soundly established shipbuilding industry in Australia would constitute 8 great asset to Great Britain. Honourable members on this side of the House have stressed the present world-wide shortage ping. If , as the result of the efforts of this Government, Australia can build sufficient ships to meet the requirements of the Australian coastal trade, the strain on the British shipbuilding industry will be eased. The establishment of a shipbuilding industry in Australia on a sound economic basis will enable us to retain skilled shipwrights in Australia. It would be a shame if Australians associated with of employment to engage in other occupations or were attracted to other countries in which the shipbuilding industry is flourishing. The Australian shipbuilding industry will make a very notable contribution to the defence of this country. If the Australian shipbuilding industry to be established under this bill is able to relieve the shipbuilding industry in Great Britain,*if it is able to assist us to maintain reasonable freight rates for primary pro-",82,Corser Th E So That We Shall Be Able To Build Ships In

I refer to the words that are used in a part of the preamble to the bill. They are as follows:And whereas it is desirable in the interests order to achieve the desirable end to which of the naval And military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States to establish the shipping industry and the shipbuilding industry in the Commonwealth on an adequate scale and to maintain those industries in continuous operation: emphasize that fact when moving the second reading of the bill ? tained in the preamble, and I do not believe that any honourable member will disagree with them. oouched in language appropriate to the bill, which will, in due course, take its place as an act on the statute-book of this country, and, in due course also, will be recognized as the foundation stone in the establishment of an industrial activity that has been sadly neglected in this country. already been established. Honourable members have had the opportunity to express their views on this bill. The Minister must be heard without interruption. couched in legal language. I make a re-statement of it in other language, as follows: '"" Any government which neglects to take action, in tbe interests of the naval and military defence of its country, to establish the shipping industry and the shipbuilding industry on an adequate scale and maintain those industries in continuous operation will be recreant to the trust imposed in it by the people who elected it "" . remark apply to Switzerland? deal with the interjection by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), but I point out that Switzerland has a mercantile marine, even though the houorable member may not be aware of the fact. I have re-stated the preamble in those terms in order to proceed a little further. I propose to examine the action that three different countries, one of which is Australia, have taken in I have referred. First, I shall deal with the United States. of America. For a long time, the United States has taken steps to ensure that an adequate mercantile marine is established and a shipbuilding industry is maintained on an adequate scale in that country. The method which the United States has adopted is to pay subsidies to American shipping companies. In proof of that statement, I quote from Harper's Magazine of last November, as follows:. The shipping industry has been subsidized by the Government in one way or another for many years. Current subsidies to the merchant marine are running close to the the $100,000,000 a year On top of all the rich benefits provided these companies by the Government ih the past. I turn now to the United Kingdom. In this instance, it is true, bankers, industrial magnates and shipping magnates and fascist appeasers combined to almost kill the shipping industry i the n industry bas United Kingdom, in the early 1930's.

The Minister is entitled to be heard in silence. ment of the day in the United Kingdom formulated additional proposals to assist the British shipping industry. The president of the Board of Trade at that time was Mr Oliver Stanley. On the 28th March, 1939, he outlined to the House of Commons the Government's proposals for assisting shipping and the shipbuilding industry in Great Britain. I shall read some passages from his statement to the House. They are as follows:It is proposed to make available a sum of £2,750,000 a year for a .period of five years by way of subsidy for tramp shipping including vessels in the deep sea and near trades but not the coasting trade. . . . As a condition of establishing this Committee, the Government w i ll expect the liner section of the industry so to organize itself as to be in a better position to defend itself without Government financial assistance. . . . The Government proposes also to ask Parliament to make available a sum of £10,000,000 for loans to shipowners over a period of two years on favorable terms for the purpose of building in Great Britain tramps and cargo liners (other than refrigerated vessels and passenger vessels), including tramps and cargo liners intended for the coasting trade. . . . While the Government have reached the conclusion that in present circumstances and as a temporary measure financial assistance under the schemes outlined above is necessary in order to ensure the provision of new ships for our merchant fleet and increased work for our shipyards, they will require the shipping and shipbuilding industries to consider together the possibility of devising means for securing in the future the more Tegular ordering of new tonnage.

251,Mr Dedman,"Late r the governUnited Kingdom and the United States of America. It has been left to a Labour government to encourage shipbuilding and maritime services in Australia as they have been encouraged in Great Britain and the United States of America. The Leader of the Opposition said that I wa3 making untrue statements, but I am able to quote documents to prove the truth of what I have said. The proposals embodied in the bill were initiated at a meeting of tbe War Cabinet in 1944. As Minister for War Organization of IndustryI put forward a proposal as the result of which an inter-departmental committee was set up to make a complete survey of the shipping industry. The committee made certain recommendations which were adopted by Cabinet, and now form the basis of this bill. The report is a fairly long one. In tbe first chapter the committee discusses the value of a permanent shipbuilding industry, and I quote the following passage:The contribution which the shipbuilding Industry could make to employment is clearly indicated by the fact that, whereas before the war the employees engaged numbered a few hundred, the numbers directly employed at the present time total about 10,000. The number would be raised well above 20,000 for the programme in hand were it not for the man-power shortage and the fact that about 10,000 are at present employed on repairs to British, Allied, and Australian Naval and Merchant ships. In the following chapter this passage occurs:The industry continued to be active until 1924 when all contracts were completed. Thereafter shipbuilding activity declined. The postmittee, but I know that one was a naval war shipping shortage eased and overseas construction costs fell. Australian shipowners naturally were not inclined to purchase Australian-built ships when they could obtain their requirements overseas, at much lower cost. As a matter owners never shipbuilding compelled to tinuesFrom 1024 until the outbreak of the present war there was an almost complete cessation of building activity. There was a small amount of intermittent naval building and construction on government account, but most of the yards established during the war-time burst of activity became idle and the equipment was dismantled and put to other uses. In 1933 the Cockatoo Island shipyard was leased to a private company, in order that it might eke out an existence on work other than shipbuilding . . . A t the outbreak of the present war, Australia had but one shipyardthat at Cockatoo Island-in active operation, the other establishments which entered into shipbuilding during the 1918-24 period had all. to greater or less extent, dismantled their shipbuilding equipment, and reverted to other work. A shipyard which existed at Adelaide had entirely disappeared, and that at Walsh Island had fallen into such a state of decay as to be unusable. The men previously em played on shipbuilding had, to a great extent, settled iu other occupations, and were not available to re-commence shipbuilding. But for the numbers of shipbuilding men employed at Cockatoo, which has existed on repair work rather than shipbuilding for years previously, the industry was practically defunct. As far as materials required for shipbuilding are concerned, the position changed considerably bctween 11124 and the outbreak of the present war. Does the Leader of the Opposition question that report, which was compiled by reliable men? I shall give their names in a minute or two. me tbe report? is a confidential report. his usual game.

So far as any new matter was concerned, the debate was actually finished when the Leader of the Opposition made his speech. All other members of the Opposition repeated his views in parrot fashion, with one exception. That was the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) who had his own reasons for disagreeing with the Leader of the Opposition when he said that he did not like embargoes.

If the Leader of the Opposition had answered his question it would have been in the negative and that would have been hard on. the shipbuilding yard at Maryborough. Because the Leader of the Opposition said everything that was to be said by the Opposition about this bill, with the exception of the contribution by the honourable member for Wide Bay, it is easy for me to reply. It would be interesting to speculate on the reasons why such a deadly monotony pervaded the speeches of members of the Opposition. It would seem, almost, that they were speaking to a brief prepared, no doubt, by the shipping magnates, the big business interests, and the appeasers of fascism in this country. Also, it appears that honourable members opposite believe that their only hope of winning the next election is to instil in the minds of the public, by fair means or foul, the idea that this Government is bent on nationalizing as many industries as possible. The third inference that might be drawn from the monotony of the debate is that the Leader of the Opposition has formed the opinion, since he came back from abroad, that his party has lost prestige, and that drastic steps must be taken to recover the lost ground.. The right honourable gentleman had; something to say about the nationalization or, as he called it, the socialization, of industry. His remarks on that topic had nothing to do with the bill. Honourable members opposite will readily concede that I , at least, if not other members of the Government, would have had a very good look at the matter in order to see whether it was in the best interest of the public to nationalize the shipping industry. I admit that I did examine the matter from that angle, and rejected such an approach. The Minister who introduced an this bill in the Senate declared, as 1 have declared in this chamber, that tbe Government does not intend to nationalize either the shipbuilding industry or the shipping industry itself. The Leader of the Opposition, with his talk of socialization, would bave the people believe that all members of the Labour party believe in nationalizing everything, while members of the Opposition do not believe in nationalizing anything. That is a false and fraudulent statement of the position. Honourable members on this side of the House believe that certain public utilities should be nationalized. Honourable members on the otber side of the House also believe that certain public utilities should be nationalized. Is it not a fact that an anti-Labour government in South Australia recently nationalized the electricity industry in that State? Is it not a fact that the Premier of South Australia, who is not a member of the Australian Labour party, is running a socialized industry which is producing coal at Leigh Creek? The truth it that honourable members on this side of the House are no different from honourable members opposite in their belief that certain public utilities should be nationalized. Honourable members on this side of the House believe that in tbe foreseeable future there is no alternative to private enterprise continuing to operate over a very wide sector of our economy.

259,Mr Dedman,"The Leader of thecleverly attempted to mislead the people regarding my own attitude towards competition. He quoted some remarks that I made about a hanking bill. Whether competition is necessary or not depends -entirely on tbe industry with which one is dealing. Would the right honourable gentleman suggest, for instance, that there should be competition in the provision of telephonic communications? good thing. We might get the right number then. MT. DEDMAN I do not think that the right honourable gentleman would make such a suggestion, because if there were competition there we should inevitably have an inefficient telephone system. member for Wakefield had to consult two or three different telephone books and use several different telephones to make his calls he would soon realize the truth of what I have said. The proposition that f have suggested is elementary to anybody with ordinary intelligence. Would the right honourable gentleman suggest that there should be competition in our telegraph system? Perhaps he would like a private monopoly such as that which exists in the United States of .America, where it costs the equivalent of 35s. to send a telegram the distance of the width of the Australian continent. In Australia such a telegram costs only Is. The right honourable gentleman went on to deal with a number of minor points. He said, first of all, that there was no way by which we could obtain information about shipbuilding costs in the United Kingdom, and he facetiously referred to the cost of what he termed ""ghost ships"". his ignorance of the subject, as .any one will realize who has read about the costs of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom, which are revealed in a number of British shipbuilding publications. An officer of the Australian Shipbuilding Board visited the United Kingdom some time ago and submitted a report. In that report he statedOn 15th December, 1948, fhe question of -costs was diseussed withI shall refer to the individuals concerned as "" MrX "" , as for obvious reasons I do not wish to mention the names of persons from whom information of a confidential nature was obtained. This company is building motor ships of about 9,000 tons dead-weight to practically a standard design, with steam auxiliaries and deck machinery. I was informed that present day basic prices -are of the order of £45 sterling to £50 sterling per dead-weight ton for this type of ship. Quotations of cost per dead-weight or gross ton are just as common as quotations of cost per bushel of wheat. The report continuesIn the British publication Fairplwy, of October, 1948, it was stated that 9,250 ton* dead-weight motor ships which would be completed in December, 1948, would be available interjecting, for £S.425,000. These ships were being designed for 12 knots with 3,300 BHP. engines. it is probable that the ship referred to is of the Doxford standard type with steam auxiliaries. In the Motor Ship, December, 1948, the value per gross ton of ships built for foreign owners for the first ten months of the year was stated to average £S.8.7. It is quite obvious that it is easy to ascertain the cost of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom. A number of newspapers and magazines which circulate in that country quote such costs from time to time. The right honourable gentleman then brought out the time-worn argument that the present Government had no mandate to introduce this measure. I dealt with that distortion on a former occasion, but in this instance the right honourable gentleman is hoist with his own petard. Did the Bruce-Page Government have any mandate to sell the Commonwealth line of ships? At the general election that occurred before that Government disposed of those ships not one word was He simply paraded said about its intention to sell the line. I have looked through all the newspapers of that time and have heen unable to find any indication that the Bruce Page Government intended to sell the line if it were returned to power. The Bruce Page Government knew perfectly well' that.had it told the country, .and especially the primary producers, during that election campaign that it intended to sell the 'Commonwealth line every",90,Joiitow The Impression That Its Shipyard Can Consideration I Submit That The Minis

262,Mr Dedman,"If the honorable member wbo stood for election to the Parliament on behalf of the Australian Country party would have been defeated. Instead, the Bruce Page Government waited until it was safely back in office and then it proceeded to sell the ships. Soi n bringing forward the old argument that the Government has no mandate for this legislation, honourable gentlemen opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, are indeed hoist with their own petard. make a right. Opposition disappeared from office two years after the sale of the line. Opposition endeavoured to make out in a subtle and sinister way that this Government was trying to nationalize the shipping and shipbuilding industries of Australia. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) even went so far as to say that we were trying to create a monopoly of shipbuilding. What is the position in the shipbuilding industry? Tbere is only one shipbuilding yard in the whole of the Commonwealth over which the Australian Government has any control, and that is the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. There is a sufficiently large naval construction programme in hand to keep that dockyard busy for many years, so that the only shipyards from which ships will be ordered, when the provisions of the bill come into operation, will be privately owned shipyards. That proves clearly how exaggerated and untrue are the statements made by the honourable member for Fawkner permitted to build ships without a licence from the Government to do so. many other measures would be necessary if the Government were even attempting to take over private shipbuilding yards. The honourable gentleman was only trying to make a debating point. It is perfectly clear from this bill that because the Government does not own any shipbuilding yards in which mercantile vessels can be built, apart from the Williamstown Naval Dockyard which will be occupied for a long time in coping with naval orders, the ships that will be ordered as a result of the provisions of the bill will be built in privately owned shipyards. That disproves the honourable gentleman's argument in relation, to shipbuilding, and the same applies to the shipping industry. If this Government desired to nationalize the shipping industry, do honourable members opposite think that it would not have the courage to do so forthrightly by legislation? By its bill to nationalize Leader of the banking this Government tackled the most powerful monopoly in the country. If it wanted to nationalize shipping it would take the same action as it took with banking, and the very fact that it has not done so in the present measure, but has done something entirely different, shows quite clearly that it did not have, and has not, any intention to nationalize the shipping industry. In my second-reading speech I said that this bill had three objectives, which were to set up a Commonwealth snipping line; to provide and maintain a shipbuilding industry; and to develop an adequate and efficient mercantile marine. I do not desire to say anything regarding the sale of the former Commonwealth shipping line. Honourable members on this side of the House have shown quite clearly how honourable members opposite, when they were in office, sold that line-in fact, gavit away. I believe that there are a great many people in the country who are not ordinarily supporters of the Labour party who were, and still are, very critical oif the action of the Bruce-Page Government in selling that line of ships. I am surprised that the Australian Country party is opposing this measure, because I believe that many of its supporterswill very strongly commend this Government for its intention to develop again a Commonwealth shipping line. The other two objectives-the provision and maintenance of a shipbuilding industry and the development of an adequate and efficient mercantile marine-ar e linked with the defence preparedness of Australia. The Opposition had the opportunity to carry out the same objectives when it was in office during theperiod",91,Joiitow The Impression That Its Shipyard Can Consideration I Submit That The Minis

267,Mr Dedman,"That is true, butbetween tbe two world wars. Instead of doing so, it allowed tbe shipbuilding industry to languish and permitted the mercantile marine to deteriorate. Honourable members opposite are continually talking about preparedness for defence, but all they can think of in that connection is compulsory military training. measure, by laying the foundations of an efficient mercantile marine and providing a shipbuilding industry on an adequatescale, is a much better means of achieving preparedness for defence tban is compulsory military training. When honourable members opposite talk about compulsory military training and relate it to preparedness for defence, while they oppose a measure of this kind, tbey are talking with their tongues in their cheeks. I asorry that my time has almost expired, or [ could show that it was a combination of bankers, industrial magnates and appeasers of fascism who wrecked the shipbuilding industry in the United Kingdom in the early 1930's. I could also show that a similar combination of appeasers of fascism, of shipping interests and bankers, that from the early 1930's to the outbreak of the second world war, neglected the shipbuilding industry of this country. I am sorry that I have not time .to do that. I say that the Government, by introducing the present measure, deserves tbe support of all honourable members, particularly of those representing Country party. I am also certain that it will obtain the support of the great majority of Australians who never desire to see again what happened in the 1930's when the shipbuilding industry was allowed to languish and tbe mercantile marine to deteriorate.

If the Government Printer is unable to provide cloth-bound volumes of Hansard within a reasonable period, will he arrange for honourable members to be supplied with an index to Hansard of 1947 and 1948 with the least possible delay? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Acute shortage of staff at the Government Printing Office is alone responsible for the delay in binding Hansard. The Government Printer has, for some time, had very great difficulty in securing staff, and this difficulty has not yot been overcome. Volumes 190 to 192 are about ready for issue.

London debt redeemable at present subject to the terms of prospectuses regarding notice of redemption, is £42,875,601 sterling. 2. Annual interest liability thereon is £1,647,436 sterling. 3. Approximately £A.400,000. 4. As at the 1.6th February-the most recent date for which figures are available-the gold and balances held abroad by the Commonwealth Bmnk were £A.357,000;000. 5: The greater proportion of London fund's is invested at short call or in British treasuryto recommend the amendment to the act hills. The return on the funds approximates 10s. per cent, per annum. 0. The level of London funds which can be regarded as satisfactory varies from time to time. A large proportion of the recent increase is due to changes in arrangements for payments for imports and exports which could readily become reversed. In view of this, and -because the prices of .imports are about three times the pre-war level, the present level ot London funds is not regarded as excessive. upon notice1.
