0,,"I now propose to tell honourable members what they will be called upon to do. It will be recalled, -without difficulty, no doubt, that the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) delivered his Budget speech last week. To all that he said, legislative effect must be given; which involves a programme that, when set down in chapter and verse, appears to be formidable. But the programme really is not at all formidable. I desire to make perfectly clear that what I ask is not unreasonable. The other day the Government were asking for Supply. There was a long, and not altogether painless, discussion. Its relevance to Supply was remote. circumstances, I am sure, will not so soon have escaped honorahle members' recollection. Supply-the sum being somewhere in the neighbourhood of Â£2,000,000-wa s relegated to the background. upon anything and everything else occupied some seven or eight hours, while ' Supply itself was granted in about three-quarters of a minute. Mr Speaker and the Clerks will be able to correct me, no doubt, if my statement is not strictly accurate; but the fact is that I . have never witnessed more rapid action on the part cf the legislative machinery. Both during my association with the party on this side of the House and in that period . when I had the honour to lead honorahle members on the other side, I have seen wonderful things done hy men who had made up their minds that work was the order of the day. Life is real. Life is earnest! And, although I do not wish to cast a gloom npon this morning's sitting, I am bound to say that last Friday was one of the most inauspicious days in our history. It was a period f u l l of gloom, of petulance, and, indeed, of anger. However, work must now be done, and here is the programme I First of all, there are measures relating to the Budget. An Income Tax Assessment Bill is to he introduced, it is designed to alter and consolidate the law. There will he a Bill to reduce rates of .taxation of income by an amount of 10 per cent., and tb bring about a reduction of ; the flat rate of tax upon companies from 2s. 8d. to 2s. 5d. Another Bill will remove the war surcharge of 20 per cent, on land tax. Other measures will include -a Bill to remove the entertainment tax where the price of admission is less than Mr Hughes. Is.; a Bill to reduce the duty on galvanized iron, iron and. steel wire, wire netting, and tractors; a Bill to provide bounty to local manufacturers of such articles; and a Bill to provide for the reduction of parliamentary allowances. That listembraces the measures immediately arising out of the financial policy of the Grovernment and the Budget statement of the Treasurer. But there are others which will be necessary in order to complete the symmetry of our programme. I said "" symmetry,"" not "" cemetery ! "" I adrait that there is mention of a reduction of Parliamentary .allowances The which, on a Friday, does suggest ideas -not entirely remote from the morgue. But I emphasize-othe r measures will The specific request for be necessary iu order to complete the symmetry of the financial policy of the Government. These relate particularly Discussion to the Public .Service; they consist of the Public Service Bill, whioh is now before the House; a B ill to amend the Arbitration (Publio Service) Act, and a Public Service Superannuation Bill. I now come to commercial measures. These include the Meat Export Bounties Bill, and the Eailway Gauges Bill. The latter will be inoperative, of course, unless and until one or more of the States elect, hy legislation, to ratify their part of the business. Bnt what will follow if the States, or any of them, elect son) -Order! The Prime Minister will not he in order in discussing the Bill. am sure honourable members will quite understand what I meant to say. Other commercial measures will comprise a Bill to place the Commonwealth Shipping Line under independent control; a measure to provide for the representation of Australia in the United States of America; a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff( In dustries Preservation) Act; and another to amend the CustomB Act. The two last named are interrelated. General measures will include an amending Defence Bill, an A i r Defence Bill, and a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. In addition to these, there must be dealt with a motion having to do with the redistribution of seats in Victoria. The report of the Commissioners upon this subject, in time, no doubt, will be forwarded to Parliament.",17,Setup

I have just indicated the legislation' which must be dealt with arising out of it . Of course, beside all the matters to whioh I have alluded, there will be debates upon the Budget itself and upon the Estimates.

If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to resume the debate upon the Budget speech he may do so after my colleague has moved the second reading of the Meat Export Bounties Bill. continuation of the Budget debate. I told the Leader of tihe Country party (Dr. Earle Page) that' in view of your statement last week the Budget debate would not be continued this week, and he could remain away until next week. We are willing to meet honourable members in a reasonable way, and when matters are called on in which nonMinisterial members are specially interested, we shall be ready to discuss an arrangement with the Leaders of the C ties in order that every section may e an opportunity of stating its views. I ought to have told the House that the Government desire' to proceed with' the Loan estimates to-day. I hope the House will realize the position of the Government, and proceed to work withter moderately, and I trust that honourable members, no matter how much they may differ from the Government's policy, will realize that it is our duty to give effect to our programme. That we propose to do. It is the business of the Opposition, so I have been told, to oppose; let them oppose. They are entitled; so I am told, to resort to all tihe forms of the House in order to oppose; let them do so. That applies to all parties. But, of course, we, too, must resort to the forms of the House in order to get onr programme through. As long as we all understand one another we shall get on well. What the Government propose to do is to give effect to their programme, and that We shall do if we can. If we cannot, we shall see what we shall see. Honourable members opPersonally'I have not much objection to Government business taking precedence on Thursdays, but I have risen to protest against the charge made hy the. Prime Minister that the Opposition had delayed tihe business of the country for I submit, the last eight weeks. I regard the work done during the last eight weeks as most important, and in the interests of the country. The only way in which we could draw attention to matters of vital concern to the people was to discuss themseriatim in this Chamber, and no honourable member can say that in so doing we delayed the. business of this Parliament. I can remember, and so can the Prime Minister,, the time when he was sitting ask for a in Opposition, and when censure motions were moved that occupied the House for four weeks at a time In regard to the matters that have been raised by the Opposition during the last two months, we have been content on each occasion, after reasonable debate, to allow the question to go to a vote. Very often the debate was continued, not by members of the Opposition, but by members on the Government side of the House. But rarely did .the debate upon any one niotion occupy more than two days. All those discussions were necessary in order that the matters to which they related might be ventilated. I tell the Prime",17,Setup

We have been told that the Government have decided that in future the guillotine shall fall .after a certain period, and that the Government are to be the judges of the value of any matter discussed in this chamber. Government will. have to answer to the people at a later period.

The remarks of tihe right honourable gentleman will have no influence one way or the other upon the party 1 represent. qur minds as to what onr duty is, and we intend to do that duty regardless of whether it will lead us to the people, as has been threatened, or keep us in tihe House fora short time longer. It was refreshing to hear the Prime Minister admit to-day that at times he realizes he is a mere man. We have realized that .all along, and we shall take exactly the same course as if the Prime Minister had not spoken. ""We have not, during this session, set up any useless opposition, or attempted to obstruct public business. We hav.fr'endeayoured to ventilate things that, in-our opinion, needed ventilation, and I remind the Prime Minister that the forenoon of last Friday was occupied with a discussion initiated by him that would have been better left alone. ""We have not raised any matter in the House that was not of vital importance, and we intend to continue that policy. In regard to one or two of the matters which the Prime Minister has mentioned, we shall regard ourselves as free agents. ""We shall give no pledge as to what we shall do, but we may have a good deal to say upon the Budget, the redistribution of seats, and the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment If discussion is stifled, the Act. Upon these three questions, at least, I can promise the Prime Minister that there will be, to put it mildly, a good deal of discussion.

I hope that no general discussion will be curtailed simply because of some item being already on the business-paper. For instance, there is one question that is bound to be fully and freely discussed, and that is the liberalization of the old-age and invalid pensions, in regard to which there is a motion on the notice-paper in the name of a private member.

13,Mr Watt (Balaclava) ' [11.42],"As-witb the exception of two brief personal explanations which were unavoidably forced upon me, I should like to offer a few .brief observations upon the motion of the Prime Minister. ' It is natural that the Government should desire to intimate to the House and the country their wish to put their programme through; they have committed'themselves to a number of very important proposals, and the country is vitally interested in several of them. But I would suggest to the Prime Minister that the weighing by the Government of the relative importance of measures, and the allotment of time accordingly for their discussion, is a very risky procedure if it is to be followed by the application of the guillotine in many instances. During the absence of the Prime Minister in Europe, it was my responsibility to introduce, at the will of the Government, these guillotine provisions. they are good. I have always thoughtand possibly other honorahle members, regardless of whether their parties are in office or in Opposition, think likewisethat that instrument of great power must be used sparingly if its use is to be continued. Otherwise, the people will undoubtedly enforce discussion of important measures, and insist upon adequate time being given to them. nominally, four months must elapse before the life ef this Parliament expires, assumpathize with honourable gentlemen who are ing that there is to be no disruption and dissolution, of which rumours are rife in the newspapers, I think this is not the time, notwithstanding the futile two months of .the session already gone, for the Government to tell the two other parties in the House that the guillotine is to he applied to all important measures in the Government programme. It would be far better if the Government boldly faced the situation, and had another sitting day. for Victorians! I may be regarded as selfish in this respect, because we can sit an extra day without that inconvenience which attaches to honourable members from a distance. hers, for instance. bers are much worse off. Although.I am not to be exonerated from the accusation of selfishness, I still say it would be far better to sit another day, than to resort to the indiscriminate or general use of the guillotine for the remainder of the session. alternative? on the notice-paper, and others that have not yet appeared, hut have heen intimated by the Treasurer, and confirmed by the Prime Minister, are really not suitable for the application of the guillotine. Then there are measures, that the country will demand shall receive treatment before we rise. There are the important matters of the amendment of the Constitution, taxation, and others of the ""kind, in regard to which I consider thc Government would, if honorahle members resorted to obstructive tactics on either side, he justified in using the guillotine, but not in resorting to its general use. I hope the Prime Minister will consider the suggestion I have made. It is not offered in any spirit of opposition, but in .the spirit of one who desires to preserve the traditions of Parliament. Unfortunately, all of us, when we get into office, think, more Seeing that, of the Government than of the House; it seems to he inevitable, and I can symin the minority on the other side, or in the Corner, in desiring free expression of views which they consider their constir tuents desire to have expressed. country! . country, even the honourable member.

Mr SCuXLOT (Yarra) [11.50] I gather that if the Prime Minister( Mr ber has twice used that expression, and, Hughes) had not spoken his motion would have gone through in one minute. The honourable gentleman seems to have developed a habit, on Priday morning, when the House is ready to do certain business, of provoking considerable discussion on quite other matters. that any of his remarks were warranted in reply to the. Opposition or to the Country party. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) rightly said, the Prime Minister has charged us with wasting time, and said that the motions we move are idle and mischievous. I remind the honourable gentleman that some of our attempts, had they been successful, would have saved this country hundreds of thousands of pounds. One question we raised was that of the Wireless Agreement, in which we are involved to the extent of Â£500,000, money likely to be wasted. Another matter was the sale of wooden ships, in connection with which this country is losing Â£50,000. there was the price of sugar, the delay in regard to which is costing the consumers Â£70,000 a week; and, finally, there was the sale of the Woollen Mills at Geelong, although they were making a large profit every year. When the Prime Minister describes as obstructive, as he has; our conduct in drawing attention to these scandals, and great abuses, he is not correct in describing our attitude. sure motions were disposed of so quickly and speeches were so short. It ill-becomes the Prime Minister, who came here last Priday, and, himself, wasted the whole this morning and provoke further discussion on a motion, which, as I say, otherwise would have gone through in a minute. son) -Order!

A ll I wish to say is that the House might as well be sitting, because we are then still able to get through some of our work during sitting hours. Referring particularly to the position of uhe Tasmanian members, it is true that we have to cross only a narrow strip of sea, hut the running of the boats is most inconvenient. It is much easier to travel in the train to Sydney or Adelaide than it is to cross that sea; at any rate, my last trip was such a bad one that I have lost my enthusiasm for visiting my home every fortnight. ThenI remind New South Wales members that we Tasmanian members, and others from distant States; cannot "" nurse "" our constituencies as they can during their weekly visits, and an extra sitting day would certainly not be an exceedingly serious matter for them. say, with considerable pain, that I did not think we should ever have a Prime Minister who would tell us what the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has told the House this morning.

There never was a graver moment than the present in the history of Australia, never a moment when the business of the country called more loudly for the closest and freest consideration. However, I have come to the conclusion that the Prime Minister, after all, is only going to get one of my desires, a legalized humun, and is suffering from senile decay politically. Since ten or twenty years ago, he has evidently gone through some process of reconstruction which has proved .of a dangerous character; and now,, instead of a real live Leader and politician, we have the very opposite. Ask any intelligent person whether the measures now before the House do not call for the keenest criticism. ""We on this side bring with us great principles which we believe are of serious moment to this country, and there should be no talk of the guillotine in the consideration of public questions. Last year, a 6 per cent* loan of Â£5,000,000, at 95, was floated, and the result of the operation is that the Commonwealth receives only Â£4,700,000, and has to pay back Â£11,000,000 in principal and interest. Yeti t is proposed to deprive this House of the power of criticism of such matters. Another matter which should be dealt with is one iu which millions of pounds have been wasted, and in which thc good intentions of Parliament have been defeated. Homes administration. too far, but you can readily understand what I felt like when the Prime Minister was attempting to dictate to honourable members this morning. with indignation when we were told that we were not to exercise our prerogative to discuss measures, and try to the best of our ability to make them perfect in the interests of the country. The right honourable gentleman proposes to lay his Bills upon the table and call upon the House to pass them without proper debate; and, unfortunately, the men who are sitting on the Government side of thc Chamber have not sufficient stamina to oppose him. Politicians of twenty years ago-me n like Barton, Kingston, and Deakin-woul d have made him shiver in his shoes if he had attempted to treat them as he can treat his own followers to-day. He knows well that he has tliem "" in the bag."" At one time in New South Wales a member of the Parkes Cabinet favoured the legalizing of the eight hours, day, and when I met the PremierI said to him, "" Parkes,""-h e was not Sir Henry then"" now, I am eight hours a day. You have a member of your Ministry who has preached it for years."" "" Dear West,"" he said, "" don't you understand I have him in the Cabinet; I have him in the cupboard, and I have the key of that cupboard. Ho cannot move."" Evidently our Prime Minister is in the same position to-day. He has men in his Cabinet who cannot open the dooT until he inserts the key. Por instance, there is the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), who has been brought up in an environment very different from mine, and has had opportunities that I have never possessed. Why does not he stand up to his Leader, and say, "" I will not remain in the Cabinet of a man who proposes to murder every progressive measure."" Honourable members should not be afraid of any threat of a dissolution. I have always done my duty to my constituents, and I have no fear of a threat so unworthy of one who is occupying the honoured post of Prime Minister. I do not find fault with the words uttered. Rather do I complain of the spirit underI refer to the War Service lying them. As a representative of thepremier constituency of Australia, I shall exercise the privileges conferred upon me by my electors. They need never worry that I shall permit any one to tread upon my prerogatives or to prevent mefrom doing what I consider to be in their best interests. As a matter of fact, the I was boiling right honourable gentleman has no complaint against the attitude of the Opposition. Personally I have refrained from speaking on many important matters, and I know that other honourable members have not exercised their full right to discuss measures. If the Prime Minister is' so extremely anxious to pass what hedescribes as progressive measures, why did he not come forward to-day in a conciliatory mood, and say that as Leadeiof the Govermnent he invites honorable members to co-operate with him in passing these Bills? Why did he not: say, ""Let us discuss our differences, and' sec whether I cannot bring you to m y",22,Setup

47,Mr West,"Perhaps, sir, I am goingideas."" He did not choose to adopt this course. Czar ever attempted, quite forgetting that he was addressing an enlightened body of men, whom I have previously described as the creme de la creme of the public of Australia, chosen, notwithstanding our faults, disabilities, and"" whatever failures we may have revealed, to represent the views and safeguard the interests of the people. I represent 60,000 electors. I do not care a button for myself, but I take offence at the Prime Minister's attitude on account of .those 60,000 voters. I hope that to-day's spectacle will be the last we shall have of such a character. Tf we are to have a Prime Minister, in the name of heaven let us have one who will not insult our intelligence or attempt hy buffoonery and legerdemain to mesmerize his hearers. at which the human .being can stand no more. One would imagine that the right honourable gentleman was the only creature on earth knowing anything about politics. I took a leading part in the .Labour councils .before ever he landed in Australia. I want honourable members to point out to the Leader of the Government the error of his ways, and to tell him. that they do not propose any longer to stand his domineering kindergarten lectures or his attempts to browbeat them. It appears that those who, with a view of expediting business, suggest an additional day of sitting share the misapprehension which is very general in this community as to what constitutes the duties of members of Parliament. When the newspapers attempt to appraise the value of an honourable member's services they generally divide his salary by the number of hours he has attended in the House to show how overpaid he is, as if he had no other duties to perform than to attend in the Chamber and take part in the debates. I am sure, however, that those honourable members who take their duties seriously feel that the time outside the House is all too short to enable them to prepare themselves properly for their work inside the Chamber. A great part of an honourable member's time outside is spent in being interviewed in listening to their complaints, and delivered during a debate sometimes alter giving them counsel. Then he has to prethe honourable member's views? pare for his work inside the House. Every He spoke in a way that no measure that comes before us ought to receive the most careful consideration of every member. One has to address oneself to a Bill, and to criticise it in the House. What does this involve? First it involves the reading of the measure most carefully from, beginning .to end. Before one can make up one's mind whether one can agree with its principles, one has to reflect on those principles, and one must do that before taking part in the debate on the second reading. The criticism of a Bill in detail involves the careful consideration of every clause of it . If those who have not had any hand in work of this kind would consider these facts, they would find that the time that a member of the House lhas at his disposal is all too There is a point short. If the House sits three days a week, the remaining days-Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday;-wil l be short enough for every member who does his work conscientiously.

It is evident that the discussions which have taken place during the last three or four weeks have been effective, and, as they have operated to the detriment of the Government, the Prime Minister has come forward with a proposal or threat which says that if we continue to expose these many scandals, he will step in with the guillotine and prevent the facts from being brought to light. have the assurance of Mr Speaker that the Prime Minister did not mean what be said. son) -The honourable member has misunderstood me.

If there has been waste of time, Ministers themselves, by bringing down measures without really knowing the details of them, have been largely responsible. Take, for instance, the Sugar Agreement Bill.

The Minister in charge was not able to give the facts to the House, and because of his want of knowledge the question has been referred to another body. Then, again, there was the Bill dealing with the retirements of officers from the Defence Department. That is now third on the list of measures before the House, but if The object of the Minister had known the facts, and I want to had been prepared to proceed at once, the Bill would have been out of the way by now.

I I am glad to agree with the honourable member that if members devoted their time when the House was not sitting to a study of the measures to be brought forward, they would find themselves fully occupied. Whilei t is true of private .members, it iseven more essential that Ministers., when they come before the House, should know all there is to know about Bills of which they are in charge. In the cases that I have cited the waste of time has been owing to the fact that Ministers have not been fully acquainted with their own measures. The result has been that, of the two measures to which I have referred, .one has been postponed indefiI f he does not mean that we nitely and the other has been referred to another body to supply the facts. Much has been said about the guillotine. I would point out to honourable members that when the party now on this side of the House was in control of the Treasury benches, from 1910 to 1913, the number of the measures placed upon the statute book, and the completeness of the programme of legislation given effect to, far surpassed the achievement of any other The Minister Government in this country before or since, and we did 'it without on one occasion resorting to the guillbtine or gag.",24,Setup

He would like to sail along without it, and he does not want the people to see through the irregularities that we have been endeavouring to explain. He wants to keep things quiet, because there is so much scandal in regard to the Wireless Agreement, the Sugar Agreement, and the Shipbuilding contract, to which I referred the other day. I can quite imagine that members of the public become incensed when they read of these things. They are indignant to find that the Government has been responsible for so many abuses. Now the Prime Minister comes to the House and says in effect, "" If you dare to expose the Government, if you dare to go on introducing censure motions, and if you do not allow us to continue, to do what we want to do in the dark-as has been our custom-the n we will introduce the guillotine and gag discussion.""

Trade and Customs) [12.28] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Before dealing with the provisions of this measure I desire to explain very briefly the conditions surrounding this industry, more particularly as applied to the export trade. Honourable members will recollect . that during a.period of the war and afterwards-fro m .February, 1915, to November, 1920-the whole of Australia's surplus output of beef was taken by the Imperial authorities under a contract, the price being flat to Australia at 4fd. per lb. f.o.b'. On the whole, that was a sound and satisfactory price for Australia, but it was far below what might be termedif such a term can be aptly used-the London parity during those years. That price prevailed throughout the whole war period and until November, 1920. how that price compared with the average parity ? pre-war average price, and on the whole it was a very satisfactory price in the circumstances. It is duo to the industry to explain that the price was a long way beneath world parity, and not much more than half that received by the Argentine growers-ou r great rivals in the Britisli market for civilian supplies. As a jnatter of fact, the Argentine cattlemen, during the war, secured very substantial advantage in the British market because, while the whole of the Australian surplus output was required for Army needs, Argentine growers, besides having large contracts with thc British Army authorities, reserved a certain proportion of their surplus beef supplies for the British market, with the result that they were obtaining substantially higher prices for meat supplied to British householders at a time when the Australian meat was off the market .altogether. However, the cattle-owners of Australia were in a satisfactory position under the Imperial meat contract, which terminated in November, 1920. The beef industry is mainly confined to Queensland, the Northern Territory, the northern parts of New South Wales, and the northern portions of Western Australia, and so satisfactory from a climatic point of view have the past two seasons been, that, on 21st March last, it was estimated that the cattle in the Commonwealth numbered 13,499,737, constituting a record, at least for the last ten years,",25,Setup

I want to place before honourable members a fair setting of the beef industry in the Commonwealth at that time. It was, as' I have said, in a most depressed condition from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. There was a pressing necessity to get the meat works re-opened and the cattle industry moving, because, as I have already indicated, while the past two grass seasons have been most bountiful, there has been little outlet for our surplus fat stock. lian consumer of meat faring at that time? show that the Government proposal has not had the slightest effect on the retail price for home consumption in any of the States, although it has been, of very praccertained reduction in the cost of living, tical assistance to the cattle-owners themestimated at 12s. per week, they would selves. point I wished to make.

It also asked for a subsidy to enable the meat works to re-open, but this request was refused conditionally. quest made? view. I think the deputation waited first upon me, and subsequently on the Prime Minister. The Government refused the request for a subsidy, because, at that time, it would have been on the then existing high freights, high slaughtering charges, excessive operating costs, and higher wages. It was felt that, by itself, a subsidy would not be sufficient to re-establish the industry on a sound basis. The Government, therefore, laid it down that if the ship-owners were prepared to reduce their freights by Â£d. per lb., that if the meat works could reduce their treatment costs by -Jd. per lb., and if the workers engaged in the industry could accept a reduction in wages equal only to the asbe prepared to pay the subsidy asked for the in the confident belief that the revised conditions would make it worthwhile for the meat works to re-open. After certain negotiations, a sound, common sense arrangement was made along the lines suggested.

If we had not heen able to export, there would not have been any Australian beef on the London market for another season, and the quality of our product would have been judged by' the stale residual stocks held under the Imperial meat contract. The result would have been that Australian meat would have been, considered inferior had we not come to the assistance of the industry in facilitating the export of new meat, because'its quality would have been based on the accumulated stocks held in London. Already we have suffered very severely in this direction, because the Argentine exporters have been able to display new season's meat on the tables and at the Smithfield market, which has been in general use by British consumers. abandoned their policy of allowing private enterprise to conduct its own business ? of Government control in this connection, and when I explain the provisions of the BillI shall be able to show that care has been taken to see that this money goes into the pockets of the cattle-owners, and not into the funds of the big meat works. works largely controlled by cattle-owners?

117,Mr Rodgers,"That is so. AusWe regard this not as a remedy, but rather as a means adopted in the last resort to try to create a movement in the beef industry. It is a class of help that oan be given in an hour of crisis and trial. The Government in taking this action are not looking for a means of spending public money, but are seeking rather to keep one of Australia's great outstanding industries going in its hour of trial. It is for the cattlo men of Australia to solve their own problems. It is for them to work out the salvation of their own industry; but I venture to say that remedies which had been suggested up to the time we took aotion would not have met the situation that confronted the industry and the Government. The situation was unprecedented in the history of the meat industry. It was not a question of re-adjustment due to war, as compared with post-war conditions. It was in effect owners or their representatives in conferthe positive result of a gigantic trade struggle between the two great meat forces of the world. This struggle had crippled the great meat industry of Australia, unorganized as it was, and there seemed to be no other way of getting relief. The assistance we are giving is but small, and will not involve the amount that we at first anticipated. We were originally making provision for a season, of 400,000 cattle. As I have already mentioned, however, the season has tapered off. Adverse weather conditions have affected the cattle of the north, their condition has gone off, and there will not be available the number of prime cattle that we anticipated. Our latest estimate is that 225,000 head of cattle will be treated. We anticipate that of these 190,000 will be treated at the works in Queensland, 23,500 in Western Australia, 9,000 in New South Wales, and 1,000 in Victoria, while 1,500 will leave Northern Australia as live cattle, and in respect of them a subsidy of 10s. per head will be paid. works will those cattle be treated? are thirteen meat works. Of these two have not opened, and eleven have operated only since the payment of the subsidy. Some of them have completed their season. The Wyndham. meat-works-the only works of the kind in Western Australia-hav e re-opened. In the Northern Territory, Vestey's works have not reopened, but we have provided for a subsidy of 10s. per head to be paid on live cattle sent out of the Territory. Every effort has been made to insure that the bounty, or its equivalent, shall go to the grower. No payment will be made except on proof that the cattleowner has received the benefit of the bounty. That is definite. Certificates will have to accompany the claims for the subsidy. These certificates will provide that the owner shall have produced proof to the satisfaction of the authorities that he has either received the equivalent of the bounty or the price ex-bounty. In that case he will receive the bounty direct. up, will he not give that certificate before he sells? every phase of this matter with the cattleence, and the mode of payment which we have adopted has been the outcome of several consultations with the cattleowners. Sales, as honourable members know, are conducted in many ways.

We have made provision as far as possible to meet all cases. sale there may be nothing to show whether it is cx-bounty or inclusive of bounty. conferences with the representatives of the meat works, and their forms of contract as from 5th April provide for that. No works will be precluded from securing the benefit of the sudsidy in respect of standard beef-that is, frozen export beef. With regard to canned meat, the proposal is that, where works slaughter the whole bullock for canning, the subsidy will be paid upon the canned meat there produced. But where there is a branch of a frozen meat works which may put up canned meat, part of which is derived from a beast slaughtered for home consumption and part from a beast slaughtered for export, that branch will not be paid the subsidy. Its output will not come under the category of standard export meat.

The departmental estimates at the present time, embracing frozen meat, canned meat, and live cattle exported, is, roughly, Â£140,000. The total may be rather more. Minister for believing that the conditions against which the industry is contending are temporary? that there is evidence that the feud in the beef world has about reached its end. The London market has recently improved, and that provides evidence of the fact that meat is no longer being rushed into the United Kingdomi n its former volume. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), who has just returned from England,, and the honourable member for New England( MrH a y ) , will be able to testify t h it beef was being rushed into the United Kingdom markets irrespective of loss. There The same will be borne out by Mr Elder, who is a member of the Board of Trade, and who will be out here shortly. This gentleman, by the way, has been asked by the Government to investigate the whole subject of the Australian beef industry. Millions of pounds were deliberately thrown away in reckless encounters between the two great industries involved, and the meat markets of the world were so paralyzed that it was impossible to export meat from Australia without sustaining loss. In the circumstances, the alternatives for the Government were to fold their hands and calmly look on, permitting conditions to continue, or to adopt the expedient of paying temporarily a subsidy. I say, candidly, that the Government did not desire to interfere. They did so only at the' urgsnt csll of the industry. It is hoped that the beef business of Australia will be able to readjust itself under ordinary trade conditions. It will be for those engaged in the industry to get to work very earnestly, to organize, and generally to re-arrange economic conditions. The Government, I repeat, do not wish to H o w much money will be continue the subsidy for one hour beyond 31st October next, which date, all agree, will end the present season. I have shown that what the Government have done has been merely to set about the wheels again in motion. Their action has not, to any appreciable extent, in fluenced home prices. By taking out of the market 225,000 head of prime cattle the effect has been to end the nightmare created by the huge surplus of stock in Australia, and prevent a total collapse of the market. Enormous losses have been sustained by cattle men in every State. No other rural industry has suffered to anything like the same extent. The Government considered every possible way",31,Rodgers The Honourable Tration Court Had Been Requested To

131,Mr Rodgers,"I have already saidof giving relief, and I am convinced that their method, as demonstrated in this Bill, has been thc best. I ask the House to pass the Bill as speedily as possible, for no payments have yet been made. The subsidy will be retrospective, it is true; but cattle men will be greatly relieved when the cash is available. The Bill is but a short machinery measure. The dates covering its operations, the subsidy rates, and all the provisions for payments are definitely During the war elaborate provision had set out. It may be taken for granted that the workers employed in the industry would never have agreed to a reduction of their wages, but that they were impressed by the absolute necessity for such a course. These men are on the spot, and know all the conditions from A to Z. They have agreed that the industry is in such a plight that a reduction of their -wages is warranted. The ship-owners have reduced their freight charges by Â£d. per lb., and the works by ^d. per lb. But there is plenty of room, in my judgment, for a further reduction of freight costs. charges for freight, aud costs at the works, and outlay for insurance and the like were, in pre-war days, approximately 1-jjd. per lb. The pre-subsidy charges were ""2$d. Reductions which I have just enumerated have since been brought about; but there is still any amount of reason why those engaged in tlie industry should get busy. In my view, a huge margin of reduction can still be fairly effected. As the industry depends for its existence, mainly, at any rate, 'upon satisfactory overseas sales of its surplus, throughout the world, no sane man would it must come down to a competitive basis with its great world rivals. This subsidy is not being given to place the industry on a competitive basis, but merely to put the wheels of the industry in motion again. that the payment of the subsidy, plusthe reductions which have so far been effected, have or will put the industry on a profitable basis. ""WereI to repeat in detail the tragic statements of individual lasses which have been made known to the Government from all over Australia, I would be merely adding to an already familiar story. I appeal to honourable members, therefore, to give the measure their immediate and favorable attention. The Minister for Trade and Customs tralia to Europe. ( Mr Rodgers) has pointed out that this is an emergency measure, and is designed to tide the cattle-growers over a difficult period during the coining year. That difficulty is not peculiar to the cattle industry; almost every trade and industry in Australia is suffering in the same way, due chiefly to the impoverished condition, of the world. The present position of the cattlo industry is due, in some measure, to the large stores of meat that had accumulated at the conclusion of the war. to be made to insure adequate food supplies for the soldiers at the Front, and large quantities of meat and other products were bought ancl stored. A considerable accumulation was on hand when the war ended, and that very greatly disturbed the beef market. I think Vestey Brothers stated that that was one of the main causes of the depression of the meat market. However, I realize that it is necessary to do everything we can to insure that. the beef industry, in common with every other producing interest, gets The total a fair price for its product. The Minister stated that the industry was so depressed that it could not be profitably carried on. A number of factors are contributing to bring about that state of .affairs. One is the fact that shipping freights to-day are more than l d . per lb. higher than they were in pre-war times. I do not argue that freights and other charges should not be higher than they were before the war; having regard to the changes that have taken place make such a contention; but I do think that the freights are very much higher than they should be, and there is opportunity for getting in that quarter some relief for the producers. It is difficult No suggestion has been made to understand why considerable shipping tonnage is laid up when such high freights are ruling. Quite a number of the ships belonging to the ""Commonwealth Line are idle when perhaps they could be trading with advantage to the Commonwealth and the producers. The purpose of establishing the Line was to prevent the Shipping' Combine getting complete control of sea carriage to and from Australia, and at the present time the Commonwealth ships might be used to advantage in connection with the carriage of beef and other products from Aus-",32,Rodgers The Honourable Tration Court Had Been Requested To

Lino is to be operated in that way it will not achieve the object for which it was established. The justification for creating it was that it should assist to keep freights down to normal; but abnormal charges are very much in evidence today, and at the same time the Commonwealth ships are idle, although it would appear that they might be operated with advantage to the producers. fere with private enterprise. tion may have some weight with the Goveniment. It seems to me that the policy of the Government is to restrict, as far as possible, all Commonwealth trading activities, and for that reason they are disposing of some of the enterprises hitherto operated by the Commonwealth. The proposal contained in this Bill may be another roundabout way of achieving the same object. It is proposed that we should subsidize one section of the community, perhaps at the expense of another. It has been urged that this proposed subsidy will not be reflected in the price of meat on the local market. The Minister quoted figures supplied by the Government Statistician in regard to prices during the last three or four months in support of that contention. In New South Wales meat prices are higher than in any other State, notwithstanding that it adjoins Queensland, which has so many cattle available, and I do not think those high meat prices are due to high wholesale prices received by cattle-owners for their stock during the last year or so. Only a few days ago I was introduced in Maitland to a man receiving for his cattle. He said that the cattle he had disposed of during the last few months had in no case fetched more than 2d. per lb., and some of them had realized only l f d . per lb. He was The Government should see bewailing the price of labour, and said that the price he was getting for his beef would not enable him to pay high wages. I said to him, "" That is all very well; but are you aware that beef is sold retail at from Is. 3d. per lb. for best cuts to 7d. per lb.?"" He said he was aware'of that. I continued, "" How do you expect workmen to subsist on a wage of Â£2 10s. per week if they have to pay such prices?"" He said that that aspect had never occurred to him; but he saw the logic of it at once. He realized that if the high cost of living prevented a man from working for Â£2 10s. per week, he must receive a higher wage. The statistics quoted by the Minister were intended to prove that the proposed subsidy is not causing an increase in the price of meat on the Australian market. I find that in New South Wales the price of beef has risen considerably;I tliink it should do so, because the cattle-owners were not getting a sufficiently high price before'but, although high prices were prevailing, it was intended to increase the price by another 2d., per lb. That fact shows that the facilitation of export by Government assistance reacts upon the price in the local market. All things we do in this way must eventually react upon the general community; there can be no escape from that. I admit that, having regard to the parlous conditions of the pastoral industry in Queensland and elsewhere, some relief had to be afforded, and when the workers at the Conference of all interested parties agreed to a reduction of wages, the conditions must have been very pressing from their point of view. They desired to get work if they possibly could, and agreed to take a lower wage. The operation of this Bill is limited to the present year; nevertheless it should contain some provision for a reduction of the subsidy in the event of the price of meat overseas increasing sufficiently to bridge the gulf between the present ridiculously low price and a reasonable price. If by some unforeseen circumstances beef rose during the period -covered by this Bill",33,Rodgers The Honourable Tration Court Had Been Requested To

Then, again, there is the position of the worker. He has been liberal enough to consent to a certain reduction of wages, but I find no provision in the Bill for restoring the worker to his former conditions in the event of the price of meat becoming satisfactory. In the absence of such a provision, if in two months' time the price of meat rises to a profitable figure, and there is no need for a further subsidy, the workers who have agreed to a reduction in their wages will have no guarantee that their wages will be increased again. such provision. The workers, as a rule, do not look far enough ahead. They see the immediate necessity of the moment, and say to those with whom they are conferring that they are prepared to make a concession on a mutual basis, so that all may benefit by keeping the industry sound. that when the producer gets back to a satisfactory condition of affairs thc workers should regain the advantages which they have sacrificed. ""We cannot lose sight of the fact that the cost of living is not falling. Some months ago there was a great clamour for a reduction of wages ou account of the falling cost of living, but statistics show that during the last couple of quarters the cost of living has been on the increase. If the workers had yielded to that clamour for a reduction of wages, what would be their position to-day with the cost of living on the up grade? I do not know what attitude honourable members of the Country party will adopt towards this measure, which affects very closely the section of the community whom them declare that they have no sympathy for State enterprise, that trade and industry should be allowed to get back to normal channels and that the Government should not hamper or interfere with industry in any way, but in connection with the beef industry the very policy they condemn is being continued. alternative. What is the use of standing on a principle and slaughtering the victim ? ing to show the need for some consistency, and am pointing out that those who decry Government interference with industry, ancl say that wages and prices must be governed by world conditions, are to-day supporting the very principle they condemn. We arc told that wages and prices must be regulated by the law of supply and demand, but it would appear that the attitude of honourable members depends upon the section of the community affected. No doubt honourable members of the Country party will support the Bill, because it will afford relief to a body of men with whom they are closely connected. I do not say that There should be some this relief should not he given, but I am arguing that the granting of it must have some effect upon the rest of the community. If we. are to send a lot of beef out of Australia, and reduce stocks to normal or below normal, the price in the local market must be affected. price far more than any condition of the world's markets. we do not get rid of some of the beef we shall lose a lot more. as to whether or not this proposal is sound, but I am showing the inconsistency of some' honorable members who, whilst supporting this bonus, argue that the working people should have their wages reduced and hours of labour increased in order to bring conditions back to normal. So long as we have to take measures like this that argument cannot apply. I know that this will be a difficult measure to administer.

However, the proposal before the House is the result of a mutual agreement between all parties concerned, and it is very evident that they would not have acted as they have done if they had not been forced by circumstances to do so. For instance, the workers have submitted to a reduction in wages, evidently because they realized that they will derive some benefit for the time being. We depend largely upon marketing our surplus produce overseas, and I hope that our meat industry will soon be in a position to secure sales overseas, thus bringing more money into circulation in the Commonwealth, and giving more employment., congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers) on his comprehensive and lucid explanation of the causes justifying the passage of this Bill. I am glad to know that its details were arrived at in consultation with the cattle-owning interests, because that precaution will tend to insure its success in meeting the conditions it seeks to overcome. A t the same time. I hope to submit some amendments which may assist in making the measure work even more equitably than might otherwise be the case. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has pointed out, not unnaturally, that the retail price of meat is price-fixing exvery high in certain parts of Australia. ThisI would attribute mainly to the excessive cost of the distribution of commodities. Asa matter of fact, one of the greatest problems of civilization to-day is how to reduce the heavy retail prices of food and other produce which prevail, no matter whether the wholesale prices may be high or low. failures of the competitive system. with the interjection of the honourable member, whom I greet for the first time, and whom I am delighted to see in this House. The present excessive costs of distribution and of retailing are due, not to any system of competition, but to just the opposite cause, namely, want of Co-operative full and complete competition. These excessive costs are largely the result of restriction on competition. These restrictions are the result of combinations set up against the interests of producers and consumers alike. member say that there are Combines among the retail butchers? the honourable member address such a question to a body of men who are observers and thinkers such as honourable members of this House? member's answer.",37,Rodgers The Honourable Tration Court Had Been Requested To

They ransacked the earth to obtain supplies of meat with which to feed the people cf the British Isles and the members of the Services. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, as some people would think, they did not place, their orders for these purchases through the usual trade channels. People were sent abroad with little or no experience of the trade, and in various parts of the world they bought beef and had it frozen, or bought it frozen. Kingdom and, through the Meat Control, was distributed to the various consuming centres. It was one of the disadvantages of this system of control that the Government would not deal with individual butchers. They said to the retailers in the various centres, ""Form your association, tell us what you want, and we will send it down for you to distribute."" That was the cause of setting up a gigantic private control over meat, which, although the Government is out of it to-day, still exists. The machinery of that private control has to be reckoned with. A great deal of that imported frozen beef was very inferior. from? say where it came from. I do not think it is right in this Chamber for me to indicate in any way where that beef came from. I have very carefully investigated the matter, and I am satisfied that practically not one inferior carcass came from Australia. shipped by Angliss and Co. ? hear that question brought up now. That was not frozen beef, and in any case the interjection relates to a totally different transaction, and does not affect the subject with which I am dealing. The result of the action to which I have-referred was that a number of people were compelled to eat frozen beef who did not want te eat it. They wanted fresh beef, and were prepared to pay for it . The beef that they had to eat aroused in their minds a violent prejudice against all frozen beef, and it is a prejudice that we have to face and live down. Another thing which aggravated the position was that the Government had accumulated, during and since the war, very large supplies of frozen beef, and they thought that the best thing to do would be to dispose of the whole of it in one parcel to one great firm. They were paid a high price for it, but, unfortunately, the firm to which they sold it, instead of distributing it immediately among the consumers at the high prioes then ruling, held it. I think the market was falling immediately after they bought it, but they did not think the fall would conI t was taken to the United tinue. very long in stock? 1920, but how long'it had been in stock at that time, no one knows. The newest of it is at least two years old. There were 150,000 quarters, of which, at the time only 33,000 were Australian, the remaining 117,000 having been supplied by other countries. The honourable member for New England( Mr Hay) and I inspected much of this meat, and I am prepared to say that the whole of the 33,000 quarters of Australian meat were perfectly wholesome, and that there was not one carcass sent to the Smithfield did it come market that was not inspected immediately on coming out of the cool stores by pincers of the Ministry of Health and passed as perfectly wholesome. The whole of the trade knew that these 150,000 quarters had to be sold, and they were continually being placed on the Smithfield market. Although the 33,000 Australian quarters were perfectly good, there was other frozen meat that did not look very well, although it might have been perfectly wholesome. It was this meat that had a very depressing influence on the market at that time. pressing influence on the consumer, too! should not have a depressing effect upon the consumer, but exactly the reverse. Realizing the parlous state of the industry, several of us, including the honourable member for New England and myself, tried to get these 150,000 quarters lifted off the market. They belonged to Messrs. Vestey Brothers, who bought all the surplus supplies of beef, amounting to 1,500,000 quarters, from Great Britain in 1920.

They asked for a subsidy on the ground that they ought not to be left to carry the whole of the loss. The subsidy they asked for was Â£100,000, and several of us were very keen that something should be done. Later they sold 20,000 quarters. they were then prepared, if they received Â£50,000, to remove the whole of the remaining 130,000 carcasses off the London market. London who wore prepared to put up Â£1,000 each. I do not remember the name of all of those who were prepared to do so, but there were Mr W. P. Shaw, of the Gladstone Meat Works; Mr Elder, of John Cooke and Company, myself, and several others. I believe we could have raised Â£10,000 in London within twenty four hours, and we thought that by some means the remaining Â£40,000 could have' been raised in Australia. The negotiations were not directly in my hands, and the result we were striving for did not eventuate. I think we were waiting for news from Australia that did not come. It is an enormous pity that something in that direction was not done. I do not blame anybody in the remotest degree.

It is impossible to say how low the price of frozen beef would have been if the Government had not taken that Â£50,000 worth of beef off thc market when it did. About that period, what is known as the beef exporting season should have commenced in Queensland. About March or April all the great meat export works in Queensland open up, or do not open up. I was iu almost daily communication with my friends in Melbourne as to the position in this city. I learned that there was not one meat works in Queensland that was prepared to make an offer of any description for cattle.

Borthwick's were still open, but they were not rushing I believe that the any new business. In any case, business was upon an absolutely unpayable basis from the point of view of the cattlegrower. The question then arose as to whether anything oould be done to save the industry, which was practically at the point of death. One of the effects of the agreement arranged by the Government was the opening of the works in Queensland, and if that result had not been achieved the consequence would have been infinitely more disastrous to the future of .j-lfifi Australia than was apparent.

235,Mr Jowett,"I am not aware ofwould the 225,000 head of cattle not have been exported and turned into money, and have provided food for people at the other end ot the world, but the continuity of thc whole Australian beef trade inEngland would have been disturbed. The cattle would probably have died next year, because if bullocks aro not taken when they are fat, in three cases out of five they never get fat again. In many instances large retailers, operators at Smithwas a recognised expert, suggested that a field, and distributers in manufacturing districts, when they saw me, raised the question of continuity of supply. They said, "" If we begin to sell your Australian bcof, if we sell it as Australian, and if we put up placards saying, ' This is Australian beef,' can you guarantee us continuity of supplies?"" I did my best to satisfy them. It will be readily understood that if a whole year is allowed to go by without a single carcass of fresh Australian beef being placed on the English market, irreparable damage would be done to the industry in this country, because the British consumer woufd have become accustomed to getting his requirements elsewhere. Some reference has heen made to the alleged . inferiority of Australian frozen beef in comparison with beef from ether sources in the British market, and in this connection I should like to inform honourable memhers of an interesting experiment that waa carried out whilst I was in England, at the suggestion of my friend the honourable member for New England( Mr Hay), and through the instrumentality oi the present High Commissioner ( Sir Joseph Cook). But at this stage I should like to digress for a in Britain or thc Argentine. I ask leave moment to say that during my visit to EnglandI found our High Commissioner most sympathetic and watchful of the interests of our primary producers. There appears to bo a very exaggerated idea of the ability of our highly-placed oflicials to influenoo' British thought in regard to Australian affairs, but there can be no doubt that ' Sir Joseph Cook is a most zealous and faithful representative of the Commonwealth. He accepted very readily the suggestion of my friend the honourable member for New England, that in order to test the relative merits of Australian and other beef on the British market there should he a practical demonstration. Accordingly, he invited [68] a number of representative gentlemen to lunch with him at Australia House, with the idea of getting them to partake of fresh Scottish roast beef, Argentine chilled beef six weeks old, and Australian frozen beef at least two years old, and without any prior knowledge as to their source of production express an opinion as to the relative qualities of the respective cuts. One of my friends, who certain cut was from fresh English roast beef, but I was not prepared to say, and I can confidently state that the general opinion was that it was absolutely impossible to detect any difference between ony of the throe cuts. They were all uniformly choice. Eight guests were present at the luncheon, and after partaking of the roast beef four placed' the Scotch roast heef first, the Australian frozen beef second, and the Argentine chilled beef third. Three placed the Scotch roast beef first, Argentine, second, and the Australian third, and one guest put the Argentine first, the Scotch second, and the Australian third. The general consensus of opinion was that there was actually no difference between the three; but the guests were asked to vote in some order of preference, and did so, with, the result I have stated. I have challenged people in the Old Country, in the press, on the platform, and elsewhere to prove that Australian frozen beef is in any sense inferior to the best fresh beef produced in England. So far as I can see, there oan be no difference in flavour, because I think our Australian beef breeds are quite equal to those either to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
