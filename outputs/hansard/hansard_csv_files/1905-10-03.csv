16,Mr Kelly,"As I shall show beforehas been made to delimit the work which the respective authorities are to undertake. Take the case of industrial statistics. At present, industrial matters are wholly within the purview of the States, and it ' is obvious that if , before the States have handed over to us their authority to deal with industrial matters, we enter upon this branch of their statistical work, we shall double-bank the statistical records. Power is sought to compile statistics relating to factories, mines, and productive industries generally. conceded that all these are subjects of Federal interest, it will be seen that under the double-banking process I have indicated, the taxpayers will be required to bear a greatly increased expenditure without deriving the benefit of a more complete service. An effort should have been made to define clearly the scope of Federal statistical legislation, and to indicate the work that is still to be left to the States. I must also strenuously object to the large powers of prescription for which the Minister is asking. in the Commonwealth and the States, and even in the mother country, has been marked by an increasing assumption on the part of the Crown of the powers which properly belong to our representative institutions. The liberties of the people, which were won at such great cost, have appaiently become matters of such small concern that year by year fresh powers are without a struggle being handed back by the Parliaments to the Crown. In the Bill provision is made for handing over to the Minister of the day powers which should rest with this House. Minister seeks authority to exercise immense discretionary power. He informed us as to his views with regard to the way in which the Commonwealth should exercise its authority to compile statistics; but if one contrasts the clauses which authorize the Minister to make arrangements with the States Governments with the provisions which are intended to enable the Commonwealth Statistician to collect statistics upon every conceivable subject, one cannot fail to be struck with the curious contradiction involved. If the Minister is armed with the powers now sought, the States will be compelled, perhaps, much against their will, to hand over to the Commonwealth their control of a number of statistical matters. We all know that the expenditure incurred by the Commoner. Kelly. wealth in this direction will be debited to the States on a population basis. For example, if under clause 16 the Government decide to collect industrial statistics, say, in Queensland, and that State wishes to compile similar information for itself, although the latter mav have its own statistical bureau, it will still be required to bear a share of the expenses of the Commonwealth's statistical operations within its own borders. Whilst it may be crue from having those statistics duplicated in any way? which I ant making. would not the Government of Queensland gracefully give way to the Commonwealth? to do so, seeing that it possesses concurrent powers, we ought to exercise our powersvery circumspectly indeed. We should recollect that the same taxpayer would be Recent legislation required to bear the cost of both operations. For my own part, I think that the work of collecting statistics generally is one which should properly belong to the Commonwealth. But before the powers of the States in this respect can be abrogated, it is obvious that we must inspire them with confidence in Commonwealth administration. Otherwise they will not be prepared to surrender their powers. The best way in which we can inspire that confidence is by negotiating with the States-no t by arbitrarily taking from them powers which they possess under tlie Constitution By comThe pelling them, to contribute to the cost of maintaining a Federal Bureau of Statistics Ave shall oblige them to surrender control of such statistical branches as they themselves now imagine it necessary to conduct.

20,Mr Kelly,"But if it did not wishin order to secure greater representation in this Parliament than that to which they were entitled. our own powers, we must endeavour to States. At the present time, the Commonwealth is regarded in some of the States with absolute dislike, and in others with feelings approaching unpopularity. The main reason for this unpopularity is that insteadof adhering strictly to our own duties, we have trespassed upon the industrial domains of the States. the right honourable gentleman exhibited one pose to deal with these matters, in detail of the few evidences that he is possessed at the present moment.

25,Mr Groom,Unde r the Acts Interpresirable to him. If statistics are necessary,15,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading
26,Mr Kelly,"Claus e n providesclause, the Minister seeks power to send the officers of the Department on general roving commissions through all places of business, workshops, and the like, during working hours, in order to make, not such inquiries as this House thinks ought to be made, but such inquiries as are prescribed. These powers are altogether too wide to be vested in any statistical bureau. As honourable members are aware, officer's of the Department will be able to enter any branch of a man's business* to compile statistics on every phase of human industry. these circumstances, should we give the Minister practically unlimited power to send officers, athis own sweet will, to examine liooks, and generally to interfere with busibecome of Parliamentary control. Then, ness, because certain statistics which this House may think unnecessary are, in his own opinion, or in that of the Statistician, required ? ,If these provisions be exercised to anything like half their possible extent, we shall have a statistical bureau of such dimensions as the world has never seen. I suggest to the Minister that this clause in itself necessitates the restriction of' the wide powers that he desires to have vested in him. Another curious part of the measure is that which gives the Statistician a mandate to compile ancl tabulate the-statistics collected "" pursuant to this Act,"" and to it incidentally.. to publish such statistics or abstracts thereof ""as Inferentially, keep from publication such statistics or abstracts thereof as the Minister may direct. This, again, seems to be altogether too wide a power for the Minister to seek. If the House says that statistics are necessary, surely there should be no political interference with the proper departmental work of preparing them. have the Minister seeking the right to say what statistics shall, and what shall not, be published. What purpose will statistics serve if they are not for the use of the people of Australia? If they are to be held up at the sweet will of the Minister -if some of them, instead of being published, are to be placed in some Ministerial pigeon-hole-of what use will they be fo the people? This provision is certainly one that must be eliminated, and I trust that the Minister will see his way to omit it without action being taken by any one else. The honourable and learned gentleman, as we know, is usually anxious to see that the House is fairly treated. So far, he has not been in charge of a Corner. Kelly. merce Bill, or other kindred measures, and we are, therefore, in a position to regard him with a certain degree of hope. That being so, I do say that as this fault has been pointed out, we shall certainly look forward to his correcting it before the Bill passes out of Committee. The next pointand this is the most important of all-is that under this measure the Government propose to take a census when they please. I do not know whether they have realized exactly what this, means. The cost of takIn ing a census of Australia amounts to over Â£100,000, and if a Minister is to have the right at any time to incur such an expenditure, we may well ask what has again, as if this were not sufficient cause for alarm, we find that the Bill, when read in conjunction with the Representation Bill, places the House, and especially representatives of those States whose population is increasing, in a rather invidious position. The Representation Bill provides fore another place, and may not be discussed. the Minister directs."" member will be good enough not to mention therefore, he is to the name of the Bill. with the basis of the representation of the various States in this Chamber, there is a provision insuring thatAfter the first census taken after the commencement of this Act an Enumeration Day shall be appointed at the expiration of every fift h year But here we after the then last preceding Enumeration Day. Under this measure, however, a census need not necessarily be taken for another hundred years, because the Minister alone has the power to fix the Census Day. After the first enumeration, which we know must take place, no further enumeration day can be decided under that Bill until the Minister chooses, under this one, to hold a census. So that if , ten or eleven years hence, any State happened to have a bigger proportionate population than it has at present, it would not be able to get its proper representation in this House until the Minister of the day saw fit to hold a census under the wide discretion he is given in this Bill. Surely the House will not stand that! In mv opinion the Bill should be altered,",15,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

30,Mr Kelly,"In another Bill dealingand a definite period fixed for holding a census. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The year ending with "" one"" is adopted throughout the Empire. Home Affairs, speaking without proper consideration, I think, stated that througnout Australia a census was taken by the States at decennial periods. really hold that opinion, because he knows as well as any one here that it is not the case in Queensland, but his speech shows orable gentleman saidEach State also acts on the uniform principle of a decennial census. at another time. Even that State, although providing for a quinquennial census, has acted on a, decennial basis. necessary to hold a census more frequently than decennially / but for the purposes of economy it will not collect a census this year, and will wait until the decennial period comes round. If it has made this experiment in the direction of more numerous census, and found that the results did not justify the expenditure involved, surely the Commonwealth might take a lesson from that State. This particular part of the measure is at fault, no matter how it may be regarded. Looked at from the point of view of holding too few census it will interfere with the representation of the States here. census, it will interfere with ihe ordinary practice that has hitherto obtained, not only throughout Australia, but throughout the British Empirea practice which; when departed fromi in one State, was found to be so expensive that it reverted to the old procedure. I cannot see that any reason i's given for this novel provision. The Minister has not shown us why it is necessary to have a census whenever he thinks fit. It has, I understand, been ssid that this is to enable ihe Commonwealth to carry out the desire of a State to hold a census at any time it may think fit. But, surely, with so large an expenditure as ,Â£100,000 involved, it is not asking too much to require the Government of the day to come down to the House and apply for special authority. These are all large increases in Ministerial responsibility, [103]2 which I hope the House will not approve. It is rather significant that whereas the Crown is %'ery ambitious for an. increase of its own powers, it shows a singular disregard for the rights of the people as reThe Minister of gards the operation of the measure. One provisions says thatAny person who forges, or utters knowing it to be forged, any form or document under this Act, He cannot shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years. The people who will suffer by this forgery or the uttering of forged forms or documents will be the people of Australia. When a forgery is committed in the ordinary way, I think that the penalty is about fen or fourteen years, at any rate it is in the State from which I have the honour to come. Why should the penalty for forgery under this Bill be so exceedingly light? It is a very serious offence. Here is one chance that the Ministers have of safeguarding the rights of the people, and I do not see why any special provision should be inserted to save the criminals involved from the ordinary punishment for that offence. I only touch upon this matter in passing to show that whereas the Ministry is extremely ambitious for new powers it is not so careful of the ordinary rights of the people. I do not wish to delay the passing of the Bill. I recognise that there are certain statistics which the Commonwealth should collect. I certainly think that the census should be taken by the CorrimonweaJth, but only at fixed periods and in the way which the House may lay down. If we have too many I regret that in his speech the Minister made no reference to the probable expense of collecting the census, gave no assurance that the Federal ancl States Departments would act in co-operation, and offered no valid reason why the census should not be taken at fixed periods. I have only a few matters to regret about the Bill. It is too loosely drafted, throwing, as I have pointed out, too great discretion upon the Department. It allows too great Ministerial powers as regards taking a census, ordering and. inferential I y, stifling the publication of statistics at its own sweet will and arranging what statistics shall be collected. I hope that before we go into Committee the Government will be able to bring down some amendments that will be the means of shortening the discussion which, is bound to ensue if the Bill is sought to 'be passed in its present very loosely-drafted form.",16,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

34,Mr Groom,I referred to Queensland,17,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading
35,Mr Kelly,"Queenslan d thought itHad it not been for this loose drafting I should not have availed myself of my right to speak on, the second reading of the Bill, but in its present form I think that the more it is debated at this stage the less discussion there will be in Committee. It certainly is not the fault of private members if they find it necessary to have a preliminary discussion at this stage. I would suggest to the Minister that! he should reconsider the measure with a view to telling the House definitely what he wants, and giving it an opportunity of granting him' definite powers. tially a Bill to be dealt with, in Committee. I agree with the speaker who has just sat down, that an effort should be made to save expense and to work in with the States in that enumeration of population which is necessary. I entirely concur in the view that there ought to be a fixed period for the census, and that years at the end of whose numbers thefigureone appears -suc h as 1901 and 1911-shoul d always be the years in which a census is taken. I have risen to sav that at a later stage, after I have been able to consult the draftsman, I shall move that the householder's schedule be a schedule to this B ill ; not with a view to limit the statistics which the officers may desire to collect, but in order that the House may understand the minimum of information to be obtained. members will refer to the New South Wales Act or' the Victorian Act, they will find that elaborate details are given as to the information to be secured. In clause 16 of this Bill, tbe heads of the various branches of information to be compiled are set out; but I think that the Bill fails in giving to the House a very limited idea as to what the character of the information is to be. upon the subject to the Minister in charge of the Bill, and I earnestly hope that he will recognise that as' this is a measure affecting the statistical information of the whole of the Commonwealth, it is much too narrow and restricted in its terms. It is true that the Minister has been guided to a considerable degree by a conference of Statisticians recently held. But we should like to have an assurance from him that he is co-operating in some way with the States. speech that it was desirable to do so. not the pleasure of hearing the Minister's speech. I think that it would be monstrous to duplicate the expense in obtaining information which is so necessary, both to the States and the Commonwealth. We should co-operate with the States. We should also co-operate in obtaining our information in such a form that it will be useful for purposes of comparison. We should fall in, as far as possible, with the practice that jhas been pursued by the States, and also with the practice in Great Britain. Comparisons which are drawn from statistical information are much more satisfactory if they are based upon similar data, and relate to fixed and regular periods. I recognise that in a matter of this sort we are largely in the hands of the Minister for the time being. But, at the same time, I urge that the Bill ought to be much more specific. It is a short measure dealing with an enormous subject, and involving States' interests. It is essentially an enabling Bill. But the information which it is proposed fo obtain is vital. We should, therefore, schedule the various kinds of statistics which jhall be collected. I rose at this stage simply for the purpose of letting the Minister 'know that I am expressing, not only my own personal view, but that of other hpnorable members who think that the Bill is very meagre in the respects I have indicated, and that we shall ask honourable members in Committee to -consider the expediency of making 'the If honourable householder's schedule a schedule to the Bill, and the details of information which are to be obtained much more comprehensive and more completely particularized than they are in the general terms here employed -Each one 'of us has his individual opinions as to what the nature of the information to be collected ought to be; and we should, in my judgment, have an opportunity of expressing our opinions on that I have spoken point. Of course, this cannot be considered as other than a very necessary Bill, and the wonder is that it has not come before the House at an earlier period. I trust that it will be amended in two or three particulars, especially those which I have indicated. Feeling that the measure is essentially one for consideration in Committee, I shall not labour the points I have mentioned any further at the present stage. this is a Bill for consideration in Committee, but there are one or two matters to which I should like to direct the attention of the House on the second read-",17,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

39,Mr Mccay ^Corinella),"I agree thating. I think it is more convenient to do .so, as it will conduce to a saving of time. I have no objection to a Census and Statistics Bill being brought in and dealt with 'by this Parliament, although personally, I do not think that there is any urgent hurry for it. But there are two or three points in connection with the measure as it comes before us which I think justify some criticism. The first to which I should like to refer is the fact, as it .appears to me, that although this Bill -refers in one or two clauses to making arrangements with the States, its general tenor seems to disregard certain existing facts with respect to the collection of statistics by the States. For example, the Bill takes power to collect statistics relating to factories and mines. The fact is that in all the States these statistics are -already being collected, at least as efficiently, and certainly much more economically, than the Commonwealth could collect them on its own account. The States in connection, for example, with factory legislation, have all the machinery and the officers who can get, and. who do get, all available information from time to time. If the Commonwealth proposes to disregard all this work, -and collect information for itself, it will certainly not get it any more fully, and, equally certainly, the information will be found very much more expensive. should show more clearly that existing agencies are to be utilized-existin g agencies, the efficiency of which has been proved, Act-a t any rate, while the present Minisand the economy of which is recognised. If , for example, in the States of Victoria or New South Wales, it is proposed to collect all the factory statistics by means of Commonwealth officials, instead of by State officials, we shall inevitably duplicate a great deal of work and information, which is absolutely necessary to the States, for the purpose of carrying on their administration. we should confine ourselves to collecting and collating the information gathered by the States. Instead of the Commonwealth creating a bureau for collecting information, there ought lo be a central statistical -staff for the purpose of dealing with information already collected, and making the necessary calculations. I must confess that I am much surprised to find it proposed that the census shall be taken whenever so directed by the Governor General. To take a census of Australia costs ^120,000, if we are to judge by past experience ; and are we to leave expenditure of this kind to be determined by the Governor General, meaning that a census shall be taken whenever the Executive Government of the day chooses? preceding appropriation. intended by the clause, and say frankly that there shall be a census in each tenth year, ending with the figure one in 1911, and so on? The States have always considered this matter, which involves so much expenditure, as of sufficient importance to justify the passing of special Acts, every ten years. But we, in our political laziness-that is the only name I can give it-pas s everything on, even a matter of this kind, to the Governor General, which means the Ministry of the day. This measure should, undoubtedly, prescribe one of two things; it should either provide for the next census, or it should . provide for a periodical census, and say in what year it shall be taken. I admit that the day cannot be named as in the case of the States; but we could prescribe that the census shall be taken in 1911, and every ten years afterwards on such days as may be appointed/ by proclamation. This Bill gives a power for which there is no need' a power which Parliament should not The measure give to any Executive. Really we are, nowadays, coming to such a pitch in regard to legislation that all we want is a short try is in office-settin g forth that the Governor General may make regulations, prescribing how the powers vested in us by the Constitution are to be exercised. That would save a great deal of trouble, so far as Parliament is concerned; but I do not know whether Parliament is prepared to thus let its power go. There are many matters in which it is inevitable that power must In a matter of this kind, be delegated to the Executive, but my view of legislation by regulation is that power should never be so delegated unless in order to do something which Parliament cannot do itself. In this particular instance, certainly, Parliament can deal with the matter itself. After all, the Bill is nothing but an enabling measure, and it gives the public very little or no information about the census. The Bill, in effect, says that there mav be appointed a .Commonwealth Statistician, and that a census may be taken whenever the Government choose that the Government may,",18,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

41,Mr Mccay,"If so, why not do what iscollect statistics as they determine, and may make regulations for carrying into effect the power we give to the Ministry. That is not legislation of the kind that this or any Parliament ought to pass. Wherever possible, powers should be defined, methods shown, and particulars given. It is only where the complex character of the modern political state renders it impossible to foresee and arrange for all details that the power of delegating legislation, or legislation by regulation, should be exercised. If we compare the last Census Act of New South Wales or of Victoria with this Bill, we are struck at the outset by the meagreness of this measure. The provisions should be more full in every way. The Bill consists of a series of clauses, which, without exaggeration, may be said to end with the words "" as may be prescribed."" There is far too much prescribing, and far too little legislation; and I hope, therefore, that in Committee the Minister will accept amendments-because, unless amendments are accepted, it will be quite hopeless to attempt to carry them-so as to make this measure fuller, as it ought to be, and more like an ordinary Census Bill, instead of merely a measure authorizing the taking of a census and the collection of the necessary statistics. I do not wish to delay the Bill from getting into Committee, but I desire to say here and now that it is altogether too brief. In their attempts at brevity, the Ministry have succeeded in leaving out most of the matters that should find a place in a measure of the kind. If the Ministry will allow this skeleton-for it is little else-to be clothed with flesh in efforts to bring about economy una proper legislative way, it will assist the passage of the measure through Committee, and make it more in accordance with the traditions of legislation to Â»which we are accustomed than is this recently acquired method of passing everything on to the Executive. The latter is not the duty of Parliament; on the contrary, it is the duty of Parliament not to leave matters to the Executive except where such a course is inevitable. Parliamentary control is disappearing day by day, and inevitably so in some cases; but it should be our duty, where the step is not inevitable, to see that we do not let go our legislative authority. I do not desire to delay the passing of the measure, and I therefore content myself with these very few words on the motion for the second reading. that, as usual, the efforts 'of the House in dealing with this measure will be left to those who sit on this side. It really seems as if the burden of discussing the measures introduced by the present Government were left entirely to honourable members on these benches. There is a stolid power on the other side which does not at any time assume an intellectual phase; it is simply a physical, dense power of carrying anything or rejecting anything which it does not think it necessary to discuss. This measure is one of the most interesting that could be introduced, and one on which I am sure there cannot be any sort of feeling in reference to the different political parties in the House. It is a practical, business question of very great moment and considerable difficulty. We must all recognise the fact that the subject forms one of the troublesome problems of the Federal power. There must be a number of questions which are interesting to the States and not interesting to the Commonwealth, and a number of questions that are interesting to the Commonwealth and not interesting to the States; and from that simple state of things arise a number of difficulties. Some vigorous action will have to be taken, or we shall find ourselves, in the exercise of this power of dealing with census and statistics, duplicating public expense, instead of effecting economies. Federation has, I think, beer* an intense disappointment in many respects, but in no respect more than in the failure which seems to attend both Federal and State authorities in their der the new order of government. Unless some happy change comes over the relations between the two powers, unless there is some exercise of greater wisdom than we have seen on both sides in reference to questions of difficulty, this Department of Census and Statistics, instead of proving a means of public economy, will lead only to further extravagance. The first thing which must be recognised by the States authorities is that, whether wisely or not, the people of Australia have handed over this work-and a very important work it is-of census and statistics to the Federal power. The States Governments must be aware, and I trust will frankly recognise, that this business is one which has been handed over to us, that we must do our duty in establishing this Department, and",19,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

43,Mr Reid (East Sydney;,"1 supposethat we have the right to suppose that when we do establish it they will make use of it, and will accept the situation in such a way as to reduce the public burdens. It might very easily be, unless there is some wise mutual arrangement and understanding, that we shall launch the people of Australia into a very serious expenditure in connection with this matter, and that instead of getting efficiency, certainty, and continuity, we shall produce nothing but friction and confusion. No one has shown, a greater desire to study the susceptibilities of the States Governments than I have done. I do not think any effort is wasted in the endeavour to establish good feeling amongst those administering the powers of government in the States and in the Commonwealth, because I believe that is a first condition to the bringing about, of a better state of things. But with every desire to stretch forbearance and consideration, I have come to the conclusion that in this matter it is the nexion with this Department. If we reduty of the Federal Parliament and Government to take this Department over, and not to hesitate to carry out this duty. Unless we take this Department over with a determination to make it something like a national Department, unless we are prepared to emulate the success of the American people or the people of the mother country in connection with their Statistical Departments, we should do better to let this matter alone. I will strengthen the hands of the Ministry in every possible way in the establishment of a Department worthy of the importance of the subject. The expression ""census and statistics"" is a dry one, and to a large number of minds it suggests very little, but to those who are aware of the value and usefulness of good statistical systems in reference to the affairs consideration of this matter with a false of nations, the control of this Department will be looked upon as one of the most important departures of the Commonwealth. If it is well established it ought to become a tower of strength to the Australian, people, year in which that census should be taken? especially in the way of showing in a true and clear light and in a convincing way the real strength and variety of resources and the prosperity that exist in this part of the world. I believe that a proper statistical display of the facts of the Commonwealth to-day would be. of immense service in every part of the globe, and would do more to dispel idle, silly prejudices and slanders than anything else that could be mentioned. The rock on which the whole project may be shipwrecked is the want of a good understanding between the Commonwealth and States Governments, but perhaps even more dangerous than that would be any sign of weakness on the part of the Commonwealth Parliament or Government in dealing with this important matter. I submit that we have no right to take up this matter unless we intend to deal with it thoroughly. We have no right to take it up in the light of there being six or seven Statistical Departments in Australia, or in the way of adding a Statistical Department to the six that exist to-day. Our determination should be to establish this Department on such a foundation that it will be looked to by the States Governments for help in the collection and tabulation of information which may be of even greater interest or importance to the States than to the Commonwealth. On the other hand, we cannot forget that the Commonwealth Government must look to the States Governments to a very large extent in conquired to establish Commonwealth agencies in every State, in order to get all the information which it would be proper to get for carrying out the work of this Department. I admit that the expense would be ruinous. We must look, to a very large extent, to the help and co-operation of States Governments, in the use of States officer's, in order to secure any sort of economy in connection with this matter. I quite agree with my honourable and learned friend, the member for .Corinella, and other honourable members who have spoken, in their general criticism of this Bill. No doubt, it is a measure in which the line of least resistance has been followed all through. I am afraid that unless it is braced up in some way, and is made more definite, we shall begin the step. Take that one most important, but very simple, question, as to when the first Australian census should be taken. What conceivable doubt can there be as to the If we go to any other period than that suggested by my honourable friends; if we go away from the year 1911, what will be the result? All our statistical and census information which has been collected on the basis of ten year periods will be useless, and there will be no basis of comparison provided. Let us suppose that we determined to take our census in 1908 instead of 1911. All the vast mass of information which we have, and which would serve as a basis for proper comparison, and would o6 preserve the continuity of the statistics of the States, would be destroyed by that one simple blunder. I am sure the Minister qan have no idea of fixing any other year than 1911. The honourable and learned gentleman, in giving a reason for not fixing the date, used these wordsIt is intended to have a decennial census here, but provision is made and the manner set forth in clause 10That is a provision that the Governor General can name the timepending negotiations with the States for the transfer of the Statistical Departments to the Commonwealth, or some other arrangement under which tlie statistics of population may be collected by the Commonwealth. When we recollect that we are in the year 1905, and that the next census cannot be taken for six years, it will be seen that we shall begin in a most abject way, if it is presumed that we cannot within six years, between 1905 and"" 1911, come to some sensible arrangement with the States about the taking of the census. Clearly, the Commonwealth Government must take the .census. It is impossible to have any arrangement under which the six States will take the Australian census. We might get the advantage of the assistance of the six States in taking it, but the Australian census must be taken by the Commonwealth Statistical Department. What a ridiculous development it would be to have a Commonwealth Department of Census and Statistics, and yet have the Australian census taken by six different States Departments. The thing would be ridiculous. We must have a census in the year 1911 and. every tenth year following, and the Commonwealth Government must carry it out. It must be really a Commonwealth census. These things being so, why cannot the measure be explicit on a simple point about which the slightest controversy is impossible. We have been told that' the regular census costs about ;Â£i 20,000. tion only ? that great expenditure should not be incurred more often than once in ten years. If some extraordinary event, of which I cannot conceive the possibility, should make it advisable to take a census at some irregular period, it would be proper for the Ministry of the day to bring down a special Bill to obtain the sanct.'.in of Parliament to so unexpected and expensive Census and [RE PRE SE NTATIVE S.] Statistics Bill. an innovation. Therefore, I strongly urge that clause 10 should be made to contain a definite provision in reference to the time of the taking of the census. The honourable and learned member for Corinella seems to think that it will be difficult to fix the precise day; but to my mind there would be no difficulty. taken on a Sunday. Wales and Victorian Acts which provided for the taking of the census of 1901 inr those States, there was the provision that the census should be taken on Sunday, 31st March, of that year, a'nd in a general Act the provision might read ""On the last Sunday in the month of March."" proclamation. portant matter, but I think that it is important that the census should be takenin or near to the month of March. Is there /not a provision in the legislation of the mother country providing for the taking of the census in. March? taking of the census is the subject of a special Act on each occasion. last English Act, that the day fixed is the day which was fixed i'n New South Wales and Victoria. followed the English legislation. in March would be the best day to provide for as a uniform arrangement, Sunday being the most convenient day of the .week for a purpose of this kind. Although the Minister mav wish to leave the fixing of the. clay of the week and the month of the year to a proclamation, I feel sure he will meet the view I have expressed by putting the year beyond doubt. We can at present compare the period between 1891 and 190a with the preceding decennial periods 1881 to 1890, 1871 to 1880, i86x tp 1870, and 1851 to i860, and the holding of a census at an irregular period would throw everything into confusion, and upset the basis, of comparison. We should, however, fix. the taking of the Commonwealth census for periods which would fall in with not only the decennial periods of the States, but also those of the mother country.

I have not had time to look at any but the New South Wales Act. tically in line with it. particulars of information required to be set out in the householder's schedule should be stated in the measure, though I would not object to the Executive of the day being allowed to add to them. would be a grave responsibility to place on any Ministry to ask it to construct the householder's schedule. a perpetual irritation in some quarters which will be aimed against the Ministry; but if Parliament itself decides what partiin. If the Government seek certain inculars shall be required, there can be no political controversy on the subject, and no grievance against the Government which happens to be in power at the time of the! taking of the census. I believe thatsore feeling is created at these times by the asking for information in regard to a number of particulars, and I strongly urge the Minister to follow the lines of the last New South Wales Act in stating, in the measure itself, what particulars shall be required for census purposes. that the Bill should set forth the particulars of information which we consider essential in regard to the taking of the census, though I shall not object to the Executive having power to add to them. There is no such schedule of particulars in the Bill. I refer to the New South Wales Act with great confidence, because it was drawn up by the then Government Statistician of the State, Mr Coghlan, who, it is matter of common knowledge, is an eminently able and experienced statistician. Althoughi t may be a troublesome thing to determine what particulars are indispensable in the taking of a census, and to embody them in the Bill, such a course will save a great amount of trouble in the end. census are one thing,, and the general statistical information which it may be thought desirable to get. another. The New South Wales Act-No. 65 of 1900-provide s for the obtaining of information other than that stipulated for in regard to the census. ing of the census are of a permanent character, and are therefore perpetual. Sections 13 and 14 set forth a large number of matters regarding which there cannot be the slightest doubt that information is desirable. I admit that the expressions in clause 16 are very wide and cover an enormous field, but I doubt very much, after looking at the other sections, whether they contain provision for all the information I hold the view tliat the that we should collect. For instance, on casting my eyes over clause 16, I do not think that the provisions in paragraph e as to "" agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, dairying, and pastoral industries,"" would It enable us to obtain information which I think about as valuable as any that we could procure, namely, with reference to There will be the land tenures of the States. Moreover, we all know the grumbling that prevails when troublesome returns have to be filled formation, without the express authority of the Act, they will be blamed for asking for more than is required. People will say: "" Why do the Government prescribe this?-the Act does not prescribe it ; Parliament did not prescribe it, and yet this meddling Government is requiring information upon an additional subject, and is unnecessarily worrying us."" No matter what Government may be in power, it will have a thorn in its side, if it I suggest acts in that manner. The effect of clause 16 would be this: Many persons would argue that Parliament never intended that information should be collected upon the very important subject. I have mentioned, or otherwise they would have expressed that intention. It is a very important and large subject, and it would be contended that inquiries with regard to it did not suggest themselves to Parliament when the clause was passed, because, whilst details with respect to horticultural and viticultural subjects were set out, no mention was made of land tenures. If we defined nothing, the position would be more satisfactory. If we define anything, we shall be bound to mention the larger questions which are present to our minds, and I look upon inThe particulars required for the formation with reference to the land holding of Australia as of the utmost consequence. I mention this merely as one of a large number of matters arising under clause 16, with which the Minister is, no doubt, familiar. I must confess that I cannot understand clause 21, which proIts provisions for the takvidesNo person shall be liable to a penalty for omitting to state the religious denomination or sect to which he belongs or adheres. NowI could understand a provision which left out all reference to information with",22,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

55,Mr Reid,"regard to religious denominations. I could understand a provision of some other kind in reference to this matter, but I cannot see the utility of obtaining information with regard to the religious beliefs of the people unless it is to be complete. We should incur large expenditure in obtaining information with regard to the religious denominations of the people, and the value of the returns would be destroyed if a number of persons declined to state the denomination to which they belonged. out the provision altogether, because a man who does not belong to any denomination is always permitted to say what he does, or does not believe in. He may describe himself as a free-thinker, or an unbeliever, or state that he does not believe in any denomination or any religion. always means of enabling a man to state honestly the denomination to which he belongs, or that he belongs to none at all. What conceivable reason could a member of the Church of England, or of the Presbyterian Church, have for being ashamed to say that he belonged to such a church ? He might say that he was brought up as a Presbyterian, or a Catholic, or an Anglican-bu t no longer believed in any religion. But what person, who acknowledged himself an adherent of a church would decline to say that he belonged to that particular denomination? It is not as if any pains or penalties attached' to the statement of a person's belief. penalties.

Of course, sometimes a board proves a failure. Sometimes one begins with the highest expectations that a board will be everything that it should be, but he may in'the end meet with a series of disappointments. The intention, however, in such a case is a good one, and I have always been very glad that ' I took the course indicated in New South Wales. I cannot quite agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie, but if there were any truth in his statement, the disadvantages would probably operate in both ways. No one has a right to see the census returns or ,to inspect the householders' schedules.. It is not as if a man's schedule of his family affairs were published to the world. It is absolutely confidential, and the householder represents merely a figure in a large total. If the schedules were posted in the police courts, to permit of their inspection, We might as well rule and any disadvantage attached to a man's religion, some pains or penalties might be visited upon him, but nothing of the kind could operate in connection with the census, where nothing but the grand total is given. I should think that information with reference .to the religious denominations of the There are people is as valuable as that which would be collected with regard to a number of pther items. bound to state his religious denomination. bears the appearance of being very inquisitive, but I think that religion is one of the last subjects with regard to which the people would resent inquiries.

I submit that we should either have a provision for obtaining complete information upon this subject, or none at all. quiry-quit e as much so as are a number of the matters mentioned in clause 16. I I think that my honourable confess that, at present, I do not quite follow the Victorian precedent, which seems to have been adopted. I shall be very happy indeed, to help the Minister in every possible way in the consideration of the Bill. The task is a very delicate one, and will call for a great deal of careful management.

63,Mr Reid,"That would hold good alsothat this Bill is one of immense importance to the whole of Australia. In considering it, the question which occurs to my mind is, "" Are we to duplicate the expense to which the taxpayer is already subject in connection with the compilation of statistics?"" At the present time statistics and census returns are collected by the various States Governments, and I should like to know from the Minister whether he has made any arrangement with them to take over their Statistical Departments, or whether it is merely intended to create a Commonwealth bureau, thereby doubling the present expenditure of the taxpayers in this direction. We must recollect that in the various States these Departments are very well conducted. Indeed, in New South Wales, the Statistical Department is most admirably managed. Prior to Mr Coghlan becoming Agent General for that State, the statistics which he presented for the whole of the Commonwealth were accepted as most reliable. Before we are asked to agree to this Bill, it is the duty of the Minister to tell us whether the States authorities have been consulted in regard to it, and whether they are prepared to hand over the control of their Statistical Departments to the Commonwealth Government. If they are willing to do that, my opposition to the measure vanishes at once; but if they are not, I must emphatically protest against the passing of a Bill which will result in the creation of a new Department that can serve only the purpose which is already being served by the Statistical Departments of the States. I have only a very few words to say upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill, although I do not at all under-estimate its importance I think that the suggestion made by the last speaker is one to which the Minister, in replying, should address himself, although I observe that he has already done so to some extent in moving the second reading o""f the measure. I understand that no decision has been arrived at in regard to taking over the Statistical Departments of the various States. In this connection the Minister distinctly statedOf course we could negotiate with a view to every State tabulates itsfiguresin a totally taking over the States Departments. I understand that, as a matter of fact, Coghlan in preference to other Statistithe Commonwealth Government have alcians is that he presents his information in ready been in negotiation with the States upon the subject, and that the latter, without exception, have very directly and emphatically replied in the negative to ""all such overtures. take over the work of collecting statistics, and thus to duplicate expense? right that we should undertake the collection of statistics for the Commonwealth. I confess that I do not like the way in which the Bill is drafted. It assumes far too much the independence, of each State in regard to the collection of statistics. I do not think that the Minister should have paid such extreme regard to the concurrent powers of the States and the Commonwealth in this connection. I think he should have framed this Bill purely as a Commonwealth measure. If there is one matter more than another which ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth Government it is that of the collection of statistics and the taking of the census. member suggest that the work can be better performed by the Commonwealth than it can by the States? that it can be better performed by means of Federal machinery' than it can by the concurrent machinery of the States. One has merely to notice the great difference which obtains between the methods that are adopted in the various States to be satisfied upon that point. I presume that nobody will deny that there is a very great difference between the methods which are followed in .Victoria and New South Wales. Why is it that in this House we do not quote statistics other than those of Cog/dan? Nobody ever dreams of quoting the other Statisticians. Why? Because Coghlan produces a 'superior book-supe rior from the point of view of the way in which its information is tabulated. cept statistics which are compiled by the other States. aware of that.

Similarly, very valuable information is presented to us in the monthly sheets which are supplied by Western Australia. But there, again, a different method of compiling ""that information is adopted. Why should this be so? I venture to say that if we had one central bureau operating under the control of the Commonwealth, many thousands of pounds would be saved to the States, and we should be able to furnish them with statistical information which would be quite as handy, from a reference stand-point, as that to which' we are accustomed in New.

Whilst we must always pay more or less regard to the prejudices of the various States-to their traditions, and to anything which makes for their local patriotismI say that their mere jealousies ought not to prevent us pursuing a course which we clearly see will be for tbe ultimate benefit of the Commonwealth at large. I quite agree with the honourable member that we ought not to duplicate the burden which is at present imposed upon the taxpayer in regard to the collection of statistics. But we ought to legislate upon this question, and we ought to establish our own Statistical Bureau without paying any heed to the local prejudices of the States, to which constant reference is made, by implication, in this Bill. desire to consider their prejudices is written large all over the Bill. seems, indeed, to be almost apologetic to the Sjtates. Wentworth has expressed a contrary opinion. always anxious, particularly in the present position of the Federation, to preserve States' rights, I think that this is one matter regarding which we ought to consider,, not so much the local jealousies of the States, as their welfare as a whole.

86,Mr Joseph Cook,"I think so. Letissue. Victorians have quoted their own statistics to prove conclusively that in the protected, industries of this State, prior to Federation, much higher rates of wages were paid than were ruling in' similar industries in New South Wales. On. the other hand, the free-traders of New South Wales have proved conclusively from the statistics of that State that the rates of wages were much higher in New South Wales than they were in Victoria. If we had had a common set of statistics for both States, arranged by the one compiler, there would not have been anything like as many points of difference as have existed for many years. the mere manipulation of these statistics would have settled the fiscal problem. It does not rest in the last resort upon an analysis of statistics, or anything of the kind. I do say, however, that we should have less of the constant wrangling that we have witnessed between, the Statesi f we had a common set of figures, dealing with our social and industrial development, emanating from the same source, and that that source ought unquestionably to be a Federal one. I therefore think that, if we regard the matter from the view point of the collection of industrial statistics, or from viding for any matter necessary or convenient any point of view whatever, the argument is wholly in favour of centralizing the control and unifying the work throughout the whole of the States. I can understand some local jealousy at the suggestion of the surrender of some of Tasmania's powers in this respect, because that State has a very able compiler of statistics. In some respects, I think that Mr Johnston is tlie equal of Mr the Commonwealth, it ought to be on the Coghlan, and there can be no doubt that he is a very able statistician. That being so, we may understand readily enough that there may be some tardiness on the part of Tasmania in surrendering these powers to the Commonwealth. But, so far as I recollect the correspondence-and I am speaking now only from memory-whe n the proposal was put by the Commonwealth Government to the different States, it was referred to the Statisticians for report, and they, without exception, vetoed it. That was only to be expected. Why should they veto themselves practically out of the independent control of this work? Most of them, of course, would still be required just as at present, but there would be less of the detailed work to be done by them than there is at the present time. If the Commonwealth took over this matter, most of the States Statisticians, in my opinion, might also with advantage be taken over. They could be made States inspectors in some such way as we have States inspectors under the Public Service Act. As to the detailed work of collecting and compiling statistics, a great deal of labour could be saved by unifying the control. Much of the labour now involved in the collection of statistics is due to the Federal reference that is constantly necessary. We know, for example, that nearly all the statistical compilations of the States contain comparisons with other States. That involves immense labour, and it is in this respect particularly that a great saving would be I do not pretend to say that effected by a common collection of statistics, and a common control and presentation of them by one central office. I trust that before the Bill leaves the Committee the Minister will see whether we cannot take a great deal more power in this respect than that for which provision is made in the tentative little measure-the halfhearted measure I had almost said-that he has presented to the Chamber. Let us refer for a moment to clause 8, which provides thatThe Governor General may enter into any arrangement with tlie Governor of any State profor the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to this Act and in particular for all or any of the following matters :The clause then goes on to provide that all the information we are seeking power to obtain under this B ill may be supplied to us through State sources. If we are going to have a central bureau of statistics for basis of economy in the present order of things; it ought not to contemplate the perpetuation of the present costly services which are now rendered to all the States. On the whole, Australia is, perhaps, better served in the matter of statistics than is any other country of which I know. One has only to turn to the Canadian Year Book to see the immense advantage which we enjoy in this respect over Canada. publication ? plication of figures in the wav of tabulation does not seem to give us the prosperity and reputation, industrially, socially, and otherwise, which the people in Canada are enjoying just now. But of all the countries I know of, Canada is the one country as to which it is difficult to get information concerning industrial and social",26,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

88,Mr Joseph Cook,"Yes. Our multimatters. most difficult thing possible, I think, to learn the rates of wages in its iron industry, or in its coal-mining industry, or in other industries. Its industrial statistics are of the most meagre order ancl kind. I think that where Canada spends jQi on the collection of statistics, we. in Australia, must spend nearly Â£5. from the question as to whether we spend too much, or too little, an opportunity Is here afforded for effecting a great economy to the! taxpayers of Australia. Our course ought to be very clear and definite, and that is to set up an industrial bureau, and place upon the States the responsibility for the duplication of the work if they so desire. The States have been asked to entrust the Commonwealth with the collection of statistics, and the doing of the work, and they have all replied, ""No,"" emphatically. But that, I venture to say, should not end the matter at all. have simply appealed to interested persons to surrender some of their vested interests, ancl, of course, they have replied ""No."" One wonders why the Premiers of the States have, as I think, so weakly passed on the reports of their officers with their own indorsements. There does not seem to have been any attempt made to seriously negotiate the matter at all, or even to seriously consider it. All that has been done has beep courteously; to pass on our reference to them, get the answer of interested statisticians, and send it on to us with their own endorsement. is an obligation upon the Federal Government to take a further step, and not to let the matter end in that perfunctory way. They ought to furnish serious reasons, together with estimates, to the whole of Australia. It ought not to be a difficult matter to furnish an estimate for each State showing the possible saving amongst other advantages by the transfer of this work to the Commonwealth. I think that if we could show that a saving of say several thousands pounds a year would be effected in each State,"" the States would very soon want to know why it was that they were incurring this expense, while the work was also being done under Federal control. Having Dassed certain laws affecting all the States particularly in their industrial relationship having granted a sugar bountv, framed a common Tariff, passed a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and done a dozen other things of a like kind1 Mr Joseph Cook. For instance, it would be the surely it ought to be the aim of the Commonwealth to collect our industrial and social statistics, and unify them as .far as possible? That could be done, I think, if the Government were to proceed in the rigbt way, and treat the matter as if they were in earnest. I never saw anything more weak than the action of the GovernQuite apart ment in their negotiations with the States on this subject. I think that, even now, if the Government would, look about them, they could get a competent man to report upon the whole question, particularly with a view to showing what saving could be effected by the unifying of the process. I am sure that a man like Mr Coghlan would give the Government an estimate in that regard, and I am inclined to think that public opinion would soon do the rest when it was seen that the States were wasting money in what I cannot help thinking would be a wanton way. At any rate, that We is a matter for the States to consider. I do not know who is responsible for the 'gingerly fashion in which the Bill is drawn. My criticism may or may not apply to the Minister in whose charge it is. I do not know to whom it applies, but whoever drew the Bill has treated the States in far too gingerly a fashion as to a matter which, in its very essence, is one for unification of control and operation. ber think that tbe Minister has treated the House properly in asking for two diaThere metrically opposite powers, namely, the power to remit to the State and the power to carry out the work himself? I am only looking at clause 8, which gives the ""Minister ""power to talk nicely and appealingly to the States on 'this matter. power to do what he likes.' as I entered the Chamber, the leader of the Opposition was referring to the omission' of some matters from that clause. I understood the right honourable gentleman to be referring to the. need for collecting statistics as to holdings and land occupation generally. thought it should be expressly set out in the Bill, but his objection is met by the provision for statistics in relation to agriculture and industry.",27,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

93,Mr Groom,"He mentioned that he will have to alter the wording of the Bill if he intends it to cover holdings, tenures, and all that kind of thing, It is a matter of almost supreme obligation on our part to collect statistics showing the trend of settlement. For instance, nearly all the States are passing a mumber of measures for closer settlement, and measures which have to do with the social amelioration of the people, beginning at the point of settlement upon the land. If I am not very much mistaken, while the States are doing this legislative work in a small way, the process of aggregating large estates is proceeding out of all proportion to their efforts in the other direction. Take, for instance, the case of New Zealand. The Government of that Colony have been buying estates at the rate of ,Â£750.000 a year for the last ten or twelve years, but in spite of that effort in this great Colony, which is supposed to be at the very apex of our social and industrial community, 500 persons own one-half of its alienated lands. I am afraid that the same process is in operation in Australia, that for every estate which is bought and cut up for the people, estates are being formed in a greater ratio than the efforts of the States to reduce the size. has been the case in -recent vears. believe, to-day. If the honourable member will investigate the figures, he will find that for every estate that is bought and cut up, two or three estates are made by the process of aggregation which is going on. and 1898, while land was cheap, but it has not occurred since then. quoted the case of New Zealand, where, after ten or twelve years' experience of this radical land policy, 500 persons own one-half of its alienated lands. a few years ago? I am speaking from memory. contrary in Victoria. great need for a common compilation of statistics bearing upon this particular matter. If we had the figures tabulated, we should be able to discover whether we were doing good, and, if so, to what extent, by the social legislation of the various States; we should be able to see which State and which method was tackling the problem in the best way, and what further improvements, if any, were required. That is a matter of the utmost consequence to Australia at the present time, in view of our efforts in the direction ""of social amelioration. I think that statistics on such a subject ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth of Australia, and ought not to be left to the various States. Then take our systems of internal taxation. If the Commonwealth had absolute control, statistical information on that subject could be tabulated. We should get, for instance, tabulated statements of the direct taxation of the various States, showing at a glance, in one table of figures, what methods were adopted right through the whole gamut of internal taxation. Again, with regard to the count of the heads of the people, I understand that at present, by reason of an understanding arrived at between the Statisticians of the various States, the census is taken on a uniform plan. But there is no guarantee that the same method is adopted as to' details such as would be possible if one authority had control. There may be a common understanding between the heads of the statistical branches of the States, but there is no guarantee that a common method is followed in detail. We have seen the importance of this subject only recently in connection with another matter, to which I may not refer just now. There has been great diversity of opinion even in this Chamber, as well as in the States, in consequence of statistics 1895 being collected upon different bases. I think we should go to the very root of these differences and sources of friction if we handed over the whole subject to the common control of the Federal Government. I therefore offer these remarks in the hope that, before this Bill gets through Committee, the Minister will see his way to make it very much more far-reaching than it is, and that he will set up the authority of the Commonwealth, and desire to exercise it, without all these continuous and gingerly references to the States. say a word about the'Bill before the motion for the second reading is carried.

The honourable member seems to think that the Bill is an indication of an intention to override and disregard the States. orable member said that it was an illustration of a tendency to override the powers of the States. But the honourable member for Parramatta takes a different view. His idea is that we are treating the subject in too gingerly a fashion. ference between my view and that of the honourable member for Wentworth. is a good deal of difference between the two views. The idea of the honourable member for Parramatta is that we should deal with this subject, and should exercise our powers in a firm and decided manner. honourable member for Wentworth that either clause 8 or 16 should be very much modified. learn that there is harmony, between the views of the honourable members. The view which I take of what.is intended is this: That there are certain matters within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and that for the exercise of those powers it is absolutely essential that we should have statistics dealing with trade, exports and imports, navigation, and population. The intention in passing the Bill is that the Commonwealth will exercise these powers, and will take over those matters which are essential to the exercise of its jurisdiction. But it is recognised that the States have concurrent-powers in dealing with matters of statistics. It is recognised that they have concurrent powers of legislation-that at least they have individual powers of legislation on State matters-and that they mav for their own purposes require to have their own information prepared in their own way. Several of the States desire, and state that they intend, to retain their own statistical branches. The Bill provides that the Commonwealth shall appoint a Statistician. It is to be hoped that we shall get the very best Statistician possible for the position. That Commonwealth Statistician is to proceed to take such steps as are essential for the exercise of. the national powers of .the Commonwealth. But it is recognised that the States have certain powers of legislation of their own, as to which they may desire to have their own local statistics / and our desire is that if the States will not give up those powers, instead of double-banking, the Commonwealth shall try to work with them, and see if we cannot act at least uniformly in connection with statistics that are required by the Commonwealth concerning State matters. that in the Bill. powers that are necessary, and the provision can only be framed in that way. We cannot dictate to the States, and say that they shall do certain things in respect of their own particular powers of legislation.

Of course, we have power to do all this, independently of the States, but, at the same time, our desire, as has been suggested, is not to take a high hand, but to work harmoniously with the States andina fairspirit. Commonwealth matters must always be pre-eminent; and we must reserve to ourselves the right to colobtain that uniformity which is essential lect information in the manner we deem best for our own purposes. Some criticism has been levelled at the principle of the measure, while other observations have been directed to details, which would, perhaps, be better considered in Committee. There are one or two points in regard to which I should like to give some indication of my attitude, because they are in regard to matters of a general nature. In the first place, it has been suggested that there should be fixed periods at which the census shall be taken. When introducing the Bill, I announced that it was my desire that there should, and hope that there would, be fixed periods, my words beingI t is intended that the Commonwealth census officer in charge m each State. shall be decennial. I used the same words in regard to another measure. My sole reason for putting the matter in that way was that we might negotiate with some of the States in which Acts have been passed dealing with the taking of the census.; but, so far as I am concerned, I see no objection to providing in the Bill that the census shall be decennial. The other point mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong had already been receiving my attention with a view to the inclusion of a provision of the kind suggested in the Bill. That is, a provision providing what details shall be included in the householder's schedule. I find that there is a similar provision in the States Acts, and also in the English Act; and, undoubtedly, when the schedule had been prepared under the Bill, it would have contained all these details. A conference of Statisticians was against the idea of having a householder's schedule, such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane, included in the Bill, and favoured If the States desire to simply the inclusion of the heads of the inquiries. I am prepared, however, to have drafted a clause providing for the inclusion of these details, with others which may be prescribed; and that is in accordance with the view expressed by the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney a while ago. The honourable member for Wilmot was very anxious lest the States should, in this matter, be overlooked altogether-les t the States were going to be "" double-banked."" As I have already pointed out, the desire is, while leaving the States to exercise the functions which lie within their power, to at the same time so exercise Commonwealth functions as to for Commonwealth purposes. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause3 (Definitions). in my opinion, is hardly comprehensive enough. For instance, by clause 7 it is proposed to appoint enumerators, collectors of census, and collectors of statistics; and I suggest that we ought to have some definition of these terms. "" Collector "" has a technical meaning under the Customs Act, and there might be a danger of the collector in each State being thought the in that. fied on the point, I shall say no more. well, I think, to include definitions of a number of other expressions used in the B ill ; and in this connection the definitions in the New South Wales Act are worthv of attention.

134,Mr Wilkinson (Moretonvi Agree,"the honourable members for East Sydney and Corio with regard to the necessity for more complete definitions in this clause. Every one who has had occasion to consult the statistics of the various States, must know how difficult it is to arrive at a proper -conclusion with regard especially to the conditions of industrial life in those States. The definition attached to the word "" factory "" is a notable cause of this difficulty, as it means one thing in New South Wales, another in Queensland, and yet .anothei? in Victoria. We require some assurance that the Commonwealth Statistician, .in making his calculations, has had a common basis on which to work. When the Statistician tells us that there are so many factories in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, we shall require to know that he does not refer to one thing in connection with one State, and to quite another in dealing with some other State. Honourable members will remember how difficult it was during the very long discussions which we had on the Tariff in the first session of this Parliament, td recqncile the figures produced by honourable members representing particular States in support of the fiscal policy they advocated. The arguments adduced in support of free-trade in New South Wales, and of protection in Victoria, supported as they were by statistics which were not compiled on a common basis, were rather misleading than convincing.

Bill has a reference to the taking of a census, and the two measures are distinctly related. The two Bills are very closely related in some of their functions, and that makes it the more necessary that there should be a definition of the word ""census"" in this clause. In the New South Wales Act the census provided for is defined as "" an account of the population of New South Wales,"" and I think that the census covered by the provisions of Part III . should be defined in similar language. I therefore move That the following words be added : "" ' Census' means an account of the population of the Commonwealth of Australia."" ister of Home Affairs) I do not think that there is any need for the definition.

143,Mr Joseph Cook,""" Census,"" in the meaning of the word ""census."" According to the dictionary, ""census"" may mean either "" a registered statement of the particulars of a person's property for taxation purposes,"" "" an enumeration of the inhabitants of a State or country taken by order of the Legislature,"" or ""any official enumeration of the population."" These definitions cover the collection of statistics relating to property, as well as to the number of the population, although the Bill makes a distinction between the two meanings. I think that we might with advantage adopt the New South Wales definition. adoption of this definition affect the right of the Department to collect the ordinary information collected at census time in addition to making an enumeration of the population? used in the Constitution. is so wide that we think that, as Part III . be set out. of the Bill deals specially with the taking of "" a census "" the word should be defined in this clause. limit the meaning of the word; they will not extend it. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -Any attempt to define the word "" census "" will lead to a result which honourable members wish to avoid, by limiting its meaning. If we define ""census,""' we must go further, and define ""statistics."" a census of the Committee now. [Quorum formed.""] Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The meaning attached to the word "" census"" is a much wider one than that suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta. It is commonly accepted as including an enumeration of the people, together with the collection of information relating to the occupations they follow, their wealth, and everything connected with their social and other conditions in life. I think we might very well accept the word in its ordinary meaning. If we attempted to define it, we should have to follow a similar course -with a number of other words employed in the Bill. I see no difficulties in connection with the Bill, and I think we might proceed with it a little more rapidly if the Minister will consent to adopt the very reasonable suggestion that he should fix a date for the taking of the census. the decennial periods. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I think there should be some uniformity between our census arrangements and those in other parts of the Empire. agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta that we should define the word "" census."" We should derive no benefit from adopting such a course, but, on the other hand, might expose ourselves to unnecessary risks. The word ""census "" is used in the Constitution without any definition, and consequently the meaning attached to the word in that connection would apply also to the word as= used in the Bill. Any definition that we might adopt would not enlarge the meaning of the word, but might limit it. The definition clause, however, is not sufficiently comprehensive. It is necessary that the meaning of the word ""occupier"" should the Victorian definition. to adopt a definition of the word "" factory,"" which occurs in clause 16. a definition of that word. will be necessary to define ""mining,"" but the phrase "" productive industries generally "" is a very vague one.

DoI understand that the clause will berecommitted if it appears to be necessary to honourable members on this side of the House? Minister, so far as his promise to recommit is concerned. that.

162,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"amendment so much as the drafting of the Bill. The limitation which I seek to put upon the word '' census '' is intended to fit the Bill. In clause 11 it is explained what the enumeration of the census will consist of, and a great distinction is made between the taking of a census and the collection of statistics. If the word ""census"" used in the Constitution is intended to have the wide application suggested which I do not deny-wh y are any limitations adopted in the Bill? Part III . sets forth exactly what the taking of the census means, and in Part IV. it is provided that the Statistician shall collect annual statistics. In Part III . the taking of the census is called "" the taking and collection of the census,"" and in Part IV. it is provided that statistics shall be collected annually. Those are widely different terms. Bill seeks to limit the taking of the census to the counting of the population of the Commonwealth, and therefore I do not see why the definition clause should not contain a clear limitation of the meaning of the word. unfortunate if we limited the meaning of the word "" census."" The Minister might have cleared the way if he had explained that he would in some later clause provide that the census should include particulars as to the age, profession, occupation, religion, and education, of the people and regarding the number of rooms in each dwelling, and the number and description of the live stock. It would, be a pity to limit the meaning of the word ""census."" honourable member. enough to cover all the information which he desires. propose to make provision for the collection of that information?

This clause is dealing with Commonwealth affairs. The Commonwealth embraces' a very large area, and the Government may require an important function to be discharged or inquiry to be made locally by a responsible person. It is desired that an important inquiry should be intrusted to only a competent person, with the approval of the Minister. The honourable member for Wentworth referred to the importance of having a person of some responsibility to deal with these matters. This work can be done only with the express approval of the Minister, and a delegation of necessity implies a specified and limited power to be exercised by the delegate. delegation than to appoint a man within the meaning of the Act. delegation may be granted may be a public officer. wished certain inquiries to be made. A State officer might have a special delegation of a limited nature granted to him, but if no such person were available, a Federal officer might be selected for the purpose. When dealing with the affairs of the nation in a country covering such a large area, it mav be desirable that a particular inquiry should be made under a special delegation, and that is the reason for the clause.

It was only put in to contrast the permanent officers with the other officers. I am prepared to omit it. that the Minister drew attention to the contrast between clauses 6 and 7, because the appointment of temporary officers who may be temporarily employed for years without a break, as collectors of statistics, is to be made by the Minister, not even ou the recommendation of the Commonwealth Statistician. The contrast has indicated that clause 6 is unnecessary, and that clause 7, in its present form, is highly undesirable. Clause negatived.

That sub-section reads as follows :Notwithstanding the provisions hereinbefore contained, the Governor General, if it appears in draftsman doing that he did not look up the public interest to be desirable so to do, may in the case of temporary work in the carrying out of any public work or scheme, order that the temporary employment of all or any persons employed upon such work or scheme may be continued until the completion of the same; and unless otherwise ordered by the Commissioner or the Permanent Head, any person may be temporarily employed by the Chief Officer in the Government Printing Office, or in the preparation of the cenclause for greater precaution. sus, for such time as may be necessary. understand that it will not be necessary for the name of any' one desiring temporary employment under the clause to be on the Public Service Register? great difficulties, indeed, in carrying out a census if we were to insist that the names of the persons to be employed as sub-collectors in remote parts of the State must be on the Public Service Register. the Minister will not give too much away without fully considering his course. is all right. I cannot understand why the Minister gave way in reference to these clauses. If may happen that if the appointments are made under the Public Service Act it will considerably hamper the Department in collecting the census. It may be necessary for some of these officers to be continuously employed, but if they are appointed under the Public Service Act they cannot be appointed for more than nine months consecutively under any circumstances.

What was the the Public Service Act, instead of wasting parliamentary time by putting in a clause which was absolutely unnecessary? When the Minister speaks in that way he is simply passing a vote of censure on one of his own officers. move appointments from political influence. It is desirable also, if it could be done, to abolish other influences which affect appointments. The present system is not working too well. Cases have arisen in which even Ministers could not, owing to the red-tape methods of the Public Service Act, obtain officers for special duties. It is strange that neither of the two different arrangements for making appointments provided in these clauses suit the Opposition. Surely, if they disagree with the appointments being made under the Public Service Act, they ought to be satisfied with the proposal to confer that power on the Minister. take a different view from that which has just been expressed by the honourable member for Coolgardie. If ever there was a matter which should be placed outside the control of Ministerial action, it is that of the collection of the statistics of the Commonwealth. I cannot conceive of any work more vital to the interests of Australia and to the purity of our public life than the proper collection of these statistics. Does the honourable member think that the Minister dught to choose the officers to make an enumeration for the electoral purposes of the Commonwealth?

He presented night after night different sets of statistics, bearing the inividual collector for each constituency. He tials of some unknown officer, and when we challenged him to authenticate them by having them initialled by the Chief Electoral Officer, he declined to do so. On the basis of those figures, which, as events proved, were fallaciously furnished to him, the great scheme for the redistribution of the it ridiculous. It would be absolutely imelectoral power of the Commonwealtha work which should have been carried out years ago-wa s postponed, and it has not yet been dealt with. We were told that a drought was devastating the larger portion of the Commonwealth, and that in normal times those who were then forsaking the country electorates would drift back, with the result that the electorates would be naturally redistributed upon their old basis. But subsequent events have proved every statement then made by the Opposition, and have shown that every assertion made by the Minister on the basis of the figures which he submitted to us-figure s which could never be authenticated-wa s incorrect.

The man who selects the labour necessary for the performance of this work should be one to whom no reproach could attacha man who has no interest to serve except that of telling the truth, and telling it in the most open way. Our experience has been of such an unfortunate character that we ought to take the most complete steps to change the method of compiling these statistics. can best be done by deputing the work to an independent authority. We shall know, at any* rate, that there is no danger of political influence in connection with these appointments, and that the details in connection with our electoral matters and in all matters affecting the welfare of the State are managed in a way that is pure and above-board. standing the eloquent speech of my honourable friend, the member for Parramatta, I think there is a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for CoolThe gardie. Honourable members must recollect that the collecting of the census is temporary work. In most of the States, the practice has been to appoint some indiappoints a number of sub-collectors. These sub-collectors work for a few days in distributing and collecting the papers, and they only get a few pounds out of it. To put the work under the control of the Public Service Commissioner would be to make possible to collect the census in a remote and scattered constituency like that of the honourable member for Coolgardie, upon the plan recoirlmended by the honourable member for Parramatta. In a district, which is comparatively scattered, like my own electorate, the only reasonable practice is to allow the head of the Department to have practically a free hand to select whom he likes, and for the persons selected to appoint sub-collectors. submit that the honourable and learned member for Wannon has furnished no reason against the suggestion which I put forward. Is not the honourable member aware of the extent to which the Public Service Commissioner controls employment at present? There are thousands of temporary hands under his direction. In respect to the outlying portions of the country, I should say that there will be enough public officers to do the work without temporary hands being employed. Additional labour will be needed only in the centres of population. have to travel hundreds of miles in my electorate. will have to do that will be public officers, whose duty now is to travel round in conThat nexion with other matters. ber's proposal cannot be worked. cause it has been done.

210,Mr Joseph Cook,"It can be, beshoulders of the Minister there cannot be much objection to it. the position to be that the Minister has agreed to allow clause 7 to be omitted from the Bill, because the taking of the census and the means of securing the enumeration in connection with it, are provided for in the Public Service Act. Let us abide by the law. We want to have the enumeration free from all party bias, religious bias, and bias of every kind. I earnestly hope that the Minister will stick to his proposal. Let us have a responsible officer, whose duty it will be to see that proper men are secured for the work throughout the Commonwealth. the Minister must see the happy effect of giving attention to the-suggestions of honourable members opposite. friend is converting several members of the Opposition into admirers by accepting 1 amendments from them. I want him to accept one from me, which will probably be followed by the same result. Clause6 has gone out of the B ill ; and properly gone out. It is not wanted. But it has rendered us a very good service. It has, by contrast, directed our attention to clause 7'. I suppose that there is no one who does not agree to the proposition laid down by the honourable member for Parramatta, that in all these questions connected with the census statistics, upon which our political representation depends, upon which a large number of questions depend in the Government of the Commonwealth and of the States, we should have at least the ordinary safeguard of the Public Service Act. I wish to refer to section 40 of that Act, and to point out that by the use of loose words a very extraordinary state of things arises. Special reference is made in the section to the Government Printing Office and the preparation of the census. We have the safeguard that the chief officer in the Government Printing, Office has the power of appointing these temporary persons. Unfortunately, the words with reference to the census leave the appointment in the hands of the Minister. able gentleman look at sub-section 1 ? The clause is sufficient to entitle the Commonwords in the earlier part of the clause wealth to the results of the collections govern the last sub-section. can read the section in that way, I am should like to see the Bill amended in quite willing to do so. porary hands can be continued by the chief officer until they have prepared the census. can be placed on the clause, because, otherwise, the appointments would have been in the hands of the Minister, and no Minister would desire any sort of patronage in connection with the Public Service. It is gratifying to know that the power lies with the Chief Officer, who is the Commonwealth Statistician, and, under these circumstances, there is a safeguard under section 40. The effect of clause 7 appears to be to give the Minister absolute patronage in the appointment of temporary officers; and surely that is a position which no Minister would desire. being struck out. My honourable Clause negatived. Clause8 (Arrangements with State Governments as to execution of Acts). Mr ""McCAY (Corinella) I draw attention to a source of information which does not appear to be covered by this clause. In Victoria, and, I believe, in other States, a considerable proportion of the statistics is collected by the municipal councils under the provisions of the State Local Government Act, which requires that the information shall be furnished in this way. Under this method, the municipalities act as the collectors of the statistics, which practically cover the whole of the agricultural and pastoral interests. This is a very valuable service, conveniently rendered at comparatively small cost; and in States which are completely covered by municipalities, the collection is quite thorough, though in other States, where municipalities are scattered, the whole ground cannot, of course, be covered. I do not think that the clause quite covers the right of the Commonwealth to these statistics, except they be obtained by the indirect method set out in sub-clause c. I should like to see the States municipalities continue this work under arrangement with the Commonwealth. make arrangements with the States Departments for the supply of this information. m'ade by the municipalities under the this particular.

219,Mr Mccay,"I doubt whether thenot include the information collected by the municipalities? This valuable source of information is utilized to great purpose in the States; and I think it ought to be taken advantage of by the Commonwealth.

At present the returns required by the States -are submitted to some central State authority. For instance, Railway Commis-sioners or a Harbor Trust may be constituted one of the bodies from which information is required, and all the returns thus affidavits or declarations. furnished are sent to a Department of the State Government. In the same way, I presume, the information obtained from municipalities is centralized, and I think it could be obtained by the Commonwealth from the States Departments. Of course, it would be necessary to look at the States Acts, in order to see the class of information that is supplied. formation supplied by the municipalities in Victoria practically covers the whole of the scribed form,"" that is a declaration under agricultural and pastoral interests. Victoria called upon to send in that information ? doubtless sent to a centralized State authority, from which it could be obtained by the Commonwealth under sub-clause c. I presume, however, that the honourable and learned member for Corinella thinks that it might be necessary for the Commonwealth to obtain this information direct, and that we should, therefore, consider whether we have power to do so. I promise to look into the matter; but I think that under clauses 16 and 17 the Commonwealth may obtain the information. Clause agreed to.

The first schedule of the New South Wales Census Act, No. 65 of 1900, provides the following form of oath :I, tor [or collector] under the Census Act 1901, for the [district or sub-district] to which I have been appointed.

[Enumerator or Collector, as the case may be.] Hade and subscribed before me, at this [Justice of the Peace or Commissioner for Affidavits.] Surely there can be no objection to putting a similar schedule into this Bill. Such a form of declaration would cover all public servants acting under the measure.

I have a pretty good knowledge of the Acts providing for the taking of oaths by public officers on entering upon the performance of their duties, and, so far as I am aware, the form of such oaths is always provided for in the schedules to the Acts requiring them.

As the honourable and learned member for Coriday of 1901,nella has pointed out, those who draft Bills for this Committee have found that nothing is loo slipshod for the people they have to deal with. Two absolutely unnecessary clauses were inserted in the Bill, although the provisions they contain are in other statutes: but there has been neglect to provide a necessary form of oath.

That stood the Minister aright, his reason for wishing the clause to be passed in its present form is that it may be necessary to adopt different declarations for different classes of persons. quire different declarations for different purposes for different persons, and relating to different duties. every officer executing any power or duty under the Act shall make a declaration in accordance with ""the prescribed form."" That is, one prescribed form, and one declaration. ""All persons appointed' to collect or distribute schedules or calculate figures will be required to take an oath of secrecy and fidelity in the discharge of their duties. If the Bill be passed as it stands, I venture to. say without any hesitation that when the regulations are drafted, there will be but one form of declaration. The Minister did not indicate the conditions which would render two forms of declaration necessary, and his mere allegation that ""different forms may be required is answered by only a moment's consideration. With every respect to the Minister, I venture to submit that he is now taking up an attitude of firmness for the mere love of doing so. Having said "" No,""' he apparently intends to adhere to his negative, despite any argument that may be advanced in the contrary direction.

279,Mr Groom,"There is no form preor twelve schedules at the end of that Act, in which every step that has to be taken is prescribed. In every Census Act the form of oath to be administered is set out. The conduct of the Minister upon rhe present occasion is all of a piece with that adopted by his colleagues in connection with other Bills, which we have been called upon to consider. Perhaps it is a new inspiration on the part of the Attorney-General to make the measure merely a skeleton one, containing loose vague powers, and an abundance of references to "" prescriptions,"" and to set up the Minister as the person in authority who is to impart life and movement to the whole concern. I do not think that Bills ought to be drafted as loosely as this measure appears to have been. We ought not to vest such immense powers in the Minister. Take the Commerce Bill as an example. It has been so framed as to make the Minister of Customs practically a Czar, who may "" hold up"" the commerce of the country at any time that he thinks fit. Similarly in this Bill, we are asked to leave it to the Minister to determine what form of oath shall be administered to persons performing work under its provisions. I do not think that he should be allowed a free hand in such matters. At any rate, Parliaments all over the world have prescribed how these things shall be done, and. I do not think we ought to leave them, for the first time, in the hands of the Minister. The honourable and learned gentleman merely affirms that it may be necessary to vary this form of declaration. Why? If it is merely to be a declaration that an officer will do his work dutifully and secretly why should there be any occasion for constantly varying it? These powers are very definitely laid down in the schedule of the Bill, and particularly in Part IV., and consequently, I see no reason why the proposed departure should be made. regarding this Bill as a very important one. The information which it is proposed to collect under the powers conferred by it affects the very basis of our existence as a people. ,The reason which the Minister advanced against the amendment seems to me to constitute the very reason why we should insist upon the form of the oath being fullv set out in the Bill. Surely it is not desirable to leave it to the Minister to say that he believes it to be unnecessary to require an oath to be taken, and that, consequently, an affirmation will suffice, or to introduce other qualifications. At the same time, I think that it might be sufficient to provide that it shall be an ordinary oath. I trust that the Attorney-General will see his way to accede to the reaspnable request which has been made,. in order to insure that this measure shall be a workable one. I am most unwilling to assume that the Minister, from sheer obstinacy, opposes this proposal. He has already conceded; one or two propositions that must have appealed to his common sense, and it seems to me that it is not only reasonable but absolutely necessary that the form of oath to be taken by those appointed by the Commissioner to carry out this work should be provided in a schedule to the Bill. It is almost incredible that the Minister should continue to oppose this amendment.. The very reason that he has offered for desiring that the form of oath shall be as prescribed is an argument in favour of our insisting that it shall be made a schedule to the Bill. I trust that the proposal will be accepted. ter under discussion is not a very important one, but I feel very strongly that it is unwise to leave too much to be prescribed by regulations. Any one who takes even the most cursory glance at the Commonwealth Statutes must be convinced that we place more power in the hands of Ministers to frame regulations than does any other Parliament in the Empire. Time and again matters of legislation vitally affecting the liberties of the citizens are handed over to Ministers to be dealt with by regulations. Many of the most eminent jurists have pointed out the danger of the growjng tendency on the part of democratic Governments to take fiiom Parliament the power to legislate, and,' practically, by means of regulations, to vest it in the hands of an indivdual or a body of Ministers. Regulations which seriously infringed the liberties and civil rights of individuals might be made while Parliament was in recess, and they would continue to have the force of law until it reassembled and dealt with them. I have felt for some time that a great mistake is being made in leaving so much to be dealt with by regulations, and I intend, wherever I think it necessary, to object to this power being vested in a Minister. No principle",43,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

282,Mr Robinson (Wannon),"The matis involved in the matter now under discussion, and it should not be left to be dealt 1 with by regulations. Only such matters as cannot properly form part of a Bill or of a schedule to a Bill should be left to regulations. The form of oath to be taken by officers under this Bill should certainly be placed in a schedule to it. I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong that the taking of a census is a most important work. As a Scriptural scholar, he will doubtless recollect the very serious consequences that attended the taking of a census mentioned in the Old Testament. I do not know that the same result is likely to follow the taking of a census in Australia, but the less we leave to regulations the better. I lay down the general principle that legislation by regulation-whethe r it be a regulation made by a Minister, a shire council, or a Justice of the Supreme Court or of the High Court-is undoubtedly bad. Parliament, to my mind, is the only -authority. to frame legislation. We are gradually giving away our privileges and placing them one by one in the hands of individuals, whose regulations are as difficult to override in many cases as is an Act of Parliament. Regulations made by Ministers are drawn up without first being subjected to the criticism of Parliament, and I therefore think that we should give with a very sparing hand the right to Ministers to prescribe various matters in this way. hope that the Minister will concede the request made by the Opposition. It has been -stated that no form of oath is contained in any Act passed by this Parliament. I find, however, that a schedule to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill passed last session gives the form of oath to be taken by the President or Deputy-President of the CourtI , A . B ., do swear that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lord the King. . . and that I will not, contrary to my duty, disclose to any person any evidence or other matter brought before the Court. . . .

There cannot be any should be prescribed, so that there can be no doubt as to the way in which the duties of the officers should be carried out, at all events so far as secrecy is concerned. -The Minister in charge of the Bill has given his reasons for not agreeing with the proposed amendment, and at the risk of delaying public business more than it has already been delayed by some of my honourable friends on the other side, I wish to draw attention to a precedent. The leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Macquarie, were members of a Government in New South Wales which secured the passing of a Land and Income Tax Act. It contains sections upon which these very clauses have been based. There is nothing more inquisitorial-and it is justlv and necessarily so-tha n a Land and Income Tax Act. In the Act of New South Wales we find a precedent for the clause which is now complained of. means of improving the Act, surely we are not going to adhere to it? The honourable and learned member has changed his opinion every day on matters of administration. hollow are some of my honourable friends' objections. We are told that there is no precedent for this clause in any State Act; but I propose to quote a preredent which they themselves set. Section8 of the Act, to which I refer, reads as follows : The Commissioners shall, before acting in the execution of their office, take and subscribe, before a Police Magistrate or Justice of the Peace, such oath of fidelity and secrecy as may be prescribed, and such oath shall also be taken and subscribed by every other person appointed or employed under this Act before so acting, which may be administered to him by a Commissioner or any Justice of the Peace.

286,Mr Isaacs,"I wish to point out howbasis for the objections which have been taken here to-night, and I hold, with all respect to honourable members, that it is, I shall not say an undue waste of time, but an unfortunate taking up of public time, to raise all this fuss and bother about a matter which has already received the approbation of the leader of the Opposition in a great measure which he assisted to pass in. New South Wales, and which has been followed in the other States. fectly refreshing to hear the Attorney General getting, up with that confident judicial air of his, which is supposed to efface all differences of opinion as if by magic, and giving as the only basis of his opinion an Act for which I was responsible. This is the first time during the whole course of my parliamentary experience that he has before my shrine It has all the charm of novelty, but I feel so touched by the involuntary mark of approbation and confidence which he has shown, that I feel compelled to add a few observations. He does not courageously say that there has been a waste of time, but there is a sort of suggestion on his part that there is a waste of public time involved in this discussion? When the honourable and learned gentleman, who should be the guide and counsellor of the Chamber, is absent from his post, afternoon after afternoon, it is worse than a waste of time. learned gentleman ought to be the last person to say that, if it is true. able and learned gentleman to remember that there is something worse than a waste of public time. It may arise from an imperfect knowledge of the law, or the way in which Bills are framed, but there can be no excuse for that avoidance of public duty of which he is guilty time after time. think that the right honourable and learned gentleman can discuss that matter on this clause. at which I was passing 'away from the subject. I hope that what is left of the mental energy of the Attorney-General will be preserved for better purposes than that of But we might have expected a Government interrupting an honourable member, who has travelled 600 milesto be here to-day. He has only a mile and a half to travel from the Supreme Court to do his duty here, but he canndt get here. In spite of my advancing years, and ever-increasing weight, I have travelled hundreds of miles to do my duty to the public, but my honourable and learned friend cannot crawl up Bourke street when there is the least smell of a brief in the atmosphere. the superior manner in which the Attorney General addresses the Chamber. me. friend, whom I used to look upon as a soit of demigod, as regards manners and accomplishments, is nothing compared with bowed down and worshipped the Attorney-General. draw the attention of the right honourable member to the fact that the question before the Committee is the retention of the word ""prescribed."" to you, sir; but may I point out that whereas the Attorney-General, who has only to come across from the Grand Hotel, cannot get here, I have come hundreds of miles in order to endeavour to assist the Government in the improvement of their measures, which time after time are full of inaccuracies. The Land and Income Tax Act, to which the honourable and learned gentleman referred, is most inquisitorial, as all these Acts are. It was in that instance a matter of the greatest consequence that we should get an oath drawn up in wellconsidered phrases in order that the secrecy of that most inquisitorial department which deals with the incomes or overdrafts of the community should be absolutely preserved. At one time. I thought of appointing a Royal Commission in order to settle the terms of the oath, but I was able to light upon one which, fortunately, met all the circumstances of the case. However, inspire of the trouble that we took in New South Wales in order to get an oath that would be binding upon the consciences of those to whom it was administered, I regret to say that it was insufficient. There has been a number of cases in which I am afraid that oath has not been respected.",45,Census And Statistics Bill For Proposing One Or Other Of These Two Second Reading

297,Mr Reid,"I am very much obligedwhich' has, in its ranks, about the most "" squaring"" element we know of in Australia, to produce something like a parliamentary oath. We only ask them for one form of oath, but we find that they are not capable of producing it , and want to take time to consider it. we wish to secure in this Bill? wish to secure an oath simply to preserve secrecy about a lot of more or less harmless details. But my want of confidence in this Government is so complete that I wish to give the strongest possible reason for putting the form of oath in the Bill. I believe that if we do not put it in the Bill we shall not get an oath that will be binding administered at all. There are so many influences at work in connection with the ravenous appetite for high protective duties on the part of the two Ministers in front of me that I am not at all satisfied that we shall ever have an oath applied to these officers, such as Parliament itself would have framed. think that it is. very important that we should have high-minded men appointed to perform these most important duties How can we trust this Government to frame an oath which will be acceptable to the religious tendencies and judgments of all the estimable people we wish to see employed in connection with this measure? I do not trust this Government to the length of an oath. I should like to see the terms of the oath put in black and white, and considered by Parliament. But I wish to say this : That this Committee was proceeding with the utmost expedition with this Bill while it was in exercised a most useful influence upon this the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs. Suggestion after suggestion was made, which was received by the Minister with the. utmost courtesy; and I never saw a more t happy til appearance. of argument, quarrelling, and contention, and he brings the very atmosphere of a legal pugilist into this Chamber. what result? Minister of Home Affairs, who about an hour before was prepared to receive any reasonable suggestion, fell under the influence of the Attorney-General. We address the most cogent arguments to the Committee, and the Minister, who an hour ago received every suggestion we made with the utmost courtesy, and accepted I do not know how many amendments, especially from my honourable friend the member for Kooyong, [104] now changes his attitude. I wish here to bear my testimony to the intelligent interest which the honourable member for Kooyong has taken in this B ill . My honourable friend submitted a most important amendment. With what result? What do The Minister accepted it, and we shall have We by-and-by a clause which will stipulate, as ought to be done, for certain particulars in connection with the householder's schedules. As the Bill was introduced, there was not a single requirement as to anything which was to be put into any of these census schedules. But I have made up my mind that the Ministry are inexorable on this point j and I do appeal to my honourable friendsI desire to exercise any influence that I possess with them-to recognise the fact that we have exhausted every possible legitimate means of persuasion. I wish to signalize my appearance in this Committee by endeavouring to promote as much useful legislative work as I can, I but unfortunately the measures which are produced by this Government are so imperfect, so objectionable, seek to go so completely away from recognised lines of legislation, seek to put so much power into the hands of the Ministry behind the back of Parliament, that if we were to allow them to pass we might as well stay away from the House altogether. Honourable members might just as well get copies of the Bills by post, and: be asked to return a form to the effect that they are willing that they should be passed. There is the honourable member for Bass, who has Bill, and who has pursued a most impartial path. I will guarantee that he, in his heart, sees the absolute necessity for this vote. I am sure that my honourable friend, family than we ' were unin two minutes, would give us an oath that the Attorney-General made his would meet any emergency. If the MinHe comes from scenes isters at the table cannot choose between one oath and another, there are two or three of my honourable friends opposite who would With be prepared to give them any number of My honourable friend the oaths to choose from.

In sub-clause 2 of clause 12 it is provided that where a dwelling is let, sublet, or held in different apartments, and occupied by different persons or families, each part so let, sublet, or held shall will give us his assurance that the clause be deemed a dwelling-house.

I would point out, however, that an entirely new state of things in regard to residences has grown up in modern times. The expressions used in the present English Act were employed fifty years ago, but the occupancy of houses has been revolutionized during the last ten years. Fifty different tenants may be found in one hotel, .and we know that flats in city buildings are let out to large numbers of persons.

Under this clause the number of dwellings will be given quite independently of the number of families, and if we exaggerate the number of families we shall have the enemies of our country exclaiming, "" See how many people have to be crowded together in one house. There are so many thousands of families in Australia, and there are only so many thousands of tenements.""

Under the New South Wales Act it is the duty of the collector to assist occupiers to fill up the schedules only when requested to do so, and I thinlc that is the utmost to which any State Act dealing with this subject goes.

The,district is a scattered one, and if the various collectors had had to go to each farm-house, and assist infilling up the schedules, the cost of collecting the census would have been trebled. The position is doubtless the same in all country electorates. The practice usually adopted is to leave the schedule with the householders, and to collect them as soon as possible after the enumeration day. In that way, a minimum of time is occupied, and the expense to the community is correspondingly reduced.

I think it would be advisable to make it compulsory for the collector to assist in preparing schedules -only when requested to do so. The collection of the census would be a most expensive work, unless some such qualification were inserted, because, as the clause reads, each collector would feel himself compelled to see every return filled up. the amendment. posedThat after the word "" Collector,"" line r, the marksmen, how would .it be possible for words "" if requested "" be inserted. ought to be the duty of the collectors to see that the schedules are properly filled up. clause, as well as clause 15, will lequire them to do so. obligation on the part of the collector to see that accurate information is given in the schedules. They will form the basis of the whole of the statistics we are striving to secure by means of this measure, and too much importance should not be attached to the fact that the time and expense involved in making the collection may be increased by our requiring the collectors to assist occupiers to fill in the returns. If the amendment be made the responsibility of the collectors in this regard will certainly be reducedt of Home Affairs) -The point mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong is an important one, but I think his objection is fully covered by the latter part of the clause. All that the honourable and learned member for Wannon desires is that the collector should *not set out on his work with the idea that it is his duty to assist occupiers to fill in the schedules, whether requested to do so or not, practically forcing himself upon the occupier in the filling up of his form. If the amendment is agreed to, when the collector goes round, the occupier, if he is in a difficulty about filling up the schedule, can ask him for information as to how it should be done, and then it will be the duty of the collector to assist him. Further than that, it will be the duty of the collector, before he leaves the building, to see that the schedule is complete, and that he has obtained all the.information that is required. I think that the amendment meets the requirements of the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and does not interfere with the desire of the honourable member for Kooyong to'get the information accurately, collected. The census forms are required to be filled up on a certain day, and at a certain time. Suppose it was intimated to the collector when he delivered forms at certain places that his assistance would be required in filling them up, because the occupiers were the collector to be at all of those places at the same time, if requested? would only be when the collector went round to collect the forms previously delivered, and. found that the information was not complete, that he could render assistance. should make an interjection and not a speech. How would it be possible for the clause to work satisfactorily if the occupier had to wait until the collector went round to collect the forms which were required to be filled up on a previous day at a certain time ? Would it be an excuse for an occupier not having filled up his form on that date, that there was no collector present to give him the information that he required ? rupt. ing the question to theAttorney-General, because, earlier in the evening, the Minister of Home Affairs gave me an uncivil answer to a question. ister of Home Affairs did not answer my question courteously. question before the Chair, which is that the words "" if requested"" be inserted in the clause. before the Chair-and if you, sir, do not know your business, I will tell you-is permit any honourable member to make sucn a remark as that to the Chair.

I would prefer the Minister to devise the drafting of the amendment, because I have found on occasions-as I am sure the honourable gentleman will permit me to say without offence -that when an amendment is moved from this side of the Chamber we are often met with technical objections to one word. fess I do not find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Wentworth in the objection which he has raised. It is very necessary that the collectors, if they have cause to think that there is any error, intentional or otherwise, in the filling up of the form, shall, as far as they are able, make the return accurate before taking possession of it on behalf of the Commonwealth. The latter part of the clause is really necessary. Even the simplest forms, so long as they bear the appearance of being issued by the Government, strike terror into the hearts of some unsophisticated rustics. They lose possession of their ordinary faculties, and refuse to have anything to do with it without some official assistance. Probably it is the recognition of that fact which has led to this provision being inserted. But it might be advisable to leave out the words ""or person in charge,"" with a view to bring the clause into harmony with the preceding one.

Clause 15Every person shall, to the best of his knowledge and belief, answer all questions asked him by a collector touching any information required to be filled up and supplied in the householder's schedule. Penalty : Ten pounds. this clause follows State legislation in making it penal to refuse to reply to the questions. But I remember that when the Census Act was first introduced in England numbers of people raised religious objections to it. refusal to answer questions about religious belief. Numbers of people refuse to answer the census questions at all. It will be remembered that there was a time in Old Testament history when the numbering of the people brought a plague upon the children of Israel. Numbers of people in England who read the Scriptures literally therefore regarded a census as an offence. They thought that England was going to immediate destruction in consequence of the passing of the Census Act, and sermons were preached against it. It was held that punishment would be brought upon the United Kingdom for the national sin that was being committed.
