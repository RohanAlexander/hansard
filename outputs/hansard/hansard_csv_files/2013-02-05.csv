As far as the opposition is concerned this I will go through some of the reasons that is not a matter of ignoring food security in the decision to withdraw from IFAD was developing countries. Our view is that taken in 2004.

As the few developed countries in the world Robert Lucas famously said, once one starts with high mineral wealth and have useful to think about the human welfare involved in lessons to teach developing countries about these great issues, it is hard to think about the effective extraction of those resources in anything else. I think it is important in this a way which enriches the whole population. place that we do not just speak about the Our second comparative advantage is in quantum of aid, important as that discussion dealing with fragile states.

But our view is that IFAD tractor for every 56 hectares.

I will not seek to issues identified in 2004. We were in no repeat all that was said by those members, better position to evaluate its expenditure, but I acknowledge their historic experience which included human resources and in this area, particularly in the previous financial management.

Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: LGSS Pty Ltd (ABN 68078003497) is an APRA-regulated superannuation trustee. Pursuant to section 56 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, APRA is precluded from disclosing information disclosed or obtained under or for the purposes of a prudential framework law and relating to the affairs of a regulated entity, where the information is not already in the public domain. Carbon Pricing (Question No. 424) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 15 June 2011: (1) Has the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) assessed the likely impact of the Government's proposed carbon tax on Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs), including loan delinquency levels, and whether ADIs would have adequate capital to cover increased delinquency levels; if so, what assessment was undertaken, and what was the outcome. (2) Has APRA requested that ADIs examine the likely impact of the Government's proposed carbon tax on their loan books, and whether they would have adequate capital to cover increased delinquency levels; if so, what requests were made, and what was the outcome. (3) What scope is there for APRA to increase the capital adequacy minimums imposed on ADIs to cover the potential increased risk of default from both the residential and commercial loan books arising from the proposed carbon tax. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: APRA has not specifically assessed the potential impact on ADIs of the carbon pricing mechanism nor has it requested ADIs to undertake their own assessments. APRA generally only assesses the impact of external influences on ADIs where, in APRA's view, there is likely to be a material adverse impact. Given that the carbon pricing mechanism has only been in place for a short period , it is premature to consider whether the carbon pricing mechanism will have a material impact on ADIs' asset quality. Carbon Pricing (Question No. 425) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 15 June 2011: Has the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) assessed the likely impact of the Government's proposed carbon tax on the superannuation industry, including superannuation invested in shares in, and retirement funds exposed to, the energy, manufacturing and mining sectors; if so, what assessment was undertaken, and what was the outcome. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: APRA has not specifically assessed the potential impact on superannuation funds of the carbon pricing mechanism nor has it requested superannuation funds to undertake their own assessments. APRA generally only assesses the impact of external influences on superannuation funds where, in APRA's view, there is likely to be a material adverse impact. Any potential impact on superannuation funds would be mitigated by the generally well-diversified nature of investment portfolios. Australian Stock Exchange: Compliance and Risk Management Practices (Question No. 490) Mr Oakeshott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2011: (1) Will the Government consider re-establishing the education fund that used to exist under ASX's stewardship, and that also served to channel revenue from fines imposed for breaches of trading rules into improving compliance and risk management practices to prevent further breaches. (2) Is he aware that the education fund more effectively used monies from fines than the current system (under new ASIC supervisory arrangements) of directing them into consolidated revenue. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) ASIC is already delivering a wide range of consumer and investor education, for example via our MoneySmart website, our printed publications and our outreach work. The MoneySmart website aims to help ordinary Australians take steps to improve their personal finances. It offers free, independent guidance so people can make the best choices about their money. The site has around 320 pages of user-friendly content. Topics covered include managing money, borrowing and credit, superannuation and retirement, investing and scams. The content for investors includes in particular information on investing basics, financial advice, investment warnings and borrowing to invest, as well as content on various investment products such as managed funds, shares, property and complex investments such as derivatives, exchange traded funds, CFDs and hedge funds. MoneySmart also has numerous interactive calculators and tools to help people take control of their finances. The calculators include a budget planner, super calculator, retirement planner and mortgage calculator. The online content is complemented by a number of targeted publications on a range of financial topics such as investing (our 'Investing Between The Flags' booklet), superannuation and credit, which provide essential information, action-oriented tips and contact details for other relevant organisations. We also issue a monthly MoneySmart newsletter and regular 'consumer alerts' on topical issues, as well as contributing editorials and articles for magazines issued by e.g. ADF, ASA, ATO and a range of seniors publications. (2) Most of ASIC's consumer and investor education activities are part of their business as usual and are already funded from ASIC's general budget. There are two exceptions to this, where the Government has decided to allocate specific funding to ASIC for particular initiatives, namely: funding from the Companies Unclaimed Monies Special Account (CUMSA) to develop and build the MoneySmart website ($12.1 million over 3 years); and funding for the 'Helping Our Kids Understand Finances' initiative, to improve financial literacy in Australian schools by developing professional learning modules and digital resources linked to the Australian Curriculum ($10 million over 3 years). Superannuation Funds (Question No. 499) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2011: Can he indicate what proportion (as a percentage) of the Australian equity portfolio held by the following funds (a) Australian Super, (b) Cbus, (c) HESTA, (d) HOSTPLUS, (e) MTAA Super, (f) CareSuper, (g) LUCRF Super, (h) Media Super, (i) NGS Super, (j) TWUSUPER, (k) AustSafe, (l) Energy Super, (m) First Super, (n) legalsuper, and (o) REI Super, is constituted by investments in the top 500 big polluting companies that will be subject to the carbon price. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) does not currently collect data on the specific investments of superannuation funds. Superannuation Funds (Question No. 794) Mr Fletcher asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 7 February 2012: (1) What balances does UniSuper use to meet its obligations to members in its defined benefit scheme. (2) Which other industry super funds have a defined benefit scheme, and what balances exist to ensure that each fund meets its associated obligations to members. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All defined benefit funds, including UniSuper and any defined benefit industry superannuation funds, maintain a pool of assets that is used to meet their defined benefit obligations to members. This pool of assets is formed via the payment of contributions from the employer(s) of the members of the fund. Part9 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 requires, at least every three years, for an actuary appointed by the trustee to formally review the financial position of the fund to:  determine whether the size of the pool of assets is currently sufficient to meet the benefit obligations; and  to advise on the level of contributions required to meet the benefit obligations on an ongoing basis. The contribution rates required to be made by the employer(s) can vary over time depending on the actual experience of the fund. In practice, actuaries also regularly review the financial position of a fund, generally on an annual basis and/or when a significant event occurs. There are currently 15 'industry funds' that have defined benefit members. They are referred to as 'hybrid funds' in APRA statistical publications. Hybrid funds are superannuation entities that have a combination of both accumulation and defined benefit members. There are no industry funds that are solely defined benefit. Please refer to APRA's Superannuation Fund-Level Statistical publications for data on APRAregulated 'hybrid' industry funds. The publications are available of the APRA's website at: http://www.apra.gov.au/Super/Publications/Pages/superannuation-fund-level-publications.aspx Australian Taxation Office: Processing of Tax Refunds (Question No. 1018) Mr Oakeshott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 28 May 2012: (1) What are the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) compliance standards for the timely processing and returning of tax refunds for individuals and business. (2) Has there been an increase in the time taken by the ATO to process and return tax refunds for the 2011 tax year compared to previous years, and if so, why. (3) If the ATO is not meeting the required standards for the timely processing of tax refunds, what action, if any, is being taken by the government to ensure compliance with those standards. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has service standards in place which publicly state its service commitment to the community. The service standards for processing individual and business income tax returns do not differentiate between returns where a refund is due or the taxpayer will need to pay. The standards are shown in table 1, along with the ATO's performance against those standards for the past three years. Table 1: Performance against tax return lodgement service standards 2009-10 to 2011-12 Service standard 2011-12 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 benchmark performance performance performance (%) (%) (%) (%) Lodgments – we aim to process: Electronic tax returns for 94 86 83 91 individuals within 14 calendar days of receipt Electronic tax returns for non92 78 93 92 individuals within 14 calendar days of receipt paper tax returns for 80 93 94 86 individuals within 42 calendar days of receipt paper tax returns for non80 82 91 83 individuals within 56 calendar days of receipt (2) As shown in table 1 above, the ATO has significantly improved its performance for the individual electronic tax return service standard in 2011-12 compared to prior years. Individual electronic tax returns account for over 75% of all tax return lodgments. Combined, individual and non-individual electronic tax returns account for over 90% of all tax return lodgments. In the 2011-12 year, the ATO redirected resources into improving outcomes for the majority of individuals whose returns are lodged electronically, resulting in the improved performance. At the same time, the ATO continues to exceed its service standard benchmarks for both individual and nonindividual paper lodgements. (3) The Commissioner of Taxation has the responsibility of administering the taxation laws. He advised that for 2011-12, the ATO met the service commitment on 3 of the 4 service standards. The standard that the ATO did not meet was electronic tax returns for individuals within 14 days, which for 2011-12 was 91% against a benchmark of 94%. We achieved 94% in 17 days. The ATO is focused on releasing legitimate refund claims in a timely manner and pays interest on refunds delayed beyond prescribed periods and on credit amendments. Delays to tax return refunds can occur for several reasons including incomplete or incorrect information requiring the ATO to request additional information, cross checking of data with another Government agency and pre-issue compliance reviews. In relation to delays caused by compliance activity, the ATO, prior to issuing income tax refunds, uses specialist technology to analyse individual income tax returns to detect potential over claiming or fraudulent activity. In 2011-12 (to 30 June 2012), over 109,000 income tax returns were stopped for potential over claiming or fraud with around 80,000 of these requiring a full review resulting in the protection of over $200 million of revenue. The ATO is:  continuing to provide updates to professional associations regarding the progress of tax return refunds and listening to concerns raised on behalf of tax agents  refining risk models to reduce the number of refunds stopped and subsequently released without adjustment  improving our practices to more efficiently review held returns in a timely manner; and  communicating our processes and progress including notifying the taxpayer within 12 to 14 days after lodgement that their return has been held for review and when they can expect further contact from the ATO. Australian Conservation Foundation (Question Nos 1170 and 1171) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Disability Reform, in writing, on 21 August 2012: For (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, (d) 2010-11, and (e) 2011-12, what grants were provided to the Australian Conservation Foundation, including the amount, purpose, and program each was delivered under. Ms Macklin: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated received $20,000 across the 2006-07 and 200708 financial years from the Women's Leadership Development Pacific Women's Mentoring Program. Of this amount, $2,000 was paid in the 2007-08 financial year. Australian Conservation Foundation (Question Nos 1172 and 1179) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, in writing, on 21 August 2012: What grants were provided to the Australian Conservation Foundation, including the amount, purpose and program each was delivered under. (a) 2007-08 (b) 2008-09 (c) 2009-10 (d) 2010-11 (e) 2011-12 Dr Emerson: On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself, the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Nil (b) Nil (c) Nil (d) Nil (e) Nil Australian Conservation Foundation (Question Nos 1188 and 1189) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness, in writing, on 21 August 2012: For (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, (d) 2010-11, and (e) 2011-12, what grants were provided to the Australian Conservation Foundation, including the amount, purpose, and program each was delivered under. Mr Brendan O'Connor: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Please refer to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Disability Reform answer to question 1170 and 1171. Securency (Question No. 1219) Mr Robb asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 10 September 2012: In respect of media reports on alleged corruption by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) subsidiary Securency, (a) on what date was (i) Treasury first advised of Securency's alleged breaches of criminal law, and (ii) he first advised of this matter, (b) within what timeframe should matters of this gravity be reported to the Government, (c) is he aware that under corporations law, financial services licensees are required to report significant breaches to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission within ten working days, (d) has he referred, to the Public Service Commissioner or any other agency for inquiry and report, the RBA's delay in reporting this matter to him; if so, on what date will the outcome be made public, and (e) can he disclose (i) the nature of discussions he and/or his officials has/have had with the RBA since this matter was first brought to his attention, and (ii) any assurances he has received from the RBA, that there will be more timely reporting to the Government and Parliament of similar incidents, should they arise. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The matters under investigation occurred prior the Government coming to office. However, the Governor has briefed the Treasurer and his office appropriately on developments and the actions the Reserve Bank has taken. Many of these matters are still before the courts. The RBA is fully cooperating with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as part of these proceedings. Given the court's consideration is ongoing, it is inappropriate to comment any further. Infrastructure and Transport: Privately Contracted Security Employees (Question No. 1229) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 17 September 2012: (1) In (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, (d) 2011-12, and (e) 2012-13 (to date), how many privately contracted security employees at (i) the Sydney Airport freight terminal, and (ii) Port Botany, have been dismissed for criminal offences or because of criminal records. (2) Can he confirm that being a known or suspected member of the 'Bra Boys' criminal gang currently does not necessarily preclude someone from receiving a Maritime/Aviation Security identification card. (3) How many CCTV security cameras at Port Botany are operated by private companies. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) This information is held by the operators of the Sydney Airport freight terminal, and Port Botany as the employers of staff at the facilities. (2) Under current arrangements, an Aviation or Maritime Security Identification Card can be cancelled on the grounds of convictions against a prescribed list of relevant offences. (3) The regulations do not prescribe the use of CCTV; however port operators and port facility operators use CCTV to assist in achieving maritime security related outcomes at security regulated ports. Each port operator and port facility operator is responsible for the CCTV arrangements within their area of control as set out in their maritime Security Plans. Sydney Ports Corporation is the port operator for Port of Botany and holds the information you seek. Home Affairs: Operation Polaris (Question No. 1231) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) In (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, (d) 2011-12, and (e) 2012-13 (to date), which law enforcement and regulatory bodies have been found to have had members provide assistance to criminal groups (as referred to in Operation Polaris’ intelligence update of 20 February 2012). (2) For the same period, how many members of law enforcement and regulatory bodies have been identified by Polaris investigators as having aided criminal groups, and how many of these members have been (a) charged, (b) prosecuted, and (c) convicted, and of those convicted, what sentences were handed down. (3) Has there been a response from any Commonwealth law enforcement or regulatory body to the revelation contained in the Polaris report that some members of its organisation were providing assistance to criminal groups; if so, what was the response, and when was it received. (4) Since1 July 2008, has any Commonwealth law enforcement or regulatory body recommended to him that laws or regulations applying to those bodies be amended as a result of members of their organisations being found to have aided criminal groups. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The AFP does not disclose the identities of persons of interest in ongoing investigations, nor does it disclose details of intelligence product produced as a result of POLARIS related enquiries. (2) The AFP does not disclose the identities of persons of interest in ongoing investigations. There have been no charges, prosecutions or convictions to date from Polaris-based investigations. (3) There have been no cases identified of AFP appointees providing assistance to criminal groups, as outlined in the findings of the POLARIS report. The AFP remains vigilant for corrupt activity through its robust Integrity Framework. (4) No. Measures the Government is implementing as part of the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill are about ensuring our law enforcement agencies have the best tools available to prevent infiltration and corruption. The introduction of integrity testing and the expansion of the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity were recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The additional powers for the Customs CEO were recommended to me by the former CEO of Customs, to support measures undertaken within Customs to enhance the agency’s integrity framework. Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy: Commonwealth Grants (Question No. 1241) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department, and at what total cost. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department and at what total cost, and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Year Total Grants Total Cost 2008/09 35 $20,376,765 (1) (b), (c) and (d) This information is published and available on the department's website (www.dbcde.gov.au) as required by the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department and at what total cost, and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Year (as at 30/09/2012) Total Grants Total Cost Total Paid 2012/13 64 $46,559,258 $15,361,202 Commonwealth Grants (Question No. 1246) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department, and at what total cost. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department and at what total cost, and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) This information is published on the Department's website as required by the Commonwealth grant Guidelines. Energy Management: Commonwealth Grants (Question Nos 1247 and 1248) Mr Briggs asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department, and at what total cost. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department and at what total cost, and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Since1 July 2009, the Attorney-General's Department has published grant details on its website. Previously, grants details were published by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Each year, the Department publishes over 1,200 individual grants on its grants register. The register includes the value of each grant. For some programs the published value of the grant represents an estimate and the actual amount paid may be different. The Department's annual reports also provide annual expenditure information for each of its grant programs. To provide further information in response the questions asked would require an unreasonable diversion of resources, particularly in that the questions cover a five-year period. Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; Disability Reform; Housing; and Homelessness: Commonwealth Grants (Question Nos 1249, 1250, 1267 and 1268) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Disability Reform; and the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department, and at what total cost.

It is FaHCSIA policy to have funding agreements with all grant recipients; and (b) $41 million (excl GST) has been paid as at 12 November 2012. Commonwealth Grants (Question Nos 1254 and 1263) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, in writing, on 18 September 2012 : (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department, and at what total cost. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Minister's department and at what total cost; and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Mr Garrett: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Financial Year Number of grants approved Total value 2008-09 2,229 $2,816,047,211 2009-10 2,274 $1,979,553,572 2010-11 2,406 $882,505,341 2011-12 3,116 $808,639,177 2012-13 (1 July– 30 Sept) 703 $137,297,502 For the period 1 July 2012 to 30 September 2012 all 703 grants had signed funding agreements. The total amount paid to recipients during this period was $39,729,056. Rail Infrastructure (Question No. 1287) Dr Stone asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 30 October 2012: (1) Is he aware that travellers regularly face delays of up to two hours between Seymour and Albury on the Victorian section of the Melbourne to Sydney railway track. (2) What measures is he taking to have Australian Rail Track Corporation maintain this line so that trains can safely travel at normal speeds, and to prevent such delays in the future. (3) If repairs to the line are scheduled to take some time, what alternative forms of transport will the Government provide for the travelling public. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government is investing over $3.4 billion to upgrade the interstate freight network, including the rail line between Sydney and Melbourne. Overall, we have increased funding in rail tenfold compared to the then Federal Coalition Government. This investment is supporting the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) in performing a significant upgrade to the Sydney to Melbourne line by replacing the deteriorated life-expired wooden sleepers with concrete sleepers. This was a vital first step to improve safety and reliability of the line. The ARTC is also investing $134 million on a ballast rehabilitation program to address long standing drainage problems. ARTC is liaising with V/Line and CountryLink to put in place arrangements for affected passenger services. Foreign Investment Review Board (Question No. 1288) Mr Fletcher asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 30 October 2012: Further to his answer to question in writing No. 1137 (House Hansard, 9 October 2012, page P141), why is he unable to provide an update on the specific investment information he provided in 2010 (see question in writing No. 1314, House Hansard, 11 May 2010, page 3185). Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is unable to provide the data requested because it is too resource intensive to produce. It would divert staff away from their main role of analysing foreign investment proposals. Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (Question No. 1289) Mr Coulton asked the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in writing, on 31 October 2012: In respect of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder indicating on its website that it has purchased 17 gigalitres of surface water from the Namoi Valley, (a) does this water come from the Namoi River or the Peel River, (b) does this amount include the 5 gigalitres of environmental water from the Chaffey Dam Augmentation Project, and (c) can he provide the actual (not average) dollar per megalitre price of water from the purchases made since Mr Burke: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Of the reported 17.5 gigalitres of contracted Commonwealth environmental water recovery in the Namoi catchment (measured in long term average annual yield), 4.77 gigalitres is from water entitlement purchases made from the Namoi Regulated River water source. No purchases have been made from the Peel Regulated River water source. A further 12.72 gigalitres of water recovery in the Namoi is included in the watersavings contracted under New South Wales State Priority Projects. This volume is an estimate of the water savings from agreed projects. The specific volume and location of the water savings will be confirmed when the works have been completed. (b) The reported 17.5 gigalitres of Commonwealth water recovery does not include environmental water from the Chaffey Dam Augmentation Project. (c) The government has not purchased any water from this catchment since 1 July 2012. Disability Services (Question No. 1291) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Disability Reform, in writing, on 26 November 2012: Is it a fact that current disability service funding for clients would be 'grandfathered' in any transition to a National Disability Insurance Scheme; if not, why not. Ms Macklin: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The high-level principles for a National Disability Insurance Scheme agreed by the Council of Australian Governments provide 'continuity of support to people with disability currently receiving services to ensure that they are not disadvantaged in the transition to a National Disability Insurance Scheme'. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments will agree the specific arrangements for each launch site to provide continuity of support to people in early 2013, ahead of the commencement of launch in July 2013. Financial Assistance Grants (Question No. 1292) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 26 November 2012: In respect of the arrangements for Commonwealth financial assistance grants to local councils, (a) have there been any recent changes; and (b) have there been any reductions in the amounts that local councils expected to receive in 2012; and if so why, and what are the details. Mr Crean: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) There have not been any recent changes to the Financial Assistance Grants legislation. The amount of Financial Assistance Grants available from year to year is set by Commonwealth legislation, the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. At the end of the financial year, the Treasurer makes a determination of the final factor for that year and the estimated factor for the following year. The final factor is calculated on estimated Australian population figures, supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the March Consumer Price Index. The difference between the estimated and final factors for the current year can result in a positive or negative adjustment on the following year's allocation. Adjustments happen every year, some are positive and some are negative. A negative adjustment occurred this year. The previous negative adjustment happened in 2009-10. (b). Yes. The negative adjustment this year was $52.9 million. This was due to a reduction in the CPI figures as well as a downwards adjustment of Australia's population estimates after the 2012-13 Budget was delivered. The population adjustments were a result of more accurate counting methods used in the 2011 Census. Local governments are receiving their legal entitlement under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. Local governments received $2.74 billion in 2011-12, including the $52.9 million overpayment as outlined above, and $1.117 billion in accelerated payments brought forward from 201213 to assist local governments to manage the ongoing impact of the natural disasters in 2010-11 and other pressures. Defence: Personnel (Question No. 1293) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in writing, on 26 November 2012: Have the issues relating to compensation for illnesses suffered by defence personnel entering the fuel tanks of F-111 jets been resolved; and if not, what matters remain outstanding. Mr Snowdon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the 2010-11 Budget, the Government announced its acceptance of 14 of the 18 recommendations by the Joint Standing Committee and Foreign Affairs and Trade report ""Sealing a just outcome: Report from the Inquiry into RAAF F-111 Deseal/Reseal workers and their families"" tabled in June 2009. The Government also announced a funding package of $55m over four years to implement these 14 recommendations. Of the 14 recommendations accepted by Government, 10 were the responsibility of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), three were the responsibility of the Department of Defence (Defence) and one was a joint responsibility. DVA has implemented all 10 of the recommendations for which it was responsible and the joint responsibility (an F-111 specific website). DVA has ongoing work in processing claims for compensation and health care, and delivering F-111 client specific group lifestyle courses through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. The Department of Defence has implemented one recommendation (number 14) and has made much progress with the other two (17 and 18). These two are to strengthen Defence's occupational medicine capability (17); and to conduct a further research of the underlying cause of health conditions associated with F-111 fuel tank maintenance work (18). For the latter, the Jet Fuel Exposure Syndrome Study, launched in December 2010, is a multi-year study that is underway. High Speed Rail (Question No. 1294) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 26 November 2012: (1) Can he provide an update on the viability of high-speed rail between Brisbane and Sydney, and whether the location of stations at Taree and Wauchope remain under consideration. (2) In respect of Countrylink rail services on the North Coast, can he provide an update on any plans in New South Wales to (a) franchise, (b) corporatise, or (c) privatise these services. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The final report from the second phase of the high speed rail implementation study will soon be complete. The report is examining the preferred route alignment and station locations, capital costs, passenger and revenue forecasts, financial and economic viability and options for staging, financing and governance. The report will be released following consideration by the Government. (2) Countrylink rail services on the North Coast, and the prospective franchising, corporatising or privatising of these services, are a matter for the New South Wales Government. I refer you to the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP, New South Wales Minister for Transport. Australia-Ethiopia Adoption Program (Question No. 1296) Mr Bandt asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 26 November 2012: In respect of the Australia-Ethiopia adoption program, (a) for what reasons did the department close the program, (b) were there issues raised as a result of the November 2011 delegation to Ethiopia and internal delegation report that contributed to the closure of the program; if so, what were the issues, (c) how many approved applications can no longer proceed due to the closure of the program, (d) what support is the government providing to those affected by the closing of the program, as per the department's media release 'Ethiopia-Australia Intercountry Adoption Program closed' (28 June 2012), (e) to date, what sum of money has the Government spent on the program, and (f) did the department consult with affected families prior to the closing of the program; if so, how was the consultation undertaken. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (a) I closed the Ethiopia-Australia Intercountry Adoption Program (the Program) in response to the specific circumstances of the Ethiopian adoption environment, which is increasingly unpredictable, challenging and complex, as well as the Program's unique operational requirements. The reasons behind my decision include:  The Australian Government faced ongoing challenges in identifying orphanages in which Australia could have trust and confidence. The growing numbers of non-government adoption agencies operating in Ethiopia, and the closure of orphanages due to greater government scrutiny, led to increased competition for referrals of children to intercountry adoption programs. My Department found that a competitive environment such as this is not always conducive to ethical adoption practices.  The Program received stronger demands for community development projects to be delivered in the region from which children would be referred, making it increasingly difficult for the Australian Government to ensure such assistance would be delivered in a way that maintained an appropriate separation between the Program and children referred to it for intercountry adoption (in order to avoid the unintentional effect of encouraging communities to relinquish children for adoption).  The Program's funds were limited to fees paid by prospective adoptive parents, and the ongoing financial viability of the Program depended on a regular and foreseeable referral of children to generate these fees. Such referrals could not be guaranteed in the current Ethiopian adoption environment.  Rising costs for Program essentials (such as food and accommodation) in the 18 months prior to the closure meant that the Program could not continue to meet operational costs without significantly increasing fees for prospective adoptive parents. Even with an increase in fees, it was unlikely the Program would be viable into the future given Ethiopia's current inflation rates (approximately 20– 40%).  The Program's adoption service provider, Wide Horizons For Children, advised that, in light of changing circumstances in Ethiopia, it had decided to partially reallocate its resources and focus from adoptions to its humanitarian activities in Ethiopia. As a result, the Program and Wide Horizons For Children agreed to end their arrangement. Wide Horizons For Children provided essential ancillary and support services to the Program, including background checking and transition house facilities. Replacing Wide Horizons For Children or restructuring the Program would have required considerable expenditure of Government funds and resources which was not defensible in view of the other issues that would continue to affect the long-term viability of the Program. (b) Officers from my Department visited Ethiopia from 24 October to 6 November 2011. Issues identified during this delegation visit, contributing to the Departmental briefing that informed my decision to close the Program, included:  The continued strained relationship between the Australian Representative and the Program's service provider, Wide Horizons For Children.  The difficulty in engaging the relevant Ethiopian Authorities, despite best efforts, to discuss updates to the bilateral arrangement underpinning the Program's operation in Ethiopia.  The emphasis placed by federal and regional level Ethiopian government departments on the importance of receiving development assistance from the Program.  The difficulty in identifying orphanages in which the Australian Government could have trust and confidence. The delegation faced pressure from many orphanage directors it met with to provide additional aid when forming orphanage relationships. The delegation was concerned by the escalating requests from the Director of the Program's then Partner Orphanage for orphanage support payments and 'facilitation allowances'. (c) At the time of the Program's closure, there were 27 files that had been approved and sent to Ethiopia for matching. My Department does not have information about how many approved applications were in Australia waiting to be sent to Ethiopia; state and territory Central Authorities are responsible for processing and approving individual adoption applications. (d) In my media release announcing the closure of the Program on 28 June 2012, I noted that the Australian Government and its State and Territory counterparts would provide what support we could. As at 24 December 2012, my Department has refunded fees paid directly to the Program by affected applicants as expeditiously as possible, with all but two complete. My Department is waiting on the affected applicants to provide the necessary information to process the remaining refunds. My Department also continues to receive a high level of correspondence on this issue, and, where appropriate, seeks to provide additional information to correspondents about the Program's closure. Other support, such as counselling and consideration of other options for affected families, including discussion of other intercountry adoption programs or domestic care options, is being facilitated by state and territory Central Authorities. (e) The Australian Government assumed responsibility for the management of the Program on 1 July 2007. There was no specific budget for the management of the Program. Departmental staffing and travel costs funded by the Department as part of its management of the Program were met by the broader Departmental budget. It is not possible to provide an accurate amount of staffing and related costs for the Program as the level of staffing devoted to the Program varied over time. Since 2007, there have been eight delegation visits to Ethiopia, at a total cost (for travel and related expenses) of $226,456. Departmental funds have also been used to meet various costs associated with the Program's closure, including refunds of Program fees to affected applicants and a payment to the Program's Service Provider in settlement of invoices for services rendered (AU$194,325.40 in total to 24 December 2012). Fees paid by prospective adoptive parents directly to the Program met fixed and variable running costs incurred in the Program's daily operation and in facilitating each individual adoption. (f) Not specifically about the Program's closure. However, my Department provided the intercountry adoption community with regular updates concerning the Program, including meeting with representatives of prospective adoptive parents and providing updates through its website. In statements on my Department's website, the Program was referred to as 'consistently [being] Australia's most complex and challenging program' and it was often noted, with announcements of delegation visits, that the delegation would assess the ongoing ethics and viability of the Program. Tertiary Education (Question No. 1307) Ms Gambaro asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 27 November 2012: In respect of students on work and holiday programs, since 1 July 2011, (a) how many have had to be deported for overstaying their visa, and of those deported students, (i) how many had the cost of their return travel to their country of origin paid by the Australian Government, and (ii) what sum of money has been spent on the return travel arrangements of these deportees, and (b) how many have not had return travel arrangements already in place. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is: (a) From1 July 2011 to 30 September 2012, 203 clients who arrived on either a Working Holiday (subclass 417) or Higher Education Section (subclass 573) visa have been removed from Australia. (i) All 203 clients listed above had their removal costs paid by the Australian Government. (ii) The cost of a removal depends on a wide range of factors including the destination and commercial airfare costs, whether security or other escorts are required (including their airfares, accommodation and allowances). The average cost for removal has consistently remained in the vicinity of $4 000 per client over recent program years. (b) The Department is unable to respond to this question as departmental systems do not record whether a client had travel arrangements in place prior to their removal being effected. Employment Services Assessments (Question No. 1326) Mr Briggs asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 29 November 2012: In respect of Employment Services Assessments, in 2011-12, (a) how many assessments did the department undertake, (b) what was the total cost to the department for delivering the assessments, and (c) how many qualified health professionals does the department employ to undertake the assessments. Mr Brendan O'Connor: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 371,309. (b) The administered appropriation provided to the Department of Human Services for 2011-12 for assessments for Disability Support Pension and employment services was $83,854,910. This includes the work of professionals carrying out assessment services. (c) All assessors are qualified health or allied health professionals. The average number of assessors in 2011-12 was approximately 500 Full Time Equivalent.",137,Adjournment What It Was They Would Do This Is Now An
