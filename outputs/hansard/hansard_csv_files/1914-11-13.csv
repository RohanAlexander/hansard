In the honourable gentleman's panegyric nothing was wanting to create an industrial Eden; but since then, however, many serpents have entered it , and it is now a wilderness. This measure has been amended, I think, five times. These amendments have been necessitated by decisions of the High Court. The power on which the Statute is based is derived fro m sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, as follows: Tho Parliament sliall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of thc Comsure with a certain amount of mismonwealth with respect to: . . .

' [26]2 Court has been likened to a ship which, leaking heavily, comes into port continuously for repairs, and, being repaired, goes out to sea again only to find herself buffeted by fresh"" gales, and becoming more unseaworthy than ever. This has gone so far that the ship is now past hopes of repair. I do not wish to disguise from honourable members that this measure ift not introduced in the vain hope of making the ship seaworthy, but of merely patching it up until it can get into port.

But this magnificent achieveI do not hesiI t is a decision Of the other decisions of absolutely incompatible with industrial But if we can gather, from the The Arbitration and long-drawn-out litigation in the tramways case, any substantial principle -u o man knoweth what a "" dispute"" is! Could anything be at once more grotesque and more incompatible with the maintenance of industrial peace than such a position ? It is perfectly clear, as I shall show from the remarks of the Judges themselves, and from the unfortunate experience of organizations, that the mere attempt to peacefully formulate a demand according to the spirit, and even the letter, of the law, will not suffice to create a "" dispute."" Nor can this method hope to succeed even if pushed to the very brink of industrial war. Even a strike itself, though ib extends beyond the limits of any one State, will not necessarily create such a dispute as will give the Arbitration Court jurisdiction. That is the position, as I shall show from Mr Justice Powers' own judgment. To strike is an offence under the Act, yet to create a dispute without a strike is almost hopeless. These are the Soylla and Charybdis between which the industrial organizations have to steer their hopeless way. If they do not push their formal demand for better conditions beyond the point of demand and refusal, no matter how widespread is that demand, how just the claim, or how contemptuous the refusal, they cannot be certain that an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act and the Constitution has been created. If they strike tbey commit an offence ! It is perfectly true that the High Court has said a strike is not necessary to prove a dispute. On the other hand, they have said over and over again, and in this case particularly, that a demand followed by a refusal or no reply, followed again by a further demand and refusal or no reply, does not constitute a dispute within the meaning of the Act and the Constitution. But between peacef u l demand and refusal and the strike there is no standing place which an organization can hold. I do not deny that in that rarer atmosphere in which the High Court exists there may be such a point, but there is no place where an organization can stand. proposition, doubtless, it may be successf u l l y maintained that while demand and refusal are not enough to create a dispute, yet it is not necessary to strike, but for practical purposes there is no alternative. What solid ground is there on which an organization can rest when a formal Mr Hughes. demand and refusal fails to prove a dispute except that of a strike? But why should it be necessary to break the law in order to invoke its aid ? The meaning of the word "" d is p u t e "" is surely clear enough. In ordinary Courts of Law these difficulties do not arise. A breach of the peace under the civil law may take one shape or another; there may be a violent assault or merely a technical one by laying on a hand. The Courtsi n practice have no difficulty in determining what is or what is not an assault, and the penalty is measured according to the gravity of the offence. But in this Arbitration Court there is no method of determining what an industrial breach of the peace is no man knows, and no one can tell him. The Arbitration Court is not permitted to tell us, and the High Court will not tell us. Through the ages one of the mysteries that has engaged the attention of man has been the riddle of the Sphinx; what was it she had to say? What is the meaning behind that inscrutable smile; what is the answer to the riddle? No man knows. But, compared w it h the riddle presented by the Arbitration Court, the Sphinx is to be read as plainly as the writing on the wall. What is a dispute? Mr Justice Powers was so overwhelmed with the f u t i l it y of trying to answer the question that, after listening carefully for days to evidence that would have convinced most Courts, not only that there was a dispute, but that it was one of a damnably interminable character, he referred the question to the High Court, which, however, politely declined to answer it . The High Court said, in effect, "" Do not ask us now,"" and so left it to the Court below to grope its way blindfold instead of dealing with the matter as the spirit of the Act intended. This Arbitration Court was to be one shorn of all circumlocution and technicalities, but it has become a place where cirAs an abstract cumlocution and technicality have taken up their abode, indeed, it is their very citadel. Conditions have arisen there that would not be tolerated in any Court of law; let me prove this by referring shortly to the facts in the tramways case. I may be pardoned for doing this in order to make perfectly clear the position that the Government have taken up in this regard. The Government would not lightly bring in legislation attempting to .amend the Act, since their desire is for an .amendment of the Constitution, which would enable us to do away with this -miserable battledore and shuttlecock busiuess. We throw the H i g h Court an .amending Act, and they hurl back its -shattered remains. the demon of eternal hope, we pass another; again it is thrown back; the -organization^ outside ask for bread; they are given a stone-o r a bubble. I wish to show what complete justification there is for this statement of the case and for introducing this legislation. sider the position in the tramways case. If ever there was a dispute between employers and employees there was one between the tramway men and the employers. What do words mean? Have they lost their meaning and become gibberish ? Are we arguing in terms of which we know nothing, or using well known words of our own language? What is a "" d is p u t e "" ? a disagreement between employer and -employee as to the terms and conditions of employment, there is primd facie a dispute and a case for the Court. A man asks for 9s. a day, shorter hours, and other conditions, and the employer ignores the request or refuses it ; there is a dispute. mediate attention by the Court, and These things create a dispute. the plain common-sense view of the man in the street, and that was the intention of this Legislature. Court was created to settle industrial -disputes, and so maintain industrial peace. Tf au organization of men engaged in running the tramways demand better conditions, surely this Court ought to be able to hear whether their demand is a just one? As far back as 1904, there was considerable dissatisfaction among the tramway men in some of the States. The dissatisfaction grew, and at length a Federal organization was formed which formulated a plaint. that the manner in which this was done was not in order, and that the rules of the organization were loosely drawn. Tbese allegations may be perfectly true, but what has fchat to do with the community for whose benefit the Statute was passed ? What is the principle on which this legislation rests ? It is the maintenance of industrial peace, for the benefit, not merely of industrial organizations, but of the community. A manufactured dispute, or one which has not been put before the Court according to the rules or regulations, is as much a danger as any other dispute; perhaps, it is a greater danger, because it is some evidence of precipitate action, and so indicates that the danger of inThen, spurred on by dustrial strife is mere acute. If there is a dispute in the streets, does any one ask whether it is manufactured ? Not at all. It is sufficient that it is a breach of the peace, and the law at once in terferes. If tliis great war which is now devastating the world is not a manufacContured war, what is it? Does any one really think that the assassination of fche Austrian Arch-Duke was sufficient cause why the nations of the world should plunge themselves into a welter of blood ? The present war is a manufactured war, but it is nevertheless very real. That a dispute is manufactured has nothing to do with the fact tliat a dispute exists. Where there is The one question is nofc whether it has been deliberately created, but whether it menaces the community. If so, let the Court deal with it on its merits. If any organization brings forward a bogus dispute, let it pay the penalty. But every dispute oughfc to be the subject of imThat is technicalities ought not to strangle it either at the threshhold or later. The dispute in the tramways case was a very For this real one; it threatened the welfare of the community very seriously. Thousands of men were involved, and the hearing occupied the attention of the Arbitration Court for ninety-three days. No other dispute that I can recall engaged the Court for anything like tnat period. There were ten parties to the dispute. In the case of eight of them agreements were fixed up, and those agreements were incorporated in fche awards made by the Court and became operative. In the It is contended case of two parties, the Adelaide and Brisbane disputants, no agreements were possible, and awards were made. But the respondents in both casss appealed to the H i g h Court for an order of prohibition. The application engaged the F u ll Court for no less than twenty-three days, and seventeen of those days, according to Mr Justice Powers, were occupied in arguing technicalities, the object of which was to hamstring the awards by hook or by crook. Mr Justice Powers in liis judgment says: "" I do not see how the work of the Court can be continued on present lines after the decision in this case until the Act is amended."" Isaacs declares be a shocking waste of public private The Arbitration the evidence at first hand, and having had all the witnesses before it, decided was a dispute; but the High Court, on second-hand evidence, decided there was none. To what extent it was influenced by the evidence of Prendergast-one those rare examples of a totally nature, a man who apparently did not know right from wrong-we But his treachery had nothing to do with the merits of the case. The only question tnat interested there danger of a dislocation of the tram service ? That was the question. Were the trams to be stopped and the whole business of the community to be thrown out of gear? That was the issue the Arbitratioiii been answered, its decision should have stood. The Court evidently thought the dispute was real, and, on the merits, made an award. In the case of eight of the parties that award was accepted. Court now has decided that there was no dispute, and has issued a prohibition order in respect of the claimant organizations in these two cases, bringing the eight agreements to the ground, for which there is now no legal sanction, them. still continuing owe nothing to the law in this matter, and either party can break the agreements tomorrow without penalty or fear of consequences. which the community has been reduced by the most recent decision of the High Court. The law not only does not protect the Commonwealth but industrial The High Court has decided that there was no dispute between the tramway men and their employers. that if there was no dispute in this case, there cannot be in any. Let me show this by quotations from the judgments of the Justices then selves. 1 Speaking as to the very real nature of the dispute, Mr of the Justices who heard the case. I put Air. Hutjhas. Justice Isaacs, in his recorded judgment, Arbitration saidThen came Badger's famous ultimatum demanding the surrender of "" Badge or billet."" At that time the re were 480 unionists in the And Mr Justice Brisbane branch; they were forbidden to come the proceedings "" to to work so long as they wore a little brass and symbol called a badge. They had agreed, it time, money, and energy."" is true, to abide by the company's regulations, and it was within the letter of thc law that Court, after hearing all the company could, without breaking its agreement with them, forbid them from coming to there work so long as they wore the badge. And thc company did so forbid them. It was, however, an undoubted lock-out, and not a strike. On the 22nd thc company advertised that men might resume, but only if they surrendered the of badge. In other words, the lock-out conunmoral tinued. In other words, a lock-out had occurred, cannot say. yet tlie Court said that there was no dispute. Looking at the dispute generally, not only as it affected Brisbane, but also the community was, Is as it affected the men in the four States, His Honour went on to sayThousands of men, as we have seen, from all parts of Australia, and grouped in branches, first framed tlieir tentative sectional schemes of demand, entrusted their representatives to which discuss and standardize them in common counCourt ought to have cil as one body, and eventually reconsidered able to answer; and, having separately the united set of conditions approved by them, adopted thein, and resolved to demand them, and authorized the organization to make that demand for them, which was done. Thc employers, one and all, rejected the demands. The HighI desire honourable members to follow this, because here we get a clear statement of the position created by the High Court judgmentWhat were the men then to clo? Unless they aro required to strike in order to convince the along with Court that they are in earnest, nothing more It is true that these are than they did is possible, as it seems to me. by consent, but they Dealing with the manner in which the dispute had been formulated, His Honour quoted the Taff Vale case as an analogous oneTliis, then, is the position to The sole difference of substance between the case (Taff Vale ease) and the present is:There a strike, with its attendant horrors, took place. Here it was happily averted, except where stated. But is the Court going to tell from industrial strife, the workers of Australia that, notwithstanding creates conditions which make all tlicir efforts to maintain the peaceful conpeace almost impossible. tinuance of industry, they have always to choose between openly striking-for a mere threat to strike could still be challenged as unreal-and running the risk of being told But the facts show they are not really in dispute? Disguisu it as we may, tliat was and is at the root of the argument. Could any criticism be more severe? Yeti t comes, not from a partisan, but from one :it to honourable members that the position which has been created is one which ought not to be allowed to continue. It invites industrial chaos. And unless something is quickly done to put the Courti n a positi on to say what is an industrial dispute -w e do not hope to do more than that-the Court will completely break down. Its trial quate. Nothing short of power to review and deal with the industrial conditions generally will suffice. That power we cannot now give it . any rate, right to expect that the Legislature will do whatever is possible to prevent the Court being an object of contempt and derision. And we owe it to the meu who have made every attempt to settle their disputes in peaceful and lawful fashion, that they shall not be the sport of those persons who, while pretending to prefer industrial peace fco industrial war, and while lauding "" law and order,"" -defraud men, after the expenditure of thousands of pounds and years of effort, of the fruits of their labours. TheB ill beforefcheChamber aims at putt i ng the Arbitration Court into the position we thought it occupied before the -decision of the High Court in the tramways case. It may put the Courti n a better position; on the other hand, it may not improve the position of the Court at all. It may be that the measure is destined to prove but another futil e -effort, ancl that the H i g h Court may pour a broadside into the battered hulk. But -of refraining from taking any step whicli will make for industrial peace is The position is serious; it is indeed critical. industrial affairs knows that the organizations are now waiting to see what is to be done. I have been informed that there are no fewer than three conferences representing very powerful industrial bodies now being held in this city, in order that the organizations may know exactly where they find themselves, and in order that they may decide upon what action -should be taken. The whole industrial world of the Commonwealth is astir, because not only has the decision of the High Courti n the tramways case upset the award and the agreements which rested on that award, so far as the tramway men are concerned-it has also made the position impossible in regard to other awards for other organizations. The decision, indeed, strikes at the very foundations of industrial organizations and their relation to the Federal Court of Arbitration. I do not hesitate to say that powers to grapple with industhere is not one award which could f a i r l y troubles will still be inadego through the same ordeal and escape unscathed. And I am of the opinion that in no case heard by the Court was there one dispute more real than that But, at in the tramways case; nor one in the community have a which could not be found some technical flaws which, being proved, would upset the awards made. Nor can there be one found where tbe claim to consideration by the Court was more just. Therefore, in what positiou are we to-day? Industrial chaos threatens us at any moment. The keystone has been taken out of the arch, and at any moment the whole fabric may collapse. If there had not been a state of war it would have happened already. The war alone has prevented an industrial crisis on a gigantic scale.

What shape the amendment should take is indicated by the Justices. Mr Justice Isaacs, in delivering his judgment, said:Claimants, however, anxious to have the fundamental question determined at once, have no means of doing so, but must run tlieir chance to the end. Respondents, on the other hand, can, if they choose, move at once, or, if they prefer to have a double chance of winning, by evidence or by exhaustion, may wait. It is not only inimical to general welfare, but quite unfair, that one party alone should have the choice of lying by, taking the chance of a favorable judgnient, and if not then satisfied, of upsetting the whole proceeding, very possibly on some merely technical point. If the respondent is dissatisfied with the award, and can only manage to ferret out some technicality that happens to be considered part of the strict and unbending machinery of the law, the merits of the question count for nothing, substantial justicu counts for nothing, the probability, or even certainty, of general turmoil and publie loss and inconvenience are immaterial and irrelevant; so, too, are the supposed settled relations of otlier parties perfectly contented with tlie award. Thus tlie whole structure laboriously and patiently built up by the Arbitration Court as an equitable settlement necessary to secure industrial peace disappears as an unreality in the eye of the law-bu t one which certainly leaves very real and very lasting evil effects behind. If, however, as previously suggested, jurisdiction were given under the judicature chapter of the constitution of the Arbitration "" Court,"" within the meaning of that chapter it is clear (see Ex parte Williamson, 15 C.L.R., at p. 583) that, subject only to whatever appeal or assistance by way of case stated to this Court, a Parliament chose to permit or provide, the basic question could be definitely settled before the huge extent of the main controversy was incurred. T must not, however, be taken as recommending an appeal. He went on to say that would not lie against the Court if it were given jurisdiction the judicature chapter of the Constitution and were clothed with those powers. Then he went on to say what had always been regarded as a dispute in England, and dealt with the earliest application disputes, in England, ner how they had arisen, and the general recognition of the principle tive bargaining. that in drawing up their logs the men necessarily must leave details to their leadens, that their leaders made these demands on behalf of the men, and that Mr Hughes. these demands, if rejected, constituted a dispute. He saidIf this commanding principle be, for instance, applied to the question whether the Brisbane men really wanted the extra few pence per day they demanded in the combined log, or were mentally content to receive what they put into their sectional log, the answer would be that the danger to the public disregarded such a test; whether they would or not the result in the case of the possible stoppage to the travelling publie and to other industries dependent on tlie prompt arrival of passengers, is the same in either case, and should be averted. Then, speaking as to the necessity for. clothing the Court with power to determine at the threshold what an industrial dispute is, he saidI t seems to me it ought to be judicially determined at the threshold whether the entry oi the Arbitration Court upon an arbitration inquiry is justified or not. If it is, let it proceed, and the result, whatever it may be, depend on the merits alone. If not justified, then let it be prevented at the outset. Such a shocking waste of public and private time, money, and energy as has occurred in the present instance ought not even to be possible. Surely no more scathing criticism was ever expressed by a Judgei n any case. Nor was there ever a case which so well merited ifc. The ends of justice have been defeated, the purpose for which the Statute had been created swept aside, the interests of the community gravely imperilled. The respondents have not given a thought for tlie welfare of the community or for the maintenance of the principles upon which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act rests. Yet what is the alternative to this legislation ? Honourable members who do not believe in the Act, who do not desire to amend it , prohibition should be honest, and say they will go Arbitration back to the old condition of things; tliat under they prefer to revert to barbarism. It will be no new thing. Germany has set us an example.

The recommendation of Isaacs, Higgins and Powers, J.J., is that the Arbitration Court should be clothed with power to determine what is and what is not a dispute. The question arises, "" Can we, by any means at our disposal, do this?"" I do not say that we cannot. There is no constitutional reason why jurisdiction to determine what is and what is not a dispute should not be given a Court other than the H i g h Court or the Arbitration Court. But the wisdom of doing so is doubtful, and the expediency still more so. would-if it wore to be really usefulhave jurisdiction to determine all matters arising under paragraph xxxv. of section 51, or of any laws made thereunder. But these powers would be considerable; and the High Court might hold that, although the Legislature could create a Court to deal with the interpretation of certain parts of the Constitution, the power of the High Court to interfere where it is alleged that an inferior Court has exceeded its jurisdiction was not in any way impaired. I do not say that the High Court would so hold, but I do not propose to take any risk in the matter. I think that we shall achieve what is necessary by the provision in clause 5When an alleged industrial dispute is submitted to thu Court(a) in the case of a. dispute submitted to the Court by plaint-the complainant organization or association ; and (6) in any otlier case-an y party to the proceeding or the Registrar, may apply to the High Court, for a decision on the question whether the dispute, or any part thereof, exists, or is threatened or impending or probable, as an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. 2. 'J im High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question. 3. The jurisdiction of the High Court under this section may be exercised by any Justice of the High Court sitting in chambers. 4. The decision of the Justice on the question shall be final and conclusive, and sliall not be subject to any appeal to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, and shall not be challenged, quashed, or called in question, or lie subject to prohibition or mandamus in any Court on any account whatever. If clause 5 is watertight, the High Court once the Justice has decided the matter, will not be able to review the decision either by way of prohibition or in any other way whatever. If the clause is within our powers, the Arbitration may apply for a decision as to whether Mr Hughes. there is a dispute, and, once that point is decided, the matter is finally settled. Had that been possible in the tramways case we should have been spared the ' ' shocking waste of public and private time, money, and energy'' caused by the tramways prohibition case. Cases will be settled more speedily, because no appeal is allowed, and no order of prohibition can lie against the Justice. I do not know that I can usefully elaborate the argument in favour of this proSuch a Court vision further, but I wish to hear the objections that may be raised against it . I do not invite criticism of our determination to make the Act workable, so as to enable the waterlogged and leaky ship to reach port, but I do invite honourable members to help the Government to effect repairs in the best way possible in the circumstances. I shall be very ready to accept any workable suggestions tending to improve the efficacy of the proposal. The position is f u l l of difficulties and dangers, but these have to be fairly faced. An honest attempt must be made to prevent industrial chaos by assuring those organizations that have awards that these will not be interfered with, and that those seeking redress may do so with perfect confidence. Thus time, energy, and money will be saved, and the patience of the community will not be frittered away. exercise the proposed jurisdiction ? twenty-three days in hearing the prohibition case, and decided, by four to two, that there was no dispute. Far be it from me to cast any reflection on the Judiciary, but I think that, if there had been sixteen Justices on the Bench, the case would not yet have been finished. The High Court itself has decided that the question of whether or not a dispute exists is one of fact, and its determination can be more expeditiously arrived at by one man than appealed against, reviewed, by six. The flaw in this provision, if there be a flaw, is, therefore, not there. The points to be considered are the constitutionality of the proposal, and, subject to that, whether it will work expeditiously and well. I invite the criticism of honourable members to these points.

A t the outset, let me say that all have been suggested either by the Court or by the Registrar. dealt with, relate to defects in machinery not vital in themselves, but which have caused a great deal of trouble, confusion, and delay. I ask honourable members to believe thafc in fche performance of its functions fchis new Court, launched with such eclat on the industrial waters some nine years ago, is continually experiencing trouble in its internal mechanism. The cogs grind; the bearings grow hot. An endeavour is here made to deal with these troubles. Clause2 deals with the position of an employee dismissed by his employer because he belongs fco an organization. Under the Act as it stands, in order to secure a conviction it is necessary to prove that an employee has been dismissed merely because he is a unionist. Ifc is a fact, and one of the most cheering evidences of the innate goodness of mankind, that convictions have been secured for this offence under the existing law. offender caught, ninety-nine go free. It is obvious thafc if a man wishes to dismiss an employee because he is a unionist, he may easily do so. An employer may discharge a man because he is a unionist, and say that he has dismissed him because he does not like his appearance. We are amending the principal Act so that the onus will rest on the employer, and this is quite compatible with the policy of the Act. Collective bargaining has become part of the warp and woof of our industrial fabric. We do not recognise individuals; we recognise only organizations. whole system is based upon the principle of collective bargaining. The object of the Act, the work for which the A r b i tration Court was established, is to settle industrial disputes between organizations and employers. These threaten the peace of the community. Disputes between isolated individual employees and their employers are negligible. Those"" dwellers in the caves"" who talk about the rights of the individual are invited to crawl into the daylight, and to see the new world, in which the individual workman, except in cases so rare as to be insignificant, does not really count at all. There are combinations of workmen and combinations of employers. These are the factors with which the Court has to deal. This Bill is to deal with conditions as they are, not as they were, or even as All , except that justthey might be. Therefore, in order that we may secure collective bargaining, and leave an organization perfectly free to embrace witliin its grasp every person engaged in the industry to which it relates, no man must be penalized because he belongs to an organization. The law : says to a worker"" Before ye shall receive industrial salvation, it is necessary that ye shall enter the fold of a union."" To penalize a man for doing that very thing the law desires to encourage is obviously wrong. And particularly so in this case, because the Federal Court cannot make a common rule. Under fchis law there is only one way in which a man can be in dustrially saved-that is, by becoming a unionist. In these circumstances, if we gave an employer power to penalize a man because he belonged to a union we should strike at the very taproot of the whole system with which the But for every oue Statute was deliberately designed to deal. We propose to provide, therefore, tliat fche onus of proving that a man has been dismissed for some reason other than being a unionist shall rest upon the employer. If an employer dismisses one of his men he must show that he did not dismiss him for being a unionist. Thereupon the onus of proof, as the lawyers in the House know, will fall upon the other party, and he will have to make out his case. case to make out. The my experience of the Courti n New South Wales only one conviction was secured. It is proposed that any fine that may be recovered may be paid to tlie victim. If a man is dismissed because he is a unionist, and the Court orders his employer to pay a fine, it is even-handed justice, I think, that the man so dismissed should receive tlie fine. It is not, however, to go to him, ipso facto. The Attorney-General may direct thafc the whole or any part of a fine so imposed shall be paid to the person injured.

This will extend the dangerously the scope of the Court. It is proposed, therefore, to extend the industrial scope of an award to all those who have been served but do not appear. Clause9 amends section 38 of fche Act , Clause6 deals with the list of and deals with a difficulty that has arisen organization in its working. It is proposed to insert, after paragraph (d), the following: (da) to order compliance with any term of an order or award proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been broken or not obmembers served.

Ifc is essenaccountant; tial, therefore, that every member of an He does his best; but organization should be an employee in the This industry. An employee is a person who deals with industrial organizahas existing contractual relations of emas they are, and not with ployment with an employer.

This rule construed strictly excludes officers of long in office work, and who are standing, such as the honourable member for the Darling and myself. On the face irregularities of it , such a rule is opposed to the spirit of the Act, and operates most unfairly. This clause will make the So soon as an organization grows to any size, it is impossible for a man to attend to its affairs and at the same time to carry on the Ordinary duties of his employment. It is customary, therefore, to appoint a secretary, who devotes himself exclusively to the work of the association; aud the moment he takes the appointment he ceases under this section to become a member of the registered association. Clause 11 amends section 58A of the Act by providing that where, for any reason, an organization changes its name, its registration shall not be affected. The amendment of section 60, which is effected in clause 12, arises out of the experience of the Courti n , I think, the amalgamated miners' case. Court found itself compelled to cancel tbe registration, although it certainly did not desire to do so. It is proposed to clothe the Court with discretionary power. Clause 13 provides that every association which, at the coming into operation of the B ill , is registered as an organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered. This is to cin""e any defects that may have occurred in the registration of any organization now registered.

That proposal means that this Parliament is to authorize the borrowing and expenditure of £10,000,000 by the Bank. The inI have already shown debtedness of the Bank is the indebtedness of fche Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth is responsible for every action taken by the Governor of the Bank. For what purpose is this £10,000,000 required ? My right honourable friend said thafc he did not intend to borrow the money just yet, and perhaps he would not borrow ifc for a long time. Then, what is tlie urgency of getting this power to We havo borrow? I have shown thafc no action is contemplated, except that there is a vague idea that the Commonwealth might buy up some other bank. The credit of th© Commonwealth is sufficient for all transactions, because the debentures are available as a stand-by if they are required. This proposal of the Governmeut is merely a placard which is intended to make a show in the window, but is not for use. If it is intended for use, wo have a right to know what that use is to be. Let us look at two of the biggest banking institutions in th© world. The Bank of England, which has done so much in connection with the financial crisis brought about by the war, has a capital The basis of the Bank's capital of only £14,500,000.

We know that if the Government desire to spend any money at all, they must submit the items for parliamentary approval, and an appropriation must be made before the expenditure can be incurred. wo are obliged to set forth in the clearest way how every item in the LoanB ill is to be expended; we have to give the specifications of the work very often; and Parliament is supposed to be cognisant of everything which it is proposed to do before approval is given. should we deal differently with the raising of £10,000,000 for the purposes of a banking institution ? Do honourable members opposite approve of giving Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer for the time being the right to buy, say, the great Bank of New South Wales, and make it part of the Commonwealth institution, without the cognisance of Parliament? agree that Parliament should be set at nought, and not even consulted ? Once the Governor gets the money, the control of the Treasurer will cease. The power of the Treasurer applies only to the raising of the money. I do not know whether the Treasurer has to approve of a bank being purchased ? and the Governor are to raise the money, to buy a bank, and tell us after the transaction is complete, when the Bank with its millions of money will be under the absolute control of one man. I am not saying anything against the present Governor of the Bank. I believe he is an excellent man, and all the time. I occupied the position of Treasurer, he and I worked most amicably together. fore, there is nothing personal in my criticism. The Governor may be one of the wisest of men, but he ou^ht not to have sole control of this Bank, and unlimited expenditure. This institution is not like the Bank of England, w i th its twenty-six directors, comprising men in the highest positions in the commercial hated Opposition to raise and banking world, and who are always the there to aid the institution. There is no other institution of the sort in the world Is this responsible government, where the absolute control is given to one man. I do appeal to honourable members opposite to have a little regard for constitutional usage. The Government are proposing to entrust to one man in the' community the whole credit of Australia. We are responsible for everything the Governor does, and must pay the piper if any loss is made. But we are committing ourselves to intrusting the country's credit to In regard to loans, also, one man. who is a law unto himself. aud purposes, the Governor is a law unto himself. Is that a reasonable thing to do ? Is there any precedent for such a course? Why, then, Isi t a safe procedure? Isi t responsible government, which means that Parliament shall be consulted before, expenditure is incurred ? Are we going to allow to the the Governor and the Treasurer for the time being to pledge the credit of the country for the purchase of a commercial enterprise at a cost of £10,000,000, without Parliament being made aware of the transaction until it has been completed ? Do they Do we realize our responsibility to the people when we vote away the powers in trusted to us under the Constitution ? 1 desire to say only a word or two in rc gard to my action as Treasurer in cor nexion with the branch of the Saving -; Bank which had been established with : > -flourish of trumpets in England. O M looking into the matter, I came to the con elusion that there was no power in the Act to establish a Savings Bank outside of Australia. I consulted the Attorney General, and he gave a very deliberate opinion that there was no power to have a Commonwealth Savings Bank anywhere .except in Australia. I at once called the attention of the Governor of the bank to the fact, and told him that he must not act illegally. He did not like that in struction, but he said he would achieve his purpose in another way. I replied that, Thereso long as he established his banks within the law, I had no objection. A t the same time, I was glad to find that the Governor's action was not in accordance w i th the Act. I look upon the Commonwealth",19,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

I shall therefore welcome any reasonable attempt to increase the Bank's powers and prestige, and to give it the status which it must possess before it can f u l f i l in the remotest degree the functions of a national bank. Some things have happened during these trying days that are of almost priceless value. has home to the Prime Minister, and to leaders of the Labour party in the States. The right honourable member signed and distributed throughout Australia a famous manifesto, containing the astounding statement tJiat the Australian note issue had given enough money to be loaned to the States by the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain their public works policy, and thus to prevent a huge army of unemployed from being thrown on the streets. The manifesto also stated that, without the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue, we should be faced at this juncture with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance. Do lionorable members believe thafc the Commonwealth Bank has had anything to do with overcoming our difficulties? The Bank has absolutely no capital, and ifc is mere effrontery to say that it has prevented the collapse of the trade and finance of Australia. It is a good thing that the crisis has brought home to the minds of responsible Labour leaders the fact that it is foolish to think that paper money can maintain the credit of Australia and preserve its industries from collapse. Holman said recently on the subject. He is one of the Labour leaders, and is certainly one of the cleverest of themJit is suggested tliat we should finance those not hug these delusions to their breasts. works by the simple and easy expedient of borThafc is his characterization of those who rowing bank notes from the Federal Governbelieve in any such thing.

But I ask honourable members to follow what would happen if that were existing crisis to bring him round to that done.

There is another alternative. If there were an over-issue of paper money, the banks would naturally get r i d of their gold and keep the notes for their reserves. Then the Treasury in Melbourne would be in the position either of refusing payment, which would precipitate the crisis which every responsible-minded man in Australia is endeavouring to avert, or of paying out until it The logic of events reached the legal maximum, when, 1 take it, driven the truth of matters refusal would be inevitable. . . . I am convinced .that the moment has arrived when it is better to speak, and speak plainly, and say to misguided people who aro urging this resource that it is no resource whatever, and that while no doubt a note issue can be expanded legitimately, and ought to be expanded legitimately, at a time like this by the united efforts of the Government and the banks throughout the State, to put as large a body of funds into circulation as possible, and while I am prepared as Treasurer to do nil in my power to help, that is a different thing to treating paper currency as an inexhaustible supply of capital. That is one of the prize delusions of tliose who know nothing about the questions involved. That is rough on honourable members opposite.

If responsible statements of Ministers when before the country may not be quoted in this House as financial bearing upon the legislation which they are proposing, it seems to me that parliamentary discussion is at an end.

I think, Mr Speaker, you might allow me to state my point before you interrupt me.

Money would have been very dearHere we come to the Attorney-General's rhetoricunemployment and trade crises would have come upon us like a flood submerging everything. Instead of which, money is very cheap, employment is encouraged, traders should not be called ou to reduce overdrafts or harassed by dread of complete ruin. Thc wheels of industry move, and trade becomes possible. The Conunonwealth Bank, andsomething again to which I may not rewithout which, at this juncture, we should be faced with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance, are due to the Labour party alone. All that the Commonwealth Bank has ever done throughout this crisis has been to act as an agent. It cannot act as a principal, because it has no capital. has acted purely as an agent, and whatever the Treasurer is going to do now with regard to certain loans to the States will be effected through the Commonwealth Bank acting only as an agent. The Bank is not finding the £18,000,000 which the States are to receive. Nothing has more strongly emphasized the need of a National bank with large resources and skilled management as the crisis through whicli we have been passing. I , therefore, am glad in one sense thafc it is proposed to clothe this Bank with greater powers and privileges than ifc has. But what does the B ill provide? In the very forefront of it we have a proposal to take over other banks. Isi t not remarkable that the Prime Minister should tell the House, "" We want power to take over other banks, but we do not know that we are going to take over any?"" Ifc seems to me thafc the right honourable gentleman is playing with the House. Either the Governor has a bank in view or he has not. all reasons why this provision should be eliminated from the B ill . Why should it be emphasized in the form of a special clause ? If , as the Treasurer says, he has no other bank in his mind, and does not know that the power is going to be exercised, that is a reason why the clause should be rejected rather than passed. And that leads me to another point. I understand that in connection with the taking over of these banks, and the exercise of this power, Parliament is to be absolutely ignored. The power is to be exercised with the consent of the Treasurer. If the Governor of the Bank wishes to get £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 within his control, he will say to the Treasurer, "" Comei n and help me to get it . "" But having once obtained it , he will show the Treasurer the door, and will have no more to do wifch him. There is nothing fair about a provision of this kind. good Socialism. adulterated, logical Socialism. It is, in deed, the very essence of bureaucracy. I protest against the Parliament being treated in this way. This provision may involve a matter of some £5,000,000, £10,000,000, or £20,000,000, and surely in regard to something which It so profoundly affects the finances and resources of the Commonwealth this House should at least be consulted. But, uo! The Treasurer and the Governor of fche Bank are to deal with it . This Parliament is not considered to be worthy of the compliment of consultation. If the Labour party were on this side of the House and some other party brought down this proposal how they would scarify and "" stone-wall "" it . if honourable members opposite were in power. members opposite would have to be "" gagged "" if we were trying to pass such a B ill , otherwise we should never get it through. The fact is that the B ill is simply a proposal to nationalize, by administration, and not by legislation; and, in this, the Government are going even further than under the referenda proposal. Under the latter, when it is proposed to nationalize any industry or corI f he has not, that is the best of poration it is lef t to Parliament to decide; but in the present instance, the",25,Commonwealth Bank Bill Second Reading

It was foreseen that even if the debentures were issued they would be an insufficient capital for the requirements of even the smallest Statei n the nation if the business of the Bank was to beeome general. In consequence, the Governor, with the consent and approval of the then Government, said, "" We must get m o n e y , a n d an easy means of getting it was to endeavour to secure the existing Savings Bank deposits of the States. That at once drove into irreconcilable conflict with the Commonwealth the six Governments of the States, and that conflict occurred irrespective of party, as the right houorable the Prime Minister will well remember. When the B i ll was before us originally, a Conference of State Treasurers and Premiers, the then Premier of New South Wales, met in Sydney to consider the effect of Part5 of the existing institutions of the States, and the whole of the six Governments -tw o Labour and joined in a memorial to the right honourable gentleman who is now, and was then, Prime Minister, asking him to modify his proposals, and to consult with the States before their institutions were attacked in that way.

When I saw a statement that had been made by the right honourable gentleman during the recent election, that he had at the Conference offered the States a partnership in the control and profits, I looked up the report of the proceedings at the Conference, and found that the right honourable gentleman was in error. I know that ifc is very easy for an honourable member who has been leading the strenuous life, as the Prime Minister has been doing during the last few years, to forget facts, but I have refreshed my mind by reference to the reports only a month or two ago. I know that I , and, I think, Mr Holman, Mr Denham, and Mr. Barnes, of Queensland, adopted the same attitude in standing out for this partnership in control and in profits, but all our efforts merely led up the road to f u t i l it y , and thafc portion of fche Conference was I attended your Conferabsolutely fruitless.

So has the tame tiger in our Zoo; the tiger is now tame, but, at one time, it had to fight for its existence. However, I am not fighting the Commonwealth Bank, but am endeavouring to draw attention to the fact that, after some years of close attention to the governmental side of the problem, I believe that a giant blunder has been committed. I believe that it is not too late to retrieve the blunder, and this is a stage, created by the very act of the Government, as this is a Bill which seeks to alter the constitution and powers of the Bank, when we can ask ""Does the Bill strike at basic principles, and does it insure the future of the Bank?"" am one of those who is willing to make it so, if the Government will allow us to do so by seeing the institution in the light in which we are endeavouring to show it . This Bank ought not to be a party institution. The Government ought to be able to l if t ib completely out of the ruck of party, and, by fair concessions, and a consideration of the views which hitherto have been neglected, make it something better than a party bank. Let us look at the attitude which the right honourable the Prime Minister took. I ask him to place himself in the position of a State Treasurer, perhaps the Treasurer of a State Labour Government. There were State institutions holding in the aggregate some £70,000,000 of money-al l of it the people's money, and deposited in small amounts. The operations of some of these institutions stretched back over three-quarters of a century. The bank in the mother State of New South Wales has a history of something like eighty years; the bank in Victoria, fifty or sixty years. During all that time the Savings Banks have been gathering up the people's money, being a common medium of transfer to those who needed it most, and wifch one uninthe Bank not terrupted career of success to both the Governments and the depositors. The money fchey covered was used, as honorA comparison of this able members well know, to serve great social purposes-in Western Australia, for the extension of land development; in Victoria, for the reduction of interest But the Bank of Engrates to farmers through a credit foncier system, and in the purchase of homes by workers and shopkeepers on very liberal terms, and we put an equitable condition into the money market which prevented the small borrower being raked afc any time by the somewhat rapacious methods of the money lenders. These institutions in general, also lent this money to the Governments of Australia before the Commonwealth came into existence. Oufc of about £22,000,000 in the Victorian Savings Bauks, over £10,000,000 have been lent to the Government by authority of Parliament, for the purpose of building railways, for water propositions, land settlement, and other reproductive schemes. For the past three or four years every Government in Australia had been leaninsr heavily on the trustees or governors of Savings Banksf or help for their local I say thafc it does not, but I loans, and in support of their loans overseas, and they felt that this step on tbe part of the Commonwealth Government not only took from them the prestigewhicli, of course, is not very much to ROnsider-of running these institution""?, but that it also rendered extremely difficult and doubtful their future financial position. The States were tryin g to develop the commercial enterprises of Australia, and to help forward the growth of population, and were doing in detail the same work that the National Government were undertaking; and they felt that the National Government were dragging them to their knees and weakening their chances of a successful coritinuai.ee of those endeavours.

186,Mr Watt,"Judging from the interinstitutions of Australia, as he has repeatedly shown in fche fruitless negotiations which he instituted to acquire and swallow the State Savings Banks. I have no hesitation, and never sliall have, in criticising the governor or controllergeneral or directorate of a bank when I think they are driven by false considerations fco a policy of wrong actions. I believe Mr Miller has on more than one occasion made gross blunders that have to a large extent prevented the establishment of that feeling of reconciliation which some of us hoped to promote. Let us take illustrations. The Bill empowers the Governor to bank in England. ancl was banking there in 1913. I had occasion to ask, for fche Government of Victoria, through its Agent-General, that a circular which the Government had issued in London, describing the bauk as the State Bank of Australia, might be cancelled.

The figures are positively laughable. In the biggest city in fche world, where fchere is a population of 7,000,000 persons, the Commonwealth is prepared to take the savings of the British workman, and to use them for Australian purposes, and yet during the quarter ended June, 1913, fchere were only 85 new accounts opened; in the next quarter, 97; and in the next quarter, 68. The business would be small for the most remote town in the Mallee. withstanding the fact that a higher rate of interest is offered. right honourable gentleman that it is not ethically right, either in times of peace But he is banking there now, or in times of war, for the Commonwealth to go to London and say, "" We want fche savings of the people of England."" The honourable member who propounded the scheme never proposed that we should search countries across the seas for the convenience and advantage of the people of this State. In Victoria we have gone so far in our sense of localization as to provide that not only is our Savings Bank to confine the raising of money to Victorian depositors, is bufc also that the money must be spent within our borders.

The institution should be for the benefit of our own people, and its money should be raised in Australia and spent in Australia for Australian purposes. I should hesitate to go to the people of any other country and ask them to lend us their money in dribs and drabs. The savings banks of the Old World do good business for the people in England. They are the soundest institutions in the world. We do not need to enter into competition with them, and by doing so w ill put ourselves in a wrong light before our parents and kinsfolk in the Old World. It may be that the Governor of the Bank can claim that he has done what he has done with the f u l l authority of the present Administration ; but, nevertheless, it is wrong. I hope that when new powers are given to h i m we shall correct matters. We are proposing to allow the Governor to acquire savings banks. But that has already been done. Some of the Tasmanian institutions have been acquired, and I think some of the Western Australian institutions, without statutory authority. Y o u beget liability to blundering and the exceeding of power when you put a Kaiser in charge of the Bank. So long as Mr Miller has his present powers, he can flout Parliament.

No member of Parliament would wish to interfere with questions of overdraft, advances, discounts, and exchanges. But when the Governor of the Bank makes a departure involving a new principle i u the development of our institutions, we have a right to speak. It was pointed out by the honourable member for Eden Monaro that this institution was promised to the people for the making of small advances to farmers and others, to enable them to do the settlement and developmental work which means so much to both country and town. Instead of making such advances the Governor of the Bank says, when a big corporation comes along and asks it to underwrite a certain quantity of debentures, taking all the risks and accepting a commission by way of compensation, "" Certainly.

212,,"It is a good thing Mr Watt I am not hounding h i mvance inoney on land? to help the farmers? this Bill had their way, the competition between the Savings Bank institutions would grow apace, and it is plain that before long those institutions would theu go out of business. There is only one other argument that I would like to put before sitting down. It relates to the proposal to increase the capital of the bank from £1,000,000 to £10,000,000, the object being, according to the declaration of tbe clauses, that we should buy up certain banking institutions as the opportunity occurs. There are two weaknesses in that, proposal, apart from those which have been alluded to. One is that we are invited to buy a "" pig in a poke "" so far as the nation is concerned. Whatever institutions were purchased this Parliament would have no voice in tlieir purchase. It would not know whether their liabilities were correctly stated or whether their assets were correctly valued and verified. Tliere are two ways out of that difficulty, licate things, which might easily be killed and I think it sbould be left to the Minisor injured by such methods. Surely the try to take one of them. Mr J. H . OATTS -Cannot we inquire into those matters? the matter will rest with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the Treasurer ? Mr J. H . CATTS -Surely we could direct the Treasurer? member and his party are prepared to back up their direction by defeating the Ministry. The weakness of the scheme is that the Governor of the Bank and the Treasurer might agree to purchase an institution, say the A. B. Company, with, perhaps, £9,000,000 worth of assets and £9,000,000 worth of liabilities, and this Parliament, which would have to back every debenture, would know nothing whatever about the value of those assets. I l would have no voice in the ratification of the conditional agreement. Tf the nation were to buy a tramway system or a great sugar enterprise, the only way in which it could be successfully done would be by the Government taking upon themselves the responsibility of drawing a conditional agreement with the seller, which should be liable to ratification by the shareholders or proprietors on the one side, and by Parliament and the people on the other. If the State purchased the tramways, that is the only way in which it could be done. Everybody desires to see that misjudgment does not lead us into a loss of millions sterling. There is still another aspect, and apparently the Prime Minister has not thought of it. It may be said at once that a financial corporation would not consent to have, at risk of rejection, the whole of its affairs laid bare on the table of the House, because that might mean ruin if rejection followed. I admit that that is so, although we saw the same sort of thing done in connection with two great insurance companies in Australia. The whole Gf the affairs of those companies were laid upon the table, they were debated in the press before the amalgamation took place, and in one case rejection, and in the other acceptance, resulted. But eventually no injury was done to either of these institutions. At the same time, we must recollect that financial institutions are deGovernment will not ask this Parliament to give unfettered control in matters of this kind to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank or to the Treasurer without certification by the nation. Surely it should be necessary that certain valuators should be appointed to privately value and privately certify either to the Government or to Parliament, and it ought also to be necessary for the Auditor General to report upon the securities which are intangible. The proposal of the Government, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, may easily mean an increase of £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 in the purchasing power of the bank. If it be true that this institution, without any capital, has already developed a purchasing power of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000, how strong will its deposits and till nionej bo when its capital is r £10,000,000? Obviously £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 might be the measure of its deposits and its capital, and it might embark on huge purchases of the kind projected.

He might purchase a Bank which does business in one or two States, but that would not satisfy the whole of the States.

The cost of that purchase will be a great deal more than is contemplated in this Bill.

It was not the kind of partnership of which I was speaking when amendment. the right honourable gentleman inter[27] rupted me. I do not desire to do him an injustice. I know that his mind runs along perfectly, rigid lines with regard to this Bank, and my own has not changed very much with respect to it I have a fairly good memory, and it has been re' cently refreshed. My proposition for partnership was one for control of the government of this institution, and not for periodic consultations, such as we now undertake, as between the Commonwealth and the States, in regard to theories of the Bank and suggestions for its better conduct. I shall, however, discuss that question at a more opportune time. I was about to say, when interrupted, that I am not qualified, as a private member, to make any offer to the right honourable gentleman.. But, as this debate proceeds-and I trust it will be carried on from both sides without prejudice or. paseionI am quite sure that the desire will grow to see this second birth of the Commonwealth Bank owned by both the Commonwealth and the States. We cannot ask the States into partnership as long as we declare war against them, and there is still a state of war. We had hopes that, if the late Government were returned with a majority at the last general election, the agreement which is proclaimed as the policy of the Liberal party would be. adopted. As a matter of fact, it was not only a Liberal party proposition. It was adopted just as swiftly and energetically by my honourable friend, the Premier of New South Wales, as it was by any of the other State Premiers. The Government of New South Wales feel the pinch of this competition even more than we do in Victoria, and it will be an act of statesmanship which will redound to their lasting credit, if the Prime Minister and his colleagues are able, before the BUI passes, to put upon it the impress of union and companionship aud co-operation wilh the States. If that he done, we shall he able to build up an institution which will be of lasting service to the people of Australia.
