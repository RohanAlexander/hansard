Consequently honourable members of the Opposition could not vote for the motion as a whole. We said that if the Government would divide the motion, we* would vote for which urged preference for our dried fnait-growers, and record our objection to the portion containing the provisions relating to 46101106. However, the Government, thinking more of the political aspect of things than of giving assistamee to fruit-growers, refused our request,, and its supporters were so mean that, during the election, they condemned the Labour party because of its refusal to support them in their desire to secure preference for the dried fruits industry. Towards the end of the last session the Government did the same kind of thing. It brought down what it called an amending Immigration able members of the Labour party would have been quite assist in placing on the statute book those parts of the measure that dealt with the exclusion from this country of undesirable aliens, but the Government included, as portion of the bill, provisions that had the result of taking from our citizens the right, in some circumstances, of trial by jury, and of providing the penalty of deportation for certain offences. Consequently, we on this side of the chamber had to vote against the whole measure.

The Attorney General( Mr Latham), in introducing the bill, said that the Government had received a mandate from the people. Wc have heard so much about this mandate that I have no doubt that the Government will claim it as justification for every act that it may commit, .from political pitch and toss to manslaughter. murder, straight out? no doubt that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) will be quite prepared to support the Government in Bill; Honorall its proposals, and will consider that the mandate justifies him in doing so. willing to The Attorney-General, in introducing the bill, quoted tlie Prime Minister's speech prior to the last election in support of his contention that the issue submitted to the people was the maintenance of law and order and the supremacy of constitutional government. He added that it was upon that issue that tlie Leader of the Opposition challenged the Prime Minister to go to the country. As a matter of fact, that was not the question upon which the Leader of the Opposition issued his challenge. It was upon the question of deportation without a proper trial.

According to him, therefore, the question was a real live one; yet none of the gentlemen I have referred to ever heard a word about it . The honourable that has been member for Riverina must have debated the matter in a Httle caucus of his own. The facts go to show that many of the denials which were made on the hustings including myself, gave should be taken w i th the proverbial grain of salt.

These are some of the statements he madeAustralian democracy is in danger, but, whilst ten years ago the menace was from the aggression of a foreign foe, to-day the danger lies in a small body of men within our own borders. The external foes and internal foes have one aim in common, the overthrow of constitutional government and the disintegration of Australian democracy. Both would hand the people over to bondage. The issue is again thu samo Whethei thu will of the people is to prevail or whether' we are to be dominated by irresponsible, political and industrial extremists who care nothing for this country and are animated by malignant hatred of the Britisli Empire. Australia is passing through dark hours, when the laws are being defied and lawlessness and sedition are openly preached. Labour has encouraged those who had flouted the law-thos e who were openly for communism. The crimes resulting must be laid at the door of political labour. That waa a defamation of the Labour party and of everything for which it stands, and the Prime Minister knew it . I propose now to make his own Attorney General give him the lie. The other leader of the composite Government also made a statement which, if that were possible, was more exaggerated than that of the Prime Minister. He saidThe issue is between order and chaos; continuous employment and unemployment;, constant wages and no wages; rural prosperity and rural distress; industrial peace and indusdefinitely of such people and where they trial unrest; arbitration methods or job control; Australian law and revolution; democratic rule of the majority and the dictatorship of a few; and between tlie composite Government standing firm for all that means progress, and political Labour betraying trade unionism into the hands of a few violent extremists arid agitators. The political Labour leaders seek to evade their complicity in the guilt of tliese men, but tbey cannot dissociate themselves, for in the last ten years they have allowed themselves to be used as the spokesmen and advocates of I.W.W. men, communist, the alien wrecker, and all who want to mix up the worker in quarrels that do not concern him. Apart from an election campaign, and with the exception of the Treasurer, there is possibly not one honourable member on the other side who would not characterize those statements as a slander on the party represented on this side of the House. I said that I would allow the Attorney General in calmer, post-election moments to answer these charges. I submit the following statement of the Attorney General in introducing this bill as a complete answer to them. He saidI have never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to obtain its objects Mr Parker Moloney. by violence. The platform of the Labour party makes it perfectly plain that that party aims at securing its objective by constitutional means. There cannot be the slightest objection to t h a t . . . . The Labour party rightly says that it is a party of law ana order. . . . I have said numbers of times, and I repeat it here, that I do not either directly or indirectly suggest that, in the ordinary sense, the Labour party is a communist party or is allied with communists. I desire to make that perfectly plain. I ask honourable members to contrast that statement with the wild electioneering stunts of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It is a complete answer to those people who defamed the Labour party during the elections. I have only to say that if they read the words of the Attorney-General"" it is not too much to expect that they should be ashamed of their utterances during the election campaign. The Attorney-General's statement should not only shame the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but should open the eyes of those innocents outside who believed their statements and voted for them because of those statements. Another interesting aspect of the matter may be referred to. The Prime Minister said that there were extremists out to overthrow constitutional government and the Empire. He said that from the hustings, and he said it here. If he did not know were he should not have made such a statement. If he does know of their existence the people generally should ask him what he is doing in order to r i d the country of such dangerous elements. The Government was in such little hurry to deal with these evildoers and wrongdoers that, after the election was over, they allowed about seven weeks toelapse before they called Parliament. together. The fact is, of course, that the Government did not want to deal with these extremists at all. They would not be here were it not for the extremists. not sell Jock Gardenf o r quids. lionorable members have suggested that, individuals like Jock Garden served the Government f a it h f u l l y and well during the election campaign and not without adequate reward.

I have said before, and it has been said by many others, that, apparently, Garden came over here purposely to make that particular speech to the detriment of the party on this side. He said, in effect, that if the Labour party were returned at the elections the strike would go on, and if the Nationalist party were returned the strike would stop. He said a number of other things, and this is what the Prime Minister had to say about other portions of that speech, so that it cannot be contended that he is not aware of the kind of utterances these people indulge in . Referring to Garden's speech on the previous day, the Prime Minister is reported in the Melbourne daily newspapers to have said in the Corio electorateThe Government was having the speech examined. Mr Garden in tliat speech had placed himself in a position where it would lie possible to deal with him. Garden talked about the British Empire, and uttered such poisonous stuff that the Government had instructed the legal advisers of the Crown to look into it and advise what action can be taken. . Garden's utterance was the most poisonous that had over been uttered about the British Empire. Words could not express his contempt for such a man. Those are the words of the PrimeM i nister. I now ask him, what has he done? Jrlas he received a report from the officers who were appointed to examine the speech ? He said that the utterance was the most poisonous that had ever escaped from the lips of any one in this country, and that words could noli express his den is still at large in this country, afree agent to express those sentiments again. From that day to this, the PrimeM i nister has not raised a little finger to deal with that man. Mr Garden would have been apprehended long ago but that he serves the purpose of this Government. One can draw no other conclusion from the leniency shown to a man who uttered the "" poisonous s t u f f "" referred to by the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) had something to say about that portion of this bill relating to transport, and it reminded one of the wild statements made at There was a the elections to try and associate the Labour party with the tying up of shipping. We can imagine the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) drawThe right honourable gentleman ing, for the edification of his electors, p it if u l and gloomy pictures of the sad plight of those who would not be able to ship their produce. There is, however, another side to that picture. The arch-offenders in preventing the shipment of the farmers' produce are those who sold over 40 of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers. If a crisis in the nation's affairs were to arise to-morrow, the farmers would find that they had been robbed of their most reliable means of shipping their produce to the other side of the world. While the Government perpetrated the grave injustice of handing the primary producers over to the shipping combine, the honourable member for Forrest and his' associates in the Country party sat meekly by. Although some honourable members opposite obtained hundreds of votes because they were able to make the people believe that they stood foursquare for providing facilities for shipping the farmers' produce overseas, the first thing they did in Parliament after the. election was to sanction the selling of additional ships that belonged as -much to the primary producers as to any other section of the community. The honourable member for Forrest also said that thousands of trade unionists voted for the Government, and that they were expecting legislation of this kind. I believe that the Government did get some of the»votes of innocent trade unionists. I would not say that those votes ran into thousands, but in all walks of life there are "" innocents abroad."" One can hardly imagine that a large number of trade unionists were led astray by the prospect of the Prime Minister filling the role of the new-born leader of trade unionism. Those who were led astray, however, 'when they read this b ill , will find themselves in danger* of being classed as criminals, and we can imagine them feeling now much as the unsophisticated visitors who have come to town from the country, and have handed their notes to a magsman to receive gold in exchange, may be expected to feel when they realize that they have",30,Setup

While waiting; for the fulfilment of what they are told will happen, they receive this bill, the second part of which specifically classes them, in certain circumstances, with criminals. Because the second part of the bill does that, honourable members .on this side ask the Government to put its industrial legislation into another bill. If the Government was serious in the statements made to trade unionists at the last election, it would bring down its proposals at once for improving industrial legislation. If it is not the intention of the Government to link genuine trade unionists with criminals, members of the Opposition will assist to place the undesirables in a category of their own. The Government has no mandate to do the things provided for in the second part of the bill, and no one knows that better than honourable members opposite. We, on this side, would not object to a bill -to deal with undesirables and alien wreckers-if there are such peoplebut no one can say that the Government has a mandate to. do the things contemplated in the second part of the bill. In truth, the Government has a majority because it was able to appeal to the passions of the people during a strike that was not an Australian but an oversea strike. At a time when the people were not able to see things in their true perspective, the Government made them believe that, in some mysterious way, the Labour party was responsible for the strike. party was not allowed to express its views to the electors. The only public man who did anything to endeavour to end the strike was the honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). He met representatives of the ship-owners and the men at a round-table conference. campaign I arranged for two ships to take eggs abroad, but the wealthy people prevented them from going. people were not allowed to know those' things; doors were closed against publicity of that kind. The Prime Minister did nothing to arrange a conference of the disputants; but, on the other hand, I believe he prayed day and night that the dispute might continue until election day. If there were a clause in the bill to provide for the deportation of persons who spoke against the strike during the election campaign, but prayed silently and reverently that it might continue until election day, the Prime Minister would be the first to be sent out of the Commonwealth. righteous man availeth much."" by the Prime Minister's actions, and particularly by his passive resistance, his pious hope was that the strike would continue until election day.

33,Mr Killen (Riverina) [4.52],"Imade by honourable members on this side; we stated our case plainly and truthfully. What is the connection between the Labour party and communism? of the Labour party is the socialization of the means -production, distribution, and exchange -sympathy with such men; but I repeat During the election campaign honourable members on this side mentioned that objective, and also the means by which the Labour party intended to achieve it, namely, the establishment of a supreme economic council elected by all nationalized industries. not communism in its Russian form, I should like to know what it is. Mr what communism has done for Russia. Theodore, one of the ablest leaders of Labour in Australia, speaking at a conference in Brisbane, said that the objective of the Labour party Was communism pure and simple. Yet notwithstanding that he strongly advised the conference to drop that objective, it was retained by a large majority. objective of the Labour party. If further evidence of the connection between the Labour party and communism be necessary, we have it in the action of a number of unions which, since the elecr tion, have attempted to expel communists from their ranks. Yet honourable members opposite say that there are no communists in the Labour movement! Queensland about sixteen communists only were expelled from the Labour party. ber said that the party contained no communists. General said that those men had nothing to do with the Labour party. secretary of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, went to a communist conference in Russia as the representative of Australia. Addressing that conference, he said that his council was governed by an executive of twelve members, eleven of whom were communists. He added that that council directed the policy of 120 unions. In the face of that declaration, honourable members opposite say that there is no connection between the Labour party and communism. to that conference .as a delegate from the Labour party. honourable members opposite are revoluof industry, tionary communists, or that they are in Mr Theodore's statement that the objective of the Labour party is the same as that of the communists. We all know what communism has done for -Russia. inember been to Russia? tion is available in Australia to show Nearly 2,000,000 of her people have been murdered by the communists, and their possessions taken from them. Wc know, further, that many millions more have died of starvation, the direct result of the revolution. The communists, . who were determined That objective is still the to abolish capitalists from Russia, are now imploring them to come to their country's assistance, in order to save millions more from dying. Notwithstanding these facts, there are men in this country who want to bring similar conditions upon Australia. Honourable members opposite have said that the menace of communism is merely 1 a bogy, seeing that there are only about 1,000 communists in Australia. People who argue in that way cannot be well informed. It would be more correct to say that the communists in Australia number 100,000. In .the last Senate election Donald Grant, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and a communist, polled 28,000 votes. Those votes are no true indication of the number of communists in New South Wales, because a great many communists will not vote for communist candidates until they consider that the time is ripe for effect to be given to the communists' objective. They believe that that objective should be achieved gradually, and that the Labour party is a stepping stone to that end. Donald Grant, when charged with having forsaken communism by joining the Labour party, assured his accusers that he was doing the most sensible thing in the circumstances. He meant that he would make the Labour party a stepping stone to communism. The Attorney-General, and the honourable",32,Setup

41,"I F That Is Mr Killen""","Sufficient informa-:member for Angas( Mr Parsons) mentioned some of tbe statements made by communists, including Mr Garden. Tbey did not, however, refer to Mr Garden's address on a recent May Day, when he saidLet May Day be a day of demonstration of a proud class consciousness, a declaration of war on capitalistic society. Forward to tlie new battle; forward to the world revolution ! That is a sample of the poisonous doctrines that are ' being disseminated. That is the kind which is demoralizing people, and giving them a false outlook on life. The proposed new sections 30c, 30D, 3 0 E , and 30j? w ill prevent such statements from being made and circulated. The result should be a better tone in the community. I hope that those proposed new sections will pass in their present form . It has been said also that this bill is au attack on trade unionism. It is nothing of tbe kind. Buti t is an attack on job control and direct action. No honourable member on this side of the House desires to interfere w i th legitimate trade unionism. Great numbers of trade unionists who realize that it w ill promote industrial peace and prevent the strikes which cause so much in jury, ' not only to the workers, but to all sections of the community, w ill rejoice when this measure becomes law. Honourable members opposite desire that the workers, while enjoying the benefits of arbitration, should have the right to flout the awards of the Arbitration Court. They cannot have it both ways. We must have either arbitration or no arbitration. The strike that occurred some months ago when a number of British seamen refused duty is regarded by some honourable members as of no consequence. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) described it as a "" l it t l e disturbance."" This industrial upheaval, which necessitated overseas shipping being held up for months, was responsible for a loss of £3,000,000, to say nothing of the distress suffered by the wives and families of the strikers. If this measure is passed, similar dislocation of our transport services will be prevented. I intend to support the bill because the Government should have power to deal with disturbances such as occurred during the strike of British seamen, and with revolutionaries who desire to bring about in Australia the unhappy conditions which prevail in Russia to-day. I regret that I cannot agree with many of the statements of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen), who, among other things, said that he thought there were at least 100.000 communists in Australia. Let me remind the honorablo member that my office in . Melbourne, which has been open for 37 years with some one in daily attendance, has not of propaganda been visited by one communist. I-could our young not locate a communist of the kind to which he referred if I tried. Communism, as preached by Mr Jock Garden, is a doctrine of which I do not approve. If communism as we know it today were the communism of Christ and His disciples, I would believe i u it . The communists are not supported by honourable members on this side of the House, but by some honourable members opposite. I agree with the opinion expressed by the right, honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who said that if these men had been paid to disorganize .the service of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers, they could not have done their work more effectively. In answer to a question asked last week, information was given to show that the Bay steamers travel faster than those of the Orient Company and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The vessels of the last-named company are not subsidized by Australia as mail steamers, as in employing coloured labour they are acting contrary to our White Australia policy. If the vessels of the Australian Commonwealth line of steamers are sold, the members of the Country party and the farmers who support them will have to transport their produce by vessels belonging to the shipping combine. The members of the combine do not mind spending a few millions in order to get all the trade into their own hands. In discussing this ma!ter with my son, who is a farmer in Western Australia, he said that the wheat growers were being robbed by the big men who bought the wlieat. I asked an old schoolmate of mine who has special business knowledge what would have happened if a wheat pool had not been formed, and he replied that John Darling and Son and other grain merchants would have purchased all the wheat they wanted to meet the local demand and the farmers would then",33,Setup
42,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.7],"have had to dispose of the balance in the best way they could, and in doing so might obtain only Is. per bushel for it . Australian Commonwealth line of steamers would be about as absurd as the action of past governments of New South Walesi n spending millions of pounds to construct tram lines to the Circular Quay in Sydney, and then allowing a private ferry company to carry the traffic over the harbour to No r t h Shore. All Australia's produce should be carried by government-owned railways and shipped overseas, by vessels under the control of the Government. Delegates appointed by the Government to visit Great Britain should always travel by the Bay steamers. 1 have nothing against the Orient Company which, in sending vessels out to compete for the Australian trade, employed white crews. I do not suppose any honourable member will disagree with me when I say that the Adelaide Advertiser is not a Labour paper. It is a Liberal publication, and this is the opinion it expresses on-the measure now before the HouseThe Attorney-General introduced the measure in a well -reasoned speech, spoilt a little lie could not do by the means previously by the frivolous facctiousness which passes for wit in university debating clubs and other places where callow youth gathers, but which has no place in assemblies of men. Speaking of Liberalism, the article continuesLiberalism alone can make Australia great; liberalism which knows no distinction of class, creed, or calling.. The article criticizes very severely the careless drafting of the measure, and refers to the meaning of the word "" sabotage,"" which is being used for the first time in a British statute. sabotage? can any honourable member define its meaning in such a way as to j u s t if y its insertion in this bill? The Advertiser also says that any one who advocates the sor-ession of a State from the Commonwealth, as has been done in Western Australia and Tasmania, w ill come under the provisions of the bill. The article continues-Similar carelessness is visible all through the bill, which reaches, in some sections, ' notably 30 ( i i ) , in its efforts to encompass all sorts of crimes against the Constitution, a vagueness which will, no doubt, horrify its framers when the High Court has finished interpreting it. The article goes onA second question which troubles one in reading this part of Part2 of the bill is that The sale of the vessels of the the measure, in its zeal to squelch revolution wherever it shows itself, says that societies are also to be suppressed which aim at the "" overthrow by force or violence of the established government . . . of any other civilized country, or of organized government."" To that we do not object. Honourable members should recall that Byron went to the assistance of Greece, and that Garibaldi was made welcome in England. Both men interfered in the affairs of countries of which they were not nationals. Garibaldi, indeed, became such a hero in the eyes of the British people that he was asked to leave England, as it was thought that the English people were becoming too fond of him. I quote from the Mercury, published in Tasmania, which no one who has any regard for verity w ill say is a Labour paper. In a leading article the following appears:After the election had followed the deportation fiasco, the problem of how to fulfil his promise to the electors was still before Mr Bruce, who found himself, however, in the difficult position of having received a "" mandate "" to do something which the High Court said adopted on the advice of his Attorney-General. The electors spoke with almost one voice against communism. They would have none of it. So we have this second attempt to deal with the problem. The bill, whatever its merits, bristles with difficulties. During the recent elections only 800 communists voted, and every vote they recorded was against the Labour party. Honourable members opposite cannot say that the communists did not give their second preferences to Nationalist candidates. The communists opposed Labour What is candidates in every constituency for The word is French, but which a communist candidate was available. Who found the money for them? They did not get it from the workers.. I stated in this House before the elections and on the platform during the campaign that I had no time for Walsh, Johannsen, or Garden, who served a purpose during the election in the way honourable members opposite desired. The members of the Deportation Board were paid the highest salary ever paid by a Commonwealth or State Government, excepting that paid to the Governor General.

There are some honourable members of our Country party who believe in the referendum, No. Let us make laws initiative, and recall, but they w ill not put it in their p l a t for m; they w ill not, But we should give the trust the people. However, let Government supporters' go on their way crushI f the ing down all opposition. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is as follows :-That all the words after the word No such measure is to bo "" That"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof:"" this House is of opinion that the bill should be withdrawn with a view to re-drafting so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to industrial disputes, as such clauses, associated with the Crimes Act, are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour. ' It is a reasonable request that the offensive provisions of . the bill should not Old-age penapply to trade unionists, and I cannot see why the Government does not accede to it . Gladstone's Coercion Act, introduced in the British House of Commons, on the night when Cavendish and Burke, who had been murdered in Phoenix Park, Dublin, were buried, contained provisions whose severity one might in the circumstances forgive, but section 32 providedNo agreement or combination which under the Trade Unions Act 1871 and 1876 or the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, is legal shall be deemed to be an offence against tins act. Thus the British Coercion Act especially exempted trade unions', and the matter at issue in this. Chamber to-day could be settled simply enough by the insertion of a clause exempting trade unions from the offensive provisions of the bill. I think my leader would agree to that. It would certainly be a way out of the difficulty, and would relieve the minds of many honourable members opposite who are not too pleased with the measure. However, I say to honourable members who are supporting the bill, "" Passi t , but always remember the turn of the wheel."" Labour will come into its own again, when,' perhaps, the abuse and malignity and which it has been so recently subjected will not be so powerful, or when, perhaps, some newspapers with old Liberal instincts will give it fair play. When that day does come, the present unholy combination of Nationalists* and the Country party will come to an end. Interest in this debate seems to have reached almost the vanishing point, and the question before the House, a simple but very important one, is whether the principles embodied in this amending Crimes Bill are worthy of our endorsement. In addressing himself to this measure,, there is great temptation for an honourable member to expatiate on the many excursions that have been made by honourable members of the Opposition. But I want, so far as possible, to resist that temptation, and to confine my atten. tion strictly to the measure itself. We have heard once or twice what I have never previously heard in this chamber from honourable members of the Opposition-the suggestion that, in the discusr sion of industrial matters, especially in discussing the settlement of industrial disputes,, we ought to resort to . sweet reasonableness, and honourable members have deprecated the principle of repression that is so apparent throughout this bill. I invite honourable members opposite to discuss the. bill in that spirit of sweetreasonableness which they so much desiderate. stantly hurling at one another's heads charges of insincerity and stupidity, and the like,, we introduced the spirit of sing this bill, I think we should make much more progress'. First of. all, let «us examine the objection that is being urged by honourable members to the inclusion in a Crimes Bill of offences connected witli industry. Honourable members seem to regard the inclusion of industrial offences in a Crimes Bill as an affront to the trade unions of Australia. But let us examine the matter quietly and in a common-sense way. What is a crime? Why should lionorable members phy at the word? 1 have taken the trouble to consult Webster's Dictionary, and I find that, in its simplest expression, a crime is "" au act which subjects the doer to legal punishment.''' Of course, there can be every shade of seriousness in a crime; but I cannot understand why honourable memmisrepresentation to bers should boggle at the word itself. Webster also defines ""crime"" as ""a grave offence against social order.'' I ask honourable members opposite to apply that very fair definition to the acta specified in the proposed new section 30J, to which they have raised so much objection. I think it will be agreed that each of the acts specified in that section is a grave offence against social order. Another thing that has struck me in this debate is the claim of the Opposition that the bill is a blow struck at trade unionism. I ask them to give honourable members on the Ministerial side credit for hones'ty and sincerity of purpose in a matter of this kind. I ask them to believe us when we say that we recognize the fine work that trade unionism has done for labour in the past, and that we have faith in its ability to do splendid work fbr the working classes in the future. gained in the past has been in face of strong opposition from the honourable member's party. on this matter previously, that labour has had to win at the point of the sword practically every inch of the way, but that is no reason why we on this side of the chamber should be saddled with all the iniquities of . those who have withstood labour in the past, or be credited with If , instead of conplacing in its path all the obstacles it has encountered.

Let me place opposite to that statement this significant f a c t: that the communist regards trade unionism as the chief obstacle to the achievement of his objective. One of the main tenets of all communists is the removal of this obstacle. They are logical,' for they say, id effect, "" As trade unionism is the chief obstacle to the achievement of our objective we must destroy it . "" Their method fbr bringing about its destruction is to join the trade unions for the purpose, not of strengthening them, but of eventually destroying them. set purpose of the nucleus of communists in every trade union in Australia is to create a left, or -militant, wing to serve their own purposes.

Could anything be more ludicrous than for the communists to write this when their avowed object is the destruction of trade I make bold to unionism? It is the height of hypocrisy for communists to tell trade unionists to get into a solid line to fight this measure, when they desire nothing more than to rout the unions.

In passing let me say that it is the existence of communism, which is the revolutionary party in the State, that renders such movements as the Fascisti necessary. It a l y was organized because of the revolutionary onset that was being made against constituted authority, and of the weakness of the existing government to combat it . It was instituted in pure self-defence. I wish to say quite definitely that I do not believe in force. But when force is brought into operation by one party the tendency is for the other party to counter it by force. That is exactly what happened in It a l y . I am told, and I have no reason to doubt -it, that there is what is called a Fascist movement in Australia; but it is very different from the ""Fascist movement in Italy. All movements must be judged by their declared constitution. I have in my hand a letter dealing with this matter, but it is very different from the letter read by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), which was proved to be an absolute and unmitigated fake. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition would himself admit that the evidence is sufficient to prove it so, and that he woUld be the last man in the world to judge the Fascist movement by its terms. My letter was written early in November last, in the following circumstances:A lecture was delivered in the Socialist H a l l, in Melbourne, by Mr C. O'Neill, chairman of the Overseas Strike Committee, in which he said that the Fascist movement must be nipped in the bud. He added that his party had its spies, one of whom he had caused to make application for membership in the Fascist movement. In answer to his application for membership, Captain Hatcher, who is evidently If that newspaper is a the head of the movement here, wrote a letter. I am sorry that I cannot myself read the letter, but perhaps, sir, with T h a t is another your permission and that of the House, my friend, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), w ill be permitted to It is amazing to me read it .

It is doing nothing of the kind. Honourable members opposite evidently did not listen carefully to the letter. The object of the movement is that when the government is taken unawares, or is overpowered, there shall be a body of its loyal supporters to come to its assistance. I ask honourable members to remember that if a constable who is responsible for the King's peace is engaged in the act of legally arresting without a warrant a person whom he has reason to suspect has committed a felony, is overpowered and finds it necessary, he can call on any private citizen to come to his aid and assist in the arrest of the offender. If the private citizen so called on, refuses, without lawful excuse, such aid, he is guilty of a substantive offence and may be prosecuted for an indictable misdemeanour.

RILEY -That should be sufficient. movement is taking steps to r i d itself of the poison that has got into its system, not only here but in the Old Country. Trade unionism to-day is doing its best to free itself from this revolutionary element. the slightest doubt about that. unionists find that it is a mighty hard job to drive the communists out of their ranks. They find it almost impossible. The Australian Labour party itself has come to the conclusion, in its wisdom, that it is well to exclude from membership p f the party men holding communistic views. The Labour party has taken similar action in the Old Country. A t the last annual meeting of the British Labour party held in Liverpool, in September last, by a vote of 2,500,000 to 500,000, a resolution was passed excluding communists from membership of the British Labour party. Honourable members will notice that there was a fairly substantial action. munist minority. the honourable member. There was a minority of 500,000 ' members of the party who believed it was not necessary to exclude these revolutionaries from the party. The spokesman of the minority,' It has been sugwhose name I forget at the moment, in severely condemning the resolution,, said that they would get into the party by some means or other. That is their determination, and they are relentless in their methods. They are determined to get into the Labour party and into the trade union movement. l o r . what purpose? No t to assist, but to destroy it . Their anxiety to white-ant the trade union movement is due to the fact that they know that in Australia and in Great Britain the trade union movement is the chief supporter of the political Labour party. They believe that if they destroy the trade union movement they will destroy the Labour party. Mr' WATKINS In whose interests would that be done? the communists. The communists regard the political Labour party with supreme contempt. They sneer at it for thinking that it will ever achieve its objective by constitutional means. They say that that cannot be done. They say, The trade union "" Our objective is the same as yours. You are reformers; you think you can reform things, but you cannot do anything of the kind. The only way is to destroy, and we intend to get a grip, not only of the trade union movement, but of the There cannot be Labour party, in order that we may Trade achieve our objective by destruction."" They contend that before a proper social order can be reared, it is necessary to destroy the existing one. It can only be done by destruction, in their opinion. I should look for approval from honourable members opposite of any blow aimed at that extreme element in the community that is a menace; not only to us of the general public living under and believing in the present system, but also to the Labour party. I should have expected the earnest support of legitimate trade unionism throughout Australia to any attempt to stop this communistic tide, and to expel from the body politic minority against such the poison that has got into it.

73,Mr Maxwell,"In the interests ofof this debate is worthy of remark. Membersof the Opposition have suggested that thisis a purely repressive measure, .that it will do no good,' and .that the Government,, instead of introducing measures for repressing and suppressing pro^ agenda, shouldsetto work to discover, and remove the root cause of industrial troubles. I think that we are all agreed that the most earnest endeavours ought to be made by every one who has the welfare of the community at heart to find out the causes of industrial troubles, and, having found them, to deal with them. But that is a very difficult task. The industrial trouble from which we are suffering, and which is manifest the world over, is not to be attributed to any single cause; it is the result of a complexity of causes. Surely, while we are engaged in investigating the causes, with a view to dealing with them, it is common sense to protect ourselves from the attacks of those who would overthrow and destroy the constructive work that has already been done by the community. I would remind honourable members of an incident in biblical history. In the time of Nehemiah, when the Jews were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, and enemies were about them in all directions, they found it necessary to protect themselves, and every man engaged in that work had a trowel in one hand and a weapon of defence in the other. That is just typical of the attitude that we, who are engaged in constructive work, must in these days assume. construct a form of society that will be true to fundamental principles, and while we are doing that we find it necessary to protect ourselves from attack by those who would overthrow all the constructive work we are seeking to do. Surely, for co-operation in a matter of that kind, we ought to be able to look with confidence to those who are the direct representatives of Labouri n this House. I now wish to come. to a consideration of the bill itself. I shall confine my remarks to the proposed new section 3 0 J , to which members of the Opposition have almost entirely directed tneir attention. It seems to me that in discussing this question members of the Opposition have assumed-a t least, their arguments seemed to indicate that they were proceeding on the assumption-that this bill deals with all industrial disputes. On e other feature That is not so. They appear bo have lost sight of the fact that it is directed at at certain definite industrial situation--the situation in which we find ouuselves when it. appearsto the Govenunent,. which is responsible for the peace and order of the comnra-nity for the time being, that a state of seriousindustrial disturbance exists. Before the provisions of a measure of this kind could be brought into operation, every effort that reason and common sense could suggestwould be made in order to effect a settlement. disputes has this Governmentsettled ? question. I am not dealing with the endeavours of this Government to settle disputes, and I am not here to pass judgment on it in regard to' any particular dispute. My object is to discuss the specific terms of this specific bill,' and I am seeking to point out that it is only after every effort has been made to avert a situation that has arisen that this measure will come into operation. Let us assume, for a moment, that, in spite of all endeavours to settle disputes that have arisen, a state of serious industrial disturbance, which prejudicially affects and threatens the well-being of the community, exists. The Government is faced with the duty of meeting that situation. How is it to be done? I have endeavoured to prove, as other honourable members have proved, that there exists in our community a party thathas as its avowed objective the prevention of the settlement of disputes and We are doing our level best to the overthrow of the ' whole industrial and social system. What could the Government do if a situation such as I have indicated arose and a proclamation had been made to that effect? W ill any honourable member of the Opposition be bold enough to say that, in those circumstances, any one fomenting a strike or promoting a lockout would not be guilty of a grave social offence? the circumstances. would., and that is the point I am making. The Government says that in those circumstances it needs to have power to deal with, men, or bodies of men, who are determined that industrial peace shall not be restored.

78,Mr Maxwell .,"Of course it would aggravate ihesituation that had been declared by proclamation to exist. I therefore cannot understand honourable members saying that ""any one guilty of such acts is not. guilty of a grave offence against the social order-a n offence which, according to Webster, constitutes a crime. I should like to call the attention of the Attorney General to an anomaly in paragraph 3 of the proposed new. section 30J.. It states what a strike or a lockout shall include. It provides that employers who, ' in combination, refuse to ;give"" work, if such refusal is unreasonable, shall be guilty of an offence. Thus, if employers in combination arc charged with refusing men employment, it must be proved that their refusal was unreasonable. But the paragraph goes on to say that if an individual employer., with a view to compelling his employees to accept certain terms, suspends work, he shall be guilty of an offence. There is no necessity in that case to prove that the suspension was unreasonable. In either case, if an offence is charged against either employers in combination, or employers individually, proof ought to be required that the refusal to give work, or the suspension of work, was unreasonable. Honourable members will further notice that the paragraph, in saying what a strike shall include, provides that where there is a cessation of work by employees in combination for the purpose of compelling employers to accept certain terms, there is no necessity to prove that the cessation is unreasonable; but if employees in combination, with a view to forcing employers to accept certain terms, refuse to work, that refusal must be proved to be unreasonable. ciple is involved in making it necessary to prove unreasonableness in one case but not in the other. Where an offence is charged either as a lock-out or a strike, the cessation or refusal ought to be proved to be unreasonable. With that safeguard I cannot understand the attitude of those members of the Opposition who say that the bill is a blow aimed at trade unionism. member consider it unreasonable if an of the settlement was the abandonment employer sought to reduce wages aud conditions of employment without .appealing to the court? member seems to f orget the' circumstances under which this bill would be put into operation. tory of the Arbitration Court, and Jt goes to show that it is impossible to prove a lockout. this bill is restricted to overseas and interstate trade.

When a section of the community represented by a union or a number of unions adopts a certain course to promote its own selfish ends, and, as a result, serious industrial unrest is created, the whole community suffers. A t that stage the Government should step in and declare that the interest of that section must be subordinated to the interest and welfare of I cannot understand what printhe general community. AndI cannot imagine any injustice resulting if, before any individual or a number of individuals can be convicted of an offence, a jury must be satisfied that the action complained of was, from the point of view of the general interest, unreasonable.

Tbere was no definition of the term, and the Marine Transport Group, in guaranteeing the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement, gave .an undertaking that if the seamen attempted to exercise job control, the unions constituting the group would bring pressure to bear to preveut such a development. During the whole of the discussion that preceded the settlement no question was raised as to the meaning of job control. Nevertheless, I think the bill would not be injured if the words "" and job control"" .were omitted from the definiparty to' the strike. It was iu no way tion of a strike. Practically every strike satisfactory. The party did not denounce is job control, because it is an attempt on the part of the employees to unduly control the business or industry in which they are engaged. illustrating the manner in which the disruptive revolutionary influence was at work, I call the attention of honourable members to the attitude of Australiau trade unions and the Labour party during the British seamen's strike. When the strike was declared people were naturally anxious to know what stand would be taken by the trade unions towards what was undoubtedly a defiance of constituted trade union authority. The Marine Stewards Union, of which Mr Moate was president, went to considerable trouble to ascertain whether the strike had the official sanction of the British Seamen's Union. Having learned that the strike was unofficial, it took a strong drawing upon his imagination. and definite stand. "" This strike being unofficial and involvcurately Mr Shelley's circular. I have ing a defiance of trade union authority, we cannot recognize it . "" Had the other unions adopted the same strong, definite, and understandable attitude the strike would have been over in a very short time. But they did not; they patted the seamen on the back, and assisted them to defy the autliority of their own union. That extraordinary attitude could be accounted for only by the influence in those unions of a revolutionary element foment trouble wherever possible, and prevent a settlement of the strike. of the Australian trade unionists was dicletter from whom, in denunciation of this tated by a desire to help the half-starved wives and children of the British seamen. Marine Stewards Union took the proper stand. No matter how much the stewards might sympathize with the seamen in their sufferings, they realized that there was a constitutional means of redressing grievances, and the authority of the Seamen's Union must be upheld. The unsatisfactory part played by the other unions was accounted for by the presence in their midst of the communists constituting the left wing, who preferred the strike in preference to constitutional methods. We were next curious to know the attitude of the Australian Labour the strike, and that is explained by its dependence upon the support of the trade unions. As constitutional means had not Eor the purpose of the whole-hearted support of the trade unions, they could not have the wholehearted support of the Labour party. I draw attention to another important fact. At one stage of the strike a definite and deliberate attempt was made by the communists to take the control of the strike out of the hands of the strike committee. The now famous circular issued in October by Mr Shelley, chairman of the Melbourne communist group, convened a meeting in the Temperance Hall, Melbourne, of the left wing of the trade union movement for the purpose of speeding up the strike, and at one blow destroying both the clutching shipowners and the traitorous trade unions leaders. not got it here, but honourable members will do me the justice of admitting that when I make a statement. I can generally support it with authority. As was to be expected, the circular created a hubbub in trade unions circles. things that the honourable member does not see; but that is no reason why we that was determined to should doubt their existence.

Mr Mathers, president of the Waterside Workersi n Albany, and later a delegate to the meeting of the federal executive of the union in Sydney, said in September or October last that the British seamen's strike, in its genesis, was promoted by the communists with a view to precipitate a general strike for revolutionary purposes. the legitimate trade unionist abhors communism. I believe that the Labour party abhors communism, and is doing its best to exorcise the monster, but wheu men who are. absolutely unscrupulous have invaded a movement their expulsion is difficult. annual meeting of the British Labour party, in September last, declared that the communists would get into the party some way or another, it showed that they would not stop at anything. We have the authority of Labour members in Australia who say that the communists are utterly unscrupulous in stooping to tactics of the most, degrading character in order to accomplish their ends. These are the men of whom honourable members opposite are trying to rid themselves. ourselves of them. Labour party have not done anything of the kind. If the interjection of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) is correct, and the Labour party and the trade unionists of Australia have r i d themcause it is absolutely sound in principle; selves of this unruly element, they have nothing to fear from this bill. They will be completely outside its scope, and it will leave the Government free to deal with those who are doing their level best to destroy the Labour movement. of reasoning. to put the position as it appears from my point of view. I have not yet heard a member of the Opposition take any act Mr forbidden by this section of the bill quietly and say, "" Here is something forbidden by the bill. I say deliberately that an individual or group of individuals Those were guilty of that act should not be regarded as guilty of a grave offence against the social order."" The members of the Opposition have dealt in the vaguest possible way with the whole question, and have referred to the measure as an affront to trade unionism. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) even went so far as to hint at this stage that communism was a mere figment of the diseased imagination of honourable members occupying seats on this side of the chamber. How any one can make such a suggestion in view of the overwhelming evidence from representaI admit that tive men from his own side passes my comprehension.

We heard much to the same effect from the Attorney-General. One would think from their remarks that Jock Garden spoke on behalf of the workers of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. One has only to look at his unsuccessful attempt to enter the New South Wales Parliament, when he and other communist candidates between them polled 800 votes only in a population of 2,000,000. Those voters were probably influenced by Jock Garden's oratory. It does not prove that they were communists. for 120 trade unions. ber for Riverina( Mr Killen) swallows what Jock Garden says; yet he calls other people dupes for taking notice of him.

Tlie good old times of playing at politics are gone. Revolution has stepped upon the stage. If , however, it so happens The honourable gentleman quoted that to indicate that communism was a real menace in Australia.

The Attorney-General wished to tickle the ears of his hearers when he read the statement. Mr Jock Garden was evidently guilty of plagiarizing Mr Pollitt's matter. This is what Mr Pollitt wrote' The shadow of communism is over the British Labour movement. All efforts to banish communism and communists are bound to fail. The good old times of playing at politics are gone. Revolution has stepped upon the stage. Except that the word "" B r it is h "" had been omitted, the statements of Mr Pollitt and of Mr Jock Garden arc identical.

133,Mr Forde,"Yes. In their endeaorable member for Fawkner complained bitterly of what was being written by Mr Jock Garden. He quoted the Workers' Weekly to show that Mr Jock Garden was associated Avith the l a b o u r party. If the Nationalists were sincere in their professed belief that these writings are a menace to the country, and tend to bring about a revolution, would the Government allow that newspaper to be registered for transmission through the post? stop that sort of thing. ready has power to refuse the registration of that newspaper. Under the W ar Precautions Repeal Act of 1920, the Government has ample power to prevent the distribution of what it calls the pernicious propaganda aimed at the overthrow of constitutional government, and incitement to revolution. which honourable members opposite quote the Workers Weekly shows that they do not wish to suppress it . Garden's addresses on communism are broadcast fro m Sydney every week. We must remember that this is the man who is said by the Nationalists to be a menace to Australia, and whose actions have -rendered necessary the introduction of this bill . If this were indeed a measure to deal with note forgers, criminals, and men who by force aim at the overthrow of constitutional government, honourable members on this side would be found supporting it . Our opposition is on behalf of the legitimate trade unionists of Australia. opposite did not want the votes of the communists, they would not be fighting for them. them, b u t for men like the officials of the Australian Workers Union. Has the honourable member forgotten that Jock Garden opposed a Labour candidate at the last elections i i : New South Wales, or that he came to Melbourne during the recent election campaign, and spoke on the Yarra bank, advising his hearers that if they put the Nationalists in , there would be no more industrial trouble; but that if the Labour party, were returned the shipping strike [42] would continue? A resident of Central Queensland, who is said to be a communist, and whose nomination the Labour party refused, said, about a week before the electionWe ought to throw the meat into the harbour, and sink all the boats if necessary. That statement was telegraphed throughout Australia as the opinion of a union leader, whereas it was not. It appeared in almost every newspaper. It was given T h is b ill is designed to prominence, but the reports of the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition were put in obscure places. reported at all. tion campaign the communist paper in Brisbane had a small circulation.

It is well that the veil of hypocrisy should be torn from the faces of those men who try to discredit the Labour party on the ground that it is allied with would be wreckers of the British Empire, and with men who desire to overthrow constitutional government. The clauses of this bill dealing with wreckers of constitutional government, and those who advocate force and violence, will not be opposed by honourable members on this side. The Labour party does not stand for note forgers, or for persons who would overthrow constitutional government, or If honourable members disrupt the Empire. We believe that those who advocate these things should be effectively dealt with. But we do intend to oppose strenuously the proposed new section 3 0 J , dealing with industrial disturbances, and providing that any person who takes part in or contributes or incites to, urges, aids, or encourages the taking part in , or continuance of, a lockout or strike, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable on conviction to imprisonment or to deportation.

This is be associated with what General (now Senator) ThompsonI do not stand for legitithen saidbrought There is another aspect of the strike matter, the scope of this bill. and that is this.

No doubt, when Mr Bowen said that there was little chance of arranging such a force at the present time, he had in mind the fact that Queensland was controlled by a Labour government that would probably deal with him if he made proposals along those lines. Thompson had made that statement the Nationalist party in Central Queensland passed a vote of confidence in him, and his candidature for the Senate was endorsed. Henry Barwell, who advocated black labour, he will soon be knighted for having the courage of his convictions. Honourable members opposite pose as friends of Labour, but they are wolves in sheep's clothing. I cannot find any clauses in the bill dealing with friends of the present Ministry, who may try to exert an unfair influence because of the financial assistance given by them to the Nationalist party during the recent campaign. were they supplied with? And where did all the money come from? A Nationalist told me on one occasion that it made him sick and tired of his party when he found that a member had no freedom, but was forced to dance to the tune set by those who supplied the thousands of pounds subscribed to cover the party's election expenses. Yet the party opposite talks of coercive methods being adopted by the Labour party. Mr 0. W. Campbell, president of the Employers Federation in Queensland, stated at the Employers' Cbnference in BrisbaneOn many and many a night we have gone up to the House when the Liberal Government was in power and secured alterations in the legislation going through, which have all been for your benefit. (Addressing employers;) ,'They were in touch with us all the time the -tramway strike was on. It was proposed at that meeting to establish a secret insurance fund which, it was said, would be used in the interests of the Employers Federation in any way thought desirable. It< was proposed to raise this fund by making a percentage levy on the amount of wages paid by employers, andi t was also laid down that they were going to coerce small employers who refused to come within the scope of the federation. Talk about unionists being coerced! Mr Bowen said' Now, having got the money, what is it to be used for? . . . It can be used, if it is found necessary, in the employers' interests in Parliament or in the municipality. After General Then he went on to refer to the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. Certain opponents of Labour claim that they believe in arbitration as in trade unionism. Of course, they are not all Probably, like Senator Sir as candid as the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook), for instance, who has openly declared that he would abolish the Arbitration Court. He would like a revival of the old principle of freedom of contract. Other honourable members hold similar views, but they prefer not to express them openly, because they fear the loss of the votes of certain workers in their electorates. Mr Bowen further stated at the conferenceNow we put through a Queensland Arbitration Act in 1916, which to-day is thrashing us right and left because it was not thoroughly altered during the time when it went tlirough the House, and because there was not a man in the House to closely watch it. . . . We want to be in a position to have money at our back, and to keep a man to watch our interests, and to pay for it. Of course, the employers desired to have a paid agent in Parliament, to fight the Arbitration Act. Yet honourable members opposite would have us believe that they favour arbitration. Would any of the reforms for which Labour has been responsible have been obtained had it not been for the self-sacrificing efforts of the union leaders throughout Australia, who, not for high salaries or social position, but because they believed that the demands of the workers were fair and reasonable, sacrificed time, money, and, in many instances, health, in the interests of the workers? As the honourable member for Fawkner had to admit to-day, all the success gained by Labonr in Australia has been won at the point of the bayonet.",52,Hatcher S Fascists

I propose to show the in consistency of the Nationalists, who by spurious and unfair propaganda misrepresented Labour prior to and during the election, and hoodwinked the people into voting for a continuance in power of the Nationalist Government.

General, in moving the second reading of the bill, saidI have never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to attain its objects by violence. Tlie platform of. the Labour party makes it perfectly plain that that party aims at securing its objects by constitutional methods. There cannot be the slightest objection to that. Continuing, he saidI have said numbers of times, and I repeat it now, that I do not, either directly or indirectly, suggest that in the ordinary sense the Labour party is a Communistic party or is allied with communism. Yet on the hustings honourable members of his party said: "" A vote for the Labour party is a vote for the disruption of the Empire and for the overthrow of constitutional government in Australia."" exactly what I said previously in the House. torney-General has been fairer than most honourable members on his side. In fact, he was the exception to the general rule observed by honourable members on his side-that any means was justified towards gaining their end. I remind them, however, that it is better to suffer an honourable defeat than to w in by dishonourable tactics, as some honourable members opposite have done. on the 29th June, 1925, just after the Immigration B ill was introduced by the Prime Minister, saidThe carefully-drawn Immigration Bill now before the House of Representatives is a notable feature in Australian policy. . . . The second part of the bill, conferring carefully-guarded powers for deporting malignant aliens and immigrants, is a natural supplement to the first. Since the war, Russia has scattered throughout the world a number of her own revolutionaries, as well as a proportion of unscrupulous adventurers. The offending immigrant or foreigner-n o Australian-born subject can be affectedI t does not say a word about the Britisher, l t tries to make the people believe that these are all beastly foreigners, and preferably men from Eussia. The article continuedmust be summoned before a board and given opportunity to .show reasons why he should not be sent out of the country. No man can dispute the honest Australian intentions of the bill without branding himself as a false speaker and. accusing himself of cowardice. He The Attorneyis either for the communist destroyers or against them; either for Australia or for the dictatorship of the foreign international. An article like this shows the tactics resorted to by journals like the A ge. When members of the Labour party oppose a bill because it aims a blow at industrial union leaders generally, they are told that they are standing for the Third Internationale and for a dictatorship from Moscow. B ut on the 3rd February, 1926, the Age again changed its tune. This was after the election. It said in discussing this b ill Ministers should also realize that in the minds of many of those who would willingly bo their friends there is considerable doubt as to the wisdom of much that is proposed. Even if legality were guaranteed, serious objection would be taken to certain provisions of the measure on the ground of their being injudicious and unjust. The bill is much too freely interlarded with references to persons I said on the hustings who shall be deported.

Any honourable member of the Labour party .who sought to discriminate between Australians and men from. the hub 1 of the British Empire, to the disadvantage of the latter, would be branded by our opponents as a disloyalist, and a traitor to the Empire, yet honourable members opposite can do so with i m punity.

The Ministry should be careful to avoid the folly of trying to combat Soviet insurgence by methods that savour of Czaristic autocracy. Could any language be stronger? the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) almost shed tears of indignation because honourable members on this side had said something similar to this. I have no doubt the honourable member, w ill say that the Age is r i g h t ; but it makes one think that his words to-night were part of a political stunt, and that his part was to. deceive the people outside, endeavouring to make them believe that the Labour party stood for lawlessness. produced no evidence in support of his assertions. generalities as to the way in which the allpged communists were corrupting Australia. turned a complete somersault. On the 3rd November, before the elections; it saidThe people are being asked' whether law and order or the principles of Bolshevism have their favour. . ' . . This is the main issue. . . . Bussia the wire-whiskers of Bolshevism, they bave their opportunity. And. of course, to impress that on the public, our friends opposite paid the very beet cartoonists to depict this awful bolshevik with long, wire whiskers seeking to devour some child, and they put the question, "" Do you stand for this, or for the Nationalist party?"" Those were the tactics they adopted; and .because they secured a chance majority they claim that they have a mandate to j a i l and deport legitimate trade union leaders. After the elections ithe Age, in its issue of the l l t h February, 1926, saidThe power the Government aspires to assume is drastic and unpredecented. Under the proclamation in question, the Government may, in what it decides -is a state of serious industrial disturbance, make a proclamation to that effect. While the proclamation is in operation, any person taking part in a lock-out or strike in relation to transport and Commonwealth public services will be guilty of an offence, for which he may be imprisoned. . . . Such a measure of power no Australian Government should get This Government must find some less dangerous way out. . . Australian citizens nave lingering memories of the arrogance and autocratic spirit that blossomed strongly in some politicians secure under the oegis of the War Precautions Act. . . . The Crimes Bill increases the number of offences. . . . To stamp certain acts crimes when ""there is no spontaneous sense of crime is merely to increase the number of potential criminals. Yet The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) endeavoured to make us think this evening that he was indignant because we were, in his opinion, insulting the trade unionists of Australia by suggesting that they would consider this bill an affront to them; but will he dare to disagree w it h the Age newspaper, which states what Labour members now say? common sense concerning this b ill . proceeded as follows:If the Government persists in keeping such a provision intact, it will display a perverse and unpardonable blindness to the elemental facts of industrial life.

In view of that statement some honourable If they want to banish to their native members opposite'will admit, perhaps, that our attitude is not unreasonable. But I point out again that the Age has turned a. complete somersault since the election. I amreminded that Pope, the poet, was so disgusted with the repetition of false statements during an 18th century election campaign that he immortalized an offender in this memorable couplet:Destroy his fib,.or sophistry-in vain;The creature's at his dirty work again The Government is endeavouring to besmirch the reputation of the Labonr",55,Hatcher S Fascists

161,Mr Forde,"That is so. The articleparty because it fears that ultimatelyat the end of three years, I confidently believe-w e w ill again occupy the Treasury bench, and w ill rout the Nationalists for a decade. As to the alleged connection of the Labour party with communism, I think there can be no disagreement among any reasonable, fair-minded citizens. The Labour party has definitely and effectively excluded communists from its political ranks. its attitude at this moment, I refer honourable members to the decision of the Queensland Labour Convention at Southport last week. It decided by 76 votes to fourteen that every candidate for membership of the Australian Labour party in Queensland must sign a pledge that he is not a believer in communistic doctrines or a member of any communist organization ; and that he w ill support the policy of the Australian Labour party and no other. stringent rule of that description. Mr Jock Garden, or anybody else with similar views, could accept lucrative employment from that body, and j o in its ranks. A t the last Federal Labour conference, and at successive Queensland Labour conferences, the following motions were carried: 1. That neither the communist party nor a branch thereof may he or become affiliated with the Australian Labour party. 2. That no inember of a communist party may be or become a member of the Australian Labour party. 3. That every man or woman desiring to hecome a member of a Labour organization must sign a pledge that he is not a member of the communist party. In order that honourable members opposite may be under no misapprehension as to the position in Queensland, I refer them to the following statement made to the Southport conference by MrW . H . Demaine, the president of the Queensland Labour executive, in regard to the communist pledge: Tliere are those amongst us who want to unduly hasten things -They are cataclysmic thinkers, able but fanatical, and there are others-onl y too many of them-wh o were mouthers of words, phrases, and shibboleths. These rally to them the-dissatisfied, the disappointed, and the disgruntled in our ranks, and. our capitalist opponents are only too ready to snatch at the disaffection caused, and with their powerful weapon, the press, only too often influence the unthinking and stampede them. The Australian Labour party, cannot continue to suffer this disturbing and disrupting element, nor is it prepared to accept the idea of communist permeation or white-anting. Evolution and revolution cannot march side by side. He that is not with the Labour movement fully and solidly is against, and he must get out of it. That is how, to my mind, the matter stands. Andi t is what has impelled the QC.E. to take up the attitude it haa taken in the matter of tbe anti-communist pledge. It is for this convention to decide between it and those who are aiming at disruption. ThatI f definite proof be required of is the big issue, and on the decision made so will the future of the movement be. Following that it was decided, with only fourteen dissentients, to adopt the anticommunist pledge. The fourteen voted against the motion, not because they were communists, but for the reason that they thought it to be unnecessary on the ground that the number of communists in Queensland is negligible. I have said sufficient to show clearly where I stand on The Nationalist party has no this matter. That portion of the b ill that deals with those who advocate the overthrow of constitutional government"" by force and those who bring themselves into conflict w i th the law in connection with note forging, and the associated .matters, I believe in , and I , w it h my party, w ill support those clauses; but the other por-. tion, calculated to strike a blow at trade unionism, I liken to a wolf in sheep's clothing, and I shall oppose it to the utmost. The effort of the Government to scare the country into believing that the communist octopus is about to devour the people is ridiculous. The provisions of the bill which deal with industrial matters I consider to be a blow aimed directly at trade unionism. The Government would be wise to adopt the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). Honourable members opposite should be reasonable and f a i r. I can quite understand that they find it difficult to do other than obey the dictates of those who supplied the money for their election campaign; nevertheless, they should remember that they owe. a duty to the great body of the electors. They are realizing how hard it is to be fair to the workers of Australia and at the same time serve their masters. . The time is undoubtedly coming when notice w ill have to be taken of the constructive proposals made on many occasions by the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr. Scullin) for giving the workers some measure of control in industry. That is the way to bring industrial harmony. The employer and employee can, in that way, work in greater harmony. If employees are given a measure of responsibility, aud treated with that consideration which is their due, industrial disputes will be almost eliminated, and peace and contentment will reign throughout Australia. This objective will not be achieved by coercive and repressive measures of this description, which can only cause rancour, bitterness, and hatred.

164,"Mcgrath, D. C. Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [9.55]","Ion Friday. The Government is at the present time inviting tenders for the supply of steel sleepers for a portion of the north-south railway, the construction of which is likely to be commenced within a very few months. to Daly Waters. made a condition of tbe contract that the sleepers shall be supplied in three shipments. I am informed by an Australian firm wishing to tender that the condition requiring the supply in three shipments is a distinct advantage to a foreign contractor, or importer of steel sleepers from abroad. I feel sure that the Minister desires that every consideration should be shown to Australian manufacturers of steel sleepers. The firm desiring me to make these representations suggests that the Minister might so alter the conditions of contract as to permit of the supply of the sleepers in monthly instalments, and to provide for monthly progress payments. I understand that there is only one firm at present in Australia in a position to tender under the terms of the contract as proposed. I believe that there are other firms in Australia worthy of encouragement and assistance who would bo in a position to tender if the Government altered the terms of the contract in such a way as would faeilitate better financial 'arrangements being made than are possible under the conditions that have been decided upon. I ask the Minister to reconsider the terms of the contract, so that Australian manufacturers may not be placed at a disadvantage and manufacturers abroad given an advantage in the supply. of sleepers required for Commonwealth railways. I wish to say a few words in connection with a quotation from -what is, for me, a very unusual source of information. It is from one of the most Tory papers in Australia. I refer to the Hobart Mercury. It refers to what is known as the Australian meat position on the London market. After discussing various matters relating to the sale of meat in London, the article goes on to sayBut that there are other steps to ho taken witli a prospect of great advantage is pretty well illustrated by such a disclosure as thatmade in yesterday's sales of the prices at which Australian meat is -being sold in London. Works and Eailways) [10.3] I shall That beef, after being sent across the world, should be sold in London at 5id. a lb. wholesale, and retailed at Is. 4d., and mutton 7d. per lb. wholesale, retailed at Is. 10d., ia a positive scandal. It indicates that wholesale buying by producing governments and purchase by the British Government for distribution at a fair margin is one of the business steps likely tq be taken. Last year, when the MacDonald GovernI understand that it is ment was in office in Great Britain, and wn were discussing the exportation of other products from Australia, I quoted a remark by Mr Baldwin, the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, who was then Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. ' A discussion had been initiated by Mr Johnson, the member for a Scottish constituency, in the course of which Mr Baldwin asked, "" What is to prevent the British Government from buying overseas products and distributing them to consumers in Britain at a reasonable price?"" Mr Philip Snowden, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, said, "" I can assure the right honourable gentleman that his suggestion will receive the most earnest consideration of the Government."" In spite of that statement, nothing, as far as I know, has been done; but now a very conservative journal in this country, which cannot be regarded as prejudiced on this question, has expressed itself in terms almost identical with those I have just quoted. I understand that the Food Council of Great Britain is considering the marketing of products, particularly of meat, from Australia. I should' like to know whether the Prime Minister is in touch with that council, and is prepared to make a suggestion to the Prime Minister of Great Britain that something should be done by the Australian Government on this side, and the British Government on the other side, with the possible collaboration of other Dominion Governments, so that the producers may receive a better prieo for their products, while the consumers purchase them at a cheaper rate? Between the producer and the consumer some one is making enormous profits. Mr Bell, of Queensland, had something to say on this subject recently, and Mr Angliss, in Victoria, has told us that some one is making large profits out of Australian meat in Great Britain, MT.

The figures I used were not quite the same as those referred to by him. His figures were 6-J'd. and Is. 4d. The figures I used were based upon the price received in Australia by the producer for cattle on the hoof, the cost of transportation over 12,000 miles, and handling charges at both ends. The price ruling was about 3£d., but the same meat, after going round the corner, was retailed to the consumer at about 9d. That was one of the strongest points I made at the Economic Conference to demonstrate that there was something hoplessly wrong with the distribution system in Great Britain. I indicated five specific schemes which, I believe, are practicable. I said that they demanded the most serious consideration, for it was necessary to lessen the disparity between 'the price received by the producer and that paid by the consumer. As the result of my representations the Imperial Economic Committee was appointed. There was some delay in the appointment of that committee, but it has now issued a general and a meat report. The subject has been very fully investigated by that committee. A commission, appointed under the presidency of Lord Linlithgow, has also investigated the question of the distribution of foodstuffs, including that phase of the subject mentioned by the honourable member. The distribution system in Great Britain, including the comparatively small amounts received by the producers, not only in the dominions, but also in Great Britain, for their products, is being investigated as fully as possible.
