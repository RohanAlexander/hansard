That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalisation of health services which will lead to impersonalised and mediocre standards of medical care, the creation of a huge new bureaucracy, and will limit the citizen's freedom of choice. That the present health scheme can be amended to overcome existing deficiencies, and that the proposed scheme is totally unnecessary. Your petitioners -therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That they oppose the Australian Health Insurance Program and any National Health 'Scheme; That they wish to retain the right to choose their own medical care by selecting a General Practitioner, Specialist or any other medical classification of their own choice under the present conditions in private consulting rooms and also the right to choose an intermediate ward or private hospital of their own choice. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measure to interfere with the existing health scheme. And your petitioners, as in respectfully shows: duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Adermann, Mr Bonnett, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr Corbett, Mr Jarman, Mr Katter, Petitions received. 16758/73-R-[129 ] National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Coates, Mr Cooke, Mr Brury, Mr Petitions received. Television To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the undersigned men and women of Australia believe in a Christian way of life; and that no democracy can thrive unless its citizens are responsible and law abiding. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will see that the powerful communicator, television, is used to build into the nation those qualities of character which make a democracy work-integrity , teamwork and a sense of purpose by serving, and that television be used to bring faith in God to the heart of the family and national life.

Z Vour petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per capita grant additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage. 3. The reduction of the present per capita grants will impose great hardships on many parents who have chosen, at personal sacrifice, to send their sons and daughters to independent schools. Further, the curtailment of the said grants will create divisions in the community. 4. Parents should be encouraged to contribute to education. The proposed legislation penalises those who do contribute, and endorses the apathy of those who do not contribute. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should acknowledge the right of every Australian child to equal per capita grants of government -money spent on education, and so instruct the proposed National Schools Commission.

Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Further, they believe that by Mr Birrell. this economic support should be in the form of per capita grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. 2. Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per capita grant additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools. 3. The reduction of the existing per capita grants will impose great hardships on many parents who have chosen, at considerable personal sacrifice to send their sons and daughters to independent schools. Indeed the curtailment of the said grants will create divisions in the community. 4. Some independent schools of high educational standards will be forced to close with the consequences that children attending those schools will have to attend government schools already over taxed and under staffed. 5. Some independent schools have been encouraged to lower standards in order that their parents may continue to receive per capita grants. 6. Parents should be encouraged to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their children. The proposed legislation will penalise parents who try to exercise this choice, and discourage them from making a vital financial contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should acknowledge the right of every Australian child to equal per capita grants of government money spent on education. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Jarman and Mr Mathews. Petitions received. Television To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned employees of the Australian television industry respectfully showeth: That should the Government allow the importation of colour television sets and component parts into Australia, the skilled and efficient workers employed in the Australian television industry may be deprived of their livelihood and Australia would lose the benefit of their developing technical expertise. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives urge the Government to take all necessary action to ensure that the television industry and those employed in that industry are not disadvantaged by allowing the importation of colour television sets and component parts into Australia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of Australia shows: That your petitioners strongly believe that it is the right of every Australian citizen to have freedom of choice of medical and hospital care. We also believe that every Australian citizen is entitled to adequate and competent medical and hospital care no matter what level of income he receives. We believe that if the proposed National Health Scheme is based on the Deeble Report, it will immediately for some, and ultimately for all citizens take away their freedom of choice of medical and hospital care. It will also take away the autonomy and independence of private hospitals, as will be seen from paragraphs 3.31 and 3.43 of the Report. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled instruct the Minister that the National Health Scheme should acknowledge the right of every Australian citizen to a free choice of medical and hospital care, and should guarantee the right of independence of the private hospitals. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Erwin. Petition received. Firearms To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That they oppose the proposed control of firearms by recording of ownership because it means that they must submit to a degrading process of seeking references as to their mental health and supply reasons as to why they should be allowed the favour of possession of a sporting firearm. That decent people will be put to great inconvenience and expense merely to get their name, address and phone number recorded and that such controls will affect the personal liberties Your of more than 20 per cent of the voting public.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to include 'God Save The Queen' in any referendum or poll held for the purpose of deciding the future of a national anthem.

Northern Territory National Park To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled: This humble petition of interested citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: 1. Tbat there is widespread public concern over the delay of the Commonwealth in promulgating a Top End .(Kakuda) National Park in the Northern Territory in a region which a former Minister for the Interior has described as 'ranking with the Great Barrier Reef and Ayers Rock as a major tourist attraction'. 2. That in the seven years since the Northern Territory Reserves Board first notified its proposal the area, despite frequent representations and objections to the Minister, has not yet been reserved. 3. That over the intervening years the area concerned has been subjected to pastoral leases and mining prospecting authorities and it is now proposed to build a road into the region, which will further damage this magnificent possession. 4. That the proposed National Park is rich in Aboriginal paintings, unique fauna, unique flora and dramatic scenery; also there is an apparent meeting of plant life from the east coast with that of the west, a phenomenon found nowhere else in Australia. petitioners therefore humbly pray that your least 1436 square miles as recommended by the And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever Petition received.

(b) That whales are highly intelligent, highly evolved creatures. (c) That there is growing international concern at the continued killing of whales for commercial gain. (d) That synthetic products are able to fully replace all whale products. (e) That Australia continues to operate a whaling station and to import whale produce. (f) That Australia supported a proposal to enforce a ten year moratorium on all commercial whaling at the 25th meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in London, June 25-29, 1973, Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the members in Parliament assembled will move to immediately revoke all whaling licences issued by the Australian Government and to reimpose a total ban on the importation of all whale produce.

That the disbanding of this Unit would strip the First Recruiting Training Battalion of a necessary military and public relations organisation, pamphlet which contains a number of questions and would reduce the employment at the many local events at which this band has in the past played. That we furthermore believe that this disbandment would be detrimental to army music in general, as a training ground for potential musicians would be lost. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives urge the Minister for Defence to reverse his decision to disband the Military Band at Kapooka. by Mr Fairbairn. Petition received. the Minister for Services and Property. What is the estimated cost of conducting the referenda on 8 December next? Secondly, will, the Minister ensure that official publications by the Electoral Office use correct English and refer to 'referenda', not 'referendums'? give the honourable member the exact cost, but I have it available and I may be able to give it to him before the end of question time. The second part of his question will be taken into consideration. Naturally his request will be fulfilled because when legal men of his great capacity put these matters forward we always like to give them the consideration to which they are entitled. ister for Health been drawn to a leaflet entitled 'The National Health Insurance Program-The Plain Truth' circulated in the Australian Capital Territory by the General Practitioners Society of Australia? In particular, I ask whether the Minister's attention has been drawn to the question and answer in this booklet as follows: Q. What hospital benefits would I get? A. You will be able to obtain a public hospital ward bed, with up to 30 other patients. You will have to take out additional private insurance if you want a private room or private hospital treatment and the doctor of your choice. conditions that now exist in the Australian Capital Territory? Dr EVERINGHAMI have seen this and I suppose this particular one is the only one with special relevance to Canberra hospitals. I think that when it speaks of up to 30 beds it may be taken as misleading if it is taken by people in the Australian Capital Territory to refer to Canberra's hospitals. We have at Woden Valley Hospital and Canberra Hospital4 beds in the great majority of wardsa few may have six-and also single bed wards which are quite modern. In one or two areas in the obstetrics and geriatric departments there are up to 6 beds and there are a few temporary geriatric wards at Canberra Hospital with 10 beds. These will cease to exist when we complete stage 2 of the Woden Valley Hospital which should be early in April next year. the Minister for Immigration. Why is it that people who have Australian passports, and who therefore have been appropriately investigated, every time they leave Australia or return have to fill in a detailed questionnaire, stating their matrimonial status, their past marriages, whether they are widows or otherwise? Why does the Minister require this information? Or is it just a hangover from over zealous statisticians collecting useless information and requiring computers to put it through? passport, he can come and go as an Australian citizen without any let or hindrance. If he applies for a further passport certain requirements have to be met which are designed mainly to ensure that no matrimonial difficulties have arisen in the meantime and to ensure also that protection is given to children.

When he was in China recently did he call on Prince Norodom Sihanouk with the Australian Ambassador to China, Dr Fitzgerald, and his personal private secretary, Dr Wilenski? Was this visit made against the advice of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and did those who had advised against the visit include the then about-to4>e Secretary of the Department, Mr Alan iRenouf? Is it true that over the weekend his Government has announced Australia's withdrawal from the currency stabilisation agreement entered into with a number of other countries to back the currency of the Khmer Republic under the Lon Nol Government? Will the Prime Minister advise this House why the Australian Government took fhe decision it did at the weekend? Will he advise the House whether any assurance was given to Prince Norodom Sihanouk as to this action at the time of his meeting in Peking and will he assure the House that there was no request or undertaking given from either party at the time of that Peking visit that in any way related to the announcement by the Australian Government at the weekend? of all the questions the honourable gentleman mischievous motives to the honourable gentleasked me. I shall, however, answer those of man. The honourable gentleman spoke yesterwhich I was able to take a note. Yes, on my day as if Dr Kissinger and I had correlatest visit to PekingI conferred with Prince sponded in the context of the alert which Norodom Sihanouk in the company of Dr applied on 25 October 1973 to the United Fitzgerald, our Ambassador to the People's States including, without official information Republic of China, and Dr Wilenski, my principal private secretary. Dr Fitzgerald took a note of the conversation and has given it to the Department of Foreign Affairs. I did not discuss with officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and specifically I did not discuss with the secretary designate, Mr Alan Renouf, whether they thought that I should or should not confer with Prince Norodom Sihanouk. I have answered questions in Peking and in Canberra about my visit. The Australian Government considered the quesion of continuing to support the currency stabilisation arrangements in Cambodia as a result of the Coombs taks force report which honourable gentlemen have had available to them for nearly 3 months. No announcement was made by the Australian Government last weekend; the only announcements appear from the decisions on the Coombs task force report. If there is a ceasefire in Cambodia, as there has been now in Vietnam and in Laos, the Australian Government will reconsider the utility or propriety of helping to stabilise Cambodia's currency. I might add that the Australian Government will do all it can to bring the hostilities in Cambodia to an end. It will do nothing to protract those hostilities by support, military or economic, for either of the contending parties. addressed to the Prime Minister.

He took the opportunity to assure me of his intention to consult willi me and our representatives about America's efforts to bring about a cease fire in the Middle East. He wrote on 20 October. On 21 OctoberI wrote back assuring him of our complete support in his efforts to bring about a ceasefire and saying that we would apply those efforts both in the Security Council and outside. LaterI forget the date-appreciatio n was conveyed, but not in a letter, of the efforts of Australia's ambassador to the United Nations as President of the Security Council.

He then said: Although Repatriation medical benefits are not specifically mentioned, persons eligible for full medical benefits from Repatriation funds and for free treatment in Repatriation hospitals would almost certainly be described as covered. So honourable members can see that the assumptions of the honourable member for Hotham were quite wrong. If, in fact, he makes allowances, as I have indicated, for the double cover of people receiving repatriation benefits but who are forced to take out private hospital and medical insurance and for people entitled to pensioner medical services who under the present system for procedural items of specialist care and for non-public ward treatment also have to take out private medical and hospital insurance-o n the medical side there is quite a large number-the figure that I have cited would tend to overstate the degree of the cover in the community.

(The document read as follows)Dear Mr Hayden, I thank you for your letter of today's date in which you have asked for confirmation of a telephone statement on the coverage of 'Persons covered by Hospital and Medical Expenditure Assistance Schemes'-the Preliminary Statement published by this Bureau in May 1972, and for an outline of Schemes other than the Pensioner Medical Service which are embraced in the term 'non-contributory'. 2. I confirm that the survey did not specifically include in its questionnaire reference to cover by Repatriation in medical services but on the other hand it did not specifically exclude such cover. 3. The respondent was first questioned as to whether he was covered by a hospital or medical benefits fund. If he said 'yes', he was further questioned as to who paid into the fund or scheme. An acceptable answer was 'coverage is free'. If he said he was not covered by a fund he was further ance scheme which cost nothing. 4. The specific instructions to help interviewers mentioned the following examples of free coverage for hospital and medical benefits. Persons in receipt of: age pensions invalid pensions widow's pensions sheltered employment allowance service pensions certain persons undergoing rehabilitation persons receiving an allowance under the Tuberculosis Act dependent wife (or other female) children or student children of the foregoing persons persons receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits low income families entitled to medical coverage and hospital benefits migrants who have joined a scheme-pai d for by government for the first two months 5. I do not have any more exhaustive list of the schemes of a non-contributory nature. Although Repatriation medical benefits are not specifically mentioned, persons eligible for full medical benefits from Repatriation funds and for free treatment in Repatriation hospitals would almost certainly be described as covered. On the other hand if there were partial entitlement only, it is possible that a person could describe himself as not covered. This would be in line with the Queensland experience where many persons have been recorded as uncovered, because they have no medical coverage, and do not regard hospitals as being covered by a scheme.

Is it a fact that the new easy visitor system which he introduced earlier this year has been suspended? If so, does he intend to reintroduce the system and if so, when? visitor system which I introduced earlier this year has been suspended. It continues in all but a limited number of locations where the system was suspended because of the situation that existed in regard to international terrorists. I am pleased to say that generally speaking the system is working well. It is still in force and it has brought from some areas a considerable increase in the number of visitors. I stress that the system can proceed only on the basis that those who come as visitors fulfil the conditions of their visit and return at the end of it. The visas are not interchangeable. I add that I am particularly pleased with the precautions that have been taken in certain locations where there have been international tensions and a danger of terrorist activities. Those precautions have kept Australia free from incursions which might otherwise have taken place. So in conjunction with other agencies of state I am particularly pleased with the success of the continuing precautions that we will take there. That means that in a limited number of locations the easy visitor system will continue to be suspended. But generally speaking the system is in operation; it is working well. to the Treasurer. Has the Australian dollar been revalued by approximately 2 per cent since the beginning of November due to the fact that it is tied to the American dollara practice described by one Minister as one that is adopted by mugs and hillbillies? Is this revaluation by stealth advantageous to Australia or does it indicate that economically we are not masters of our destiny in this real area of national interest? to this House the independent action that has been taken on at least 3 occasions by the present Government in regard to the exchange levels. When one currency rate moves, whether it is the yen or the United States dollar, it does have some impact on our currency. The answer I give about exchange rates is-and I am pleased to be able to repeat it in this House: The Australian exchange rate can stay where it is; it can rise; it can fall; it can float. I have all options still open. Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that spokesmen for the Liberal and Australian Country Parties and the Australian Democratic Labor Party have decided that the answer to the present second rate pensioner medical service, which they uncritically supported during the previous Government's term of office, is to enrol pensioners in the subsidised health benefits plan? Have these spokesmen also criticised Labor's scheme on the ground of its excessive cost? Will the Minister inform the House as to the cost of enrolling pensioners and other low income groups in the subsidised health benefits plan? Will he also indicate how this would benefit these low income groups? What other groups may benefit from this arrangement? to benefits under the pensioner medical service were to be covered by the subsidised health insurance program-assumin g that were possible because every effort to cover all people so far has failed with only four in every 100 low income families being covered so far-man y of them would in fact be squeezed out because the income eligibility levels are much lower than they are for the pensioner medical service. It would mean that 650,000 single pensioners and 65,000 married pensioners would be squeezed out. Under the pensioner medical service the income eligibility level for a single person is $49.50, including pension, and for a married couple it is $86.50, with the levels rising in relation to any additional dependant who might be involved. It is inconceivable that either the Liberal Party or the DLP would want to squeeze people out from the benefits that they currently enjoy.

43,Mr Hayden,"If those pensioners entitlednot currently covered would be covered by the subsidised health insurance benefits scheme. The costing within my Department indicates that if this were done the additional cost of covering pensioners would be $160m and for non-pensioner people who would come into the scheme the cost would be $140m, making a total of $300m. This would be additional to the total cost of the present scheme, including the pensioner medical service, hospital benefits, repatriation and local medical officer services. Our scheme will cover everyone in the community. It will cover them all automatically, including groups which currently miss out on the subsidised health insurance scheme as it relates to the present system of health insurance, at no extra cost than the total cost of the present scheme which covers only 87.7 per cent of the population. An additional $300m is a lot of money for a first aid effort to patch up a virtually defunct scheme. the Prime Minister. He will recall the comments by Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd that the Prices Justification Tribunal had not given an explanation of the grounds on which it, the Tribunal, reached its decision on BHP prices and the Tribunal's own comment that it had not been given the criteria it needed to make its decisions. Does the Prime Minister regard such a stab in the dark method as satisfactory? Will he give an assurance that if the Government is given price and income control powers proper criteria will be laid down for the applideserves the support of the Parliament. When, cation of these powers? Finally, will the Prime Minister make it clear to the Australian people before they vote on 8 December just what these criteria will be? certainly did not use any such term as 'stab in the dark'. I remember that comments were made by BHP on Mr Justice Moore's findings early in the year and again on the findings of the Prices Justification Tribunal last month. I do not dispute the right of BHP to make these comments. In fact I appreciate that BHP has so willingly accepted the Government's policy in this respect and has abided by the findings of the judges who have inquired into the Company's affairs. It was a matter of deliberate policy by the Government to have the Tribunal established and to have good appointments made to it so that we could observe the whole system in practice. We did not presume to ask the Parliament to lay down guidelines for the conduct of the Tribunal. We believed that the persons we were appointing to the Tribunal would be in an excellent positiona better position in fact than at this stage members of the Parliament on either side are-to draw up such guidelines. We want to give the Tribunal an opportunity to work these matters out in practice. Where it becomes clear that amendments are desirable to the Act we promptly will sponsor those amendments in the Parliament. blindly in that case on what you actually intend to do. repeat that it is desirable to have an unchallengeable right in this Parliament to establish a prices justification tribunal. So far none of fhe bodies which have come before the Tribunal has defied itsfindings,but there is doubt as to the sanctions which can be applied by the Tribunal. When the Parliament gets power to pass laws with regard to prices it will put the powers of the Tribunal beyond challenge. Nevertheless there is no reason at this stage to suggest that the Tribunal is not acting with complete propriety and justice. It is hearing all sides. It is giving its reasons. I believe the public is supporting the method of operation of the Tribunal. Nobody has cavilled at the appointments and I believe the Tribunal as it will, the Tribunal makes reports to the Parliament it will be entitled to suggest amendments to legislation. This is what happens in the annual report of the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and in the annual report of the Trade Practices Commissioner. One would expect that the President of the Prices Justification Tribunal similarly will feel free to make suggestions for alterations to the basic statute. I can assure the House that the Government will act promptly on any recommendation that the President makes in his annual report or which he makes on any interim occasion. I believe the Tribunal is acting in the way that the Parliament expected when it passed the Act and as the public would hope.",27,Pensioner Medical Service

Out of the several who appeared in the the last sentence of the last paragraph of the last chapter, he will see that the paper states: The total net cost to the Budget, including the insurance scheme. That is, there is no greater cost to be borne by the community. Let us be clear on this: Our scheme automatically will cover everyone in the community for the same cost as the present scheme incurs. But the present scheme does not cover everyone and never can, even with massive injections of the community's money. That is the only response inadequate, as it is, that has come from members of the Opposition. Let us be clear that these are the people who had the present system of health insurance in operation for more than 2 decades and at the end of that time the scheme was still seriously defective and riddled with anomalies.

If he wants me to seek permission I will be very happy to seek it and to table the letter. The fact is that the honourable gentleman is trying to make mischief in this context. As I said in an answer at question time, Dr Kissinger wrote the letter which he delivered through the American Ambassador, praising our efforts in the chair at the Security Council to bring about a ceasefire, assuring us that he would be consulting with us and saying that he would be going to Moscow. PromptlyI assured him that we would do all we could in the Security Council and outside to bring about a ceasefire, applauding his initiative in going to Moscow and wishing him well in it. There was nothing that anybody could derive from Dr Kissinger's letter in the least way critical of the Australian Government's actions, reactions or initiatives.

I will refer to this later. I should state from the start that no doubt when arrangements were made to. allow this access the arrangements were entered into with the best intentions and generally, I expect, they were entered into when contemporary attitudes towards personal privacy were not as keenly developed as they are today. The original 1908 Invalid and Old Age Pensions Act made no provision for the protection of privacy, so I am advised. The first occasion on which specific provisickness benefits and special benefits were sions regulating disclosure of information granted last year. This personal information about clients was included specifically in legisin most cases includes full details of their lation occurred in the Child Endowment Act financial position, their assets, legacies, per1941. This was repeated in subsequent legislasonal business/ financial transactions, as well tion. The Social Services Consolidation Act as their whereabouts.

This was included in or married, who was the father of the child section 17 of that Act which, with amendand so on because of our payment of materment, is the same section providing regulation nity allowances. As honourable members can in this matter in the Social Services Act 1947see there is considerable potential in such 1973. I will refer to this section again shortly. records, if they were to get into the wrong I understand from verbal advice I received hands or through abuse of privilege, for from an officer of my Department that access embarrassing or even damaging misuse. to personal files held in the Department by non-departmental sources can be traced back to 1934 and probably extends to even earlier explanation of the legislation controlling the dates. In 1948 the then Minister for Social SerSocial Services Act is the relevant section and vices, Senator McKenna, seems to have felt it says: some concern about the way in which access to personal files was available. He sought to General so directs, before entering upon his duties, regularise the procedures. I dare say that at or exercising any powers or functions, under this Act, that time, a quarter of a century ago, Senator make before a Justice of the Peace or a CommisMcKenna's efforts were in harmony with conwith temporary attitudes; but that is too far back in the dim distant past for me to have clear except in the performance of his duties, or in the recollections of what contemporary values exercise of his powers or functions, under this Act, were then on such things. What is clear is and while he is or after he ceases to be, an officer, that our society today has a much more sensiperson, tive regard for personal rights with respect of another person acquired by him in the performance privacy and confidentiality of personal inforof his duties, or in the exercise of his powers or mation provided on trust and in confidence to functions, under this Act or under any Act repealed official bodies. A quarter of a century ago by this Act. there were no computers with the aweinspirPenalty: Five hundred dollars ing capacity to store and rapidly retrieve comprehensive records from central storage not, except for the purposes of this Act, be required: units. I think it a sobering thought for all of us to reflect on the enormous amount of detail which is stored in the computer records of the Department of Social Security. For instance, our computer bank has detailed information on over 1,870,000 families in Australia including their addresses. These are families where there is at least one child under 16 years and where child endowment is paid. It is possible to establish which children do and which do not go onto higher educa-' tion because of the transition to student endowment; and again personal details on these young people can be retrieved. Similary we have extremely comprehensive data on over 1,100,000 age and invalid pensioners, on over 126,000 widow pensioners and women receiving supporting mother's benefit and on some 396,000 cases in which unemployment, It is as well that I now move on to an access to informtaion held in personal files held by the Department. Section 17 of the (1) An officer shall, if the Minister or the Directorsioner for Declarations a declaration in accordance the prescribed form. (2) A person shall not, directly or indirectly, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any any information with respect to the affairs of (3) A person who is, or has been, an officer shall (a) to produce in court any document that has come into his possession or under his control",35,Furnish On Request
97,Mr Haydeni Am Aware From Several,"in the performance of his duties or functions under this Act or any Act repealed by this Act; or (b) to divulge or communicate to a court any matter or thing that has come under his notice in the performance of any such duties or functions. (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding provisions of this section, an officei may: (a) if the 'Minister or the Director-General certifies that it is necessary in the public interest that any information acquired by the oflicer in the performance of his duties, or in the exercise of his powers or functions, under this Act or under any Act repealed by this Act, should be divulged, divulge that information to such person as the Minister or the Director-General directs; (b) to divulge or communicate to a court any authority or person; or (c) divulge any such information to a person who, in the opinion of the Director-General, is expressly or impliedly authorised by the person to whom the information relates to obtain it. (5) An authority or person to whom information is divulged under the last preceding subsection, and any person or employee under the control of that authority or person, shall, in respect of that information, be subject to the same rights, privileges, obligation and liabilities under subsections (2) and (3) of this section as if he were a person performing duties under this Act and had acquired the information in the performance of those duties. (6) In this section, 'officer' includes a person who has performed duties, or exercised powers or functions, under, or in relation to any Act repealed by this Act. As honourable members will note section 17 loose arrangement is open to the gravest forms is very loose and this is particularly so of of abuse. I will not add colour to what I am subsection 4 of section 17. FirstI should indicate the general approach tiveness of this sort of arrangement and tbe the Department has followed until now in the abuses that could creep in. release of information. The Department has 3 lists of authorities to whom it divulges information under section 17 (4). They are: A. agencies have been informed of clients' Commonwealth and State departments and incomes on the basis of requests to the Departother bodies expending public moneys, social ment in cases where they proposed to provide security benefits or workers compensation or aid to such a client. My inquiries indicate the like; B. Commonwealth and State departthat the administration of arrangements ments and other bodies where expenditure of related to the accessibility of these records has public moneys or social security benefits is been left very much to State offices and it not directly involved; C. Commonwealth or seems that a wide variety of practices has State departments where the protection of developed. Strangely enough practices vary incoming revenues, the grant of concessions to between States. Obviously the whole procedure pensioners or their liability in respect of has grown unsteadily and with a want of advances and arrears of rent is involved. There consistency which comes of looseness. is a free exchange of information with authorities in Group A. Information to the mental instructions had been vigorously authorities in GroupsB and C is, however, pursued at all times much of what I regard only furnished upon request. Again these are as misuse of information by non-departmental very generalised conditions and have allowed sources would have been avoided. Even practices to develop which I regard, and the Government regards, as quite unsatisfactory. Although in principle police officers are not supposed to handle personal files I have been advised by 2 senior officers of my Department and this confirms information I had received from other officers of the Department with whom I have personal contact that in practice police officers have had access to personal index cards and to personal files in a number of cases. I mentioned last week how one police officer had quite improperly used this privilege to trace his estranged wife. I understand that there have been instances in the past2 years ago; I have not been able to confirm whether this has occurred in more recent times-of police officers, in at least 2 States where a special fee was paid to them for serving civil summonses, using personal records in the Department to trace people on whom these summonses were to be served. I regard it as quite improper that debt collecting agencies, such as State housing authorities, local government bodies and power distribution authorities, should be able to trace people indebted to them through personal records in the Department. I understand that most often a telephone call was the only form of request received and that this was sufficient to obtain the information sought for tracing the person concerned. Obviously this sort of saying by giving illustrations. I am sure honourable members will quickly apprehend the defecI am further informed that voluntary It is as well to bear in mind that if departallowing that instructions had been followed, the very nature of my Department's personal records on its clients, the absence of security measures to protect privacy and the easy and rapid retrieval of computer stored information make it proper that all procedures should be reviewed. It is intriguing to learn that guidelines laid down in 1948 by the then Minister for Social Services, Senator McKenna, on the disclosure of information by the Department have remained undisturbed for a quarter of a century. This is really nowhere near good enough. What Senator McKenna did in 1948 was probably appropriate and adequate for contemporary standards. But 1948 standards in this sensitive area are not good enough in 1973 or in future years. I propose certain actions to change these procedures, but before I discuss that I want to raise a further point. There is an additional situation in which Medical Association. He suggests there is as information has been provided from personal much relevance in this, in terms of the subfiles. This concerns academic research. A ject now before the House, as there is in his recent instance, for which I did not give membership of the Longueville Presbyterian approval and about which I knew nothing, Church. There is a difference however. The concerns access to personalfilesrelated to child Longueville Presbyterian Church has not, endowment recipients. Professor A. H.

So that there will Government agencies such as a health insurbe no confusion on the nature of that access, ance commission. Both the AMA and the I quote from a note I received from my MBF have. I wonder what position Professor Department on this matter: Professor Pollard, on 22 March, 1973, during cils of these 2 bodies. Perhaps he justifies consultations with omcers of this Department, outlined academic access to such files, but if he does the objects of a survey his University was conducting he is at odds with the AMA and the MBF it into the fertility patterns of mothers residing within would seem. Again, I do not want to labour the Shire of Cumberland, N.S.W. The information sought was the mother's age at the time of the birth this point; merely to draw attention to its of the first child, the time interval between gentle irony. subsequent births, age at the time of births of the last or most recent child and the mother's nationality. It was not possible to obtain the required informaCountry Party would be distressed at any sugtion other than by examination of actual child endowment files. Approval was subsequently given to allow the university staff to extract the required data from child endowment files held in the Sydney office on which payment had been terminated 12 months earlier. Professor Pollard was advised on 30 March 1973, of the approval in the following terms: As child endowment files held in our Sydney office and on which payment terminated 12 months earlier are culled for destruction each 4 weeks, they will be made available to you for examination and extraction of data regarding the ex-endowee's child-bearing history; where the earlier portion of a file is held in be restricted to cases (a) where there is explicit archives, arrangements will be made for it to be obtained and made available to you. Experience may show that it will not be necessary to obtain the older parts of files from archives on a continuing basis, but they will be made available for as long as you consider necessary. As the material to be extracted from the files is of statistical nature, it will not be possible to identify any of the individuals involved from the published results of the survey. However, while I have complete confidence in the integrity and discretion of your staff who will be handling the files, it is perhaps necessary that I draw ypur attention to the provisions of section 17-the so-called 'secrecy provisions-of the Social Services Act. A copy of this section is attached and I would be grateful if it could be brought to the notice of your colleagues and staff who will be associated with the survey. I understand that, in the light of the results obtained from the survey now contemplated, you may wish in the future to consider looking at the fertility characteristics of a sample of OUT current endowees. This may present some problems but we will be happy to examine the practicability of assisting you in this direction at the appropriate time. It is interesting to note that Professor Pollard is both a member of the Board of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and of the Economic Advisory Council of the Australian Pollard has taken on this subject in the counI am certain the Liberal Party and the gestion that the degree of access which they permitted to Department of Social Security files should extend to health insurance commission records. It will not of course, and it will cease in so far as records in the Department of Social Security are concerned. I have instructed my Director-General that all access to personal information recorded within the Department of Social Security will written authorisation or verifiable authorisation by the client concerned (b) in extreme cases where there exist grave reasons of public interest; and in such cases approval will be decided by either the Director-General or me on each individual case. The Director-General is to report to me on all cases he approves. This is an interim measure because the issues involved are quite complex. It is clear that the matter of recording this sort of personal information and of access to it requires very careful consideration. I have accordingly contacted Senator Murphy, the Attorney-General, suggesting that tbe matter should be a subject for thorough consideration by the Committee of Inquiry into the Protection of Privacy. SenaDepartment pointing out the weaknesses of tor Murphy agrees with the proposals and the matter is in the process of being referred to that Committee. that he will not raid this Department? the unacceptable practices tolerated by your on clients held by the Department was availGovernment in the past will not be tolerated in able to non-departmental sources.

109,Mr Chipp,"B y some freak the TAA combeen so concerned about human fallibility that they have rightly and properly in the past brought to his attention this matter of human fallibility. They have done it in the context of the fears expressed by honourable members on this side of the House about the disclosure of personal medical records under the health insurance scheme. I find that a rather strange thing for the Minister to bring into question. The only other 2 criticisms I have are not of the Minister's statement but of the way in which he introduced it. In the last couple of days he has made 2 announcements. 'Smear' is a word I do not like using and I will not apply it here. I think he made a misdirected criticism. Firstly, he said that debt collecting agencies had been given access to departmental records. I was deeply concerned about that as was everybody else. But the Minister in his statement says: I regard it as quite improper that debt collecting agencies such as State housing authorities, local govadequate supervisionI agree with the Minernment bodies, and power distribution authorities I had in mind, as did everybody else who heard the Minister and read his report, some sleazy debt collecting agency which uses standover tactics being given access to departmental records. I am not suggesting that the Minister has tried to smear anybody on this, but I think his words both then and in his statement were very ill-chosen. They have been misinterpreted in a very wide section of the community. Unconsciously, I think he has placed a reflection upon the officers of his Department because everybody who read the report was appalled to think that any officers of the Department of Social Services, as it then was, would have given records to a sleazy debt collecting agency. The other thing to which I object is the reference to Professor Pollard. It is most unfortunate that the Minister has taken 4 pages of his statement in criticising Professor Pollard, a most distinguished man, a man who has tried to do some real research in this area in which the Minister is interested. Simply because the professor belongs to other organisations such as the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the Economic Advisory Council of the Australian Medical Association the Minister is virtually calling him a hypocrite. It is also very unfortunate that he has brought into question the fact that Professor Pollard is a member of the Longueville Presbyterian Church. The relevance of that completely escapes me. In conclusion I commend the Minister for referring the matter to the Committee of Inquiry into the Protection of Privacy. He has made some point of this, but I want to emphasise it. The fact that certain agenciesState government agencies and local government agencies-ca n obtain information about pensioners, for example, is often to the pensioner's advantage. In the case of some authorities-housin g commissions, for example if substantiation of the fact that a-person is a pensioner can be made, that person receives special dispensation from that authority. I know that it would not be the Minister's wish to close off additional benefits that might be given to pensioners and people in the low income groups by obsessive secrecy in what he finally implements. I know that that is in the Minister's mind. But I did want to point out that the disclosure of this information, provided that it is under proper and ister here, I agree with the actions he has taken-quit e often can act to the benefit of the underprivileged groups in the community. Sitting suspended from 1.1 to 2.15 p.m. agree that the statement that the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) has put before us is in most respects moderate and restrained. To that extent I think that it is a withdrawal from the somewhat extravagant statements which he put out earlier. I can only hope that the damage which, perhaps unconsciously, he has done by those previous extravagant statements will to some extent be undone by this one. There are one or two points I should remark upon besides those made by the honourable member for Hotham( Mr Chipp) who preceded me. I refer particularly to the aside of the Minister, which was not contained in his roneoed speech, when he referred to the 'evil practices' of the past Government. This was not only unfair but also out of line with what the Minister had said. Nothing has been done in the past that is not in conformity with the practices inherited from a previous Labor government and from previous governments before that. As the Minister has pointed out, it is true that there have been changes in services. I think that he was fair in that regard. It is perhaps extraordinary how little complaint has been made in the past-certainly very little justified complaint. In the whole of my 4i",43,Furnish On Request
110,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) (2.15),"Iyears as Minister for Social ServicesI cannot remember any complaint being voiced in this House on this matter. It is important to remember that by far the greater part of the giving of information by the Department is either for the benefit of the pensioner or with the pensioner's explicit or implied consent. referred, such as the housing commissions, were I deal now with that second point of which honourable members will all be aware. Probably hundreds of times in a year every one of us gets a request to look at the circumstances of some pensioner in our electorate. There is an implied consent from that pensioner that his affairs should be known to the honourable member who is trying to help him. Although thefilesof pensioners are not usually made available there have been occasions when a complaint has been made that a Minister-I , and I think other Ministers, have done thishas discussed the file with the member of Parliament who has brought this matter before his attention and who is acting on 'behalf of the pensioner. I know that I have treated honourable members on both sides of the House in exactly the same way in this regard. I do not recall an instance where, after discussion with the honourable member concerned and the adjustment of what had to be adjusted, there has ever been a matter which has had to be raised subsequently in the House while I was Minister. The other point is that most of the disposes only. I do not blame the Minister for closures are for the benefit of the pensioner. what he did. AlthoughI cannot recall it, I This is necessary when he is a claimant for believe that permission in principle was given some kind of concession available to during the time. I was Minister and I have pensioners from a State authority, a nothing to retract from that at all. I do not local government authority, a charitable blame the Minister for what was done. It may authority or, indeed, from one of the be necessary for academic reasons-'for such Commonwealth departments. In these cases things as, for example, Professor Henderson's a file is not made available in total or inquiry on poverty, which was instituted by the anything like that. The impression given by the previous Government when I was Minister, or Minister's previous statements was quite false the inquiry on repatriation by Mr Justice in this regard. Only information which is Toose, or something like that-for some acanecessary for the settlement of the pensioner's demic or judicial authority to get statistical claims is given. They may be just claims and information, not personal information, from it is important for the pensioner that they files. But in general the files are not let out of should be settled with the least possible delay. the possession of the Department. In this case, I know that some of these practices grew up as I have said, although I do not blame the in the days before there was what is known Minister for what was done I think it was as a pensioner medical service card used as a perhaps a little irregular for Professor 'Pollard method of identification. In those days a pento have access to the files, although no harm sioner's form was available only to those penwas done. It is purely whipping up hysteriasioners who had their pensions paid through that is the Minister's phrase-to consider that post offices and not through banks. They, of any harm was done. course, are by no means the whole body of pensioners. But in some cases there was not a ready means of identification. Even today many pensioners aTe not entitled to PMS cards. For all these reasons I think it was unfortunate that the Minister should refer, as he did, to debt collecting agencies using the Department's files because the 'bodies to which he bodies whose main reason, not sole reason, for getting information was to do something for the benefit of the pensioner. It was necessary for them to verify not details about the pensioner in almost all cases, but the fact that he was a pensioner. I shall not go into the details of this. I promised the Minister that I would speak for only a few minutes and I will keep to that promise. But I regretted what the Minister said about Professor Pollard. If my memory is correct I think that, in principle, the disclosure to Professor Pollard was authorised while I was Minister for Social Services. The actual disclosure was done while the present Minister was in office, so I suppose that it is reasonable for both of us to bear the responsibility. at any stage. I would say that in this case nothing wrong was done. Old files were involved on which there was nothing that could have been of significance. The extracts were for statistical purI come now to the 2 main points I want to emphasise. 'Firstly, it is possible that there can",44,Furnish On Request
111,Mr Hayden,It was without my knowledge,45,Furnish On Request
112,Mr Wentworth,"That may well be, butbe human error in such cases. No department is invulnerable to misbehaviour by its omcers. The Minister cited a caseI think it was before my time as Minister-of a police officer who got information from the Department and used it for personal purposes to trace the address of his erring wife. That was a misuse of departmental information. It happened not through an officer of the Department of Social Services but through an officer of a police department. It was misconduct. It was misconduct, but there is no system in which misconduct of that character is impossible. This has become much more important because of the use of computers and the greater availability of accessibility of information. It is true that a computer can go wrong, but a computer can also be subjected to misuse by misconduct or by human error. Because of the greater volume of information now being collated it is important that we should have some control over the new facilities. Therefore I think the Minister is right in doing the same thing as the New South Wales Government has recently announced that it will do, that is, to have an inquiry into the better protection of privacy. The Minister's guidelines as set out on page 16 of the reneoed statement may prove impractical. The information will be restricted to cases. (a) where there is explicit authorisation or verifiable authorisation by the client concerned, or (b) in extreme cases where there exist grave reasons by the Minister that perhaps this has been to of public interest. How are we to deal with inquiries by members about pensioners in their constituencies? Many of these inquiries are made by telephone and it is important for the pensioner concerned that they be resolved with the least possible delay. Second, how are we to deal with the position of voluntary organisations which need information about whether an applicant for relief from them is in point of fact a pensioner? How are we to deal with those inquiries that must be made by State welfare organisations if they are to give relief? Those organisations want to know the facts quickly. An inquiry may come in on Wednesday night and it is desired to extend relief to the person concerned on Wednesday night or Thursday morning. There is not sufficient time to go through all the departmental procedure. Though the Minister's guidelines are well meant, and I can understand the motive behind them, I am afraid that in practice they will act to the prejudice of a great number of pensioners and will make conditions worse for the pensioners. They will impede the operations of State welfare departments. They may well make very difficult the position of those excellent organisations like the Red Cross or St Vincent de Paul or other relief organisations that exist and require quick knowledge-no t details-of whether or not a person is a pensioner before they are able to give assistance or assess the relief that should be given. claim to be mispresented insofar as by imputation ing to the motion? so. I commend the Minister for the moderation of this statement. I was concerned at an earlier statement he made in this House in reply to questions. I believe that at no stage while he has been Minister, or at any other stage, has the information divulged by the Minister for Social Services, as he was, or by the present Minister for Social Security, reacted against the pensioner. It is my belief that over the course of the years it has been necessary for some divulgence of information to be part and parcel of the holding of information within a department such as the Department of Social Security. Obviously there is a feeling on the part of those who have heard the statement the detriment of those concerned. It should be said on the other hand that by far the major usage of this information has been for the benefit of the pensioner. When I was Minister for Social Services on a number of occasions I was approached for confidential information from files. I made it the practice that files should never be seen other than by officers of the Department and, if information were to be made available, it should be statistical information of a general nature rather than of a personal nature. I do not believe that information of that character that is divulged reacts other than to the advantage of the individual. I am concerned that if there is to be any undue restraint on the ability of the Department specified or any other Commonwealth Department to exchange information it should not be in such a way as either to frustrate the operations of the Government or to deny pensioners concessions that are available to them through some other government agency, be it at local government or State government level, when those concessions can be made only if the other agency",45,Furnish On Request

115,Mr Sinclair,"If I may, I prefer to doknows that the person concerned is a pensioner. I should hope that people who are pensioners do not feel that the results of the steps taken by the present Minister for Social Security will react to their disadvantage. I am sure that that is not his intention. I hope the degree to which there have been headlines in various newspapers around Australia that have suggested that information has been divulged detrimental to personal privacy, and consequently in some way reacting against those persons, will not make people feel that the pension system of the Department of Social Services is an agency of which they need be afraid henceforth. There have been real problems in the community in getting people to take up pensions. Unfortunately there are still some people who feel that there is a measure of loss of pride involved in receiving a pension from the Government. I believe this not to be so. I hope that as a result of the action taken by the Minister people who hold some fears about disclosure of personal information, particularly elderly citizens who, for reasons of pride or for other reasons, have been hesitant to receive this benefit, do not feel hesitant to receive this benefit, do not feel inhibited in making the disclosures necessary to ensure their entitlement. I am apprehensive that this could be the result of the Minister's statement. I believe it is necessary that information be exchangeable between officers of various government departments and that there must be the strictest possible restraint placed on the use to which the information can be put. I trust that the inquiry to which the Minister referred in his statement and which was initiated by the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) will not result in undue restraint on the use of information. I trust that whatever procedures are ultimately adopted will be promulgated in this House and that it will be possible for honourable members to discuss the information and the manner of its exchange and application as well as to ensure that the fears expressed by honourable members on this side of the House are not realised. For my part I believe it is necessary that there be complete freedom of belief on the part of an indivdual that information disclosed to the Department will be [protected to the maximum degree, but I believe equally that divulgence of that information should not preclude the Department from exchanging the information with other agencies or individuals where the exchange can be to the benefit of the applicant. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Dr Patterson, and read a first time. Second Reading Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (2.34)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to impose a charge on honey exports to provide necessary additional finance for the operations of the Australian Honey Board. The Australian Honey Board was established under the Honey Industry Act 1962 for the general purposes of regulating the export of honey and engaging in promotional activities on the domestic and overseas markets. The Board's operations are presently financed by levies imposed on domestic sales of honey and on honey used in the production of other goods. Exports of honey which normally account for some 40 per cent of Australian production were exempted from levy when the legislation was introduced in 1962 because of the very depressed state of the export market at that time. Since 1962 the Board's operational costs and requirements for promotional funds have risen along with the general cost increases that have occurred. Periodic increases in the rate of levy have been made to meet this situation, but there is an increasing reluctance on the part of the industry to increase the present levy on domestic honey sales. In March 1973 the Board felt it was appropriate in light of the prevailing bouyant market conditions that the export sector should contribute tofinancingthe Board's operations. It recommended that a charge be imposed on honey exports at a maximum rate of lc per kg and that the operative rate should be a minimum of 0.3c per kg. Following its recommendation the Board sought the endorsement of the main honey industry organisations which indicated their general support. The matter was subsequently discussed at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in August last and there was general acceptance of the need for a charge on the export of honey. The Bill gives effect to the industry proposal. It provides for an initial operative rate of charge of 0.3c per kg which may be varied by regulation, on the recommendation of the Australian Honey quential to the Honey Export Charge Bill Board, to any level within a maximum rate 1973, the purpose of which is to provide of lc per kg.

The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate S24m in 1973-74 for the growth centres program announced in the Budget. The $24m is the balance of the appropriation for that program after subtracting the $9m approved for expenditure in Albury-Wodonga. This Bill is basically concerned with financial conditions. Funds will generally be made available to the States upon agreement to the terms of finance, and to conditions relating to development corporations, where appropriate, and the introduction of legislation permitting a system of land acquisition at fair prices. The Bill only sets out conditions relating to the terms of finance. Clause9 (1) provides that other conditions may be agreed between the Australian and State governments. These other conditions will be set out in the financial agreementsClause 15 of the Bill requires these agreements to be tabled. Many of the detailed provisions in this Bill are the same as provisions for the Land Commissions (Financial Assistance) Bill which is on the notice paper, and I shall speak on it later today in some detail. However, for the purposes of this Bill, I will outline some of the more important provisions. Clause4 of the Bill provides for approved programs of urban and regional development which include land acquisition, development, other works, and studies. Sub-clause (3) requires that where land is to be acquired it should be identified as intended for urban use, or otherwise. This is because the terms of finance for these 2 categories are different. Clause5 is the operative section. When a State has incurred expenditure this financial year in accordance with an approved program it is then entitled to financial assistance. Clause9 qualifies clause 5 by providing that a State's entitlement to financial assistance is subject to conditions set out in the Bill and also to such other conditions as may be agreed upon between the Australian and State governments. Clause 10 provides that, in respect of land for urban use, financial assistance will be through loans. Under clause 11, financial assistance for the acquisition of land for buffer zones, conservation areas and major recreation space can be made by way of non-repayable grants. This is subject to a matching grant by the States.

The Australian people face major expenditures to overcome the backlog in urban services in our major cities. In short, too often co-ordinntion and provision of services, governthe product is poor, the price is too high and the bills have not been met. Let me give some figures with regard to Sydney in the period September 1970 to March 1973. The increase of the consumer price index in all groups was 18.2 per cent. Average weekly earnings rose 29.5 per cent. The wholesale price of building materials for houses rose 21.4 per cent. However, the minimum price for home sites in urban fringe areas in Sydney rose an astounding 157 per cent. What is happening in Sydney today and what will happen there in the remainder of this year is what will happen next year in Melbourne and in other capital cities. It is occurring already in the south eastern corridor of Melbourne. This is a national disgrace. It points to the need for action by the State governments as well as by the Australian Government. MightI add that the State governments have had the power in the past to carry out this action, if financial arrangements had been made. Thefirstrequirement was for the States to have the will to do this. The second need was for them to enter into financial arrangements with the Federal Government.

This is one major reason why we must change the rules of the game. Public acquisition defeats speculators who withhold large parcels of land from the market. Land Commissions and the legislation to enable acquisition at fair prices which we are encouraging the States to implement are essential if better co-ordination and better planning are to be achieved. Ultimately, they are the means by which we will enable young people to enter the land market at a cheaper price. Let there be no mistake about this: The present Australian Government believes that excessive profits have been made in land speculation and this should not continue. We need the co-operation of the States to stop this. If there is co-operation between the Australian Government and the State governments, this state of affairs can be stopped. Honourable members should have no doubt about that. There are three major objectives underlying tures. Firstly, we want to allow areas to be comprehensively planned and developed; Thefinancialassistance offered to the States sidering specific parts of the Bill. The second There are two major performance conditions: Firstly, each State should carry out its land acquisition programme through an organisation structure agreeable to the Australian Government; and secondly, the State should implement legislation to acquire the land at prices unaffected by announcements of intended urban development. Honourable members should know that the aim is not to freeze land prices. I hope that that really sinks into the minds of honourable members opposite. I repeat for their benefit those words: Honourable members should know that the aim is not to freeze land prices. Nor is the aim to reduce the capital value of the asset. Rather, the aim is to ensure that any inflation caused by the announcement of any government is not borne by the purchasers. I hope that this is perfectly clear to honourable members. There has been too much hysteria on the question of the stabilisation of land prices. We are not freezing land. We are trying to stabilise the price of land. There have also been some misunderstandings in regard to the question of land tenure. Let me make clear the process of urban development as we envisage it. Firstly, there is a decision by governments that a city will expand in a certain area. Secondly, and as soon as possible, there is an announcement that the price paid for land acquired in the general will set aside increases deriving solely from the Government decision. Thirdly, after studies have been carried out with full public knowledge and involvewith the concurrence of the Treasurer. Under ment, a decision is made on the exact area to be zoned urban. Fourthly, the land commission authority acquires that part of the new urban area where it is to supervise development. Fifthly, the area is physically developed. This operation would usually be undertaken by developers in accordance with reasonable conditions agreed upon with the Government. Sixthly, the land is disposed of to individuals, groups, companies and government authorities -for houses, flats, factories, shops, offices, schools, parks, roads and all the things which go to make up an attractive and complete community. I think we can draw on the experience of the development of new suburbs in Canberra. This is the end of the first phase of urban ment assistance will be in the form of interest development. The question then to be answered bearing loans. Clause 10 provides for these is what form of tenure should be adopted for loans to be repayable over 30 years. Interest this disposal. There have been discussions with is to be payable half-yearly on the outstandthe States on this question and the Government ing balance. The interest rate is to be the is awaiting the report of the royal commission long-term bond rate or such lower rate as the inquiry into land tenures. The Government is not dogmatic on this question of residential land tenure. I stress that I believe that all State governments understand this and that detailed questions of land tenure are not a barrier to commencing the process of land acquisition and development I have just described. I turn now to the detailed provisions of this Bill. The Bill provides in clause 4 for the Minister to approve programs of land acquisition and, in consultation with the Treasurer, to agree upon the amount and terms of financial assistance to be provided to carry out the program of land acquisition. In each case, negotiations will be with the appropriate Minister of the State defined in clause 3. This is a general Bill which allows forflexibilityin the determination of programs of land acquisition and setting the terms of finance. Clause 15 of the Bill provides for the financial agreements to be tabled. Dealing first with the programs of land acquisition, clause 4 provides that the programs are for purposes connected with urban expansion. Clause3 defines urban expansion to include redevelopment, and setting aside land in or near urban areas for public recreation purposes or for conservation. Subclause (1) of clause 4 requires that the programs be carried out by an approved authority. Clause3 defines an approved authority as either the land commission of a particular State or an authority of that State approved by the Minister sub-clause (2) of clause 4, the land to be acquired will be specified as intended either for urban use or alternatively, for public recreation space, for buffer zones or for conservation areas. These latter areas of land will be large tracts returning relatively little income. Clause 11 provides that in these cases Australian Government assistance will be non-repayable grants subject to a matching grant provision. Where land is intended for urban use, and this includes not only land for houses, offices and factories, but also land for schools, community facilities, transportation routes and urban parks, Australian GoverTreasurer with my concurrence determines. I will return to the question of interest rates in a moment. Sub-clause (3) of clause 10 provides for a period of deferment of up to 10 years. This will be agreed with the State before payments in respect of a particular program commence. The deferment period is a period during which there are no repayments of principal or payments of interest. The outstanding principal will compound on half-yearly rests during the deferment period. After the deferment period, the principal and accrued interest are treated as a principal sum which is then repaid with interest over the balance of 30 years. The deferment period is offered so that States accepting financial assistance can ensure that the process of development of the land generates funds to service loan requirements. 'There will be a period after acquisition when the land is not returning any income to the approved authority which carried out the acquisition. The deferment period will allow the States to plan the cash flow for each project so that funds are available to service borrowings as required. The Australian Government has also decided that there will be a review of interest rates. I will propose to the States that the review should be carried out within 5 years and, in any event, before the end of the deferment neriod. The review will take into account the cash flows for each project or group of projects so that they can be self-financing as far as possible. The flexibility cussions are continuing with Ministers and in the terms of finance allowed by the Bill will permit the Australian Government to tailor a program of urban development to suit conditions in each State and region. In describing the type of land involved in of resources. Together the Australian and State this program, I have referred to some of the governments can achieve a more equitable terms and conditions under which financial form of urban development.

There are provisions in native method which will enable Australians to clauses 6, 8 and 13 requiring the supply of receive the benefits of more efficient and more information and in clause 14 there is a proequitable urban development. I commend the vision that the Australian Government's conBill to the House. sent is to be given to any major change of land use. The clause in the Bill which connects adjourned. the two types of conditions is clause 9. That clause provides that advances are to be subject to conditions set out in the Bill and to such other conditions as the Treasurer and I determine. Through that clause, the conditions relating to land commission structures and land price stabilisation legislation will be made effective. This Bill provides for $30m to be spent this financial year under our land commissions program. It is a first step in a continuing involvement by the Australian Government in order to provide more attractive and better planned communities. Land commissions are one part of an interconnected package of programs in urban and regional development. This Government recognises that the various investments which the AustraUan Government has made in the past coupled with the initiatives we are now taking are all inter-connected. These investments range over the whole fieldland, housing, roads, sewerage, transport. These investments must increasingly be seen as an inter-connected parcel of policies, not as isolated programs. The Australian Government seeks the co-operation of the States to work as a partnership in this venture. Already the South Australian Government has established a Land Commission. Western AustraUa has introduced a Bill to establish a Land Commission. I have 'been engaged in detailed discussions with the Victorian Minister for Local Government for some months.

The Opposition was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee supports this proposal for the good and suffion Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of engineering services, Malak and Karama neighbourhoods, Sanderson DistrictDarwin, Northern Territory. The proposal involves the provision of roads and engineering services to 1933 residential and 44 special sites, including the necessary supply of water, sewerage and electrical services to the neighbourhoods. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $ 11.6m. The Committee concluded there was a need for the works, that it was appropriate to continue the development of the Sanderson District in accordance with the town plan and the general principles of town planning and engineering standards adopted for previous district development, and that the construction of the work should proceed. The Committee also noted a review of housing designs and standards under way in Darwin and requested that a group of houses be referred for public inquiry by the Committee. Arrangements are in hand for a group of 40 houses developed to the new designs and standards to be referred to the Committee for examination and report early in 1974. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. OF ALTERING THE CONSTITUTION) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November (vide page 3400), on motion by Mr Whitlam: That the Bill be now read a second time. sixth of a series of referendum Bills, with one more to come. It is another Bill in a long and continuing series to alter the Constitution by fraud and by deceit, and to do so without adequate thought and without adequate parliamentary discussion. Let us look first of all at clause 2 (c) of the Bill which proposes to alter section 128 of the Constitution to allow qualified electors in the Territories to vote. The words 'the Territories' refer to electors in the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory. There are 264,000 citizens in these territories, of which cient reason that all Australian citizens qualified under the laws of this country should be able to do so. I mention in passing that the 130,700 Territory votes will not be counted in the votes of the States in order to determine whether in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law. They will apply only to the total Australian vote. There is a second proposal in the Bill in clause 2 (b). It proposes that the following words in section 128 of the Constitution shall be omitted: But until the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives becomes uniform throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half of the electors voting for and against the proposed law shall be counted in any State in which adult suffrage prevails. These words have been overcome by events and are now superfluous. The Opposition pointed out that similar requirements in other referendum Bills should have been deleted. The Opposition is glad that the Government has acceptedits advice-howeve r grudging and tardy acceptance might have been. There can be little doubt that the Australian Constitution has proved difficult to amend. There have been 26 proposals for amendment since 1901, and only five have been passed. That is exactly how it should be, because sovereignty, or quasi-sovereignty, resides with the qualified electors of this country. It is for them to decide, subject to certain constitutional safeguards, whether they want any change. They have a right, even an obligation, to move with care because they are the people who must bear the burden of irresponsible government-governmen t of the kind they are compelled to endure stoically today. The real problem we face is associated with the third proposal in clause 2 (c) of the Bill. The relevant part of the Constitution to which clause 2 (c) relates provides that: And if in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law, and",50,Assistance Bill 1973

120,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) (3.19),"This is theif a majority of all the electors voting also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent. Clause2 (c) of the Bill proposes that the words 'in a majority of the States' be omitted and that the words 'in not less than one-half of the States' be substituted. The Constitution would then read: And if in not less than one-half of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law, and if a majority of the electors voting also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent. The effect of such a proposed change would be that instead of the constitutional requirement that, before a referendum can be successful a majority of the electors in a majority of the States must vote in favour of the proposal-that is, that there must be a majority of electors in four out of the six States and also a majority of all electors-in its place there would be a requirement that there must be a majority of electors in only 3 States out of six and a majority of all electors before the proposed law can be presented to the Governor General for assent. The requirement that there must be a majority of electors in a majority of the States was inserted in the Constitution to preserve the federal system of government-that is, the system of the Commonwealth and the 6 States -and to ensure maturity of thought in the consideration and settlement of the proposals relating to organic changes of the Constitution. These constitutional requirements both safeguard the Constitution itself and were designed to ensure that proper and mature consideration is given to the proposed changes and their effect on the people of this country. We reject this proposal and will move for the deletion of clause 2 (c) from the Bill. Let me argue somewhat more persuasively and with greater authority about the effect of this proposed change. I am indebted to Quick and Garran's learned and elegant 'Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth' for most of the ideas relating to amendments to the Constitution by plebiscite or referendum. As a preface I want to state the Liberal view relating to written federal constitutions and proposals for their alteration. A constitution may be compared to a living organism. It is not in the nature of a living organism to remain monotonously the same from year to year and from age to age. As with individual units, so with nations, change is one of the laws of life. The constitution of a nation is the outward and visible manifestation of its national life, to the pulsations of which it necessarily responds. The energy within any healthy organic structure must find vent in change. Change assumes various external forms. The power in a progressive community is never quiescent or stationary. The safeguards that are contained in our Constitution have been provided not in order to prevent or indefinitely resist change in any direction but in order to prevent change being made in haste or by stealth, to encourage public discussion and to delay change until there is strong evidence that it is desirable, irresistible and inevitable. A constitution is, after all, a charter of government. It is a deed of trust containing covenants between the sovereign communitythat is, the people themselves-and its individual units. Those covenants should not be lightly or inconsiderately altered. At the same time a constitution which did not contain provision for its amendment with the development, growth and expansion of the community which it is intended to govern would be a most inadequate and imperfect deed of partnership. It would be doomed to collapse ignominiously and without hope of reconstruction. It would be bound to break beneath the pressure of national forces which it could not control or resist. I believe that those 2 principles are incontrovertible. At the same time, the tendency to change must be scrutinised to ascertain whether it is proceeding in a safe direction and, if possible, to guide the tendency in that direction. The principal element in the process of a submission of proposals to the electors by way of a referendum is this: The process is a concrete illustration of the political expedient formerly known as the plebiscite and now better known as the referendum. It is an undoubted recognition that the qualified electors are the custodians of the delegated sovereignty of the Commonwealth. The qualified electors represent the people of the Commonwealth as a quasi-sovereign State in quasisovereign organisation. The requirement of the approval of a majority of the electors and a majority of the States is the method imposed by the Constitution for ascertaining the will of the people of the Federal Commonwealth. If a majority of the States had been ignored the federal element in the structure of the Commonwealth would have been impaired and whittled away. But that does not end the matter. The Constitution, as I have said, is a living organism and we in this House must move with the times. The time may come when the national element -the people-ma y become so strong as to disregard and overshadow the federal element -the States. An amendment of the Constitution may then be projected and carried abolishing the necessity of the second majority. When that is done the Commonwealth will probably cease to be a federation and will be converted into a state that is national in form and structure and national in organisation. The relating to the passage of a referendum, which Constitution itself enables such a change to be require a majority of the electors voting in 4 made if the sovereign qualified voters, in their of the 6 States, as well as an overall majority wisdom, consider that such a change is desirable of the total voters of Australia, are too rigidand that the plebiscite is carried out in accordmore rigid, indeed, than could ever have been ance with the Constitution and procedures of contemplated by the founding fathers.

The Prime Minister rights of the citizens of the Territories was outlined the views of this all-party Committee seen again recently in the opposition to our in his second reading speech, but I merely attempts to obtain Senate representation for quote the first few lines: If a clear majority of the electors who vote at a Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. referendum are in favour of a proposed law, their will should not be frustrated because seperate majorities of electors have not been obtained in a majority of the States. It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the developments since Federation that it should be suflicient to obtain separate majorities in at least one half of the number of States. This amendment is long overdue. It will bring the Constitution more into line with the social and political realities of this day and age. The second purpose of this Bill is to give electors of the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay and the Northern Territory, the right to vote at constitution referendums. A survey of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory population over the period 190M973 shows the changes that have taken place. I state them for the House. In 1901, the population in the Northern Territory was 4,811. The Australian Capital Territory, being in New South Wales at that time, no figures are available. On 30 June this year, the population in the Northern Territory totalled 95,600 and in the Australian Capital Territory 168,400, a grand total of 264,000. Projected populations for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory indicate that by 1990 there will be 745,000 persons in the Australian Capital Territory, and 275,000 persons in the Northern Territory, a total of 1,020,000. By the the AustraUan Capital Territory alone, if present population trends continue. These figures are provided by the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Northern Territory. This fundamental growth and change indicates that in the future, unless this change is made, countless thousands of Australians will be denied their right to vote at the ballot box for changes in the Constitution. It is incredible right at this date to 130,700 Australian voters. It should have been removed years ago. It the people of these areas-the Australian Surely, the Australian Country Party must support a referendum to ask the people to give a vote in referendums to all people of our mainland Territories-the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) has a question on the notice paper and continues to make weird noises in support of this proposal. Of course, this does not mean that they will support the legislation because we have the example of their vote on the Territory senators legislation. In this House on the first occasion they voted with the Government in favour of it, and then their counterparts in another place voted to defeat the legislation. It was almost a Laurel and Hardy production. Of course, the honourable member for the Northern Territory was the leader of the band in this sham show of support. Then, on the second occasion, the Country Party in this House and the honourable member for the Northern Territory again expressed support for the proposal-o n the voices, mind you; they would not divide-bu t again rejected it in another place. This, of course, is sham fighting. The Country Party cannot have it both ways. It is a case of put up or shut up. The Country Party and its Northern Territory member scream for more representation for country districts and in this House support legislation designed for this purpose. Then, in another place, by the ruthless use of numbers, the same Country Party rejects the proposal. They cannot have it both ways. Now they are being asked to let the people decide the issue, and I suggest that they give up their trapeze acts and vote in accordance with what they say are their established political principles. I am aware that Country Party Ministers did make representations on 2 occasions to the then Liberal-Country Party coalition Government in support of this proposal but, of course, their views went unheeded and they died on the vine in their earnest endeavours. There are no sound reasons why the electors of these Territories should not have a voice in referendums, and there are good reasons why this right should be extended to them. The political rights of all Australians are diminished denied a basic democratic right, once they while some of our citizens are denied the right of fully participating in the governing of the nation. It would be an indictment of our democratic system of government to allow this discrimination to continue on the basis of geography. The restriction of the right to vote in constitutional referendums to the citizens of the States is a consequence of the desire of the framers of our Constitution to protect the small States. But they could not have envisaged the growth that has taken place, and will continue to take place, in the Territories. Certainly, it would not have been their intention to disenfranchise at this date 130,700 Australian citizens and, in later years, thousands more. Again, we are reminded that Quick and Garran identified the qualified electors as the custodians of the delegated sovereignty of the Commonwealth. Our proposal is that the votes of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory electors be included in the national aggregate vote. This would not only mean that the referendum result would be more democratic, it would also give a better national reflection of the views of the Australian people. Further, it in no way infringes on the principle that the States have a separate interest to be protected with respect to constitutional change. The present situation is not only undemocratic and archaic; it is also anomalous. Not aU Constitutional referendums directly involve the interests of the States, or the powers oi State governments. Surely issues such as the rights of individuals, or the nature of parliamentary government, are of vital concern to all Australian citizens. What possible justification could there be for excluding residents in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory from expressing an opinion on questions which affect them at least as much as other Australians? For many years, the citizens of the Territories have demanded this right to vote in referendums. Their claims were strongly put at the time of the last referendum in 1967 when clearly they felt very deeply, as did all Australians, about the rights of the Aboriginal people. The citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory merely seek the same rights as other AustraUans. To a great many residents who come here from other States, it is a shock to learn that they are cross the artificial frontier. These electors do not seek any special politioal privilege. They have taxation commitments, defence responsibilities and other obligations similar to those enjoyed by the people of the States. They have the same interests in the working of the Australian Constitution as other Australian citizens. It is high time this anomalous discrimination perpetuated under Liberal-Country Party governments ended. All this legislation does is to seek the approval of the Parliament to give the Australian people the right to say whether their fellow men and women in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, shall have the right to exercise their vote in referendums. Surely no democrat can oppose this proposition. Surely no person who believes in democracy can be opposed to it. It should receive the support of all fair-minded citizens, and in view of that I commend the legislation to the House. ter for Services and Property( Mr Daly) has a very robust approach to politics which of course he expresses in a very exuberant and, at times, boisterous fashion.

But then the honourable gentleman also turned to Quick and Garran and he said: 1 hope the honourable member for Moreton will follow me through to make sure I am observing my lessons as a lawyer'. It is an absolute delight for me to find that the honourable gentleman, at long last, is observing some measure of discipline with respect to the Constitution, and that he should ever feel disposed to quote Quick and Garran was a contemplation that was never within my mind. So what a joyous afternoon it is for me to find, on a variety of counts, that the honourable gentleman has put himself into this engaging, this fascinating, this fragrant state of mind. He quoted from Quick and Garran, but what a pity that my friend did not continue to quote from it. He left out what I would have thought was the nub of this discussion.

What does my friend say about the other sentiment? Would he agree with Quick and Garran that it was unjust?

The honourable gentleman cannot approbate and reprobate, and this is one of these severe disciplines that I suspect he will really have to turn his mind to in order to ensure that he has a clear approach to constitutional problems. Having said that, may I turn to what I have invited the honourable gentleman to acknowledge is the nub of this issue. I would, by way of introductory remarks, say that the Government surprises me with its measure of impatience. I know that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has long entertained that there are blemishes as far as the Australian Constitution is concerned. I know that he has always held out, in the boldest of frames of mind, that the Constitution should be altered. One may indulge in the luxury of seeking to agree with him in some respects, but what puzzles me on this occasion about the Government which the honourable gentleman leads is the impatience, having regard to the fact that a Constitution Convention was held in Sydney a short time ago and that at that Convention, with the agreement of all of the States and with the agreement of the Commonwealth delegation, of which the Prime Minister was the distinguished leader, committees were set up to investigate various areas of constitutional reform. This was one of those areas. Indeed, in any measure of jeopardy, it was on this Prime Minister to serve. It is going to take some months for the views of that committee to be made available. It is going to take, I suggest, about another 12 months before that Constitution Convenin terms of constitutional reform but also committee's report. The States have long considered that the Palladium of their rights and liberties as States is to be found in section 128 of the Constitution. It is very difficult to find any State member for that observation. Speaking at the convenof Parliament, no matter what his political allegiance or affinity may be, who will not nurse some measure of resentment against the central Government. My friend knows this to be true. Many of them take the view we are seeking to trench upon their rights. State rights is the battle cry which I know we find on occasions irritating and a little difficult to understand, but the attitude of mind is there. The need to create a feeling for this country as one nation is one I hold to very strongly indeed. But the simple fact remains that the difficulties about constitutional reform are substantial and one can achieve them only step by step, by a process of enlightenment and, I suggest, by a process of encouragement to ensure that those who serve in State parliaments are not consumed or overwhelmed with any sense of fear, that they are convinced as to the merits of the proposal that is put before them. I may find myself in the position of having anachronism. But the fact remains-thi s is the considerable sympathy with the proposals put historic base from which we must consider this forward. IndeedI have unfeigned support for question-that Federation would never have the proposal regarding the territories and I been brought into being if there had been a do not disguise that for one moment. However, simple deal to have 3 States or to have a it is the third proposal that concerns me, and majority simpliciter of electors voting. TheI suggest that what the Government has done question I ask the Government is: Why have now is to imperil the prospect of constitutional a requirement for 3 States only? In his second reform by seeking to thrust this proposal onto reading speech the Prime Minister( Mr the States in particular and the people in Whitlam) said: general. Let me put this proposition to the House: If at the time of Federation in the flexibility and on what a majority of the electors want, 1890s the proposal had been that a simple wherever they live, while retaining a proper position majority of electors voting at a referendum for the States. would be adequate means of altering the If one accepts that sentiment and subscribes Constitution, the Federation would never have to that argument I suggest that the logical come into existence. One has only to go back extension of it is to have a majority simpliciter. to the 1891 Convention debate to realise that What does the honourable gentleman mean by that was precisely the position. I just want to a recognition of what he describes as 'a proper read one or two brief extracts from that debate position for the States'? What is a proper posito indicate the position of those who attended tion for the States? Those who founded the the 1891 Convention. At that time there were no States in there shall be 3 States in favour of any proexistence; they were colonies and they became posal. What is so splendidly virtuous about 3 States when they entered the Federation. The being in agreement? I would suggest that in attitude of the colonies was quite clear. It terms of sheer logic one could build a powerwas made clear by, for example, Mr Playford, ful and quite respectable case for carrying a a name well known in Australian politics, and proposition on a majority of electors alone. I have no doubt an ancestor of the gentleman This, of course, is where the dilemma is with who has been so well known to many of us in this House. tion on 8 April 1891, in Sydney, Mr Playford said: No one in his senses will argue that it is fair that the minority of the commonwealth shall be able to make an alteration of the constitution of the commonwealth. If that is not fair, the people are quite willing to say, 'If we cannot carry a majority, first of the people, and secondly of the states, no alteration of the constitution shall be made.' I say that this is fair on the one hand to the states, and on the other hand to the people. The states have no more right to say that, simply because they have a majority, though not of the people, they will override the people, than the people, on the other hand, have a right to say, 'Because we have a majority of the people we will override the states.' Let us deal fairly in both cases. That is all I want. I do not care how it is brought about, so long as it is thoroughly understood that the people, on the one hand, shall not override the states, and that the states, on the other hand, shall not be able to override the people. Of course time and events undoubtedly have swept by. The sentiment which reposes in those observations may be considered by many of us today at least to be tinged with a measure of The emphasis, in this day and age, should be on Federation said that there shall be four States in favour. The Prime Minister today states that",58,Constitution Alteration Mode
123,Mr Giles,His grandfather.,60,Constitution Alteration Mode
124,Mr Killeni Am Indebted To My Friend,"the States. There is no point in us putting our hands to the plough to do something which will not produce anything. If we are to plough in barren ground we will find ourselves in difficulties. That is what I suggest the Government is doing. The great Burke reminds us that that which is not practical is spurious. I suggest to my friends opposite that this proposal is not practical politics today. Could one, for example, encourage those who sit in State parliamentsagain I do not put them on one side or the other in terms of political sentiment-to say that they would have no ground for fear regarding this proposal. I shall give a couple of illustrations of the sort of fear which will be held by those who sit in State Parliaments. I take the assumption that the proposed referendum is carried. It would then mean that 3 States and the majority of people could alter the Constitution. Section7 of the Constitution which provides, among other things, the number of senators from each State, goes on to observe: . . . but so that equal representation of the ment had waited at least until the report of several original States shall be maintained and that no the sub-committee had been brought down it original State shall have less than 6 senators. I must confess, speaking for myself, that mittee is large, with 17 members. For many I find, in terms of sheer arithmetic, it curious of us 17 could be a well attended public meetthat Tasmania has 10 senators and New South ing, but the committee may produce someWiales has 10 senators. But if one puts ariththing; it may not. HoweverI think we show metic to one side and comes back to the Conthe members of the committee a measure of stitution, of course that was the deal. The discourtesy by proceeding in this fashion. More Senate was seen as a States House, a proposiimportantly, more critically, I think the comtion which I suggest most of us today would mittee may have been encouraged to have seen have some difficulty in embracing. I think that there could well have been some virtue that it is, by and large, a Party's House. Today in taking an overall majority and a majority occasionally one sees a flash of independence of 3 States. and a return to the role originally cast upon the Senate, but that is the exception; it cerand gallant friend from Isaacs( Mr Hamer), but tainly is not the rule. Imagine the sense of he was saying to me before this debate started suspicion that would be generated in State that at the time of Federation it was in the parliaments with respect to section 7 of the minds of those who attended the convention Constitution. 'Carried' could well mean that that new States would be created. The position 3 States-say , New South Wales, Victoria and can be made dramatically clear by taking the South Australia-coul d disadvantage Tasassumption that one more State had been mania, Western Australia and indeed created. That would have meant that 4 of the Queensland. To illustrate the sentiment that is still the Prime Minister observed, a two-thirds abroad, at the Sydney convention on the Conmajority is needed. Is there any person seriously stitution Sir Charles Court, the Leader of the possessed of the idea that new States can be Opposition in Western Australia, said to me: brought into existence? Such a scheme failed 'Killen, you have some views on the Constituin New South Wales and even though it tion which I do not share'. This is the effect lingers in northern Queensland the practical of what that gentleman said. He said: 'But you prospects of having new States brought into must understand our position'. Sir Charles existence seem to me to be utterly remote. went on to describe an incident that had happened this year in Kalgoorlie regarding the gold subsidy. He said that the miners walked down the street and when they got to the Post Office the cry of 'Secession, secession' rent the air. This situation has something of the Terry Thomas or Ealing film studio about it to most of us, but not to the Western Australians. One can understand their sense of indignation at and their sense of distrust of this proposal. I invite my friends to look at section 24 of the Constitution, which provides: But notwithstanding anything in this section, 5 members at least will be chosen in each original State. What if a governmentI do not say this of my friends opposite-a t some time in the future said: 'How absurd it is to have 5 members from Tasmania' again being persuaded on an arithmetical basis. That is where the fear comes in. I feel that the tragedy in this situation from the point of view of getting constitutional reform is that the Government has been impatient. I am sure that if the Governwould have been better. Admittedly, the comI do not wish to embarrass my distinguished 7 States would have been sufficient to carry a proposal-four-sevenths . At the moment, as I have sought, in the matter of 18 or 19 minutes, to put my views. Every honourable member on this side of the House subscribes to the second proposal in the Bill. The first proposal has simply been swept by by time. It is quite otiose. It is the third proposal that tion (Mode of Altering the Constitution)' would worries us. It seeks to alter the Constitution with the consent of the majority of the people and merely 3 of the 6 States. That is not good enough. At this time. I suggest that the Government, putting it in simple homely language, has put its foot in things. I think it has shown a measure of impatience which if it had held in abeyance it could well have convinced our colleagues who sit in State parliaments that we were not seeking to trench upon their position in some dramatic fashion. There is a cultivated resistance in Australia to constitutional reform. In many respects I think it is a thousand pities, but it is there and it must be recognised. The impatience of the political practitioner of today could well be the trap into which he will fall. I think it is a pity, but that is the position. The Government has now put its hand to the plough. What it will produce time and time alone will show. The Minister for Services and Property( Mr for a petition that I subsequently presented to Daly) as usual has been trying to denigrate not this House on 22 August 1967. Recently the only myself but also honourable members on Minister said that I had done nothing about this side of the House and the Country Party it. That is a typical example of the inaccuracies in particular. I noticed during his speech that I shall use that term because this is early in he was only emphasising the fact that the my speech-that flow so readily from his Government is trying to give Territorians, both tongue. There was also a protest notice nailed in the Australian Capital Territory and the to what would have been the polling booth Northern Territory, a right to vote at a referendoor. I have that to say for the Minister. dum. He sidestepped the major and cynical approach of the Government towards this question as contained in sub-section 2. (c) of the going to vote? Bill whereby it is proposed that the majority shall not be decided as at the moment on a four to two basis at referendums. It is the mention the motion of the Northern TerriGovernment's object to carry a proposal to torians. The Territorians sent a message to the alter the Constitution with agreement on a Prime Minister.

But the to be represented in national votes on vital Labor Party is tacking on to this Bill someissues. They considered overall that the matter thing that should not be there. If it is genuine in its offer to give Terriof the debates of the Legislative Council of the torians the right to vote at referendums it is Northern Territory an extract which will being most insincere about tacking paragraph (c) onto clause 2 of this Bill, hence our proposed amendment. The title of the Bill is a misnomer. I imagine that people who at a referendum saw the words 'Constitution Alteranot have the faintest idea that the Labor Party was trying to swing this rather snide deal on them about altering the numbers relevant to a majority at a referendum. I agree that section 128 should be amended by deleting the words 'in each State', as provided in clause 2 (a), so that Territorians would have a right to vote at a referendum. But clause 2 (c) should be deleted, and if the Prime Minister is sincere in this matter he will see that it is deleted. I agree that we jn the Territories should have this vote. That was part of my original platform in 1966. Despite the Minister's disparaging and inaccurate remarks, as usual, about the noise I was making or about my not having done anything about this-that was a complete falsehood-o n referendum day in 1967 I was in the lead of a protest procession marching down the street carrying banners bearing such words as '60,000 voteless voices'.

I shall quote from the Hansard report",60,Constitution Alteration Mode

126,Mr Daly,Ho w is the honourable member,62,Constitution Alteration Mode
127,Mr Calder,"You just be quiet. I shallinform the Minister for Services and Property on this matter. It states: Amongst tbe things which were brought out at the Constitutional Convention and referred to the executive and the standing committees to be looked at, there are some things which will be plucked out and dealt with by the Australian Government before the ordinary machinery of the Constitution deals with them. This was indicated at various stages during our discussions there. One of them is the matter of the powers in relation to prices and incomes. Another one following on that could well be the quesuon of legislalose than those who speak mainly, from a tion relating to electoral matters in Australia. That was Dr Letts, the member for Victoria River, speaking. He continued: So that we may get the full value out of the work of the Constitutional Convention, his matter of getting our vote recorded somehow in referenda is of prime importance and should be looked at as a matter of urgency. He also said: Obviously there are 2 different degrees of difficulty in having us included in a referendum. There would be very little difficulty in having the votes of Territorians registered and included in the overall vote of the Australian people. This is the one that should have been taken notice of by the Government and therefore influencing whether there was an overall majority of votes in favour or against a particular issue. He went on to say that it was more complicated when it came to section 128. As I have mentioned, that was Dr Letts, the Country Party leader in the Legislative Council who was speaking. What does Mr Withnall have to say? He is an independent member. He said that Dr Letts was not really politically realistic if he thought that there would be 2 amendments of section 128 in succession. He said: The people of Australia simply won't accept that they have to vote on 2 amendments to section 128. Mr Withnall is a legal man and I imagine he knows what he is saying. He also said: I find it somewhat odd, in view of the fact that this provision in the constitution is to come under very careful scrutiny by the standing committee of the Constitutional Convention, that the honourable member proposes that we should ask the Commonwealth Parliament to put before the people a referendum in advance of the decision of the constitutional committee. That was the point being made all through this debate. It was considered that the matter should be considered by the Constitutional Convention. Mr Withnall continued: I would like to see that the people of the Northern Territory have a vote but it ought to be on terms more carefully considered than this. It ought to be on terms that seek the exact way in which section 128 is to be amended. It ought to be in terms that do not permit the Commonwealh government to take the best way. As I said, an independent member spoke on those lines. He also said: I think it anticipates a decision of the Constitutional Convention. These are men who are actually in the Northern Territory and have first hand knowledge and experience. They have more to gain or political standpoint, on behalf of the Government. What did Mr Ward, another legal man in the Territory, say? He has been there since 1939 and has practised on and off during that time. He is also the Leader of the Labour Party in the Legislative Council. Mr Ward moved an amendment to the original motion that is quite interesting. He moved that the motion be amended by omitting all words after 'that' and substituting: (a) the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory, the State Premiers and the Executive Committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention, be informed of the disquietude of Nonhern Territory citizens at their inability to take part in referenda to change the Australian Constitution; and (b) the Executive Committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention be requested to give priority considerauon to a means of providing citizens in Australian Territories with voting rights in referenda equal to those of their compatriots in the AustraUan States. In speaking to the amendment Mr Ward said: I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Port Darwin. He was referring to Mr Withnall, who said he considered that the matter should go before the Constitutional Convention. Mr Ward continued: This amendment does achieve the right approach which should be adopted on a matter of this kind. I agree, nevertheless, with the honourable mover of the motion That is, Dr Letts from Victoria Riverthat this matter should be brought to the attention of the right authorities. It is a question of who are the right authorities Fair enough and we have covered all those who could possibly be involved. We certainly could not bypass in any way the Australian Constitutional Convention. The speaker was the Leader of the Labor Party in the Legislative Council. He advocated something entirely different to what the Government proposes in this measure. On the following day in the Legislative Council that amendment was agreed to by all elected members. On that day Dr Letts said: Undoubtedly the collective wisdom which will be brought together in the executive of the Constitutional usual crop of cliches and without substance. Convention should arrive at a better and more balanced decision and one which will carry more force in an Australian referendum on the subject than a decision of one parliament or one man, the Prime Minister or the Federal Parliament. That is what the people of the Northern Territory have said about this matter. The remarks to which I have referred relate only to the question of the right of people in the Northern Territory to vote at a referendum. At that time the members of the Legislative Council did not know that the Government proposed to introduce by this rather underhand, slimy and dishonest approach the amendment set out in clause 2 (c) of the Bill. I do not know whether the Government hopes to have opposition to its referendum it hopes to sneak in this provision to reduce and of the honourable member for Moreton the majority of the States in favour of a pro( Mr Killen), particularly as they related to posal in order to carry a proposal. I agree that clause 2(c) of the Bill. One claimed that the the Constitution should be amended as propassing of this legislation would result in the posed in clause 2 (c), but I do not agree that abolition of the sovereignty of the States, and it should be done under the terms of this Bill. the other referred to destroying the States and As I say, I do not know whether this Bill has the powers they possess.

After listening to honourable memat large, or in their aggregate capacity, but bers opposite speak to this proposed alteration by the people of the future States voting in and to the other proposed alterations to the Constitution one sees that what they have said certainly reflects a completely negative approach. Their speeches were clouded in the When honourable members opposite talk of constitutional reform they obviously mean that they are all for reform providing it changes nothing. In this context what they obviously mean is that we ought to put the clock back by strengthening the States at the expense of Commonwealth power. Maybe we should and maybe we should not, but 'before we limit the discussion of constitutional reform to what the rights of the States ought to be, surely we should debate whether we want to preserve the federal system at all. If we want to preserve the federation in something like its present form, we should at least spell out why we want to do that. I was interested in the remarks of the right Using 'federal' in its primary sense, the general between the federal and national elements separate and independent, within their respective . . . national which unite the people which regard the people colony.

129,Mr Jacobi (Hawker) (4.17),"I support Australia, that was to be voting 'en masse' oreach State as inhabitants thereof. Then they said that if a general vote had been accepted as a test, the Constitution would have been triumphantly adopted on 3 June 1898. They concluded by saying this: The Commonwealth, however, is not constituted merely hy a union of States; it is something more than that; it is also a union of people. That is more relevant to this discussion than because they were dealt with in the second the arguments advanced by the honourable reading speech and by a majority of the member for Moreton. The other question that has been raised is observations on the proposed alteration. It the inflexibility of the Constitution particularly retains the 2 basic principles embodied in section 128. I was interested in what was said section 128, and I think everybody would agree at the Constitutional Convention and in the that they are worthy of retention. The first is reference 'by the honourable member for that no ordinary, but an absolute majority, of Stirling( Mr Viner) to Sir John Cockburn, a the members of the Houses of Parliament is famous South Australian. When dealing, in required to amend the Constitution; secondly, effect, with the referral provisions-the y are that the people have a voice in altering their apposite to the matter before the House-thi s fundamental law; and thirdly, some reference is what Sir John Cockburn said shortly after is made to the States, although it is submitted federation: Constitutions tough, yet tractable, give the best tially give way to an approach which primarily promise of long and healthy life, the most deadly considers the electorate as a national entity. foe to organised growth is the atheroma which cannot yield without rupture.

This for the direct expression of the popular voice. probably indicates that it is not so much the In my view, the question of the procedures for Australian system but the Australian electorate constitutional amendment is the most fundawhich is inherently conservative. After all, with mental issue. If this alteration is not supported a Constitution so manifestly inadequate, either by this Parliament or by the people, all popular reticence towards change cannot be the rest is mere talk. Basically, section 128 of merely an expression of satisfaction with the the Constitution provides that an amendment status quo. This alteration is critioal, and it of the Constitution requires the assent of an needs to receive the wholehearted support of absolute majority of the members of both all sections of the community if this nation Houses of Parliament, of a majority of electors is to progress in a constructive and meaningful in a majority of ithe States, and of a majority way.

The requirement of innovation is to me as gruel was to Oliver approval by a majority of electors in a TwistI accept it but I intend asking for majority of electors in a majority of States is more. I can only reiterate the argument I too stringent because this means that majorities advanced at the recent Constitutional in four out of the 6 States must approvein effect, 2 States can veto the proposal.

It will be interesting to see whether the members of the Country Party in the other place confirm the view that has been expressed by members of the Country Party in this House. I will not refer again to the 2 alterations sought to section 128 of the Constitution speakers in this debate, but I shall make 2 that this latter principle should at least parI have said this previously, and I will repeat Convention. It is admitted on all sides that our Constiextremely slight indeed. At least we, as a Government, have taken the initiative for the first time in a quarter of a century to have public discussion on the Constitution and to give the people an opportunity to vote upon it. This stems undoubtedly from the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1958 and 1959. One of the reasons for scepticism stems undoubtedly from the fact that there has been no real preparation on a large-scale to determine public opinion on changes to the Constitution. Another reason is the intransigence of both the voting public and the Opposition parties. We stand by, year after year, while vast amounts of taxpayers money are wasted on sterile disputes concerning the extent of Commonwealth and State powers while the taxpayers of the Commonwealth have to listen to Australian and State governments passing the buck back and forth. We stand by, year after year, while commercial interests play off one government against another to their own advantage. Why should we assume that we are stuck forever with a particular solution to a particular problem, a solution which was aimed at by our forefathers over 70 years ago? They had a definite objective in view, and that was the social and political integration of 6 communities into one community, for the common good of all. Admittedly they did not have much to go on. Federations are two a dollar these days but they were not that cheap in the 1890s. America and Canada were about the only two extant examples. To their credit they came up with a pretty good Constitution for their time, but surely they would have been the last people to argue that the result of their combined labours was to fix a codification of constitutional law which was to remain inflexible, immutable and binding upon all generations for all time. If that is what the Opposition contends in relation to the proposed change, it is utterly preposterous. The founders of Federation certainly would not have subscribed to that view. I fear that the chances are that the more attempts that we make at amendment under the present onerous section 128 procedures the more negative results we will get. Regrettably voting 'no' will become a sort of reflex action in the Australian electorate. It will become the norm and successive amendments will become harder to pass. Therefore it is imperative that we satisfactorily alter A Bill for an Act To facilitate alterations to the section 128 of the Constitution before we do much. I have been asked to restrict myself to 10 minutes speaking time and I will comply with the request. Let me repeat what I said last May in a debate dealing with our offshore legislation because I believe my remarks then are equally pertinent to this debate. I also want to make an observation on the Opposition generally. Having listened intently to Opposition speakers I am reminded of an assessment I once heard of the Anglo-Saxon electorate in South Africa. It was said that they talked progressive, voted liberal and hoped to God that the conservatives got in. phrase. It is very apposite. Unless the Parliament and the people support the Government's attempt to amend the process of amendment, then you are just so many men hoping to God that nothing out of the ordinary will ever happen. Let me conclude by repeating what I said last May. I said that our federal system may be looked at in 2 ways. It may be reviewed either as a loose confederation of quasi-independent States or as a national federation. I do not apologise for voicing it as being the latter. IfI may paraphrase something which the honourable member for Moreton said on another occasion, I am an Australian first and a South Australian after. It is about time that we acknowledged that our Constitution should no longer be used as an obstructive document which can be quoted by any partisan politician for his own purposes. Our Constitution must be clear, dynamic and forward looking. It must in my opinion serve the purposes of an Australian federation of States and not preserve a confederation. If our Constitution cannot serve us in that way, then it ought to be changed. If the law exists to frustrate common sense, then the law must be changed. I commend the constitution alterations to the House. Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah) (4.30)I rise to speak on this Bill because it is symptomatic of the type of legislation which this Government is bringing forward and, as has been mentioned by several other speakers on this side of the House, it seeks to mislead the Australian people. It seeks to mislead them by the title which reads: Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to vote at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution.",64,Constitution Alteration Mode
130,Mr Viner,It is not a bad philosophy.,66,Constitution Alteration Mode
131,Mr Jacobi,"It is a very good turn ofHonourable members on both sides of this House would, I am sure, agree that the Constitution is probably one of the most fundamental documents governing our Uves. To seek to alter that Constitution in a manner which is not clearcut is, in my view, a clear attempt to deceive the people because when this matter comes before the Australian people for a vote there is nothing in the title of the Bill which refers to the 2 ways in which the Constitution is proposed to be altered. I think that is a simple attempt to deceive. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) has cogently put forward arguments in relation to both concepts which are embodied in this legislation. The first relates to providing the residents of the Territories with an opportunity to vote in referenda. I believe that nobody would argue that the people in the Territories should not have that right. They are citizens of Australia and they should have the right to vote in referenda. But in relation to this very contentious question of changing the Constitution in respect of a majority of the States, clause 2 (c) seeks to omit the words 'in a majority of the States' and to substitute the words 'in not less than one-half of the States'. To me this is a retrograde step because I believe, as I have said previously, that proposed alterations to the Constitution should be made very clear so that the people of AustraUa have clear in their minds the questions which are before them. They will not have clear in their minds these questions before them because of the way in which this referendum will be presented to them. There is another aspect which I believe should be investigated. It has always been a tenet of good chairmanship and good framing of motions that any motion should have only one central idea in it. If a motion has 2 central ideas and it cannot be amended, then the motion is likely to fail. This is a motion which contains two separate definite parts. We cannot, as this proposal is presently before us, vote for one and not the other. We have to vote either fof both or for neither. I am quite certain that a majority of the Australian people would be fully in agreement with the idea that all Australian electors should have the opportunity of voting in referenda. But I am less convinced that aU Australians would seek to alter the constitutional requirement in relation to a majority of the States. The people of Australia are presented with a very difficult question. They have to choose between their desire to give all electors the opportunity to vote in referenda, and their opposition perhaps to the alteration of the requirement in relation to a majority of the States. I suggest that when they are called upon to make this decision, which they should not be called upon to make, then the possibility of the well-fancied proposal contained in the BiU being passed is seriously jeopardised. Let us look at some of the arguments contained in the second reading speech made by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). He admits in the first paragraph of that speech that 2 changes are proposed to section 128. Having admitted that, in my view there is no justification for concealing it in the title of the Bill. The Prime Minister continues: The real difficulty is that the Australian Constitution has proved in practice to be extremely difficult to amend. The Prime Minister says that as though it is a bad thing. Would anybody seriously suggest that a constitution should be easy to amend? I remind honourable members that the purpose of a constitution is defined as: A system or body of fundamental principles according to which a nation, State or body politic is constituted and governed. Would anybody seriously suggest, if that definition is accepted, teat a constitution should be easy to amend? Of course one would not. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, stated further: The emphasis, in this day and age, should be on flexibility and on what a majority of the electors want, wherever they live, while retaining a proper position for the States. In his speech today, the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) said that it did not matter where electors lived. I contest that point. I would argue that the geographic location of electors has a large effect on the way in which they look at propositions put to them. One would not imagine for a moment that the people of Western Australia at this time would regard centralised control from Canberra in the same light as would many people from New South Wales. The honourable member for Moreton has already given to the House a very real story of what occurred earUer this year. I do not think that we should blind ourselves to the practicalities of the situation. The simple fact is that the geographic location of people determines in many instances their approach to and their opinions on fundamental points. I think that where people live has a real influence on the way in which they consider various matters. For example, the people of Tasmania, who are affectionately referred to as Taswegians, have a very real appreciation of their geographic location. I think that we should understand this fact. The present Australian Constitution acknowledges this appreciation. It did so at the time when it was framed. The Prime Minister states further: We are one nation, we are one people That is quite right. We are. He continues: . . . and on national issues it is desirable that the will of the nation should be determined more 'by the total vote of all the people entitled to vote than in voting to achieve that end. We saw an by State borders. Why not go all the way? If that is what the Prime Minister really believes, why does he not move to abolish entirely this provision in relation to the States? If he believes that, why not cut it out altogether? What he is seeking to do is to achieve by stealth what his ultimate ambition is, that is, to do away with the States as entities. We have heard a good deal of talk from Government supporters about the fact that the Constitution presently imposes a requirement that two-thirds of the States must pass a referendum before it can become law. The Prime Minister states: But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original 6 SUtesI agree with the proposition that the framers of the Constitution envisaged more States and therefore they instituted this requirement in relation to a majority of States agreeing at a referendum in the confident expectation that there would be more States created in the future. The honourable member for Moreton has postulatedI believe he is prepared to wager money on it-that more States will not be created -perhap s it is more than slightly dishonesttime. I would not go that far. I do not say that more States will be created. If we have an increasing trend towards regionalisation as envisaged by members of the Government, there is no real guarantee that these proposed regions, should they come into effect, will not assume a more definite shape and in fact become States or Statelike in the ultimate. So, I do not think that we can say as the Government does that because the requirement is two-thirds this is a bad thing. It is two-thirds of present number of States because there are 6 States. If there were seven or more States, the fraction would correspondingly be reduced. The Prime Minister states further: As a matter of historical interest social service proposals of a wide-ranging nature which were submitted at the same time obtained a majority in all States and an overall majority. The Prime Minister was referring to the occasion of the referendum when certain questions were passed and others were rejected. This goes to prove, I believe, that when the Australian people really wish to see an alteration to the Constitution they have no trouble example of this in 1967 when 2 questions, one dealing with Aborigines and the other with the breaking of the nexus between the numbers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, were posed at a referendum. The vote was clear cut. The Australian people were in favour of the question relating to Aborigines but were against breaking the nexus between the 2 Houses of this Parliament. That seems to me to be a very good example of how, if the Government was really sincere in its wish to have these alterations made to the Constitution, it could bring its aim about, that is, by separating the questions contained in this Bill. Not only would this in my mind be a more reasonable way, a more honest way, a more direct way and a more clear cut way of presenting the alternative propositions to the Australian people but also it would probably have the very real effect of giving the Australian people the opportunity of voting in favour of the measure proposing a constitutional change to give electors in the Territories the opportunity to vote at a referendum and also to express their opinion on the second proposal contained in this Bill. To present both questions together in my view is misleading. It is slightly dishonest and also it runs the very real risk of preventing a wished-for amendment to the Constitution being agreed to. wonders what one can assume from the constant attendance in this House this afternoon of a total of one or two members of the Labor Party about the regard of Government supporters for this measure which the Government has put before us.

136,Mr Staley,"There is little enthusiasm.members intend to draw a veil of secrecy over the operation in which they are involved in this Bill; perhaps they simply do not care. Even the charms and the eloquence of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) could not beguile them out of their private chambers. This is a Bill which, as other honourable members have said, basically seeks to do 2 things. It seeks to extend to all electors the right to vote in a referendum and it seeks to reduce the requirement that there should be, in addition to an absolute majority of electors in favour of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, also a majority in a majority of States supporting such a proposal. This Bill, in seeking to do these 2 things, offers us not only a bait but also a hook. The bait is highly succulent, tender and juicy. We agree completely with the remarks of Government supporters that it is a fundamental democratic principle that all electors should have the right to vote in a referendum. I do not think there would be a member of my Party or indeed on my side of the House who would depart from that principle. I was puzzled by the remarks of the honourable member for Hawker( Mr Jacobi) about what might happen to this legislation in another place. there? day in another place. But I will have to see it before I believe it. The bait is offered that, by passing this Bill and supporting this referendum on which the Bill is based, we should give votes in a referendum to all electors in this country. We would love to be able to do it. We regret that this is merely a bait which is placed upon a hook a hook which has some lack of attraction for us. The hook is in a way another one of those hooks which suggests that the Labor Party would, if it could, hang federalism by the neck until it was dead. Further, the Government has thrown a veil of secrecy over its operations. The basic and short statement which is contained in the Bill and which will be put before the people can only mislead the people as to the question on which they will be casting a vote in the referendum. The Bill is entitled as a Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution. That is a general statement. No detail is given as to what sort of alteration is envisaged. It could be stated as an alteration of the Constitution to enable a referendum to be passed if there were a majority in three out of the 6 States or something like that. It could be stated in a dozen words at the most. We go on and find that the other half of the proposition which is being put to the people is spelt out. It is odd that one part of the proposition is spelt out in detail while the other part warrants no detail whatsoever in the mind of the Government, the other part being, of course, to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. That is nothing other than an attempt to draw a veil of secrecy over what is being done to mislead the people as to the vote they will be making at the referendum. We strenuously object to this sort of thing. Constitutions, by their very nature, should be hard to change, precisely because they are in effect the rules which govern the Government of the country. Honourable members opposite might say that in Britain the Constitution can be changed easily by a majority in the Houses of Parliament. If they have a mind to say this, I would remind them that in Britain the Constitution, at least in important particulars, is changed only after the most lengthy deliberative proceedings in their Houses of Parliament. Britain does not change its Constitution with anything like the reckless abandon with which the Government in this country these days seeks to change the Australian Constitution, and indeed, in some respects, even the Australian way of life. The Constitution is always a most serious document, because it governs the Government of the country. In a federal system it is even more important that there should be safeguards surrounding the Constitution. It is unimaginable that one would have a federal system without building safeguards of that federal system into the Constitution because there has to be some way of reconciling the obvious conflicts which will occur in such a system from time to time between all the parts or the governments of the system. If at the time of Federation those who looked to the future felt that the small States might 'be in some peril at the hands of the predatory large States, today it is all the States who feel that they are in some peril at the hands of the predatory central government. That was not a question when the Constitution was drawn up. Few thought at the time of Australia's Federation that the basic governing role of the States was in",68,Constitution Alteration Mode
137,Mr Jacobi,What about the Country Party,69,Constitution Alteration Mode
138,Mr Staley,"That is a matter for anotherany real doubt. There was a thought, of course, that the big States could in certain particulars dominate. Nobody really for a moment thought that the States as basic governing units were threatened by the system. It is true that Alfred Deakin, with remarkable prescience, talked of the way in which the small States would be drawn into the orbit of the large and of the way in which the power of the new Federal Government would increase. He talked of the States being tied to the chariot wheels of the Commonwealth, and we all know those great words. As I say ,there was remarkable prescience, but the fact remains that at Federation there was no thought that the States were in dire peril of their existence. At the time of the Constitution, as a matter of convenience, the founding fathers sought to deal with the troublesome and absurd matters which were summed up as the barbarism of borderism. They sought very often economic goals, but there was no thought that our system would ultimately become a unitary system. My point is that even then, under no real threat, the founding fathers provided for a majority of the States in a referendum as a sensible way to provide for democratic dealings between what would be regarded as equal members in a partnership who had decided for certain important and overriding reasons to come together to form a federal union but for other purposes to retain their separate existence. This after all is to this day what federalism is all about. It is about the decision to sink certain differences for certain common purposes while retaining a measure of pride in one's own existence. Today the spirit in which the Federal Labor Government acts is what sadly disturbs so many Australians. The logical extension of the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in his opening speech in this debate is that an ordinary majority of all electors would suffice for the passage of a referendum. There is no particular magic in there being a majority in three out of the 6 States as he is suggesting with the support of his Party. There is no magic at all in this. There is indeed much more magic in the proposition that there ought to be a majority of States that would assent to anything that is as basic to a constitution as are the powers between and among the several States of the union. It is a very odd thing that in 1973 the constitutional safeguards of the federal system should take on a new significance, but they do. They take on a new significance because we live today in what we might loosely describe as days of big government. Government is no longer a thing that you could do in the afternoon between a good lunch and those other things that gentlemen used to do in .the evenings and sometimes still do, even in this House, in the days when the British Constitution comprised the monarch, the parliament and the foxhounds. Today we live in different days. We live in days of big bureaucratic government, when big government poses a quite new threat to individuals. Only today we have been talking about such threats in government bureaucracies and the use of secrets. This means that we must take a fresh look at those sorts of things which safeguard individual rights and which safeguard a system which provides checks and balances aimed at safeguarding individual rights. It always strikes me as a sad and quaint thing that the Australian Labor Party rails so much against the 'inherent conservatism of the Australian people' and that it rails against the Australian people for only being decent enough to pass 5 referendums. What it fails to see is that this is a measure very often of the wisdom of the Australian people and the basic good sense of the Australian people, who are healthy disrespecters of government and who, if they are healthy disrespecters of all government, are particularly healthy disrespecters of Canberra based government. They are healthy disrespecters, as Australian people, of big government, because they are basic respecters of the rights of individual people. was of concern to me that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) should introduce into this Parliament a number of significant Bills to initiate referendums to change the Constitution at a time when local government authorities, State governments and the Federal Government are meeting together in a constitutional review convention. Irrespective of the merits of each one of the Bills that have been submitted to us, it is important that the constitutional review convention be allowed and be seen to perform the charge which has been given to it. It is a unique convention; it is a unique gathering, in that for the first time in a meeting of this sort there are representatives not only of Federal and State governments but also of that important third tier of government. Because it is a unique gathering, I regard it",69,Constitution Alteration Mode
139,Mr Sinclair (New England) (4.54),"I tas most unfortunate that Bills of this character, including the one before the House, are being initiated by the Prime Minister at this time. The second point which concerns me relates to the several referenda Bills. I suspect that the motivation of the Prime Minister and of the Government is not simply to achieve the changes that are expressed in the respective Bills just for the sake of the particular format to which each one refers. We have dealt with several in this chamber and the one before us today changes significantly the way in which a referendum is in fact passed through eliminating the necessity for it to be successful in a majority of States and also enables persons in the Territories of Australia to vote in referenda. It is not on those merits that this Bill or the other ones are being put forward. I believe that each one of them is a direct and overt expression of this Labor Government's intention to divert more power to Canberra. Whether it be on 8 December when the people of Australia are considering a referendum on another matter or whether it be on another occasion when they consider the referendum which will flow from the Bill that is now before the chamber, the people of Australia must be conscious that each one of these measures is not presented just for the overt change of the Constitution in the way that the Bills suggest but rather in a covert fashion to ensure that additional powers can be exercised in Canberra. I suggest that through the exercise of those powers, the powers of the State governments and local governments will be eroded. Of course, in the implementation of the socialist platform of the Labor Government, the powers and rights of the individuals of this country will be eroded. My third reason for concern with this Bill is the basis on which section 128 of the Constitution is to b3 altered. I am apprehensive that in the ambit of the Parliament alone we should be recommending the submission to the electorate of a referendum to delete the necessity for a majority of the States to approve the passage of a referendum. I see that there is still a very real significance in State governments in Australia. If those States, particularly the smaller States, are to be given an opportunity to grow and prosper there needs to be some proceeding by which there can be some relative equality between States such as Tasmania and the larger States, such as New South Wales, which are bigger in population as well as in geographic area. Although we are one nation and although, as the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, this Bill, perhaps more than any other of the referenda Bills, seeks to achieve the concept of one nation, it is certainly true that there are variances between States in size, pressures, economic circumstances and social opportunities. As a result, I do not believe that it is suitable for us within this chamber alone to introduce a referendum to change this part of section 128. I mentioned before my belief that if this Bill were to come forward it would have been better had it emanated or evolved from the discussions at the Australian Constitutional Review Convention. There is no justification for us in this Parliament to say arbitrarily to the States: 'We will no longer give you as States the opportunity through the application of section 128 of the Constitution to have a separate fight in determining whether the Constitution should be changed'. Let me hasten to say that this Parliament must be-of course, under the Constitution it can be only through this Parliament-the organism through which a referendum can be referred to the people. But that does not mean that, when a constitutional review convention is meeting and when the States are the principal participants in that convention, they should not have been given thefirstopportunity to say whether they really believed that this sort of change was in their interests. Our taking an arbitrary judgment here over and above anything that the States want is likely to ensure that this particular measure is rejected by the people of Australia. In terms of the intrinsic merit of the proposal, again I have some doubts. I am uncertain as to whether it is desirable, for the reason I mentioned before-the difference between the big States and the small Statesto remove the requirement that there should be a majority of States as well as a majority of electors approving a referendum. The character of our Constitution is such that it has stood the test of time. For all that there have been minimal changes-the five mentioned by the Prime Minister to which the people have acceded-it is a Constitution which has been changed indirectly as much as directly. Those who follow the decisions of the High Court-in particular the recent decision in the concrete pipes case-wil l know the extent to which the application of the Constitution and the relative powers between Canberra and the several States have changed both as a result of those decisions by the Court and also by the exercise of the taxation power by this Parliament. As a result the Constitution has changed quite significantly. I query the degree to which in this particular area there is a need for us specifically to change the Constitution to make constitutional change easier simply by the removal of the requirement that a majority of States should support the referendum. The other thing that concerns me is the degree to which at this stage people within the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are denied the opportunity to speak on a constitutional matter. I support wholeheartedly the part of the Bill which deals with that matter. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder), who has already spoken in this debate, has since his election to this chamber expressed his concern that the same opportunities should be provided for Territorians, whether they be in the north or here in the Australian Capital Territory, to express a view on matters that affect all other Australian citizens, for those that affect rather than any genuine concern about making all other Australian citizens must equally affect them because they too are Australian citizens. Of course there are particular problems in the constitutional relationship between the citizen of a Territory and the citizen of a State. The particular relationship of the Government of the Commonwealth to the individual Territorian is different from its relationship to every other Australian citizen. I do not see that there is any validity any longer in our preserving a circumstance whereby those who are qualified electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are denied the opportunity to speak on referenda referred to other Australian citizens. Accordingly, the Australian Country Party completely supports that part of the Bill which ensures that there will be a vote for electors within the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory at referenda which will subsequently be submitted to the Australian people. The other item within the Bill is largely a procedural matter and therefore I have no disagreement with it. But let me revert finally to that part of the Bill which concerns me most-that is, the degree to which at a time when the States, local government and the Commonwealth are meeting together, the Prime Minister should have initiated measures of this sort. I believe that it reflects little credit on him and his Government that he has not been prepared to participate within that Constitutional Convention in a meaningful way. Participation does not mean just attending the sessions of the conference; nor does it mean just standing up at those sessions and expressing the intentions of his Government. It means taking part in such a way that any recommendations and submissions from the Convention are considered by this Parliament, and Bills prepared and ultimately proposals put to the people if that should be the decision of this Parliament. This Bill, perhaps more than any of the others, demonstrates that the Prime Minister is not particularly concerned with the Convention; nor, indeed, would I suggest that he is really concerned with constitutional change, other than the extent to which it is going to enhance the powers which he and his colleagues will exercise. I beUeve that the Australian people need to take note of the degree to which that is the significant motivation which leads the Government to present this Bill to the House at this time, constitutional change simpler and easier. Capital Territory) (5.6)-If I were not normally a charitable socialist feUowI would, of course, think that my coUeagues opposite were simply trying to have 2-bob each way, as the saying goes; in other words, that tbey would not give votes to the people of the Territories if it came to a single straight-forward vote on the issue in this place. In fact, if the Government had brought down 2 referendum Bills they would not have supported them either. But I will be kind enough today to say that perhaps they are on our side on the question of counting every Australian as being equal in this case, especially when they are not going to stand up and be counted themselves. This afternoon we are taking a step to integrate the people of the 2 Territories-the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory-int o the Australian electorate, at least for the counting of their numbers in referendums. There can be no argument against that proposition. It is strange that we have taken so long to get around to it. I am only voicing, on behalf of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, their wish to participate in these matters. Over the last 5 or 6 weeks I have attempted, as Minister for the Capital Territory, to explain exactly why, on so many issues, the people of the Australian Capital Territory do not need to have a say.",70,Constitution Alteration Mode

In some areas honourable members may well have doubts as to whether they would vote for the propositions put forward. I am emphatically in favour of the proposals that have been put forward in the last few weeks. Plenty of people who think about politics in the same way as I do have had doubts about some of them. But I can think of no reason whatsoever why such propositions should not be put forward. So we must proceed to do so now. It has been a long, slow haul since the 1890s. After listening to the remarks of my colleagues opposite, I cannot understand how we ever federated. Just imagine the arguments they would have put up 80 years ago. Just imagine the honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Staley) stepping out of the ivory towers of Toorak in 1893, as he does now. He would have said: 'Look, you cannot do that. You will be interfering with the sacred rights of us Victorians if you make us join with those people from north of the Murray'. It is one of the miracles of Australian public life, considerments and even the municipal councils as ing the fact that there are still people Uke that having greater heart, feeling and sensitivity here, that 80 years ago we were able to have Constitutional Conventions and to enhance the tremendous document that is the government arrangements of Australia, as a result of the vote of the people of Australia. I just do not know why so many of them have gone down hill so far in the last few years. When one hears what they have to say one must admit that what happened is one of the astonishing exercises in Australian politics. Let us examine some of the other things that were asserted by honourable members on the other side of the House, particularly by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party. They are a notable bunch of democrats. One has only to consider the way in which they have rigged every electoral boundary in Australia and how they have prevented people from voting in Legislative Council elections throughout Australia to see how they would be worried about such matters. He said that this was a direct and overt expression of the Australian Labor Party's thirst for power, or words to that effect. Those are magnificent words. Of course, they are all part of a cliche to try to stampede the people into voting no. Then he talked about the power of the States. I wonder what he meant by the word 'power'. One of the great exercises in which he and his colleagues indulge is the enshrining of the States of Australia as some sort of holy writ. Let us examine them and see what they are like. Let us examine, for instance, the recent return to office in New South Wales of the Liberal-Country Party Coalition. majority of the people voting for it. If one were able to enshrine the arguments of other honourable members opposite he would have to say that that is not a true vote. Fifty-one per cent of the people of New South Wales have not said 'Let us have Askin. We will have to have other elections until we find out'. Perhaps, on their views, we should proceed until we get an absolute majority voting for somebody. But, of course, they are not going to do that. The number of times the Liberal and Country Parties of Australia have achieved an absolute majority of the votes is minimal indeed. Of course, what honourable members opposite have established is that they are more concerned with power than with people. They are continuously enshrining the State governabout people than this Commonwealth Government. The Australian government has made some great errors in the past, but in general it is based upon adult suffrage, no matter how much tinkering goes on from honourable members opposite. But just consider the records of the State governments and municipal councils when it comes to the arbitrary and capricious exercise of their power over people. Their bulldozers will knock streets of houses down, their governments will hang and flog, and they will rig electoral boundaries and gerrymander the whole system. Honourable members opposite cannot make any case for preserving States' rights or anything else. The operation here today is one of the continuous steps we will have to take to bring the Australian Constitution into this century. As I said at the beginning of my speech, one can only wonder at the enormous persuasive capacity of our predecessors 80 years ago who managed to convince the Australian peopleI suppose there were people like honourable members opposite representing them then-to federate into one nation. This legislation represents more of the long, hard steps we must take to bring the Constitution up to date.

If we accept that amendment the section would read: The proposed law . . . . shall be submitted to the electors qualified to vote . . . . It is part of the federal compact that the States be preserved. If one looks at the foot of section 128 of the Constitution one sees a requirement that an amendment of the Constitution must 'be approved by the majority of the electors in each State. That being so, the Constitution should provide also that a referendum is put to the electors in each State. I do not dispute-indee d I support itthe contention that we should also allow the electors in the Territories to vote and that their vote should be counted in determining the overall majority. I and the Government are at one on this. We are both trying to do the same thing. But I would suggest to the Government that it would be better drafting to keep the words as they appear in the section. One is always a little worried about omitting from the Constitution words which protect the States. To retain the words 'in each State' and simply add the words 'and Territory' would mean that the Bill would be submitted to the electors in each State and Territory matter. My amendment would make no subseparately. This is necessary, of course, if one stantial difference to what the Government is to satisfy the requirements of a majority in says it wants to do, but I think it represents the majority of the States. I am not suggesting an improvement in drafting. It would better that we should do anything to impair the preserve the federal nature of the Constituposition of the States-ver y much the contion, and it is one which I hope the Governtrary. I think that when we are drafting an ment will be inclined to accept.

But at the same time first move towards the assassination of the I agree with the Government that the votes of States by leaving out these words, if there is those in the Territories should be counted in bad faith in the Bill, the Government will not the general total which is required of all accept my amendment. But I would prefer to electors to carry a referendum. I agree with believe that in this instance, and only in this the Government that the electors in the Terriinstance, the Government means what it says tories should have that right, but I do not and will, therefore, be inclined to accept my think that since the Constitution is a federal amendment which clarifies the position and compact we should, in any way, impair the does not derogate from what the Government rights of the electors in the States. I know that with this Government-and I whole proposal is meant as a first step to the must say, with respect, it was with past goveventual assassination of the States, of course, ernments also-it is a matter of pride not to the Government will reject my amendment. I accept an amendment even though it may am not saying that the Government wants to result in an improvement to the Bill. Maybe do this at present. Let us consider this amendthat same kind of foolish wide actuates even ment on its merits. I believe that there are very the Prime Minister, although we know that the Prime Minister, of all the people, is a modest man and is quite devoid of any feelings of pride. I suggest to the Prime Minister that in this matter of drafting, he should swallow not his pride but the pride of his Party, and accept my amendment, which is reasonable and one that improves the drafting and makes clear the residual rights of the States in the federal compact. I ask the Government not to take out, even from this section, the phrase 'in each State' but to prefer the machinery whereby the referendum is submitted to the electors in each State and the Territories. Let me again make clear my amendment which has now been circulated. I suggest that we should not take out the words 'in each State' twice occurring; but instead that we should leave in those words and add after them the words 'and Territory'. This would make clearer to the people in the Territories what we are doing for them. Moreover, it would preserve, as it should preserve, the position of the States explicitly in this section of the Commonwealth Constitution which is part of the federal compact and is drafted around the residual rights of the States in that compact. I ask the Government to reconsider this says it wants to do. If on the other hand this great merits in making an amendment along the lines I have suggested. (5.36)-The amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) would make no difference in the circumstances which apply in Australia at the moment where there are 2 Territories. It would appear that on this matter everybody in the chamber agrees that everybody entitled to vote for the House of Representatives should be entitled to vote on the question of amending the Constitution. The Government, however, does not accept the amendment because it is quite conceivable that there will be not two but one Territory. It is quite within contemplation that one of the Territories might become a State within the meaning of the Constitution. When that happens the term 'of the electors in each State and Territory' would not be apt. The correct terminology then would be 'in each State and any Territory'. When we are amending the Constitution we ought to propose amendments which will stand for as far ahead as we can contemplate. I know that contemplation is sometimes more distant in these matters than any of us would expect. For instance, the founding fathers of Australia's Constitution certainly would not have expected that after three-quarters of a century there would still be only 6 States. I am not without hope that there will be more than 6 States in the lifetime of many members here. On the other hand I would not imagine that there is likely to be more Territories in the sense of the Constitution. In those circumstances I believe that the objective that we all have-that is, the giving of a vote on proposals to amend the Constitution to every elector qualified to vote for the House of Representatives-is best secured by removing the limitation contained in the words 'in each State'. To add 'and Territory' would deal with the present situation but it might not be appropriate in circumstances which we ought to have in contemplation. second reading debate I and other honourable members on the Opposition said that the critically important factor for us when considering the first proposal in relation to paragraph (a) of clause 2 was to ensure that the residents of the Territories-that is the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, and the Northern Territory-shoul d have a vote if they are qualified under the law. We have no hesitation in repeating now in emphatic words, that we want those people to get a vote. I pointed out that there are 264,000 citizens in the 2 Territories and of those 130,700 are entitled to vote. I have looked at the amendment that has been prepared and submitted by my colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), during the time. I have been sitting at the table waiting to commence the Committee discussions. I do not believe that in present circumstances it adds enough to the Bill to justify a change in the proposal and could, in fact, in the future create some difficulties. For that reason the Opposition does not press Mr Wentworth's amendment. Provided it is ensured that the 130,700 people qualified to vote will be entitled to vote, we as an official Opposition, will be prepared to support paragraph (a) of clause 2. perfectly true that the Opposition as a whole has not had an opportunity to consider my amendment because it was submitted by me only a few moments ago. Of course the Opposition in the Senate may have an opportunity to consider it at greater length as more time will be available to it. I can understand the dilemma of the right honourable member for time to think about it and realise what it is all about. I can understand and appreciate his position. I do not want to press it any further than that. HoweverI address myself to the remarks which the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) was good enough to let fall from his lips in this chamber. His observations do not seem to me to be terribly logical. I would be quite happy to accept as an amendment to my amendment the inclusion of the words 'and any Territory'. I do not think it is necessary but if he would like it I would be very happy to meet the honourable gentleman in that way. It does not seem to me to add to or detract from the thought that was in my mind when I moved my amendment. Of course one has to look to the future. I do not think it likely that the Australian Capital Territory will be erected into a State. If it were, quite extensive alterations would be necessary to the Constitution. If the Australian Capital Territory became a StateI suppose it is possible that there would be no Territories but if this were so the Constitution,",75,Constitution Alteration Mode

152,Lowe ( Mr Mcmahon) Who Just Has Not Had,"not only in this respect but in other clauses, would require significant alterations. SoI do not think that this is a contingency which we need to consider. But even if we were to consider it, let us look at the position. Suppose the Prime Minister is right in forecasting that at some date he will make further States, perhaps of the Northern Territory and perhaps even of the Australian Capital Territory so that they would cease to be Territories and become States. If this were so and there were no Territories my amendment would still stand. The wording would be 'should be submitted in each State and Territory' and if there were no Territories there would be no Territory to which to submit a question. But if the Prime Minister wants to put in 'and any Territory' that is fine. If there is no Territory the clause still stands even though its operation becomes nugatory. It may be at some later date .that there shall be no Territories as there are at present. We cannot forsee history. There still might be some part of Australia which could become an Australian Territory. For example, at present the Northern Territory is a Territory but when the Constitution was drafted the Northern Territory was part of the State of South Australia. So, in point of fact, a new Territory was created in the past. It may be that this will not occur again. I cannot foresee it occurring again, but even if the possibility remains at least the drafting that I have suggested would be better than that proposed by the Government. I ask the Government not to press this matter of foolish pride. If we can improve the wording, let us improve it. If the Prime Minister wants to say 'and any Territory' let him say that. That would be no skin off my nose. I should be perfectly happy if he were to take that course and to accept the amendment which would read 'and any Territory'. It is not often it occurs but the honourable gentleman and myself would be ad idem on the matter. Our minds could work together. Surely the Prime Minister is not going to stand fast on a drafting matter when obviously what he is putting forward is less intelligible to the public. official Opposition, as the right honourable It means less. It is perhaps capable of being twisted. As I listened to the honourable gentleman I was wondering what was going through his mind. I know that he talks about creating more States but the policy of his Party, in the background, is to abolish the States. That policy is first to abolish the Senate which is the States Mouse. That is written into their platform and constitution. The Australian Labor Party wants to abolish the Senate-the House of the States. It wants to centralise all power in Canberra. That is not only contained in the Party's constitution; it is shown in practice. It is what the Government has been doing in the past few months. If it wants to abolish the States perhaps it will stick to its drafting. If that is so it will take the States out of the Constitution everywhere it can. It will omit the words 'in each State'. This may be just a little straw in the wind-it may not mean very much-bu t if the Government has nothing to lose by making itself plain and by retaining the words 'in each State' and putting after them, if it likes, 'and any Territory' that would surely satisfy the quite chimerical fears expressed by the Prime Minister in this House a few moments ago. Surely there should be some reason in this. Surely the Government is not so proud that it will not look at an amendment on its merits. My Party know that you are Leader of the House but will you let somebody else talk for a moment? amendment in your life. you call the Leader of the House to order? you. an opportunity to consider the matter. It occurred to me only a few moments ago when I was reading the Bill and looking at the draft. Of course I should have thought of the amendment before, but nobody else thought of it before. PerhapsI am a little slow witted but I am not as slow witted as the Government is. I agree that my Party has not had an opportunity to consider it and therefore as an member for Lowe so rightly said, it would not have a chance of really supporting the amendment, as a Party. The Government which has been looking at this matter for a long time has all these constitutional aspects in mind. Surely it can make up its mind on this. If it makes up its mind against it I am afraid that honourable members will have to read the most sinister implications into its decision. If the",77,Constitution Alteration Mode

By the time it comes to the Senate my Party will have had the opportunity to look at it. By that time. I believe that some of the doubts that remain in the mind of the right honourable member for Lowe will have been dispelled. Perhaps it will be possible to explain the matter at greater length. I am quite happy to accept the words 'and any Territory'. I am as flexible as can be in these thingsI am always big hearted-bu t if the Government does not want it done in this House now perhaps the Senate might have another look at it. Motion (by Mr Daly) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendment negatived. Opposition is also prepared to accept the proposal contained in clause 2(b) of this Bill which makes provision for omitting the words: But until the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives becomes uniform throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half the electors voting for and against the proposed law shall be counted in any State in which adult suffrage prevails. It will be remembered by honourable members that on at least 2 occasions in discussions of other Bills relating to referenda we have drawn attention to the fact that there are sentences in various sections of the Australian Constitution which provide that, until the Parliament or some other institution otherwise provides, there is a constitution requirement as to the law that shall prevail. I am glad that somewhat tardily the Government has accepted the recommendation of the Opposition. I believe it is a sensible proposal to delete this clause and consequently we have no objection to the deletion. I move now to what is now the critical sub-clause so far as the Opposition is concerned. That is clause 2 sub-clause (c) of the Bill which proposes to omit the words 'in a majority of the States' and to substitute the words 'in not less than one-half of the States'. This is an amendment that we reject. The Opposition will vote against it and will take it to a division. I admit that there is little doubt that the Australian Constitution has been found difficult to amend in practice and that since 1901 there have been something of the order of 26 proposals to amend the Conis a compact, such as in the Australian Constitution but only five of them have been stitution, between the States, the Commonapproved by the people of this country. I have wealth and the people, the people should be also pointed out that that is as it should be because the people of this country in whom sovereign power resides-a t least the qualified electors of this country in whom sovereignty resides-shoul d be the people who determine what changes should be made to the Australian Constitution, not only as a matter of logic but also to comply with the provisions of section 128 of the Constitution. Wh' would happen if the proposed amendment were made? It would mean in effect that there would be an amendment to that section of the Constitution which requires that before a referendum can be successful it must be approved by a majority of all the electors and by a majority of electors in 4 States out of 6 States. To put it in inure simple language, there would be a different requirement in place of the provisioi *b.% presently exists in the Constitution. T ne. l result of that would be that instead VJI a majority of electors in 4 of the 6 States, and also a majority of all electors being required to vote for the proposal, the Government would need only a majority of electors in 3 of the 6 States and a majority of all electo before action could be taken by the Governor General. We have pointed out also that the reason this section was initially incorporated in the Constitution was, firstly, to sustain the Federal Constitution, and secondly, to ensure mature consideration of the proposal and settlement relating to organic changes of the Constitution. In other words, to put it shortly, the section was designed to sustain the Constitution and to give the people adequate time in which their mature consideration could be exercised so that they would be the ones who would have sovereignty and the right to determine the changes that were to be made. I have pointed out also that change is the law of life and of society. It is a law of persistent change in the environment and persistent social change as well. The Opposition does not object, and would never object, to cases where it is essential or desirable that changes should be made to the Constitution in order to meet changing circumstances and where the people themselves can be convinced or come to the conclusion beyond doubt that change is desirable. The Opposition believes also that when there",78,Constitution Alteration Mode
160,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) (5.51),"Th egiven ample opportunity to make up their minds, and they should be thoroughly briefed not only as to the meaning of the changes, but also as to the consequences that might flow from those changes. Because we do not believe these conditions have been met we have come strongly to the conclusion that we will move for the deletion of clause 2 (c). I move: Omit paragraph (c). I think the Opposition has an overwhelmingly good case. The greatest students and the most competent people who have thought about the Constitution-and I include both Quick and Garran-hav e come to exactly the same conclusion as we, in the Opposition, have come to. In other words, if honourable members read Quick and Garran and understand the constitutional principles and the realities of a federal and democratic system that guided the fathers of the Constitution, they must come to the conclusion that before a referendum is put to the Australian people they must be informed of exactly what is involved in the proposed change. Do the people of Australia want to sustain federalism? I believe that certain other matters ought not the representatives from the 2 Territories to be drawn immediately to the attention of -ha d proposed that the people in the 2 honourable members. The Prime Minister on at least 2 occasions them at the Constitutional Convention has stated that amendments to the Constitudemurred at the proposition that a referendum tion are not necessary and that if the Governto give the people in the Territories a vote in ment wants to carry out its objectives it cansubsequent referendums should be held at the not treat the Constitution as an alibi.

It people in the Northern Territory, and parwas at least considered by the McMahon ticularly the representatives of the Labor Party Government. in the Northern Territory, believe/ that this matter should be discussed by the Constitutional Convention.

It should at rejected by our 2 predecessors, and it has least be able to submit a report and recombeen adopted by my Government The right opportunity for more mature consideration said in rather a high flown passage that high and more mature thought before any further opinions of best constitutional view is that the action is taken.

I stated the condecided to move the amendment, which I have ditions under which changes should take already circulated, and we will divide on this place. For those reasons I said that we want amendment. (6.0)-The Government does not believe that there is a case for deleting or deferring this provision. The Constitution at the moment states that referendums to amend it must be approved by a majority of all the electors voting, and also by a majority of the electors voting in a majority of the States. The Bill proposes to put to the people the proposition that amendments to the Constitution will be carried if they are approved by a majority of all the electors voting, and also by a majority of the electors voting in not less than one-half of the States. The Government believes that there is no case for deferring this proposition. It is economical and sensible to hold referendums at the same time as elections for either or both Houses of the Parliament. An election for at least one-half of the Senate must be held before the end of next June. It would, accordingly, be sensible and economic to have a referendum on this proposal, as well as referendums on other proposals, at the time of that Senate election. This proposal is before the Constitutional Convention. I do not understand that anybody at the Constitutional Convention-certainl y Territories should be denied a vote in referendums any longer than was necessary.

163,Mr Mcmahoni Did Not Put It That Way.,"accept what you say, but I do not accept the reasoning behind it. eminent associates of the right honourable member for Lowe and, in the constitutional context, I am proud to say, associates of mine. In 1958 and 1959 his fellow Ministers and my colleagues on the Constitutional Review Committee recommended this change. His associates and my colleagues to whom I refer were the Honourable Sir Neil O'SuUivan, once Attorney General; the Honourable Sir Alexander Downer a former Minister and later Australian High Commissioner in Britain, and the son of one of the founding fathers of the Constitution; and the Honourable Mr Justice Joske. The2 members of the Country Party on that Committee supported the proposal. They were the Honourable David Drummond, a former member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales as well, of course, as a former member of this House, and Mr Len Hamilton. My colleagues in the Labor Party, all supported this proposal. It is a proposal which commended itself to the whole spectrum of political opinion in both Federal Houses of Parliament in 1958 and 1959. one Liberal member dissented. It was Senator the Honourable R. G. Wright. But the other 3 Liberals, fhe 2 Country Party men and the 6 Labor Party men aU supported it. In its 1958 report the Committee pointed out: It is, in the Committee's opinion, more in accord with democratic principle and the developments since Federation that it should be sufficient to obtain separate majorities in at least one-half of the number of States. It repeated that view in its 1959 report-it s should be taken of asking the people to definal report. Instead of requiring a majority of States, which at present means 4 out of 6 States and thus a two-thirds majority of the States, was recommended by so representative a body what the Government is proposing is that a of Federal parliamentarians from both sides of majority of voters in not less than half the both Houses 15 years ago. It is hightimethat States will be necessary for the carriage of an the electors were given the opportunity to examendment to the Constitution, as well, of press their view on a matter which has been course, as an overall majority of voters in the supported for so many years. whole of the continent. The present provision meansI quote the report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review: . . . vote there must be a favourable vote in two States. . . . A constitutional change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States. Clearly the proposed change will facilitate alterations to the Constitution. The2 referendums which would have been carried if the Constitution had read as this BiU now proposes were the referendums in 1946 on tbe organised marketing of primary products and on the terms and conditions of industrial employment. The right honourable member for Lowe has been a Minister in charge of both those subject matters. His first portfolio was that of Primary Industry. He was later Minister for Labour and National Service. There is no question that the right honourable member would have found it easier to legislate and to administer for the peace, order and good government of this country if he had the 2 subject matters which a majority of the electors in the States and a majority of the electors in 3 of the States wished to put in the Constitution in 1946. Those words did not go into the Constitution, not because there was not a majority of electors in the States in favour of them being inserted in the Constitution but because there was not a majority of electors in a majority of the States. There was a majority in 3 States but not in the necessary 4 States. This is a proposal that would have made it very much easier for our predecessors to govern in two crucial areas. I would not believe that the right honourable gentleman would demur to the proposition that he would have been even more successful as Minister for Primary Industry and as Minister for Labour and National Service if the Constitution had been altered as a majority of the electors in the States and a majority of the electors in not less than half of the States voted for in 1946.

Both of these things were untrue. I was in contact with the Deputy Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles), shortly before the debate, and he assured me that there had been no set arrangement. Subsequently I was in touch with the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Street), and he told me that there was no such arrangement. I think it is possible that the Minister is under some misunderstanding and, if so, he could put the matter right by giving an explanation and apology to the Committee.

186,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) (8.9),"Shortlya majority of the States' and to prevent the substitution of the words 'in not less than one-half of the States'. I pointed out how the proposed new paragraph (c) would completely change the tenor of section 128 of the Constitution, in the sense that it would be taking away some powers of the States relative to the Commonwealth and that adequate time was not being permitted in this Parliament to debate the measures proposed. I now come to the long title of the Bill which is in these words: A Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to vote at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution. Mr Chairman, may I ask for a little quietness? It seems as though my friends on the other side of the chamber are in somewhat the same position as they were last Wednesday night. ask honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House to be silent so that the right honourable member who is addressing the chamber may be heard -the long title is false, is capable of misundertitle of the Bill. It says: A Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow Electors in Territories, as well as Electors in the States, to vote at Referendums approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution.' on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution. As you will know, Sir, and as I believe all honourable members will know, the long title is critically important in referendum proposals because it is the long title that people will see on their ballot paper. Consequently, it should honestly and accurately reflect the substance of the Bill. Therefore I believe that we must consider the long title and ask ourselves whether the words 'to facilitate alterations to the Constitution' are a correct or false description of 2 relevant parts of the Bill. I repeat that they are important so far as the actual voter is concerned. These are the reasons for believing that the words false description apply not only to the rejection of clause 2 (c) but relate also to the long title of the Bill. If these 2 changes"" are not made-on e has already been rejected-the n clause 2 (c) will obviously be an attempt to whittle away the federal system and the powers of the State governments. It will take away powers that are now vested in the sovereign States and will attempt to vest them in the Commonwealth. Every honourable member who has a conscience will have to admit that proper consideration has not been given to the meaning of the words and to the consequences of the proposed changes. I am prepared to say that there would not be half a dozen honourable members who would have a clue as to the meaning. The Government is doing this to prevent proper public discussion in what is, after all, the senior and most representative Parliament in the Commonwealth. If we look at the long title of the Bill we will see that it docs not truly reflect the meaning of the Bill. In other words, it is a false presentation, and that presentation should be altered not only in the interests of accuracy and justice but also to permit the Australian people to know exactly what is contemplated. The Opposition wants to omit the words 'To facilitate alterations to the Constitution' and to substitute the words 'To reduce the number of States required to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution'. Yet nowhere in the long title is there a reference to that fact. Consequently, every honourable member with a conscience should be prepared to admit that standing and is, therefore, deceptive. For those reasons I formally move: Omit the words 'To facilitate alterations to the Constitution', substitute the following words: 'To reduce the Number of States required to The title will then go on to say: 'and to allow Electors in the States, to vote at Referendums on Proposed Laws to alter the Constitution'. (8.15)-The title of the Bill is 'A Bill for an Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution' etc. The right honourable member for Lowe 'A Bill for an Act to reduce the number of States required to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution' etc. The long title to a Constitution alteration Bill is significant in that it appears twice on the ballot paper at a referendum. The consequence of adopting the amendment which the right honourable gentleman has moved clearly would be to complicate the ballot paper. electors. asked for silence when the right honourable member for Lowe was speaking.

194,Mr Whitlami Appreciate Your Protec,"right honourable member for Lowe with rapt attention. I confess that I came down in a later shower than he did. Nevertheless I do not think he would really expect many honourable members to be so naive, innocent and guileless as to believe that this third or fourth attempt to alter the long title of the current Constitution alteration Bill would have any significance other than to complicate the ballot paper, and any purpose other than to confuse the electors. The right honourable gentleman, said that the present title is deceptive and that it offends the conscience. I think he used the word 'conscience'. I suppose to use a more earthy term he would say it was slanted. The words he used were themselves somewhat slanted because they seek 'to reduce the number of States required to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution'. He does not point out that the number of States required to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution at present is four, that is, 4 States out of sixa two-thirds majority2 States voting in favour for every one voting against a referendum. If the right honourable gentleman wants a truly accurate, factual, dispassionate description why does he not use some words such as 'a Bill for an Act to require not less than one-half of the States to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution'? Those words would be completely accurate, completely factual and completely dispassionate. People who do not realise the present impediment to an alteration of the Constitution might regard it as a very considerable impediment. Nevertheless it states the facts accurately as presented by this Bill. I suppose that one could say 'to require not less than one-half of the States instead of the present two-thirds of the States to approve proposed laws to alter the Constitution'. That would be another accurate, factual and dispassionate statement. In any case the right honourable member's objective would be achieved, I suppose, of complicating the ballot paper but I do not think he would be confusing the electors so much. The term in the Bill is 'to facilitate alterations to the ConEdwards, H . R. stitution'. It is a simple, concise, accurate statement of the purpose of the Bill. I remind honourable gentlemen that the purpose of the Bill in this respect is to carry out recommendations made 15 years ago by three out of the four Liberal members, both Country Party members and all the Australian Labor Party members of the Constitutional Review Committee. This is a long-standing proposal. It is one which was examined at length at the highest level. Frankly, I agree with the view on this matter of Sir Alexander Downer, the son of one of the founding fathers of the Constitution, Mr Justice Joske and the late Sir Neil O'Sullivan, a former Attorney-General of Australia. I was of the same view then. I have been of that view in all the intervening years. I believe that the Australian people are now entitled to express their view on this long-standing, well-founded, factual proposal. Motion (by Mr Daly) put: That the question be now put.

Incidentally, I make the point in the context of speaking to these Johnson, Keith estimates that the amount of reduction in Jones, Charles defence expenditure was considerably greater than was admitted by the Government because Kerin, J. C. the Government failed to take account of the Luchetti, A. S. amount by which it reduced defence expendiMathews, C. R.

He defended himself not only in the House during the discussion of the Hansen, B. P. matter of public importance but he also went Nicholls, M . H . to great lengths to defend himself in a long speech at the Returned Services League Congress in Perth. He stated that he had not become the Minister for Defence for the purpose of dismantling this country's defences. The Committee will recognise the Churchillian overtones in that phrase.

Anyone who did not accept his assessment of what the defence forces required was living, in the past, according to the Minister, as he upbraided the members of the RSL Congress and anybody else who would criticise him. He even said: I do not support a mindless process of determining defence policy by a reference to defence spending as a proportion of the gross national product. Really, for a person, who had run around the country for some years before the last election in order to reassure Australians about the Australian Labor Party's defence policy, to make such a statement before a body like the RSL CongressI believe needs no further comment from me. If any confirmation of the criticism we and others have made is required it is contained in the statement that the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) on behalf of the Minister for Defence sneaked into the House yesterday. The Opposition had alleged that all sorts of decisions had been taken which were detrimental to our defence capability and which the Minister had not announced in his statement in August. We alleged that these decisions had played a large part in the decline of the morale of the defence forces; and we were right. The decisions have been dragged out of the Minister and are there for everyone to see. The decisions that the Minister did not announce go to the very heart of a serviceman's basic motivation for service-hi s pride, his training and his search for excellence. I turn now-unfortunatel y I have very little time-to the strategic assessment which the Minister uses so frequently to confound his critics. When I spoke on the discussion of a matter of public importance I was sceptical of the assessment. How dare I , said the Minister. How dare the RSL. How dare all the others who have been sceptical. I spoke, as I said then, from experience of the interpretation that can be put on these assessments and of how the Government's interpretations defied the tenets of history, experience and common sense. The Minister was indignant. But I quote from Mr Clem Lloyd, the Minister's ex-Press secretary, on this question. He said: It is clear from Government statements that its new concern with continental defence and its confidence in a low threat environment is based substantially on the latest strategic estimates which came this year from Defence Department planners. There is reason for some concern at the unduly heavy weight the Government is putting on the latest estimates. There Temains a danger with this sort of document that the strategic conclusions of the Government's advisers are implied in a framework which is tailored essentially to existing Government policy and what the Government wants to hear. Something analogous occurs in otheT departmental documents such as Treasury, White Papers; you have to read between the lines. Reiteration of base assertions such as 'Our advisers tell us there is no threat for 15 years' are too simplistic; they don't do justice to the quality of the work contained in these documents where the inflections aTe expressed with much greater subtlety. My fears and suspicions are confirmed by the Minister's refusal, despite my request in writing, to permit me as Opposition spokesman on defence, to see the strategic assessment on a confidential basis. The fact is that the Government is not fair dinkum on defence. All this talk of the absence of threat is a smokescreen for a decision to save money from the defence vote for other purposes. In this respect the Coombs report is a revealing document. I do not have time to go into it now, but it clearly shows that this was the Government's motive. The Government should be honest enough to come out and say so; to tell the people that it has chosen butter rather than guns and not pretend by hiding behind its interpretation of the strategic assessment that adequate defence is being provided when it is not. I do not rest my case on the Coombs report alone. It rests equally on the fact that the. Government does not match its words with actions. The decisions it makes do not match the scenario it paints. Let us assume that its assessment of the strategic situation is correct and that there are no threats or situations on the horizon which will require the use of Australian forces in the next 10 to 15 years, that this prediction becomes more uncertain as we get further away from the present and that if the situation changes it will change slowly with plenty of time to adjust to the new circumstances. This, as I understand it, is the Government's position. For reasons which we have outlined we would bitterly contest the Government's position, but let us assume that it is correct. Let us assume too what is in fact the case, that the Government wishes to put a ceiling on defence expenditure, and indeed to slash it, in the interests of other expenditure programs. In those circumstances surely the logical course to take is to concentrate expenditure on the long lead items-item s that cannot be obtained in a hurry and which may be needed as the future grows more uncertain-and at the same time to economise on the items with a short lead time, in particular, non-specialised manpower. This was the solution advocated But in fact the Government is doing the very opposite. It has hardly touched manpower and where it has, it has been manpower of a specialised variety. On the other hand, it has bitten deeply into the long lead equipment items-for example, DDLs and replacement for the Neptunes-so that the proportion of the defence vote spent on capital equipment has fallen to its lowest level ever. This is why we say that the Government is not fair dinkum, that it is motivated by ideological bias and not the proper defence of this nation. debate the fact that the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) quoted from inaccurate newspaper articles but I should like to make 3 points on some matters he has mentioned. Firstly, the new defence cuts, so termed by the newspapers and others, are not new at all. I was well aware of them. They have been filtering through for some time. Secondly, expenditure was greater in the second half of 1972-73. Although the abolition of conscription did save funds at the time, the increased money spent on pay and conditions more than took this up. The third thing is that the 15-year strategic basis, the no-threat period, has been widely misinterpreted. All we are saying is that in this period increased emphasis on pay and conditions is logical, plus the fact of a need for reassessment of the weapons area. There are many important points one could develop in detail when reviewing the progress the Government has made in developing a coherent defence policy in little less than a year. Given .the regrettably short time for the estimates debate, it is impossible to do justice to more than a fraction of the Government's moves in this area. The need for, and the potential to develop, a logical defence policy has in the past been clouded by the unfortunate rhetoric of the scare campaigns run by the Opposition when it was in government. This threat-mongering, linked with the occasional purchase of a few items of flashy hardware, was allowed to pass as an excuse for defence planning. In contrast, in the time since the Government came to power we have witnessed the beginning of a period of basic investigation and planning of defence needs and capabilities which is without precedent in the peacetime history of this nation. I hope that we have seen the last of red threats and snap purchases of F ill s, as a means to delude the public into thinking that an Australian Government was really concerned about the security of the nation. The cynicism with which these ploys were used in the past for crude electoral advantage is quite staggering, especially when it culminated in the tragic death of so many young Australians in Vietnam. In my opinion, one of the main things for which the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) is to be congratulated are the steps he has taken to restore sanity to the discussion of defence matters in Australia and thus create a situation where fear and deception can never again be used to mislead the Australian people for the narrow interests of a conservative government. I think the honourable member referred to the need to have strategic base locations published. That would be absolute nonsense and would be irresponsible. Such a document should not be made public. This Government is 100 per cent ahead of the previous Government in making available defence information to the Opposition. This is, of course, an unspectacular thing and therefore an occurrence which is not recognised until it has been accomplished and has become part of history. Nevertheless, what the Minister for Defence has been able to achieve even in the last 10 months may be looked upon in future as a watershed, not just for defence policy and planning, but for Australian history in general. For the first time in many years we have a Government which recognises that the totality of this nation's security lies in the complete integration of its foreign policy, defence planning, international trade; indeed all aspects of our relations with the outside world. It is in this totality of how we see the outside world and how the outside world sees us, that the true security of Australia must be planned. I hope we will never again see a spectacle such as that where some Minister's grave warning of the threat of Russian naval vessels in the Indian ocean whilst other Ministers of that very same government are engaged in trying to increase the volume of our trade with the same country. The same goes for China. The overseas visits made by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) have shown that we can open",87,Defence Services

This has done much to destroy the old hysterias and set the background in which a more sane and rational analysis of Australia's defence problems and requirements can take place. The calm and rational defence analyses instigated by the Minister for Defence and his explanation of these to the Australian public has done much to consolidate the awareness of these developments amongst the Australian people, although its long term importance has been overlooked. Of course, there are elements in the Australian community which react with uncertainty andfear to new ideas they do not understand. The old shibboleths die hard and some people will never see the way in which the new realities have left their preconceived ideas, formed a quarter of a century ago, far behind.

In future, only such carefully reasoned arguments will be acceptable to the Australian people who have, under this real defence priorities for national security, Government, witnessed for the first time what the Government has ordered other studies to defence policy debate is really supposed to be find the most efficient locations around Auslike. It is simply because defence policy must not only the assessment of purely military now be, and be seen to be, based on logical requirements but will also evaluate the need arguments developed from accurate informaof units of the Services for industrial and tion that the Government is pushing ahead with more basic studies of defence requirements than has ever been the case in the past. To give them their due, the importance of logical and accurate information was something which the Opposition was slowly coming to realise in the last few years of the previous Government. The Central Studies Establishment of Supply is only one example of the machinery which was starting to provide much of the hard information needed for sound decision making in defence. However, the process had not gone much further than analysing and comparing different types of equipment. For these types of studies to be truly effective a coherent overall defence policy framework is needed, if only to determine what type of equipment is relevant. To provide this necessary framework the Government commissioned a new paper on and has since initiated further work to refine thinking about the areas shown by this document to be crucial in the development of the nation's defences in the future. For the first As a further part of this effort to define the tralia for the various defence facilities required by the armed forces. This work will involve technological support, ways to facilitate the closer joint operation of the Services, and the best possible access to amenities for servicemen and their families. Similarly, the Government has commissioned a study of the Citizen Military Forces as a basis for the development of policies which will allow this essential element of our armed forces again to play the significant role in national defence 'policy which it once did. Of course, these studies will take time to complete. Much detailed work has yet to be done to complete them and further time will be needed to assess the implications of their findings and combine them all into a coherent reality strengthening the development of the nation's security. This painstaking process is the inevitable consequence of the general paucity of the defence debates sponsored by past governments in this country. What is now significant is that for the first time an Australian Government is prepared to ask for, and listen to, cold, rational analysis of the defence needs of the nation. It is also signifithreatens or'a problem arises, the Government cant that for the first time a Government is prepared to reveal these arguments to the public. What a stark contrast this is with the previous situation, where a degree of secrecy which was completely unnecessary totally shrouded defence debates in this country in a cloak of ignorance. I hope this situation has gone forever. Certainly one thing which will make a return to past habits difficult, even under the most reactionary of administrations, is the Government's decision announced in March this year, to endow 2 fellowships in the Stratement, troops and trained manpower can be gic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University. The stimulation of public debate on defence policy in ways such as this will make it very hard for any future government to masquerade the emotionalism of fearmongering as sane defence analysis. Significantly, honourable members opposite should benefit from the Government's determination to pursue rational, logical analysis in defence policy-making. Unlike them when they were in power, this Government has no fears of giving the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) or his relevant spokesman access to defence planning documents if they have the wit to request them. One can understand the way these men used secrecy The honourable gentleman's time has expired. honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Kerin) says, if ever we get involved in a war we will certainly have lots of paper studies to throw at the enemy. But what we really want is an effectivefightingforce, which is what this Government is busily destroying. The Government obviously is frightened of a debate on this subject of defence. When we raised a matter of urgency some weeks ago, the statement by the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) was item No. 34 on the notice paper, and since then it has sunk to No. 45. It is quite clear that the Government does not wish to have that statement debated. All that the Government will allow us is a very brief timeI think that the debate will soon be gagged-to discuss the defence estimates. This Government has achieved a remarkable anatomical feat of making itself a cross between a hen and an ostrich. Whenever danger runs around like a headless hen, although at the same time it wants to bury its head in the sand like an ostrich. A few weeks ago in Perth the Minister for Defence quoted partially and misleadingly from a paper on the strategic basis. We must consider the strategic needs of this country. It is always the tactic of Treasuries and people opposed to effective defence preparations to ask: 'What is the threat? Where does it come from? Itemise the threat. Then we can provide the defence.' The trouble is that with the lead time of effective defence forces, threats arise much faster than the equipprovided. The Minister for Defence claims that he is able to look ahead 10 or 15 years. Let us look at what happened in 1931. Who then could possibly have foreseen that within 10 years Australia would have been at war with Germany, Italy and Japan? Certainly not the Australian Labor Party. As late as 1938 it was saying that references to preparation for war were hysterical propaganda. Now the Government is talking about the defence of the mainland. What a defeatist policy. If we have an effective defence policy the question of the defence of the Australian mainland will not arise. Surely the establishment of an effective defence policy should be the object of the Government. The Government talks about a period of strategic peace. I find it difficult to",89,Defence Services

America is reliant on the Middle East for about 8 per cent of its oil. Japan and Western Europe are almost totally dependent on the Middle East for their oil. Australia produces about 60 per cent of our oil requirements, and for most of our other oil requirements we rely also on the Middle East.

What is likely to happen is that the OPEC countriesthe Arab countries-wil l realise that there is a terminal date in relation to their effective ability to exploit the situation, and therefore the next 10 years are likely to be extremely turbulent. If we had any sense we would be not only ently he expects that it will significantly impair making extra defence preparations, but also the capability of the Navy.

It is a great tribute to their devotion to course, said: The Services may have to accept weapons systems efforts of this Government. they regard as less than satisfactory. By Budget time in August, virtually all orders for new equipment were cancelled, and now we find from the admissions that have been very grudgingly dragged out of the Minister that not only has he cancelled all the long term orders for equipment, but also he is trying to delay purchasing equipment for which we are already committed. He is talking about trying to cut down on the purchase of light observation helicopters for the Army and on the orders for anti-submarine helicopters for the Navy. If the Government can cut down on our defence equipment it will do so. It will defer everything and cancel everything. This is equipment which our defence forces will need not immediately but which will make them effective forces in the 1980s. I repeat that that is a period into which neither this Minister nor any Minister can possibly foresee. Then there is the question of our operational readiness and the efficiency of our forces on which our training depends. We have seen a cutback in the fuel allowance for the Navy and in the flying hours of aircraft. In regard to the Navy, the Minister for Defence in his recent statement said that the equipment in the Navy would not be below a level which seriouslyI repeat, seriouslyimpaired the capability of the Navy.

Let me refer to some of the achievements of this Government in a short space of less than 12 months. I certainly would not need to reiterate all the attitudes that have been adopted and the actions that have been taken by this Government in relation to improved conditions for servicemen. But what we set out to do this year has largely been achieved. We set out to provide better conditions for those who are serving in the armed forces of this country on a volunteer basis. I do not have to recapitulate the improvements tonight. Every honourable member knows what has been done in terms of pay and allowances and in terms of the defence forces retirement beneinferences in the document and indeed recomfits scheme, which is now probably the best scheme of its kind that could be found anywhere in the world. Let me remind those honourable members who now sit on the Opposition side how they procrastinated over this issue in the dying stages of the Parliament in 1972 when they could not make a decision. What did the honourable member for Barker do at that time? As usual, he ran for cover. At that time no new defence forces retirement benefits scheme was adopted. Within3 weeks of attaining office I was able to reach a decision which was satisfactory in terms of the Jess Committee report and it has the complete support of the armed services in this country. Honourable members opposite had been in power for 23 years. Let me come back to a point which I think representative not only of the Service departis most relevant to this debate.

Yet we hear about the attitude former Prime Minister had been briefed. This that is now adopted by this Opposition which informations was made available to the Leader had 23 years in which to provide adequate of the Opposition and the honourable member housing for servicemen. About 6,000 homes are required for servicemen who are waiting for accommodation, who urgently need it and who are entitled to it. This again is a legacy from the previous Government. The honourable member for Barker referred to the strategic bases document. He had the temerity to say that he was not able to see the document. As a former member of a Ministry-no t of a Cabinet; I do not think he ever reached that rank in the previous Government-the honourable member knows that in that document there would be statements based on security and therefore they could not be released. No one knows that better than the honourable member for Barker. But there are mendations that can be made public. No one would suggest that those who were responsible for drawing up the strategic bases document would propose that their findings and recommendations should not be made public. I sought to make them public. Indeed, that is what I did, not only through this Parliament but also by using a forum outside the Parliament. In doing so, I made it quite clear that this was not an assessment by the Government. The Government agreed with it. I agreed with it. As the honourable member for Barker knows, this assessment was arrived at by the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Chiefs of Staff of the 3 Services and representatives of the Joint Intelligence Organisation. There was a committee that was The honourable member for Barker knows for Barker. They were invited to be briefed and they accepted my invitation. The honourable member for Barker, the defence spokesman for the Opposition, was told that he would be able to have information from the Department of Defence at any time he requested it. He has been briefed by departmental officers. I invite honourable members to contrast my attitude and my actions in relation to informing members of the Opposition on these matters with the attitude of members of the Opposition who, when in government, denied to me and to the then Leader of the Opposition any information relating to security and defence matters. tunity to speak in a few moments. wish to speak. Dr ForbesA number of other members want to speak. You know that. The Government is going to gag the debate. by the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Isaacs, on the Opposition side. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Isaacs is not ill-informed on some of these matters. I respect his judgment in many areas. When I was in Opposition, I found myself in agreement with the honourable member for Isaacs on a number of occasions. I cannot say the same with respect to the honourable member for Barker. Let me say to the Committee, in dealing with the strategic situation in this country, that the strategic bases document has been arrived at as a result of the considered judgment of those whose advice we are expected to take. I believe that their assessment has been proved to be correct. Indeed, as they have pointed out, we can look forward to a period of from 10 years to 15 years in which we can build up our resources in this country. This brings me finally to the question of procurement. I have indicated already to the Committee that in our first year we have been concerned to improve the conditions of Service personnel in this country. That has been done. I have announced to the Parliament and to the public generally that, in contrast to the attitude of the former Government, the strength of the Australian Army will rise to 34,000 by 1976. I invite honourable members to compare that figure with the level of'22,000 personnel which was the peak of the former Government's volunteer force in 1964. Our Army force of 34,000 will be based on a divisional structure with 6 battalions. We will achieve that divisional structure of 34,000 by 1976. I turn to the other point of contradiction. Again this refers to a matter raised by the honourable member for Barker. WhatI wish to say relates to some of the points that I have put to the Returned Services League recently. WhatI said was that defence expenditure this year will exceed the expenditure by the previous Government in 1972-73. In money terms, we will be spending more. In terms of a proportion of the gross national product, the expenditure is slightly less. It is 2.9 per cent of GNP. But again I invite honourable members to contrast this expenditure with the 2.7 per cent of GNP that was spent by the former Government in 1964. It was not until the Vietnam involvement and the need for conscription, in the opinion of the former Government, that a need arose to increase the percentage of the gross national product devoted to defence. Nothing was said by the honourable member for Barker that is deserving of reply. Let me conclude, then, by pointing out that we will now be looking to the question of procurement. As I indicated to the honourable member for Isaacs, we will be dealing with the question of the destroyer replacement. Other items of equipment, such as tanks, are involved. Our present tanks are more than 22 years old. Who is responsible for that situation-thi s Government or the former Government which now sits in Opposition? No decision was made on tanks by the former Government. I hope to be able to make a decision on this matter in the near future. Decisions will be made on essential items of procurement. But we will not be stampeded into purchasing equipment merely for the sake of spending the defence appropriations. We will ensure that, whatever equipment is purchased for our defence forces, that equipment will be purchased on the basis of the advice of those who are charged with the responsibility of conducting a complete and thorough investigation into our requirements.",93,Defence Services

Chairman, I am sorry to say it but I really believe that this man must go. That was a deplorable effort. This man, the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) on behalf of the Labor Government has just provided a closure for us in the middle of a debate on the Defence estimates. This is a most unusual procedure. Normally the practice in an estimates debate is for the Minister, whose departmental estimates are under consideration, to speak at the end of the debate. He has unlimited time. The Minister has accused my colleague, the ment. If one thinks this is unusual it is interesthonourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), a ing to note that Rear Admiral Crabb found former Minister in the preceding Government it necessary, in correspondence to Australian and now the Opposition spokesman on defence daily newspapers, to comment on the fact that matters, of not presenting a positive case. In this man, this Minister for Defence, disclosed 10 minutes? Goodness me! What earthly chance in public statements confidential materialwould anyone have of analysing effectively and material which he now holds to be confidential. totally either of the 2 ministerial defence He would not disclose it to the honourable statements that have been delivered, neither member for Barker but he was prepared to of which we have been given an opportunity to disclose in the Parliament and in speeches, debate in this Parliament, and the Defence specific statements from the strategic assessestimates, and then present a positive alternament which this man promulgated to the world tive Opposition defence program? Goodness at large. That, of itself, should because for me, Mr Chairman, what utter nonsense! This man, who tells us that the statement he that we realise that that strategic assessment made yesterday is not really a statement on is made on the basis that we do not know, new policy, opened his statement by saying but we have it on the say-so of the Minister that the purpose of the statement was to for Defence, that there is no forward threat acquaint honourable members with details that for the next 15 years. had not been previously announced. Does he mean that it is his view, or has he announced unlike the Minister for Defence, who has unthem before? He surely should make up his limited time-wan t to refer to an article by mind. The problem, of course, is that the defence mented now on 2 previous occasions in this statement yesterday, coming on the Defence Parliament, in the 'Bulletin' of 10 November estimates which we are now debating, sets in which he refers to the conflict which might the stage for a further run down in Australia's emerge between China and Russia from the defence capacity. The Minister has begun setting the stage by announcing, supposedly in under no forward defence threat in the foreseeable future, and certainly not for 15 years. by my colleague, the honourable member for Barker, for the disclosure of this forward strategic assessment. The Minister for Defence, in a letter to the honourable member on 14 November last, said: After careful consideration of your request that and these are the words of the honourable member for Barkerfor my perusal that is for Dr Forbes' perusalthe strategic assessment which was prepared by the Defence Committee at your request, together with the terms of your request', I have decided that it is not appropriate The point is that the honourable member for Barker did not ask for this information to be made public. He asked only that he might have some opportunity to peruse this assessthis man's resignation.

216,That Is To Dr Forbes,"confrontation of 67 divisions on the ChinaSoviet border. He speaks of the greater necessity today than ever before to maintain our alliance with the United States, and yet the Minister for Defence, this man, suggests that there is no forward defence threat. Professor Burns says that he believes that the world is now in a greater state of instability than it has been over the last decade. We all know the tragedy of the Middle East war, only a fortnight ago. The Minister for Defence said, in a way in which many of us on this side of the House beUeve might well have been worthy of him had he been able to substantiate his undertaking, that Australia would be prepared to send a peace-keeping force to the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. With the steps that this Government has taken to reduce the defensive capacity of our armed forces, I seriously question how soon any armed detachment could be sent from this country, and how able that armed detachment would be to undertake the tasks allotted to it. That is certainly a state, that has resulted from the 11 months of maladministration of the present Minister for Defence. Let us look at the general field of defence procurement. We are told by the Minister for Defence that that is something he will worry about. I want to come back to it because it is one of the things that concern me in the new statement made yesterday about the things that he is now not going to do. In an article that was written some months ago on Australian defence policy under Labor, Dr Robert J. O'Neill, a senior fellow in international relations and head of the Strategic and Defence Study Centre in the Research School of Pacific Studies of the Australian National University, Canberra, said: The state of development of Australian technology does place severe limitations on the extent to which Ocean or anywhere around the great expanse local manufacture can be carried into practice. Ausof Australian coastline. Similarly, in the naval tralia is not likely to design, develop and produce air units, the army air units and the Royal a high performance fighter-interceptor, a fighterbomber, a heavy transport aircraft, a cruiser, a subAustralian Air Force establishments there is marine, a major missile system, many of the essential a serious cut-back in flying hours at a time sophisticated components of early warning systems when it is more and more essential that the , . . and so on . . . Consequently Australia men operating the equipment should be techniis still going to have to purchase many essential items cally able to handle it and should be operafrom abroad and accept the accompanying disadvantages. The point of that is that there is a recognition by those who are proficient in this field that we will have to purchase from abroad a considerable number of those goods and items that we need in a sophistically advanced navy, army and air force. To manufacture them here I am one who hopes that we may be able to do so, in spite of Dr O'NeiU's statement-it will be necessary for a long lead time. Yet the major consequence of this Government's defence statements and this Minister's defence decisions is that we are now in a position where that lead time has been extended beyond the bounds of reasonableness and beyond the bounds where we might well be able to rely on the procurement program at a time when that equipment might have to be used for defensive purposes on behalf of Australia. In other words, the decisions taken by this Government and the decisions that are covered by these Defence estimates seriously prejudice our nation's ability to undertake anything of a defence campaign if such should be necessary within anything less than the 15 years on which the Minister has committed himself. I want to say 2 things. It is extraordinarily difficult in 10 minutes to cover all that one wants to say. The first is that I am horrified to see that there is in the estimates of the Department of the Navy a cut-back on oil fuel requirements of nearly one-third. I know that there has been some change in the character of the oil used by Her Majesty's Australian ships, but we were told yesterday that the steaming time of the Australian naval vessels will be reduced by 20 per cent. We see in the estimates that there is a reduction of nearly $900,000 out of a $2.5m budget in the amount of money provided for furnace fuel oil, other automotive fuels, diesel fuel and so on for the propulsion of naval vessels. In other words, financial decisions are being taken which, supplementing the positive decisions-the negative decisions, I should call them-by the Minister, will very seriously impair the ability of the Australian Navy to undertake any sort of reasonable patrol operation in the Indian tionally proficient. The tragedy of this Minister is that he sees his task, not as the maintenance of an Australian defence component but as the elimination of it. Because he persists in his pomposity, the only solution for the defence of Australia is that this man should resign as a protest at what his Government has done to him, if he seriously believes in the statement he made tonight that he is advancing Australia's defence cause instead of destroying it. Defence) (9.48)-The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Sinclair) read portion of a letter which I wrote to the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes). I want to read that letter to the Committee, because the Deputy Leader of the Country Party read only portion of it to distort the facts. The letter reads: Dear Dr Forbes, After careful consideration of your request that I 'make available to me for my perusal the strategic assessment which was prepared by the Defence Committee at your request, together with the terms of your request', I have decided that it is not appropriate to give you access to the Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy 1973 or the terms of my request to the Defence Committee. You will appreciate that the Strategic Basis is not merely an intelligence assessment but includes frank discussion of Australian interest in relation to other countries and policy advice from officials to the Government. I have often stressed that I regard it as important that Opposition spokesmen have 'access to all relevant intelligence information'. Therefore I invite you to arrange through my office to be briefed on specific intelligence matters or on the intelligence background to the Strategic Assessment in general by the Chairman of the National Intelligence Committee, Mr Mulder. A. W. Gordon Jockel. Of course, it is not surprising that the Deputy Leader of the Country Party refused and intentionally omitted to add the last part of the letter which invites the Opposition spokesman to be briefed by the Director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation on that part of the strategic basis document which is relevant to the assessment arrived at by the Committee and, indeed, relating to the period in which it says there is not likely to be a threat to this country. It is still open to the honourable member for Barker to accept my invitation. Motion (by Mr Hansen) proposed: That the question be now put. confine my attention to a relatively small role, that is, what the Government has done for the Navy. The question is that the question be now put. All those of that opinion say 'aye', to the contrary 'no'. I think the 'ayes' have it. Is a division required?

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Crean) read a third time. Army Bands-Politica l Parties Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. sorry to see that the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) has left the chamber. I had warned him that I would be raising a matter which I had discussed with him. One of the many actions that has been taken by the Minister for Defence in his capacity as Minister for the Army, in order to keep his expenditure within the amount of money he was allotted in the Budget, was the disbanding of four Regulary Army corps bands. One of those scheduled for oblivion is the Signals Corps band at Kapooka where the 1st Recruit Training Battalion is located. The decision has brought immediate, prolonged and adverse reaction in the Riverina. I doubt if I have ever seen during my parliamentary career a decision of this sort that has been so unpopular and to which there has been such sustained opposition. AlreadyI have received 2,500 signatures to a petition asking the Minister for the Army to reconsider the decision. I have passed them on to the Minister. I that another 1,400 signatures have been obtained. They will also be passed to the Minister as soon as I receive them in the post. The House may wonder why this action, which to some honourable members may not seem to be a major matter, has brought forward such a violent reaction from my constituents. I think the answer is twofold. First, as I have said already, Kapooka is the location of the Army's 1st Recruit Training Battalion. Both military and civilian personnel in the area have asked how a new recruit can be trained to march and to drill without a military band. I thank the Minister for returning to the chamber. Certainly the band need not be large. Indeed, the Kapooka band is not large, but to my way of thinking it is an essential adjunct lo a training base. Once a week a passing-out parade is held. This parade is usually attended by many of the parents and friends of those who have completed their training. These people come from all over the continent and their presence is good for the morale of the trainees. The absence of a band would virtually mean the end of these parades. The other important part played by the Regular Army's Signal Corps band is its activities in the nearby city of Wagga Wagga. The band has played an active part in the civic life of the city. It plays there during the beating of the retreat, during marches through the city and during many civic occasions when Wagga is visited by distinguished visitors. RecentlyI witnessed an excellent demonstration of marching, counter-marching and quick and slow-marching during the visit to the city by the State Minister for Youth and Welfare. Last week I went to the Minister for Defence and told him of the high regard in which the band was held, and of the vacuum that would be created if the band was disbanded. He promised to review the decision and I have-no doubt that he intends to carry out this promise. Unfortunately, actions taken previous to this promise have continued to roll on. First, the Minister had tabled for him yesterday a speech which included the words: It has been decided to disband four of the Regular Army's corps bands at Puckapunyal, Kapooka, Singleton and Casula. Second, I understand that notices of posting have been received already by 23 out of 25 members of the band. So it is urgent for the have informed the Minister's staff Minister to act quickly in reviewing this decision. When I saw the Minister last week he said that the abolition of a number of bands had been recommended to him by the Army Board. I pointed out to him that this was not so. What the Army Board had in effect said was that if the defence vote was to be reduced from 3.5 per cent of the gross national product to less than 3 per cent of GNP, one of the many ways in which such a reduction could be achieved was by getting rid of the bands. The Minister pointed out that the disbandment",102,Adjournment
269,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) (10.44),"I amof the 4 bands marked out for the axe would save about $1.5m, but Kapooka, with only about 25 bandsmen, can only be costing between about $200,000 and $300,000 a year. To my way of thinking the Army and the public are getting good value for their money from the band at Kapooka. May I make one final point. The Government has made a point of saying that it believes in decentralisaof the Chiefs of Staff. tion. This is very much decentralisation, yet this band is being abolished and its members are being posted to larger centres. The Government does not intend to abolish the band at the Royal Military College at Duntroon, so why should it abolish the band at Kapooka? After all it would be much easier to form a city band in Canberra than it would be to do so in Wagga Wagga. Finally, in the light of the thousands of signatures requesting a review of this decision, not only from the public but also from the Returned Soldiers League and leading citizens who are, after all, also voters, I ask the Minister to reverse this decision. Minister for the Navy, Minister for the Army, be some resentment when it is disbanded. Minister for Air and Minister for Supply)I But I must reiterate what I said a few minutes did not know that the honourable member ago, that it was the unanimous recommendation intended to raise this matter tonight. Mr FairbairnI sent 2 messages to the deviated from that recommendation in regard Minister, one this morning and one this afterto 2 bands. One was the Army band at noon. the honourable member would do that and I recommendation because of the lack of money. accept his word that he did do so. Unfortunately the information was not passed on to may be partly true. But I am sure that the me. I can understand the honourable member's Defence Committee itself had considered the concern about the decision. He spoke to me increasing cost of maintaining so many bands last week about the decision that had been in the defence forces. As I said, I made a made to disband the' Kapooka band. As I indideparture in regard to 2 bands. One was the cated in the statement tabled in this Parliament Army band at Townsville, and the other was yesterday, even considering the number of the Royal Australian Air Force band at Richbands that it has been decided to disband, mond. I did this for reasons which I think in those that are left will still be costing the regard to the Army band at Townsville, are country $2.5m a year. I am sure that the obvious. That band is the only one in an area honourable member, as a former Minister for in which there is a significant number of Defence, would appreciate that this is a very troops, and Townsville is a great distance from significant and large expenditure.

The Royal Australian Air As I promised the honourable member, I have Force band at Richmond was only the second instituted inquiries to see whether the decision air force band in that State, and for this to disband the Kapooka band should stand or reason I believed that it should be retained. whether some alternative arrangements can be The decision was made as a result of what I made. AgainI must point out to the honourbelieve was a correct assessment of the able member that despite what he said a few situation. moments ago, it is true that one of the recommendations that was made to me, not by the Army Board but at a general meeting of the Chiefs of Staff in which I participated when these questions were under consideration, was that these bands should be disbanded. As far as I am aware this was a unanimous decision of the Defence Committee, that is, The recommendation came to me, and naturally I was concerned because I agree with the honourable member that the bands make a very significant contribution. I am aware of the great prestige which the bands of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force have been able to build up as a result of their public appearances. The bands are sought very widely. Very often I have come under criticism because I have had to refuse a request for the appearance of a band or sometimes because I have acceded to a request for the appearance of a band. I agree with the honourable member that the bands make a significant contribution in this respect. Certainly, when a band has been of the Defence Committee that a certain number of bands should be disbanded. I Townsville.",103,Adjournment

273,Mr Barnard,"No, this is not true. ItI assured the honourable member for Farrer that I would have the question of the disbandment of the Kapooka band looked at. Alternative arrangements were suggested to me. They were that the Royal Military College band could be sent to Kapooka once a month, if necessary, for passing out parades. It could also be made available on other occasions when it was required in the area. It would also be available when required on special occasions in the Wagga area. This decision was made as a result of the first investigation. I regret that I have to inform the honourable member that unless there is a very good reason why one should reverse the decision in relation to the Kapooka band, that decision will have to stand. However, I indicated to the honourable member that I would have the matter further examined, and I will do so. I am sure he will appreciate that over the last 3 or 4 days I have not had an opportunity to follow up this matter and some other matters that may be regarded by honourable members as being urgent. I conclude by saying that I agree with the honourable member that he is entitled to express some concern about this matter. It is not an easy decision to make but I must repeat that it was a recommendation from the Defence Committee, and I am sure that the decision would have been made sooner or later whether or not there had been any reduction in funds. The sum of $2.5m is a significant amount to spend on bands in Australia. However, I appreciate the honourable member's concern because I know that the Kapooka band has a very good reputation and, like all other Service bands, I believe that it would have done much to improve public relations between members of the defence forces and the civilian population generally. I assure the honourable member once again that I will have the matter further examined and I will let him know the result of that examination as soon as possible. few minutes available to me on the adjournment debate I want to speak on matters relating to economics and business. Prior to last Saturday's New South Wales election the Australian Country Party candidate for the seat of South Coast inserted in a local newspaper an advertisement which stated: Render your protest. The Labor Government in Canberra is crippling your district, your job, your future and your business. Significantly, as at 20 November 1973 he had received 1,371 votes out of 20,358 voters enrolled. But he was only repeating the statements of his leaders, and tonight I wish to take the opportunity to rebut some of those statements. I do not wish to raise again in any great detail th: debate on the revaluations and the tariff cuts that the Country Party opposed so much, but I would point out that in opposing tariff cuts the Country Party was cutting directly against the rural sector, as the cost of tariff subsidisation is borne largely by the exporting sector. The benefits of revaluation were stressed in the Treasury publication entitled ""The Australian Economy' of August 1973. It stated: While a strong growth in exports adds to gross domestic product and therefore to the potential for a higher standard of living, this potential will not be realised if the receipts from export sales-whic h involve a transfer of Australian resources to the rest of the world-ar e not used to finance a higher level of imported supplies. In short, production for export is a means to an end rather than an end in itself. Continuing current account surpluses when reserves are already excessive are not only wasteful of resources that could be used to meet internal demands. By adding to domestic liquidity they can, in conjunction with capital inflow, pose considerable problems for ' economic management. That Australia had a high level of international reserves compared with other countries, even in 1970, is clearly illustrated by referring to a table which was prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library Legislative Research Service. It shows Australian international reserves as a proportion of annual imports. The annual average for the 5 years ending June 1969 was 46 per cent. It was 43 per cent for the year ending June 1970, 60 per cent for the year ending June 1971, 99 per cent for the year ending June 1972, and 114 per cent for the year ending June 1973. This sort of excess of reserves and the effect that it had has recently been enlarged on by Dr Porter. Reference to this matter was made in a debate in this House last week. But even in May 1973 Dr Porter estimated that this excessiveness led to a total speculative inflow of $ 1,500m for the period from January 1971 to September 1972. This implies that about 43 per cent of net apparent capital inflow during this period was based on speculation and that the Australian dollar would have to be revalued. I return to the statement by the Country Party candidate in the seat of South Coast at last Saturday's New South Wales election. The fact is that the business and rural sectors are",104,Adjournment

It being 11 o'clockThe following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Turtles (Question No. 1297) Mr Hunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise, upon notice: May Australian bred turtles or Australian turtle meat be exported; if so on what conditions. Excise has provided the following information for answer to the honourable member's question: Export of live turtles is prohibited unless the consent of the Minister for Customs and Excise is first obtained. As is the case with all Australian native fauna, permission is usually only granted for export to approved zoos and scientific institutions. At the present time the export of turtle meat is not subject to the provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations but I understand that State legislation prevents the taking of turtles, except under licence in Queensland and Western Australia and an ordinance provides a similar control in respect of Northern Territorial waters. I gather that no licences have been issued for some time. I should mention that the export of turtle meat is subject to the provisions of the Exports (Fish) Regulations administered by the Department of Primary Industry; this is essentially a quality control. A close watch of developments in this area is being maintained with a view to establishing whether any additional controls under the Customs Act are justified. Australian Council for the Arts (Question No. 1305) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) How many permanent, temporary and exempt public servants were employed to assist the Australian Council for the Arts as at 2 December 1972. (2) What was the comparative figure as at 31 October 1973. honourable member's question is as follows: Staff of the Australian Council for the Arts at 31 October 1973 numbered 47 permanent, 15 temporary, and 11 exempt public servants. I am informed that on 1 December 1972 the comparative figures were 28, 3 and 1 respectively. Airports: Noise Levels (Question No. 978) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: When may I expect an answer to question No. 550 which I asked on 16 May 1973. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The answer to question No. 550 was published in Hansard on 22 October 1973. Melbourne's Second Jetport (Question No. 1198) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) When does the Minister expect the inquiry into the location of Melbourne's second jetport to be completed. (2) What is the nature and extent of the environmental studies being undertaken. (3) Has he made arrangements for the conduct of public hearings in conjunction with the inquiry. (4) If so, what arrangements have been made. (5) At what stage are consultations between the Department of Civil Aviation and the State Planning Authority, and what decisions have been reached. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) After taking into account that locating a second airline airport to serve Melbourne is but part of an inquiry covering expected developments to the south-east of Melbourne, as a whole, it is not possible to give a worthwhile indication as to when the inquiry may be completed. (2) It is understood that environment and conservation have been taken into account throughout the studies of the State Planning Advisory Committee in this area. In addition it is understood that before a final decision is made as to which particular airport site is preferred the State Planning Advisory Council will require an Environmental Impact Statement on each of the alternatives. (3 and 4) In the event of consideration being given the actual establishment of a second airline airport to serve Melbourne, as an Australian Government project, then public hearings primarily dealing with the environmental impact would be arranged in accordance with the recently announced policy of this Government. Any question as to whether the State Planning Advisory Council has in mind to conduct public hearings related to their total plans for that area should be addressed to the Victorian Government. (5) Several sites have been identified to the north and north-east of Westernport Bay suitable for the establishment of a second airline airport as a result of consultations between the State Planning Advisory Committee and the Department of Civil Aviation. Current studies, co-ordinated by the State Planning Advisory Committee, are expected to lead to a firm recommendation for consideration by the State Planning Advisory Council.",106,Adjournment

(2) What are the respective contributions by the pilots and the airlines to the existing superanuation fund and what are the benefits to .the pilots. (3) What are the respective contributions by the airlines and pilots to loss of licence insurance for pilots. (4) What are the details of tbe new superannuation claim by the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and what would such a claim cost the airlines annually. (5) How many AFAP members are involved. (6) If the AFAP claim is granted would an increase in fares be necessary; if so, to what extent. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Guaranteed related to 65 salary B727 Captain First Officer, 8th year of service 13,345 DC9 Captain First Officer, 8th year of service 12,599 F28 Captain First Officer, 8th year of service 12,083 F27 Captain First Officer, 8th year of service (2) Contribution by Pilot-1 0 per cent of guaranteed annual salary until age 55. Contribution by Airlines-1 0 per cent until the completion of 22 years of service; thereafter 7i per cent to age 55. Benefits Up to 10 years own contributions plus interest at 5 per cent. 10 years and up to the completion of 22 years benefits range from one times average salary over the last 5 years up to 4.95 times average salary over the last 5 years. At the end of 22 years' service the benefit is funded and from then on this funded amount accrues compound interest at the rate of 5 per cent; in addition the Pilot's contributions and TAA's contributions after 22 years of service accrue compound interest at 5 per cent per annum and are added to the funded amount. Examples of the lump sum benefits in the present scheme at age 55 B in Captain: Commenced in 1946, retiring in 1976 at age 60-$86,00 0 of which his own contributions amount to $13,000 plus interest. Commenced in 1946, retiring in 1978 at age 60$103,000 of which his own contributions amount to $16,000 plus interest. Commenced in 1946, retiring in 1980 at age 60$124,000 of which his own contributions amount to $20,000 plus interest. Commenced in 1946, retiring in 1982 at age 60$148,000 of which his own contributions amount to $25,000 plus interest. Pilots in TAA and ATI now have a retiring age of 60 and the lump sum mentioned above includes the additional interest on the lump sum between age 55 and 60. Pilots in TAA and Ansett Airlines (excluding the ATI subsidiaries) under the present seniority system could be expected to proceed to 727 captaincy. (3) Airlines contribute $180 per annum towards Loss of Licence Insurance for Pilots. For this amount Pilots can purchase Loss of Licence Insurance for $36,000. Pilots need not contribute anything but under the scheme run by the AFAP they can contribute an additional amount, depending on age, to get an additional benefit. The cost of Loss of Licence Insurance for all TAA and ATI Pilots is $218,700 per annum. (4) New claim by AFAP-pertinen t details: Contriannual butions by Pilot to be reduced from 10 per cent to 7 i salary Average per cent after 10 years, with a further reduction from which is annual 7 i per cent to 5 per cent after 20 years. hours per month Benefits or less At 10 years of service 2.82 times salary increasing % $ to 8.46 times salary at 30 years of service. 21,056 24,835 Death benefit-ne w clause 15,423 19,702 23,182 All Pilots shall be entitled to the sum of £100,000 14,513 in the event of death, whether on duty or not, and 18,765 22,038 such amount to be additional to entitlement under the 13,883 superannuation scheme and Workers' Compensation, 14,892 17,373 where the latter is applicable. Where the interest rate is to apply for resignation or discharge other than 9,954 11,501 benefits mentioned above, the interest rate is to be 7 per cent. Cost to Airlines of claim Estimate that for future serving Pilots the additional cost will be 51,000,000 per annum. In order to meet the cost in relation lo all past service of existing Pilots the cost over a reasonable future period of, say, 10 or 15 years could well exceed $1,000,000 per annum. Therefore it is foreseeable that the claims could cost an additional $2,000,000 per annum. These figures relate only to TAA. The effect on ATI is unknown but the total annual cost would not be less than in TAA's case and probably greater as AT I employ more Pilots. (5) 1,215 Pilots in TAA and ATI . (6) On present salaries it is estimated that present fare levels would need to be increased from l i per cent to 2 per cent. However, this could increase and would depend on the future level of salaries for Pilots. Canberra: Doctors Practising (Question No. 1314) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) How many doctors were practising in Canberra as at 2 December 1972. (2) How many doctors were practising in Canberra as at 2 November 1973. (3) How many doctors left practice in Canberra during this period. able member's question is as follows: The term 'doctors practising in Canberra' has been taken to exclude doctors employed whole-time by hospitals, by the Australian National University and by the Armed Services. It has also been taken to exclude locums and the staff of the Australian Department of Health except those employed as Community Medical Practitioners. It is dimcult to arrive at precise figures for the number of doctors practicising in Canberra at any particular date. The numbers given in (1) and (2) below have been obtained by taking the numbers of doctors on the lists of visiting medical officers at the Canberra and Woden Hospitals current as at June 1972 and June 1973, with modifications based on the definition above and registration records. So far as it is practicable to ascertain, the answers to the particular questions asked by the right honourable member are as follows: (1) 174 (2) 185 (3) 5, one of whom retired and one of whom died. Parliamentary Staff Establishments: Non-Government Parties (Question No. 874) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to Teports that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition requires a female adviser who can type and that the Deputy Leader has stated that the Government has refused to provide the Opposition with adequate staff. (2) What staff were provided to Opposition Party Members under the Government of which the present Deputy Leader was a Minister, and what was the classification in each case. (3) What staff are available to Members of the present Opposition, and what is the classification in each case. (4) What requests by the Opposition for additional staff have been rejected. able Member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Details of staff approved by the former Government for the non-Government parties as at 1 December 1972 are shown in Table1 below. (3) The present Government, following representations from the non-Government parties, approved a major increase and upgrading in the staff available to them. A total number of positions was approved viz. nine clerical, three Press Secretaries and fourteen stenographic positions for the Liberal Party and four clerical, one Press Secretary and six stenographic positions for the Country, Party leaving each Leader to allocate the positions within his party. The Government also approved three stenographic positions for use by the Liberal Party Executive and one for use by the Country Party Executive. It upgraded the top position on the staff of the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party. The end result has been that the staff available to non-government parlies has been increased from 29 under the previous Government to 45 under the present Government. Within these totals the number of senior positions (i.e. third division) has been increased from 10 to 19. The classification of staff available to the nonGovernment parties has also been upgraded. In addition to the positions listed on the attached table, six positions are available to the Rt. Honourable William McMahon and the Rt. Honourable J. G. Gorton, as former Prime Ministers. The approved staff establishments for nonGovernment parties as at 1 November 1973 are as shown in Table 2. (4) Requests for staff, in addition to the total positions allocated, that have been rejected are: Requested by the Leader of tbe Opposition: One extra Sessional Clerk position foT each Opposition Whip (allowance for these positions had been made in the total positions allocated); one extra stenographer position for each Office-holder; One extra Electorate Secretary for each Opposition Whip to Telease two stenographic positions for re-allocation within the party; one Research Officer position at Clerk, Class 11 salary ($13991-14484) in lieu of one Ministerial Officer Grade1 ($8886-9548) position for the Leader's staff. The Leader also suggested that the top position on his own staff should be at the same classification, Ministerial Officer Grade5 ($19085), as the top position on my own staff and that the top position on the staff of the Deputy Leader should be at Ministerial Officer Grade4 ($17300) in line with that on the Deputy Prime Minister's staff. Requested by the Leader of the Country Parly: One extra Sessional Clerk position for the Country Party Whip. At the time this request was refused, I approved a full time stenographic position for use by the Party Executive.

(Question No. 915) Mr Nixon asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: What is the (a) name, (b) status and (c) salary of per cent. This compares more than favourably with each person employed (i) as private staff, (ii) as a seconded departmental oflicer, or (iii) in any other category who is attached to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and each Minister. able member's question is as follows: I have already in answer to earlier questions (House of Representatives Hansard 13 March 1973 page 534, Senate Hansard 10 April 1973 page 992, House of Representatives Hansard 22 May 1973 page 2471 and 23 August 1973 pages 397-398), given information on this subject. I have said that once staff appointments had been completed, I would make available to the House details of the staff employed by each Minister and by Office-holders of non-Government parties. The Government, in conjunction with the Public Service Board, recently reviewed Ministerial staff arrangements introducing a new Ministerial Officer category, Grades5 to 1, in lieu of Private Secretary, Adviser and Research Officer categories. Grade5 is the senior position on the Prime Minister's staff and Grade4 the senior position on the Deputy Prime Minister's staff. The basic personal staff establishment approved for other Ministers is as stated in answers to earlier questions viz: Two Ministerial Officer positions (each to be at a different level within the Grades 3, 2 and 1) One Press Secretary Two Assistant Private Secretaries One Steno-Secreary, Grade1 One Secretary/Typist In addition each Minister, in consultation with the Permanent Head of his Department, may, appoint (at the remaining Ministerial Officer grade available) a Departmental Liaison Officer who remains on Departmental establishment. A Minister may choose to have one Ministerial Officer, Grade 3, 2 or 1 in lieu of a Press Secretary. Any requires my personal approval. Ministers have now completed their staff appointments. I have been informed that details in respect of my own private staff and of the private staff of each Minister are as listed in Table1 below. Departmental Liaison Officers are shown in Table 2. The details are as at 1 November 1973 and are as up to date as possible. There are continuing changes in staff and the House will be aware for example, that since that date I have appointed Mr Young to my own staff while Mr Bilney has transferred to the Foreign Minister's staff. The Ministerial Officer categories have replaced the Private Secretary, Adviser and Research Officer categories on the private staff of Office-holders of non-Government parties also. As in the case of Ministers, Office-holders may choose to have one Ministerial Officer at the highest Grade appropriate to his staff establishment, in lieu of a Press Secretary. The former Opposition and non-Government parties had 29 Staff positions in total. The present Opposition and non-Government parties have, in total, approval for 45 positions-a n increase of 55 the increase in Ministerial staff establishments. I have been informed that details of the private staff of the Office-holders of the Opposition and non-Government parties as at 1 November 1973 are as listed in Table3 below. Salaries are listed in Table 4. THE HON. E. G. Whitlam , QC, M.P. Classification and Occupant: Ministerial Officer, Grade 5-D r P. Wilenski** (Principal Private Secretary).

(2) The figures published by the Statistician for the September quarter 1973 show an increase over the corresponding quarter in the previous year of 10.6 per cent in the Consumer Price Index. The implicit price deflator for gross domestic product is not yet available for the September quarter. (2) Will he assess the annual rate of inflation, as at the present time, and estimate, at this current rate, its impact upon the estimated Gross National Product value in 1973-74. member's question is as follows: (1) The following table shows, since 194849, annual percentage changes in gross domestic product at current and constant prices, in the so-called implicit price deflator and in the consumer price index. Comparable series are not available prior to 1948-49. Movements in the gross domestic products at constant prices are commonly used as a measure of economic growth although such a measure is subject to a number of limitations (see, for example, the recent Treasury Economic Paper entitled 'Economic Growth: Is it Worth Having?'). The implicit price deflator is often used as a broad indicator of price change for total gross domestic product. It is derived by dividing figures of gross domestic product at current prices by corresponding figures at constant prices. It is not, of course, a price index in the true sense. The consumer price index, on the other hand, is designed to measure variations in prices of goods and services representing a high proportion of the expenditures of wage-earner households.
