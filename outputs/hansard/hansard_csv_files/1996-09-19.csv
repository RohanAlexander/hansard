Mr Keating promised not to increase the overall tax burden but to honour the l-a-w tax pledge of the 1993 election campaign. He committed his government to a total of $14 billion",105,Representatives Main Committee
296,Mr Brough (Longman) (10.10 A.m.),"Since 20 August, when we had the budget handedThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4805 in tax cuts but Australians were subjected to $13.4 billion in new taxes. When the 1993-94 budget was brought down, some of the highlights were: an increase in wholesale sales tax by two per cent, from 20 to 22 per cent, obviously impacting directly upon many Australian families and many of the goods that they purchase; an increase in petrol tax of 7c and 5c on leaded and unleaded petrol respectively, another major impost on average Australian families; an increase in the excise on tobacco of 15 per cent; the taxation as normal income of lump sum payments for unused annual leave and long service leave; the imposition of FBT on salary package benefits such as membership of social clubs; a tightening of the safety net for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-and haven't we heard a lot about that in this session of the parliament; restricted access to Medicare benefits for optometry services; a reduction in the growth of defence spending; and the pushing of the pension age for women to 65 over a 20year period. The 1993-94 budget changed Austudy and changed HECS repayments to commence earlier and at higher rates. Yet Labor complains when we make similar changes to HECS in a responsible budget. Labor realigned HECS with income tax arrangements, so payments reflected the proportion of the year for which those with HECS obligations earned above the repayment threshold. That was in 1994-95. It increased departure tax to $27 and increased recovery costs of aviation safety standards. In 1995-96 Labor increased the Medicare levy. It increased the tax on motor vehicles by six per cent, taking it to 22 per cent; increased company tax by three per cent, to 36 per cent; increased the tobacco tax once again by 10 per cent; increased PAYE tax payments; and increased thresholds for the pharmaceutical benefit schemes. The I-a-w tax cuts were never delivered. here is that, whether we are talking about HECS, pharmaceuticals or aged care, whatever we are talking about, the 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 Keating budgets attacked many of these areas. Labor increased taxes, it increased the burden, and yet the opposition stands up in this parliament and derides this government for the position that it takes. The big difference is this: I would have had no problem with the raising of taxes that Labor undertook if it had been going to result in some improvement to the Australian overall economy. But it did not do that. The previous government simply spent more money. When you spend more money, at the end of the day you do not improve Australia's fiscal position, you do not improve the outlook for the generations to come. Under Labor, family household debt rose to over $200 million, or the equivalent of nearly 70 per cent of household disposable income. The current account deficit increased to $2.6 billion in May 1995 and foreign debt rose from $23 billion to $185 billion over the term of the former Labor government. the term of the former Labor government. Australia's economic sovereignty was put at risk, with net foreign debt liabilities as a proportion of GDP at the third worse in the industrial world, ranking 45th out of 49 countries in terms of external debt to exports. Under Labor we saw the worse economic downturn in 60 years. Home mortgage rates hit 17 per cent and business loans hit 20 per cent.

Under the Labor regime we saw l.9 million Australians living in poverty. The level of income per person under Labor fell from 10th place in the world to 22nd in a period of 10 years. We are supposed to be the lucky country. Twenty-four per cent of all families had no family member employed and more than 600,000 children under 14 lived where no-one had a job. That very clearly spells out the rubbish that we have heard in this place in the last few weeks. The difference is that yes, this government is making cuts, that yes, this government is taking a more responsible attitude towards the debt that was imposed upon it by the previous government, but we are going to benefit from it. We are benefiting from it already. Let us look at what has happened since this government came to power. We have had two reductions in home mortgage interest rates of approximately 0.5 per cent which have impacted on families. The people who are benefiting are the people out there who are trying to keep a roof over their heads. Housing is becoming more affordable. before the budget because you could already see the fiscal position that was being set up. throughout Australia. We have also seen a reduction of one per cent in Australia's long-term rates. But, most importantly, the risk factor that Australia pays, the premium we pay for having had such a disgraceful economic management record over the last 13 years, has been reduced since this government has been in power because of the budget measures that were brought down on 20 August by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. We now have a premium of a 1.2 per cent risk factor as opposed to a 2.2 per cent risk factor that we were paying. This effectively means cheaper money for Australian businesses and Australian families. It means that we are no longer going to be connected, because of our foreign debt, by an umbilical cord to overseas companies. I would also like to speak about the other legacy of this mismanagement and that is how we sold off the Australian farm. I welcomed the Prime Minister's initiative last week with the supermarket to Asia but the reality of the situation is we now own only 20 per cent of our food production in this nation, a nation which has a great record for having one of the most efficient farming sectors in the world. In 1989 there was $52.9 billion of foreign ownership in Australia. Foreign investment is not a bad thing, but in 1989 it was $52.9 billion. In 1996, some seven years later, that figure has now reached $190.1 billion of foreign ownership. What have we lost in that time? We have lost an enormous number of national icons and they are things which mean a lot to Australian families. We say, 'Let's buy Australian', but when people tum up to the shops and the kids want a packet of lollies they go and get a packet of Lifesavers.

If an Australian goes to the pub to have an Australian beer he cannot choose Tooheys, he cannot choose XXXX, and he cannot have a Swan because they are all owned by New Zealand. When he pulls on his Stubbies in a morning, or his King Gees, he is not pulling on Australian brand names any more because these companies are owned by the USA. Of course, like myself, a good Australian worker likes to have a Bundaberg rum. There is no point in having that if you are going to support Australian owned products because it is owned by the UK. We all remember when we used to have the Sidchrome super test cricket team and we would have the commentators speaking long and hard about who was going to make it. The Sidchrome super test team really should be a USA team these days because it is no longer an Australian company; it is owned by the USA. The Fairfax media group is partially owned by Canada, as is the TEN network. Yates Seeds is also foreign owned. As for Qantas, you cannot fly in and out of the country without putting money into foreign ownership. The Brashs retail group is another. You cannot buy anything Australian owned these days. Solahart is another. What about Aeroplane Jelly? There was nothing more Australian than Aeroplane Jelly and now it has gone too. Of course, for people in the bush, the Liberal Party is a party that recognises regional and rural Australia. The Liberal Party does represent the bush. We have more members in the bush than any other party. In fact, the Labor Party has only two members in this parliament representing regional Australia. The bottom line is that when bush people go out there to protect themselves on the wild, open plains of Australia and they put on the Akubra hat and their Drizabones, hey, they are supporting overseas industries as well. That is the legacy of our Labor opposition. As the headline said on Saturday, 13 July, in the Sydney Morning Herald, we are fiddling while the farm is being sold off to foreigners. Only 20 per cent of our food assets are now remaining in Australian ownership. I would like to read a quote from that particular article in the Sydney Morning Herald. It says: Fundamentally, the problem is Australians can't, or won't, save and governments don't do much to help them save. Well, this budget that was brought down on 20 August shows exactly what savings can be achieved. It is bringing the budget into balance in three years. I might add, that is exactly what the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, has said should happen. He said three years is a responsible way of going about it. Certainly, there has been hardship but Australians have accepted that this needs to happen. You could say that the Liberal Party and the National Party have brought down a responsible and a caring budget for the future. Before concluding I would like to make one other point regarding the budget and it concerns something which is going to impact very directly on the people of Longman. I am referring to the change from Medicare offices to local agencies. Opposition members like to tell half the story. They are very good at that; they do not seem to be able to tell the full story. Eighty offices are going to be closed. You would say that that is an appalling thing to happen but the reality of the situation is that the closing of 80 Medicare offices means that we are going to be able to open 400 Medicare agencies in regional areas and in outer suburbs such as in Narangba in my electorate.",108,Representatives Main Commitiee

Therefore, they cannot access many of the facilities that other people enjoy in central city areas. They will be able now to have a Medicare agency in their region. The people on Bribie Island where we have very much an elderly population, about 15,000 people, are going to be able to access a Medicare agency now. I also hope that we are going to be able to have them in places such as Laidley and Esk. They are only 100 kilometres from the Brisbane GPO but the bottom line is that they may as well be at the back of Bourke for the amount of service that they received under the previous Labor government. This is a wise use of money. It is revenue neutral but it provides a service to where the people are, and that is what we should be trying to achieve. That is what this government is about. We are not just about fiscal responsibility; we are about using Australian taxpayers' money in the most responsible manner in order to get the results that are needed on the ground for Australians in the bush, in the cities, and right across this great nation. I am very proud to be representing the people of Longman. We do not have a wealthy electorate. In fact, the average family income is $28,000. That $28,000 is the total income that comes into the family. average income is concerned. These people want jobs, they want to work and they do not want to mortgage their future. They do not want to put in jeopardy the future of their children. This budget goes a long way to achieving their goals and our goals. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996-97. I have said before that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) and the Liberal Party and the National Party are to be congratulated. They had a resounding win at the last election. Mr Ted Grace-That is the good news! Minister's statement that he would be governing for all Australians was one thing that perhaps allayed some of the fears that many Australians may have had about voting against the previous government. Because this is the budget debate we really do need to say a few things about what is going to happen as a result of the new direction of the new government. Firstly, it is true that this government has set some targets. It has set targets for inflation at around two per cent. In fact, it has exchanged letters between the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the new governor of the Reserve Bank to ensure that the governor is fully aware of what the government desires in relation to inflation. I have to say that having a low inflationary outcome is a good thing and it really would be supported by members on this side of the chamber. government and the previous government in relation to inflation. We also said that we thought it was a very high priority to have employment increasing. We were very optimistic and desirous of having a very strong growth rate. It is interesting that the government is prepared to set targets for inflation and set targets about getting into a surplus as far as the budget is concerned-and we would support the general thrust of that. We do not agree with what they",109,Representatives Main Committee

We think getting the budget into surplus is a good thing. But when half of the money is going to pay for your election promises we say that that is electoral deceit and you will eventually get marked down for that. But I want to return to inflation, because you pay a price when you abandon an employment target. You pay a price-and the price is that if you crunch down on inflation, as this government wants to, you are going to see unemployment increase. The budget papers talk about unemployment rising through the year to 8.5 per cent. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that figure has already been exceeded. While the growth target in the budget is 3.5 per cent, I really regret to say that I do not think it is going to be met. Already, people are talking about nine per cent through to the year 2ooD-and even higher. I think you can guarantee one thing about this budget: the growth target will not be met and the unemployment target will be exceeded. That is a tragedy for ordinary Australians, because even if you are in a job you will know people who do not have one or know the despair of not being able to find a job. On the Labor side, we always felt you needed to put people first, that the best form of economy is a strong economy and sustained growth. I would like to see growth even greater than we were able to achieve under the most difficult circumstances. I just want to put that on the record. AndI ask the people of Lindsay, for example, who will have an opportunity to vote, to note that the government will put a target on inflation, a target on growth, but they will not put a target on how they expect unemployment to fall-because they know they cannot achieve it. We went to the last election-people such as the honourable member for Fowler( Mr Ted of the fact that. as a government, we were setting a target up there. We were saying we believed that as Australia, the society we know and love, goes into the new millennium we had to pick the lowest possible level of unemployment. We said, 'At every election we have said we would create a certain number of jobs-and we have exceeded that.' When people on the then government side, on the Labor side, set the figure of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. firstly we were proud of it and, secondly, we knew that on our track record we would meet that target. But on the government side today they will not tell the people of Australia what they believe. They do not even believe that they should have a target. In other words, compared to inflation. compared to the budget position-whether it is in surplus or deficitunemployment is not a sufficiently important statistic for the government to pin its name and reputation on. The second reason for that is that they know all their policies are not going to add up to decreasing unemployment but to increasing it. In this respect, they have sadly deceived the people of Australia. I hope that in the by-election in Lindsay we will get an opportunity to revisit this with the people, because they are good people in Lindsay, my neighbouring scat. They are hard working, industrious, family oriented and, let me say, very concerned about unemployment. Let's see how concerned they are. When you have been in government, as the honourable member for Fowler and I have, you always reflect on the worse budget and you think, 'My god, how might this have been a little different?' Without specifying the budget, I can certainly nominate one that would meet that category.

Not that this is a budget reflecting a charter of budget honesty, but, 'Look how deep, how deceptive, this government has been in burying all the many nasties in it.' No honesty, no openness, no transparency, but guile, deceit and deliberately not living up to the commitments they made to the people of Australia. One day they will be brought to account, let me say. We all get brought to account one day. But in a budget speech of so many nasties it is always difficult to identify the thing that upsets you the most, the thing that you find most objectionable. I think what they are doing about unemployment is really objectionable, and I know it affects a lot of my constituents. Unemployment has been consistently a concern of many of my constituents. But I am going to nominate the thing that I find most abhorrent. Perhaps the member for Fisher is not like me, but I say in my electorate the thing that gives me most pleasure is actually going to school kids, meeting with them and answering questions and speaking to themto be Australian; I am very proud of our country. The children are going to be our future and they are to be nurtured and treated and valued and encouraged. But our senior citizens are the people that have already made their contribution, doing so before my generation. They have done something to develop and make Australia the country it is. It is not that they are not intrinsically nice people; they are. They are lovely and courteous; they give me great support. But they have made a contribution to Australia which I am always happy to acknowledge in terms of what they are leaving me and others. That is why I find what the government is doing about nursing homes so outrageous. What they are doing is insisting on a pre-payment, a down payment on death, by senior citizens in their new nursing home arrangements. The member for Fisher says, 'Oh, that is what you did with hostels.' They are not medically assessed for getting into a hostel, as the member for Fisher well knows. It is a matter of choice whether you live in your home, live in your flat, live with your folks or go into hostel accommodation. With nursing homes there is a medical assessment-an ACAT team. You have to be medically qualified to get into a nursing home. There is no choice in your medical condition; it is a function of the condition that you are in.

The government is going to raise $130 million out of this down payment on death by senior citizens. The minister says, 'It is not up to us. Nursing homes are going to make the assessment about whether they are going to charge $26,000' -and I believe it is going to be closer to $50,000. The minister says that it is not up to the government; it is up to the nursing homes. It may be the case that some of the religious nursing homes are going to take a very compassionate view of it. Under the funding for hostels, they have to set aside a certain percentage for people who cannot pay an up-front fee. But this is not the case with this new nursing home imposition. It is going to be left to the people who run it. Can we say to this government, which is obsessed with bottom lines, profits and private enterprise, that the wealthy Australians who are so well connected to it and who own and operate private nursing homes are suddenly going to say, 'If it is a choice between collecting $26,000 or $30,000'-or whatever the figure that the minister cannot provide is, which we know is at least $26,000-'or not we don't want your money, madam. We are going to freely elect to drop our bottom line. We are not really operating under the profit motive, even though we may be listed or incorporated as a company. We are going to choose some poor person who cannot afford it'? The honourable member for Fisher knows that that is absolute rubbish. The government is doing a number of things to poor, elderly, frail, vulnerable Australians. Firstly, it is saying that if they cannot afford the $26,000 they cannot get into a nursing home, even though they are in a housing commission flat and are medically assessed as requiring a nursing home bed. So their quality of life is going to suffer. When you are medically assessed as requiring nursing home accommodation, you require it. So your quality of life, your medical condition, is going to suffer. This is the destiny for poor, elderly, frail Australians. This is the government's vision of the future. What if they are living at home? What if a family has been concerned enough to have their mother, father or grandparent living at home with them and the elderly person is assessed as requiring nursing home accommodation? What happens in the situation where the family cannot afford the up-front payment on death? What will happen is that there will be an increasing incidence of parents being bashed by their children. That is what is going to happen. I know a lot of senior citizens who are on a pension and are living in their homes. The government says, 'No-one is going to be forced to sell their home.' I will give you an example. This is a true story. There is a couple in my electorate and the husband required heart surgery. They were referred to a cardiologist. They owned some acreage, but were pensioners. They are lovely people. The cardiologist said to them, 'Why do you need to live in your home? Why don't you sell this home and land and pay for the operation?' That is the double jeopardy you are going to be putting people in. What happens where there is a surviving spouse? I will give you another instance, just quoted to me recently, where a wife had been desperate to keep her husband at home. He really needed to go to a nursing home, but she battled to keep him at home. She has had a complete mental breakdown. She is now away from the home being treated. This is the rosy future that the government is painting for elderly, frail Australians, whom it does not value at all. 4812 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 Getting back to the pensioner in the house receiving a pension: what happens when one of them requires nursing home treatment? What happens when one spouse is convinced that the only way they can get them into the nursing home is by paying the up-front fee? I am afraid to say, pensioners do these things. If they sell the house, probably they will not have their pension affected by the assets test, but they will be deemed on proceeds of the sale of gains. Where does that person live in the meantime? Perhaps, there is an argument that we need to inject $130 million into nursing homes. That is, in a sense, a different argument. But not one cent of this $130 million is going to provide one extra nursing home bed. Not one. You are going to increase the profits of private nursing home owners and operators. I do not say that about the religious and community ones. You are going to increase their bottom line as a dirty election deal. I think what you are doing about nursing homes is absolutely shameful. To suggest, as has been suggested, that it is the same as you are doing for hostels is nothing more than a deliberate, dirty untruth. reasons? are demented? home treatment. I cannot volunteer to go into a nursing home. My mother cannot volunteer to go into a nursing home. My father, I regret to say, or thankfully, is already in a nursing home. But people cannot volunteer their grandparents or their mothers to go in. They have to be medically assessed. I know that the honourable member for Fisher is thick, but I wish he would cotton on to this point. I think that probably, once he fully understands the policy, having got out amongst his senior citizens for whom he has interjected and for whom he has so much admiration, he is going to be embarrassed and, I hope, humiliated. I hope he will be motivated to want to change. I think that this is horrific-absolutely bloody horrific. not add one nursing home bed in Australia! Old people do not want to be a burden on their families. Their one desire in life is to see out their remaining years with dignity and not put any financial burdens on anyone. You have put a new financial terror into this nursing home proposition. Much as the honourable member may interject, it only demonstrates, I think, that even he with his thick hide may be a little bit discomforted by these new arrangements. I say to my senior citizens that I value them. (Time expired) thing to do is to get into perspective the background to the budget. Three dreadful decisions have been made in this country. One of them was the abolition and, it must be added, the undermining of the reserve price scheme for wool in this country. One tenth of this nation's entire export earnings throughout its history has come from wool. In 1988, one-tenth of this nation's export earnings came from a single commodity, wool. The last thing that any government should have done was to play around with wool, but",112,Representatives Main Committee

329,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (L0.43 A.m.),"In saying a few words today, I think that the firstThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4813 government did. The net result of it was that when the economic rationalists took us into the paradise of enlightenment that we are now in the world's wool buyers were able to buy our wool for $3,000 million a year, instead of $6,000 million a year. On behalf of the world's wool buyers and wool traders, I would like to say thank you to the Australian people for selling a product at around half of its cost of production to us for the last six years. The people that enabled them to do that were the economic rationalists, the people who are the architects of the misery in this country, and they are still riding high in all parts of government. I will move on. The second decision was to deregulate the banking sector. Let me go to no lesser authority than Trevor Sykes and his book The Bold Riders. He designates that, in four short years, there was a loss of $28,000 million. In that book-that brilliant tour de force, giving an understanding of what happened in the 1980s in Australia-Trevor Sykes delineated the cause of the loss of that $28,000 million. That is a lot of money. That is costing this country, to this day, $3,000 million a year. So there were two decisions which cost this country $6,000 million a year. The third decision-for which we must thank, as with all three of these decisions, our economic rationalist friends-was the deregulation of the oil industry. As one person put it to me yesterday, it is like the invisible suit of clothes in this place. Outsiders with any sense say, 'What is going on here? This economic rationalism is madness.' We deregulated 90 per cent of the oil industry in this country. Having proved how successful it was, now we are going to deregulate the other 10 per cent of it. That will indicate the enlightenment that we have in this place. Since the time we deregulated it, the world's price for oil has dropped clean in half, from $34 a barrel down to about $17 or $18 a barrel. But in Australia the price paid to the oil companies in the same period of time doubled. People say to me, 'That is ridiculous. Where did you get those figures from?' I thought everyone knew that the world price of oil had dropped clean in half. But, of course, they think it is all taxation. When they go and fill up at the bowser they know that the price they pay has far more than doubled but they think that it is all taxation. Whilst a lot of it is taxation, the fact is that the price paid to the oil companies rose from 12V2 cents a litre to 22 cents a litre in that same period of time. So, while the world price dropped almost clean in half, the Australian price doubled. That means that the oil companies are taking from the people of Australia $6,000 million a year that they are not entitled to--they are not entitled to one cent of that-because of the slackness in our anti monopolistic legislation and our lack of determination to enforce that legislation in this country. If you take all the taxes off here, we are looking at something around 36 cents a litre. In the United States, the last time. I looked, it was 26 cents a litre. They have adequate antimonopoly legislation which they enforce. That is the background to this budget. If you doubt the extent of the damage that economic rationalists have done to this country, I will quote you some figures. Let us look at average weekly earnings in this country over the last 13 years, under the great hammer of economic rationalism, Mr Keating. I do not doubt for a moment that he has many enthusiastic supporters on our side of the House, so I am not going to stand here and be hypocritical enough to say that it is not the same on our side of the House. These people just seem to keep going with policies without ever assessing whether they work or not. 4814 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 If you get my speeches from the state parliament, you will find that I was a very strong economic rationalist 15 years ago. You will get a lot of speeches along these lines from me. But I kept watching the figures. I had to say to myself, This policy is not working.' I then had to put my tail between my legs and run, because I was monitoring what was happening out there and what were the results of these decisions. The results of these decisions were absolutely disastrous for this country-the three costing $12,000 million a year. As for average weekly earnings, let me quote the figures and be very specific. In 1983, 61.6 was the CPI index. In 1995, it was 117.6. There was a rise in the CPI of 56 per cent between 1983 and 1995. Average weekly earnings in the same period rose from $341 to $654 and that gave us a rise in average weekly earnings of 47.9 per cent. So average weekly earnings trailed the cost of living by 8.1 per cent. Every person who was on an income in this country was down 8.1 per cent. But that was only a small part of the story. Federal, state and local taxes rose from $52,000 million per year to $151,000 million per year in the same period. Since one-third of all our income goes on taxes, that translates into a reduction of 17.7 per cent in take-home pay for the average wage-earner. The average wage-earner in Australia has suffered a loss in his purchasing power of 26 per cent in the last 13 years under these policies. We now have the highest juvenile suicide rate in the world. Very sadly for me, my electorate is outside the metropolitan area. The suicide rate outside the metropolitan area is six times higher than that in the metropolitan area. I do not have to tell this House of the sea of human misery that exists outside of this place; yet the policies that have created this sea of human misery are continuing unabated. On both sides of the House, there are people who are still out there advocating and implementing these policies. It is deeply regrettable that these people have, like the Bourbons, forgotten nothing and learnt nothing. We have, this year, the highest bankruptcy rates in Australian history. The figures for the past three quarters have all been over 4,000. Let me be very specific. In the past three quarters, there were 12,493 bankruptcies. The March quarter, which is the last quarter for which we have got figures, had the worse figures in Australia's history. On present trends, the final quarter almost certainly will go over the 16,780 bankruptcies of three years ago. It is the worse year for Australian business in Australian history. That is what we have come to, after 13 or 14 years of economic rationalism. Average weekly earnings are down 26 per cent. As far as unemployment goes, add to the other unemployment figures the figures for the part-time unemployed-because, as we all know, if you work for an hour per week, you are registered as employed, not unemployedtogether with the labour market program figures, which the current minister said were over 200,000 but which, on my figures, were most certainly 198,000, and, on top of that, the CDEP figures, which are another 26,000. When you add the three figures together-for the labour market program people, the people who cannot get a full-time job, and the people employed part-time for an hour per week-you come up with a figure, according to Minister Kemp, of 17 per cent. If you would like to go to the past chairman of the Labor economics caucus committee, John Langmore, he says it is 16.5 per cent. Dr John QUiggin, who won the Academy of Science prize in the year before last, quotes the figure as being between 16.5 and 17.5 per cent. I think that we can reasonably assume that the real unemployment rate in this country is 17 per cent. Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4815 During the Great Depression, there were only about four years in which unemployment was over 17 per cent. In the United States, it was only over 17 per cent for three years. Whilst we do not have the human pain that was inflicted during the Great Depression-because we have, some might say, adequate unemployment benefits-the human misery that is entailed in not having a job is communicated through the suicide rates in this country. That is where we can find out what it means in this country to have no job and no hope for the future. Let me compare, for those who laud economic rationalism in this country. The very antithesis of economic rationalism was John McEwen. A lot of people say that he and Menzies got their own way all the time. Most certainly, he was the driving force as far as economics went, and he was roundly criticised for his policies. Let us look at the score card in the last year of John McEwen policies. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have to bear with me, because I am going to compare these figures with the 1991 figures, and most of these figures are worse now than they were in 1991, of course. Unemployment in 1972 stood at 1.9 per cent; in 1991, at 10.5 per cent. The balance of payments in 1972 showed a $754 million surplus. The current account was in surplus. In 1991, there was a $16,000 million deficit. In 1972 there were 2,648 bankruptcies and, in 1991, there were 13,091. In 1972, the value of the Australian dollar was such that it took a whopping great $US 1.28 to buy an Australian dollar. In 1991, the value of the Australian dollar was $USO.76, or ¥384; and it is now ¥95. In 1972, interest rates stood at 7.7 per cent and, in 1991, at 15.5 per cent. In 1972, taxation was at $8.9 billion and, in 1991, $97.9 billion. The interest paid on foreign debt in 1972 was $425 million. The interest paid on foreign debt in 1991 was $19,000 million. Which were the successful policies? They say the world has changed. If we take the phrases used by the current economic rationalists and the phrases used by the people attacking Ted Theodore during the Great Depression, I hate to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is the same phraseology, the same turn of phrase-the same words are even being used. How do we get out of the hole that we are in at the present moment? Believe me, we are in a depression. The only reason we do not know that is because we now pay adequate social security payments, which we did not pay during the 1930s. How do we get out of that hole? In fairness to the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and to the government, it is very hard to keep borrowing money. Three years ago, the interest paid by the federal government was $3,880 million. The interest paid in 1996 was $9,390 million. If the interest bill keeps exploding at that rate, all of our taxation in a 10-year time frame most certainly will go to paying interest just on the federal government's debt. We cannot keep borrowing money, but cutting back on government spending in a recession is not what should be done. That is the very last thing that we should do. The message from what happened in the 1930s was that, when the economy is in recession, cutting back on government spending is the most disastrous move that can be made. So how do we solve this conundrum? To break the cycle, we have to look at adequate antimonopoly laws. We must look at giving our commodity producers, be they wool producers or copper producers or whatever, the ability to collectively market their product. Unless they can collectively market their product, then the little sheep cocky outside of Longreach is being pitted against the might of Itoh of Japan, one of the biggest trading houses in the world. The little sheep cocky outside of Richmond or Julia Creek or Longreach is going to go under, and he is going under at the present moment. The Australian people are going down 4816 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 as well, because half of our sheep herd-this nation's greatest asset-has already gone. So we must give our commodity producers the right to collectively and aggressively market their product, instead of, as we have been doing in this place, removing that right. That is what we did when we abolished the minimum price scheme in wool. There are many other examples I could use. Three thousand million dollars a year is the benefit in wool alone. Another example is the tobacco industry. A lot of people think that it is collapsing because people are stopping smoking. It has really got nothing to do with that whatsoever. There were 660 tobacco farmers in Australia and now there are about 260. The reason for that was the removal of the marketing schemes that existed previously. If we got stuck into the oil companies and took them on-the same as that great and courageous President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, did at the start of this century-we would enjoy the same sorts of prices that are enjoyed in the United States. That would save this country $6,000 million. Just with those two commodities-wool and petrolthis country could save $9,000 million a year if we had a bit of backbone and aggression and took the same aggressive policies that were taken in the days of people like John McEwen and Sir Robert Menzies. To move on, there are some three or, arguably, six major water schemes in Australia which, if we proceed with them, as the Americans did during the Great Depression, will bring into this country $5,000 million a year. I have not got time to go into much detail here. As far as mining goes, if the laws with respect to the Native Title Act are put into place properly and if we stand up to the ridiculous obsession which some people have with the environment and which takes us into absolute lunacy areas, then we will produce for this country great wealth that is not being produced at the present moment. In just six mines in North Queensland and at the top of Western Australia there is $5,000 million worth of production being held up, some of it indefinitely, because of those twin problems that exist in Australia today. In the prawn farming industry, the greenies are winning to such an extent that prawn farming is actually going down-production is actually going down in this country-because they are succeeding in closing more farms than we can open. So a tiny little country like Thailand, with a coastline about one-twentieth the size of Queensland's coastline or maybe even less than that, is producing $2.2 thousand million worth of prawns a year, whereas Australia is producing from her prawn farms under $100 million a year. And that figure, in all probability at the present moment, is falling. So there is $2,000 million in prawn farming alone to add to that list. Moreover, in the area of ethanol phosphate and converting a lot of our transportation systems to electricity there is another $2,000 million that this country can make but is not making at the present moment. Those micro-schemes, specific target areas, are worth $23,000 million a year to the Australian economy. If we are looking for money, surely primage is the way to go. All the federal government's income before the First World War came from primage, which is simply a charge on every single product coming into this country, an across-the-board charge. I cannot quote you the section from GAIT, but it is GAIT neutral. The income can be bought in that way at 10 per cent and will most certainly give our struggling manufacturing industries-and even, now, some of our food industries-some desperately needed respite against countries where people are forced to work for $2 a day. We should move into the area of income splitting. You may want to know why we have the highest juvenile suicide rate in the world. In a single-income family, where a bloke is Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4817 working and the wife chooses to stay at home and look after her kids properly, if the husband is on the average Australian income he starts with $34,424. After tax is taken out he is left wi th $26,182. If there are four people, including his wife and two children, that works out at $6,500 each. That is what they have got to get by on. If it is a double-income family, where the wife chooses to work, they are on $52,364 a year after tax is taken out. That leaves them on $14,000 a year each. But if it is a DINK family-double income and no kids-as so many Australian families are today, they are on $26,000 each. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you: would you like to be on $6,500 a year each or would you like to be on $26,000 a year each? If you are a DINK you are on $26,000. If you are like me and like so many of the rest of us and your wife chooses to look after your children, and if you are on the average Australian income, you are on $6,500 a year each. That is the reason why women are being forced out into the work force against their will. That is the reason why our young people truly are so unhappy today that they are doing away with themselves. (Time expired) a first-class speech on behalf of his constituents. He would make a good Independent member, as a matter of fact. WhatI want to say at the beginning of my speech relates to the fact that we are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996-97, a very important bill, here in the Main Committee, which was set up-as I well know, being a former member of the Procedures Committee at the time-to deal with non-contentious legislation. Here we are in the Main Committee, out of the main chamber, debating what is, effectively, the most important legislation of the year, and the government considers this to be part and parcel of a responsible working parliamentary democracy. I can say that that was outside the scope of the intent of the formation of the Main Committee, well outside. This was designed to deal with non-contentious legislation and it was designed to offer members the opportunity of speaking on those non-contentious bills for which, often, the speaking time had concertinaed because of more pressing government matters on the government legislative calendar. We find ourselves now here in this room debating, in effect in the secondary chamber of the House of Representatives, the most important piece of legislation the government has this year. In my view, this is an abrogation of the responsibility of the government. The government made it clear in the election campaign that it was going to raise the standards of parliamentary debate. It was going to improve the way in which we conducted our affairs. It was going to make the Speaker more independent. What we have, in effect, is the executive leaning on the House of Representatives and forcing the legislation which is, basically, going to fund a large amount of the government's election promises-and some of the things it did not promise in the election, which I am going to come to-to be debated here, away from the main stage in the main chamber. That is not only a shame; it is a disgrace. I have made that point clear elsewhere and I will continue to do so until the government realises that people in the wider community will not put up with this. Then it will have to change. The government, in essence, is using the power of its numbers to squash the opportunity for members to make their contribution in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. There are no ministers here, no parliamentary secretaries. Nobody is listening. Nobody is interested. That also, to my way of thinking, demonstrates the contempt that the executive government has for the contributions of individual members. In other words, all these things",114,Representatnes Main Committee
330,Mr Filing (Moore) 01.04 A.m.),"The member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) has just delivered4818 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 that are occurring in the House of Representatives, either here or in the other chamber, are entirely irrelevant to the conduct of government business. The way in which the government is conducting itself is not only no better than the conduct of the previous administration, in many instances it is worse. It is more authoritarian and, in fact, it is more oppressive than the worse excesses of the Keating government-and believe me, they were bad enough. What is happening now is that the government is doing more than the Keating government did. The Keating government set up the Main Committee. I was an opponent of it in the first instance, because I believed that the Main Committee would relegate aspects of debate from the main chamber into the Main Committee and there would be a secondary debate. Members of the public probably would not even know this chamber exists, and the members of parliament would feel that their contribution was being treated with contempt. What we have, in essence, is exactly what I predicted, coming true now. But that is not under the Keating government: to be fair to the Keating government, for all the other excesses it brought to the Australian parliament, the Keating government never referred other than non-contentious legislation to this Committee, except in a couple of instances when it was pulled up, quite rightly, by individual members. I just make this observation: if the government thinks this sort of thing is going to go on unchallenged, it has another think coming. It really has to fulfil the promise it made to the electorate in the election campaign, that it was going to make parliamentary debates, the parliamentary processes, more relevant to the community. It would raise them, to make sure that the government and the parliamentary process was an effective part of our system of governance. We in this place would all know in the bottom of our hearts that much of what we might say and much of what we might do, as far as the government is concerned, is worth nothing, because it chooses purely to ignore it. We have seen occasions in recent times when the government has chosen to use numbers to crush individual motions. One instance was, in my view, a dreadful occurrence: a member who chose to move two similar divisions was ruled to be obstructionist and the second division was considered to be out of order. That is interesting, compared with the situation where the Labor opposition has moved three divisions on exactly the same thing but they have not had the same ruling applied to them. It is interesting that there seems to be one rule for some and another rule for the others. The general thrust of the budget, in most areas, is commendable. I know that the member for Kennedy and others share some very strong reservations about the economic rationalist aspects of the government's agenda, and I do too. But there are a number of areas where the government has been forced into accepting greater fiscal accountability and responsibility as its essential duty to the community. After all, we are here, in essence, dealing with the expenditure of taxpayers' money, and we have a very substantial duty to make sure that is done properly, it is accountable and transparent. In more recent times the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) pointed out that, in the Primary Industries Amendment Bill which was before this place some time ago, there was a $24 million appropriation from the non-wool assets of wool farmers to what was called Wool Holdings International, which was a body designed to encourage the sale of wool on the futures market. And how much description was there, in the documentary material which accompanied the bill, about what that was going to be used for? There were two lines in the explanatory memorandum. Did that arouse much interest or concern on the part of the Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4819 government? Very little at all. It is incredible that $24 million can be appropriated with only two lines of explanatory memorandum. That is incredible. That is $12 million per line. It is a very expensive explanatory memorandum. But there are a few areas in the budget which I would like to address now and they cause me some concern. I was elected in Moore as the Independent member with, in my view, a role to play to try and ensure, as much as I am able, that the promises that the government made in the election campaign are kept. I have to say that a number of them have not been kept, and there are a number of things in the budget which were not foreshadowed. Some people have found them to their cost. The government cannot talk on the one hand of providing incentives for development, prosperity and the public good and then place legislative and administrative fiscal disincentives in the way. I am going to address a few areas where I think that the government can provide innovation and improvement. One is a light fuel oil excise rebate, something the member for Kennedy would know about because this also affects, I would imagine, areas of his own electorate. It is a matter of considerable concern to regional Australians, especially those in Western Australia and Queensland. The government made a very good decision, in my view, to leave in place the excise exemption for light fuel oil used in the mining and farming industries. I was one of those that lobbied the government to try and ensure that this took place. But I am concerned that the government has not addressed the anomaly created by the previous government where the rebate was removed for power generation. Regional and remote Australia are very dependent on distillate based power generation and thus are highly vulnerable to any increases that occur in fuel pricing. Most electricity consumption in regional and remote areas is directly related to mining and primary industry activities. So there is a little bit of a dilemma or an incongruous situation here. The government has imposed an excise on the fuel used by utilities generating electricity for consumption by the mining and primary industry sectors, and yet it provides exemptions for distillate used by the mining companies in those sectors. The situation is being exacerbated by the previous government increasing the light fuel excise from 6.5c per litre to 33c per litre. In my state, this increased Western Power's regional power division costs by $18 million, to a record $44 million loss. Western Power generates and distributes electricity to 19,000 customers in 29 regional towns from Esperance to Kununurra. Much of Western Power's electricity is subject to contractual arrangements where initial costs could not be passed on to major consumers. Western Power is subject to the national competition policy-which I am sure the member for Kennedy has some strong views about-which disallows subsidisation to the regional divisions with profits from the metropolitan operation. South Waleswill be significant price increases in electricity for regional users. Large regional users face an increase of 30c per kilowatt hour from July next year, compared to the total cost now of 12c per kilowatt hour for supply to a metropolitan household. So, there is a substantial disincentive for businesses operating directly or indirectly in support of mining and primary industries, and it has great implications for development and quality of life in regional WA.",119,Representatives Main Committee
331,Mr Katter,"That was brought out by Mr Hilmer, the head of the power industry in New",121,Representatives Main Committee
332,Mr Filing,"I was going to say that the only recourse in the case of Western Australia4820 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 This excise is an inequitable outback tax and it causes an inefficiency in infrastructure decisions and a significant burden to regional WA and to Queensland, I might add, where there are a number of areas where power is generated through diesel fuel. I call on the government to extend the light oil fuel rebate to cover the generation of electricity by utilities. The other aspect where I have got some substantial concerns is the cuts in low levels of federal funding in the budget for programs which are related to fighting and preventing crime. These budget cuts are damaging to the morale and effectiveness of organisations such as the AFP and the NCA. Public order and safety spending is decreasing significantly as a percentage of the total Commonwealth budget, and this is occurring when the risks to the community from crime continue to increase. The AFP is a principal law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. This budget reduces funding for 1997 by $19.2 million in running costs, $1.2 million in outlays for plant and equipment, and $1.8 million in appropriations for buildings or works. The government gave an election commitment to increase funding for fraud investigation by the AFP. This cannot be maintained. This budget means that the AFP will lose staff and resources. The AFP has shown that there is a direct correlation between operational resources and operational performance. Cuts in resources here will mean a cut in narcotics seizures, investigated frauds and proceeds of crime confiscations. The reduction in the AFP's policing effort will affect the entire Australian policing operation. I share the concern of the Police Federation of Australia that this funding reduction puts at risk the whole reform program for the AFP. I might add that in my home state it is estimated there is $1 billion of illicit drugs entering over the state border per annum. I might also say that in the face of funding cuts in Australian Customs, the NCA, the AFP, and the Western Australian Police Force-in effect, real cuts-we are going to see a significant problem become even more of a concern. In Western Australia we have significantly higher crime rates than the Australian average. As I have described before, Australia is a place where you are far more likely to have your home burgled or to be robbed or assaulted without a weapon than in the United States. This is something a lot of people do not realise. Crime is on the increase. It is a serious problem. AndI am appalled that the government has chosen to target the AFP in particular for those significant funding cuts, as well as the NCA. The Australian Institute of Criminology was established to conduct research, policy analysis and information dissemination on criminal justice issues. It is a valuable resource in our nation's fight against crime. It has meant, in effect, that the state police services have not had to devote resources of their own to similar statistical research. But there is one particular aspect of it that I am sure the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) would be concerned about too. That is that the budget statement relating to the Australian Institute of Criminology has proposed the discontinuance of the AIC's violence against women project. I would have thought that members of the government would be appalled at that particular prospect. It is something that I hope they will work within their party fora to have overturned. It has a direct application in the fight against violence against women. We know that that is a matter of very serious concern in Australia, not only to women but to all responsible members of the community. Under the circumstances, given that the state police forces have used the Australian Institute of Criminology statistical research for their own particular Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4821 workings, I would have thought that that was a matter for grave concern on the part of government members who I know share my concerns about the problems of violent crime against women-and, of course, domestic violence as well. The dental program is another area where there have been some serious concerns. In effect, the cessation of the dental program is really a decision to underfund the last year of the program by half. We know that dental care delivery is a state responsibility. But the Commonwealth did develop the program to meet the high level of need in the community for this type of support. There is not any great evidence of a reduction in the demand, and I am concerned to a certain extent that the measure is short-sighted. In the circumstances, knowing that dental care is an important component of health care, I think we will see an increase of costs in general health delivery as a result, because the interesting thing is that if you do not get your teeth sorted out, often that can lead to other health problems. We know that in a lot of cases, and certainly from the past, dental health care was considered to be one of the most important aspects of personal health care because of the primary fact that we have to use our mouths in order to be able to eat and drink. Therefore, dental health care is of significance and I call on the government to increase state funding that can be directly attributable to dental care because of the circumstances I have just mentioned. The changes to deeming for pensioners is another area of concern. They say it is a measure to simplify and reduce the intrusive nature of the taxation system. Independent commentators have stated that the effect of this change is that pensioners must ensure that their money must achieve a return of at least five per cent to avoid being disadvantaged. I have stated that I am opposed to any measures taken by the government that will disadvantage pensioners. I am sure many of the members of the governmentA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.19 to 11.34 a.m. rules for pensioners and to reinstate the previous exemption of the first $2,000 for singles and $4,000 for couples. Given the difficulty in gaining the five per cent return after operating costs in their working accounts that the original exemption was designed to provide for, I will continue to oppose this measure. It is unfair. It is, in my view, an unnecessary burden on pensioners. It is a burden that, in the first instance, was placed on pensioners to bring about some sort of fairness in relation to the likely unearned income that pensioners might be achieving with some of their financial assets. But, in this case, it is purely and simply an extra whammy on pensioners that they do not deserve. In the time that I have left, I want to address a couple of points. One is in relation to AQIS. The federal government funding for both the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Customs Service remains inadequate in relation to the risks our community faces. AQIS must be made efficient and maintained as such. This is not just in terms of its inspection and prophylactic services but also, most importantly, in terms of the quality of advice it gives to the government. We have the potential to further develop as a major producer of safe, healthy foodstuffs throughout the region. This is at constant risk from imported pests and diseases. Recently, serious weeds such as cleavers and red shank have entered Australia in canola seeds from New Zealand. Other introduced pests include the golden apple snail, which poses a serious risk to",121,Representatives Main Committee
333,Mr Filing,"I call on the government to reverse its decision on the extension of deeming4822 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 the rice industry, and fire blight, which could seriously affect our apple production and devastate our pear industry. The potential damage to Australian industry if infected products such as cooked chicken meat or salmon products are allowed to be imported is enormous. With AQIS funding at its present levels, this becomes more highly likely. The government must have confidence in the advice of AQIS, and AQIS and the government must be accountable for the actions taken under the advice. In this matter, I give notice to the government that I intend, along with the member for Kalgoorlie, to move a private member's bill to make the Commonwealth government of the day more responsible for the losses that are incurred by producers as a result of decisions made under the advice of AQIS. Finally, I will go back to the point that I made at the beginning in relation to our system of parliamentary democracy. I will make some comments in relation to some changes to the constitution that are absolutely necessary. I recognise and applaud the fact that the funding appropriated in this bill is directly related to the implementation of one of the most wide-ranging changes in direction for Australian society. There was a mandate in the election for the government to implement that program and they are in the process of implementing most of it, some of it in areas which were not foreshadowed. Industrial, social education and employment characteristics will be dramatically altered. The number of government members attests to the very high level of public support for change. But it was not necessarily support for change to a Liberal coalition government. It was a call for a change from the community which had been absolutely sick to its back teeth of 13 years of Labor's inefficient and, in many instances, corrupted government. This government has announced its intentions to make government fiscally accountable and responsible. I believe that it is time for them to also become legislatively accountable and responsible. In our society we have witnessed a growth industry in political correctness. We have seen relatively small vested interest groups take control of various issues and, eventually, government. This has occurred relatively easily, despite being contrary to the will of the vast majority of the people. The Westminster system is becoming more cut off from the will and the rights of the people. In essence, the executive virtually operates in an untrammelled fashion vis-a-vis the parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate. We have the situation where, in many instances, the rights and interests of constituents of the members of the House of Representatives are unable to be fulfilled purely and simply because they do not fit in with the program or the will of the executive. We must allow the Australian people as a whole the right and responsibility to introduce or amend legislation by the power of their votes. I am referring to what are generally known as citizen initiated referenda. I believe the absence of a mechanism for citizen initiated referenda reduces the quality of our parliamentary democracy and also reduces the accountability of our judicial system to those it is meant to serve. I give notice that I will shortly be introducing a bill to provide for an alteration to the constitution to enable the making of laws on the initiative and popular request of electors. The Westminster system of parliamentary democracy is under a great deal of questioning, scrutiny and threat. We have a system that has evolved over a long period of time. Because Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4823 of this imbalance between the power of the executive and the power of the parliament, we are seeing, in essence, an executive dictatorship in this country, not what was originally envisaged-parliamentary democracy. The system needs to be changed. It needs to be changed to be more accountable to the people. It must be more accountable to the people through the processes of the parliament and, of course, through the diligence and efforts of the individual members representing their constituents. (Time expired) families, business, industry and youth are heading in the right direction, after an abysmal betrayal of their future by the previous Labor government. I rise to speak on this Appropriation Bill (No.1). Debt and deficit were all we were passing on to our future generations after 13 years of fiscal irresponsibility. The Australian community were led down the yellow brick road by a pied piper who cajoled everyone into believing his tune was the only beat to move to. The Australian taxpaying public were in for a big surprise when the Treasury books were opened to reveal what we all know now: not just the devastating $7 billion deficit that we found initially upon gaining government, but a disastrous final figure of $10 billion. We did not create the problem, but we will fix it. This is the whole purpose of the measures taken by Treasury to restore the economy to surplus. This will not happen without the measures outlined by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) in the budget documents for 1996-97. The legacy of previous Labor budgets, of their failure to cut government spending and their reliance on high interest rates, undermined Australian families and businesses. Under Labor, home mortgage rates hit 17 per cent. Interest rates went up nearly three per cent between August and December 1994. Family household debt rose to over $200 million. The current account deficit reached nearly $2.7 billion in May 1995, the worse figure ever since the statistics began to be collected. Under Labor, nearly one million Australians were out of work. Under Labor, Working Nation, the greatest failure, cost the Australian taxpayer $3.5 billion. What a waste on labour market programs. Previous budgets increased wholesale sales taxes by two per cent, from 20 to 22 per cent; increased petrol tax; increased excise on tobacco by 15 per cent; reduced the growth of defence spending; changed HECS so repayments commenced earlier and at higher rates; realigned HECS with income tax arrangements so repayments reflected the proportion of the year in which those with HECS obligations earned above the repayment threshold; increased the Medicare levy by 0.1 per cent, to 1.5 per cent; increased tax on motor vehicles by six per cent, from 15 per cent to 22 per cent; increased company tax from 33 to 36 per cent; increased PAYE tax payments to bi-monthly for small businesses-and the list goes on. On2 March, Australians reassessed their priorities. On2 March, Australians had had enough. On 20 August, the new government outlined the new direction for fiscal responsibility. For families, business, older Australians and those in genuine need, the 20 August budget met our core commitments. The family tax initiative means that a family with two dependent children, earning less than $70,000 per year and taking out private health insurance, will get a tax break of $51.90 per fortnight. That is $450 a year. These measures will have a positive effect on the constituents in my electorate of Bowman. In fact, one such family, the Mauds, were quoted in my local paper as saying: It's terriiic. We weren't expecting any family assistance. We didn't think the country could afford it. They went on to say that, while a $17 a week tax rebate on their health insurance costs did not sound like much, it would certainly help. They said:",123,Representatives Main Commitiee
334,Mrs West (Bowman) (11.40 A.m.),"The mediumto long-term prospects for Australian4824 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 It'll make it a lot more comfortable. The paper pointed out that the Mauds arc typical of the type of family in the Bowman electorate. But in my electorate it is not just families who will reap benefits from this budget. The small business sector have expressed their satisfaction with the measures announced, in particular the move to reduce the deficit which has resulted in a reduction to interest rates. Business is understandably wary of claims made by politicians, and why would it not be? For 13 years business has suffered from the broken promises and inept administration of the Labor Party. Business, particularly the small to medium business sectors, was the punching bag of the former Labor administration. 'We need more money? Let's tax business,' seemed to be the creed of the former Lahor government. One of my small businessmen. who was struggling, has described the impact of the previous government on business as a severe bruising. The bruising that business received was in the form of taxation, duplication, employee related issues. licences and complexity. So it is little wonder business is still wary of governments and politicians. It is the job of this government to regain the trust and confidence of business, and we have already begun Lhe process. These businesses can rest assured that the deregulation task force set up by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs( Mr Prosser) is addressing the concerns of small business in putting priorities in a less time consuming way. As I mentioned earlier, interest rates arc on the way down, with the most recent drop bringing the rate on variable loans down from 11.25 per cent to 10.75 per cent. This translates to a total saving of up to $2,500 a year for small business with a variable rate loan. This also represents 40 per cent of all small business loans. To this effect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have decided to conduct a forum in my electorate to bring together all the interested parties that are going to deal with the future business in Bowman. It is called a business forum and we are looking at addressing the needs of business. We will bring government members and government advisers together to listen to small business and hopefully promote a strategic plan to address the problems in the area. The new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme will also assist business with employers being eligible for a commencement payment of $1,250 for each apprentice or trainee, a $1,250 progress payment and a bonus for each one taken on above the previous year's intake. Obviously this measure will not only benefit the small to medium enterprises but also benefit the unemployed. The government will spend $207 million over the next four years on the new apprenticeship scheme. That means real jobs for the unemployed, not the never ending training programs that were designed for one purpose: to keep these unemployed off the unemployed numbers list. The former administration spent over $3.5 million on labour market programs that did not work. In fact, two-thirds of the long-term unemployed are still unemployed after going through a Working Nation program. In direct contrast the coalition government will get these people back to work in jobs that last longer than the length of their course. We will be encouraging the skillshare organisations to move with us and restructure to cope with the changing needs of the Australian people. On a recent trip to Queensland the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) and his entourage of hasbeens and wannabes tried to make political mileage by visiting one of my skillshares. His efforts went largely unrewarded as he was forced to admit that the skillshare he visited would survive. I have commended this skillshare for their ingenuity, their responsibility and their accountability. I endorse their management practices and I have encouraged them to continue. Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4825 Further to this, the manager of this skillshare was quoted in the local paper as saying his organisation was putting a positive light on the changes and would adapt to them. This goes to show how out of touch with the electorate the Leader of the Opposition is and why the coalition is in government and he is in opposition. The Labor Party has obviously learnt nothing from the lessons handed to them by the Australian people on 2 March. At the other end of the spectrum, the government has recognised the significant contribution the elderly have made to the development of this nation and has introduced measures to assist these people enjoy their retirement years. One such couple from my electorate were quoted in the Courier-Mail as saying, 'The 1996-97 federal budget was one of the most encouraging ever for senior citizens.' Bill Clarke, who is the spokesperson for the National Seniors Association, and who is a constituent of mine, went on to say that it was a sensible budget that tries to overcome previous budget shortcomings and Australia's senior citizens have fared extremely well. The raising of the tax-free threshold for self-funded retirees to $11,185 has been well received in my electorate as has the initiative which allows seniors to contribute to a superannuation scheme up to the age of 70. This flies in the face of the scaremongering of the opposition, which is targeting the pensioners of Australia because they are seen as an easy target. The opposition is continuing its attack on the introduction of a voluntary entry contribution fee for nursing homes. I say 'voluntary' because that is exactly what it is-a voluntary fee which will be paid by those who can, not as the opposition would have us believe a flat $26,000 fee on all people who enter a nursing home. I have had a number of calls to my electorate office from pensioners who were worried that they would have to sell their family home should they wish to go into a nursing home. Fortunately, I have been able to ease their anxiety by explaining that the contribution does not apply to those on a full pension, and nursing homes can in no way force someone to pay. These people deserve better than the treatment being handed out by the opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tum my attention now to the environment-a subject which is very dear to my heart. My electorate of Bowman includes the magnificent Moreton Bay. The bay is one of the most significant breeding grounds for a large variety of marine animals, and it must be protected at all costs. It is also a great tourist destination. The government has provided funding to the tune of $1.8 million for research into aquaculture in my electorate. The projects that will be conducted by the Cleveland division of the CSIRO will provide the fishing industry with vital information on fish stocks and the replacement rate of the stock. At the same time, we need to be looking at the pollution of the bay. The government's proposed coasts and clean seas initiative is aimed at doing just this-keeping the bay clean. However, this will not be achieved without the partial sale of Telstra, which would allow the government to implement the most impressive and important piece of environmental legislation ever proposed-the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the Treasurer and all ministers for their combined efforts in restructuring the fiscal directions of this country. I believe we are on the road to recovery, with very responsible and accountable strategies put in place by our very able executive. We look forward to a brighter future once we realise that we all have a part to play in making these policies work. 4826 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 We were left in a desperate situation that needed addressing, and we will not back away from our commitment to address the economic mismanagement of the past 13 years. I am pleased to lend my strong support to the measures outlined in the budget documents of 1996. member for Bowman( Mrs West) because, as I have said to a number of her colleagues previously, they have a lot to learn in this place. Whilst they may genuinely believe the words that are being handed to them by their leadership, they are going to get one hell of a rude shock a little bit further down the path as we go forward. This budget is a budget of betrayal. It betrays the promises made to Australians in the run-up to the election. I will cover some of those promises a little later. It is a budget of deceit, because it is a budget that is presented in a manner that is designed to conceal the true impact of the budget, not to reveal it. It goes down in history as the first budget that anyone can recall which has been presented in this fashion. There will be a lot of examination of this budget to be done in time to come. I would refer those who doubt that to Hansard of 10 September' 1996, at page P3814, where my colleague the former Treasurer and member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) said that the budget outcome, as reported by the now Treasurer ( Mr Costello) for the past year, was a deficit of $10.3 billion. He went on to say: If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. Those figures are not the budget outcome at all. The actual budget outcome for 1995-96 was a deficit of $5.045 million; that is, about half the figure given by the Treasurer. The forecast actual budget outcome for 1996-97 is not a deficit at all. It is a surplus of $464 million, which is forecast to grow to a surplus of $6,638 million in 1997-98. But these figures, of course, are not mentioned by the Treasurer in his speech because they would not fit in with his fiscal crisis rhetoric. I strongly recommend that members look through the speech on this issue delivered by the member for Gellibrand in the main chamber. I recommend particularly that our colleagues opposite do that, because they are hearing for the first time what this is all about, and they will see how they and the Australian public have been deceived. I do not have to say that to the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles). He is wiser and more knowledgeable; he knows it deep down; he can count, he can read and he can analyse. But he has to go with the party line at the moment. This is also a budget of broken promises. As I have said, it has been presented in a form designed to conceal the attacks it has made on major sections of our population. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first budget in Australia that has been based not on principles of sound economic management but on polls and surveys. It is a poll-driven budget that will harm specific sections of our community. This government has made decisions, based on surveys and polls, where it believes there are no votes to be lost. In fact, there may even be, in the current climate, some votes to be gained. Those attacks are aimed at people looking for work, and their families. Running through this first Howard-Costello budget is the same theme as ran through the Fraser-Howard budgets, budget after budget. I read all of their budget speeches last evening, just checking. They show the same old thing: people are unemployed because they want to be unemployed. The rhetoric that is in this budget is little different from the rhetoric back in the Howard budget speeches and all of the debates back in those periods of the Fraser-Howard government.

335,Mr Peter Morris (Shortland) (11.53 A.m.),"I have some sympathy for the honourableThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4827 goes back to the same old thing: people who are unemployed are unemployed because they want to be unemployed. That is the most shameful approach to be taken in this country if we are talking about pulling this country together. There are people who will always have more difficulty in gaining employment than other people. There will always be people in the queue who have greater skills, better abilities and better training than others. Looking at the employment policies of this government, I find that what they are about is contained in the budget papers in the scrapping of the CES and the designing of a scheme of contracting out to the private sector the placement of people in jobs. Who will the private sector take? As we know from experience, they will take those who have the best prospects of getting placed. Who do they not take? Who are left on the scrap heap? The people who have greater difficulty. It is not their fault. That is one part of the problem. The other part of the problem is the economy. Looking at all of this budget and all of the projections, I find that it says-it is a wonderful objective, in their terms-that there will be no growth in employment. I will put it round the other way: there will be no decrease in the unemployment rate. So all of the prospects they are offering, all of the offers they are making and all of these changes are really about finding a way to cost or provide for their election promises, on the one hand, and concealing the fact that they really do not have a policy or a program that is going to reduce unemployment on the other. Let us move from people who are looking for work to immigrants. That is coming forward in speeches coming from other members of this House. That is another issue the government is dealing with. That can lay fair and square right across their shoulders. It will come back to haunt them later on. This is divisiveness. This is setting Australians against Australians. Like it or not-and you might not like it, on the other side of this committee-ours is a multicultural society. It is a nation drawn from many different cultures that have lived in harmony, worked in harmony and progressed this country. This country has benefited from their presence and their contributions. A number of us in this committee at the moment come from differing backgrounds. What this budget is about and what this government is about is dividing those groups. Let there be no mistake about this. The other group that comes from the poll surveys is that of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Let this also rest on the shoulders of government members opposite, both in the committee and in the chamber. You will wear the acrimony for this later. It is clearly in your budget, in the measures you have taken and in the language used prior to and since the election. The one that really worries me is the attack upon sick, aged Australians. The other attack is upon working women. But in respect of sick, aged Australians, why is it that, out of the blue, a program like the Commonwealth dental health program, for which organisations campaigned literally for years, is abolished? Almost half a million Australians utilised that program in the last financial year. In my own electorate of Shortland, in the Hunter region and in the Central Coast region which my electorate embraces, over 7,000 people used that program last year and benefited from it. Why is it suddenly abolished? Again, it is an attack on the aged. They think, There is not going be much response there. They will not be a worry. We have got avery, very big margin and we can wear any response that might come from that. ' 4828 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 But then it goes to the next step-the increase in the pharmaceutical benefits charge with no corresponding increase in the allowance for people with health cards. Why is it? It is the same target. Then the next step is an entry fee to get into a nursing home. So if you have got bad teeth, and you are aged, bad luck. You are going to pay. If you need medicines, you are going to pay. But when you get to the worse stage, when you really need to be in a nursing home, then you pay up or you do not get the treatment. And don't let's have any of this fussing around the edges and saying, 'Oh yes, but the nursing home does not have to demand the contribution.' If you are getting the full rate pension, if you are on a base rate pensionAdelaide interjects. You will not get in. colleague; you can't run away from your own actions. These are your actions. Why are you attacking aged Australians like this? But, worse, why are you attacking sick, aged Australians? Why are you doing this? This illustrates the callousness, the ruthlessness of a government that is really out of control. You target a group like this-aged, ill Australians-but then you say, 'Oh yes, they could dispose of their property.' The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) said, 'Well they could sell the property.' Have you thought about what is involved? It means somebody who is ill enough to need to be in a nursing home, who is in that condition and that frame of mind, is going to be told, 'You might be ill, you might be sick and you might need to be placed in a nursing home, but you are certainly fit enough to go out and negotiate the sale of your property.' The inhumanity and ruthlessness of that is something I have never seen beforenever even contemplated. But you can add to that the Medicare offices. They have this wonderful idea of Medicare offices. 'We'll close down the Medicare offices that are functioning efficiently' -I have the Belmont Medicare office in my electorate scheduled for closure-'and people will be able to go into selected pharmacies.' Not all pharmacies-these are yet unnamed pharmacies. In the budget documents it says people will be able to go in and lodge a fax. Have you thought of the retired person who has not yet gone to a nursing home, who needs medication and has been to the doctor? That person goes across to the pharmacist and has to make a claim to Medicare because they have had insurance-and this is the insurance that the government wants them to have. They have to be fit enough to operate a new piece of technology-and if they don't know, learn how to do it-and then get a credit made to their bank account, go down to one of the supermarkets and key in the amount they want to withdraw. Just think about the impracticality of that and the burden that imposes upon people in that age group. As members, each of us knows that even the receipt of a form with the Commonwealth crest on it often terrifies and confuses people who are retired. They find it so difficult just to even get a letter, let alone face the set-up involved in this kind of scheme. So, as I said, the way this budget is being put forward it is an attack on sick, aged Australians. It is an attack on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is an attack on immigrants. It is an attack on people looking for work. And it is an attack on the families of each of those groups.",128,Representatives Main Committee

You can't run away, my dearThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4829 When we come to working women and the changes to child care, this is based upon a belief of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) that we should tum back to what he sees as the traditional family: father, mother and two children, and one income-and mother is home in the kitchen looking after the children. And, in those circumstances, if they make the cost of child care greater that might discourage people from going to work and might force women back into the kitchen and back into the household. I want to say to him: that is not going to happen. The world has moved on since those days. But the change to child-care arrangements and the increased charges that will flow from them will impact upon those families. So it is an attack upon them. During the election campaign, the Howard-Fischer Liberal and National parties promised fairness and hope to all. But their first budget offers no prospect of increased employment. As I have said, it deliberately attacks sections of our community. Worse still, members of trade unions and their families are reviled almost as demons. That comes thwugh repeatedly in the House; one hears it. The unemployed are to be punished as if they are responsible for the insufficiency of available jobs. No government in history has presented such a litany of broken promises in their first budget as has this government. But then, the Prime Minister is the same man who, as Treasurer, promised a fistful of dollars in tax rebates at the 1977 election, only to withdraw them several weeks after winning the election. That action earned him the everlasting title of 'Honest John', a title he retains today. What we have before us is a pea and thimble budget: it appears to give tax benefits to some, but then takes them back, and adds some charges through other means. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gareth Evans) in his second reading speech detailed the example of a two-income family with two children under five years of age, the mother earning $22,000 per annum and the father earning $47,000 per annum, with children in community-based child care for 50 hours per week and no private health insurance. The result of the budget will be that such a family gets $7.70 per week from the proposed tax cuts, but is $38.55 per week worse off as a result of increased child-care costs arising from the government's decision to withdraw the operational subsidy, estimated at $21 per week per child. When we look back at the attack on families, this government mouths all the language about families and incorporates the words 'families' and 'family' wherever it can into its speeches, but the reality of its policies as they are implemented is to attack families and sectionally impact to the detriment of families. I tum now to regions and the abandonment of the regional development policy and how that will impact upon regional Australia. Anybody who has a knowledge of country Australia and has heard the reactions coming from there will understand how fierce has been the response against that decision of the government. Linked also to that is the cut in road funding, which is a substantial cut in funds from the Federal government and a reduction in its effort, and that is going to impact upon regional Australia. I want to say something in respect of Newcastle Airport. Newcastle Airport is a project which we put forward and which came oUl of the federal Labor task force for the Hunter. Funding was provided by the previous government-some $2.75 million-for the civil facilities to be upgraded and transferred across to the control, on lease, of Port Stephens Shire Council and Newcastle City Council. As the one who led that task force and led the whole project, I am very proud that we have done that, because it could not happen under this government. It happened under the Labor government. 4830 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 That essential piece of infrastructure has now placed Newcastle Airport Ltd in the position where it is the prime construct site for the lead-in fighter project that is coming up for decision later in the year. And not only that: that airport is now developing as a regional hub airport, with direct services into Brisbane and, hopefully, into Melbourne. That is an example of judicious federal investment in regions providing the link and the base to generate other activity and the growth and diversification of opportunity and employment in a region-the very action that this government has turned its back on. I tum now to the impact in the regions of the cancellation of the employment project works programs and the reduction in training programs. It is in the regions of Australia that the unemployment rate is several per cent higher than in the metropolitan areas. It is in the regions of Australia that it is always more difficult to find jobs. There is not the spread of industry and there is not the spread of opportunities, so we always do it harder-whether it is in Port Kembla, Wollongong and Illawarra, or in the Latrobe Valley and Geelong, or in the Hunter and other parts of Australia. Those training programs are much abused and ridiculed by members of the government, but those members don't seem to realise that trying to update one's skills--even if it does not place people in employment-does an enormous amount to lift the esteem of the people involved, and to lift the esteem, feelings and attitude of their families. Try to give them current skills and to increase their opportunity. No-one is stupid: they know that there are 800,000 people unemployed, but not 800,000 vacancies. If there were, it would be easy. Their opportunity is going to come from a growing economy, but that has to come from the diversification of regional economies-the very issue that this government has turned its back upon. On the Central Coast and Lake Macquarie, those programs have been supplemented by the work of the skillshare organisations. Toukley skillshare on the Central Coast has played a very, very important role and is sourced out of Wyong but funded by the former Labor government. They have done a tremendous amount of work in helping people who have a lesser chance of getting a job, who are always more difficult to place. It has done a wonderful job in helping those people get skills and some of them to get into work and regain the dignity and independence of having income from employment. Similarly with Eastlakes skillshare, they have done a very, very good job. The winding down of the skillshare organisation is really a political decision by the government. It is not a decision based upon helping people obtain skills to improve their chances of getting work. It is all very well for some of those members opposite to say, 'But how many of them get placed?'. The reality is they know and we know that there is no 'tum the key solution' that suddenly provides hundreds of thousands of employment opportunities for them. The other matter that comes forward is in respect of tourism. There was a launch at the beginning of this week by David Simmons, the former federal minister for tourism in the Labor government, of a campaign by the Hunter region tourism organisation which is being funded under a program approved by the previous Labor government. Small business has been gravely deceived by this government and regional Australia has been deceived about the impact of the attack upon the ABC. The ABC is a vital communications service to regional Australia. For those who are in the regions the major way of getting out news to the rest of Australia and to the world of what we do, what we are good at and how we succeed is through the ABC regional news services. Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4831 Obviously, if the government has its way they are going to suffer. So will the regional infrastructure through the various programs that will not be provided as would have been provided under our government. In my own case, the Lake Macquarie City Council, which would have received almost $2 million, and received almost $2 million last year, will miss out. (Time expired) of the member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris), but certainly I have enjoyed what I have heard since I arrived here in the chamber. I would like to tackle him on every point that he actually raised. In fact, his speech was very similar to every speech that has been made by opposition members in this particular debate. The point is that they are finding it very difficult, in the end, to be critical of a budget which has obviously been broadly accepted and applauded by the vast majority of Australians. I understand the difficulty that opposition members must have. They are, after all, largely irrelevant; they have been sidelined. They were sidelined in an overwhelming fashion by the Australian electorate on 2 March. Like the shadow Treasurer, they are suffering. I am not quite sure what disease it is, but it is something like relevance deprivation syndrome. I think the member for Shortland's speech here today just indicated the pain that he is experiencing from that, particularly as the member was a member of the Labor government for the whole 13 years. He, as much as anybody, is responsible for the mess that Australia is now in-the mess that we were elected to fix up after 2 March. member for Shortland made first. He talks about unemployment. No member of the Labor party can come into this parliament and talk with any credibility at all about the problem of unemployment-no credibility whatsoever! They, as we remind them day after day, are responsible for the unemployment problem we have today. They presided over a regime that created unemployment, on the former Prime Minister's own admission. They created unemployment and, through their economic policies, the 'recession we had to have'. Are they not immortal words from our former leader? The recession we had to have threw hundreds of thousands of Australians on to the scrap heap of unemployment. SoI will not come into this chamber or, indeed, the other chamber and be lectured by Labor Party members about the problem of unemployment. They created, and they have left us with, a huge problem. The member for Shortland attempts to defend the former government's solutions to unemployment. He is obviously an advocate of training programs. He makes the point that people are better off in training and it is good for their self-esteem. But the point that we have made, and the point that we have proved, is that it was not good for their self-esteem. There was training program after training program. Half or three-quarters of them were mickey mouse programs and were not good for people's self-esteem. I had people coming into my office, day after day, in those dark days of the last few years, with certificate after certificate for training programs that they had been sent off to, predominantly to keep them off the unemployment list for a short period of time, if they were long-term unemployed. Then a cruel hoax was visited on them, when they found themselves, at the end of the training program, no longer long-term unemployed but back on the queue",130,Representatives Main Commitiee

That is why there was no self-esteem involved in those particular programs at all. So the answer to the question of the member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) is that we are solving the unemployment problem at the end it must be solved. There is only one way to solve unemployment and that is to create jobs. We are about creating jobs. understand that. is creating a target. The only thing they can throw back at us these days is, 'If you do not have a target, you are not serious about it.' that you have to be serious about getting the economy moving again. The only way you will get the economy moving again is by getting the private sector working again and getting small business working again. That, ultimately, will be the solution to unemployment. Mr Peter Morris-You're the big end of town, not the small end of town. You're not small business. at the big end of town and they thrived off it. Mr Peter Morris-John Elliot is not in the ALP, you know. sitting down at board room tables and having big nosh-ups with the leaders of industry and the big trade union leaders. They used to love that. I am proud to say that I represent, in this place, the small end of town. My electorate is based on small business. The tourism industry is based on small business. That is what I am here representing. I am proud to say that I have no connections personally-and I do not believe the majority of our party has a connection-with the big end of town in the way the former government did. The Labor Party were the ones that chased the big end of town. Mr Peter Morris-I've got news for you! our position is entirely defensible in respect of that. The solution to unemployment is not an easy one. We do not pretend it is easy. That is a difference between us and the former government, as well. They used to try and give the impression to people that they had all the solutions: 'Here is another program and another bucket of money that we will throw at this particular problem. Here are a few people off the list for a while into a training program or a new work opportunities program.' That was the solution. Well, it turned out not to be. In fact, quite the reverse happened. The situation actually became worse and, at the end of the day, we ended up owing a lot of money. If the former government's systems had worked, they might have solved the problem to some extent and the money we spent on it would have been worthwhile.

351,Mr Bradford,"If former government members want to take us on on that issue, thenThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4833 and the great disappointment were that, having thrown those hundreds of millions of dollars into those programs, that did not work. We were left with a deficit of some $8 billion, as a result, that we had to come up with solutions to. So the money was wasted. It was borrowed and we had a debt problem. the situation here in Australia as it applies today. The fact is that you borrowed money hand over fist. You sold off the family jewels. You did whatever you could to throw money into all of these programs, none of which worked. Our small business policies which were criticised by the member for Shortland are aimed at getting the small business sector working. That is not going to be easy. We do not pretend that it is going to be easy, and that is why we are not going to be sucked into setting some sort of target. The former government was great at setting targets. A former Prime Minister, you remember, said that no child would be living in poverty by 1990. It was one thing after the other. They had this great illusion that somehow targets were the solutions to problems. The fact is that we have acknowledged that unemployment is going to remain high, that there is an awful lot of underemployment in the Australian economy and it is going to remain high in the foreseeable future. There is a lot of underemployment in the Australian economy that has got to be soaked up. There are a lot of people who gave up looking for jobs under the former government and who are now coming back into the system. They can see some light at the end of the tunnel and, of course, the participation rates are increasing. As participating rates increase, obviously it is going to be hard to get that raw unemployment statistic down for all of those reasons. Our policies in respect of the small business sector are aimed at creating the right climate for business-and that did not exist before. Our fundamental labour market refonns which this opposition, joined by the Democrats, is committed to opposing in the Senate, and the tax and regulatory refonns are all policies announced in the budget, and they are in the process of being put into place. In fact, a large number have been put into place. But the problem is a big one and it is going to be very difficult to solve and it is going to take time to solve. In the end we are not under illusions about the solution to unemployment. It has to be the creation of real, full-time and lasting jobs. The utter tripe that we heard trotted out by the former government so often about the number of jobs they created! They used to come into the parliament and say, 'We have created 300,000 jobs this month,' or some other ridiculous figures. When you got down to the fine print-and it was a matter with the former government of getting down to the fine print, getting behind the rhetoric, the exaggeration and the hyperbole-you found that most of these jobs were part-time jobs, even as little as one hour a week, or transitory jobs. They were six-month jobs for people who had been brought into one of these great programs and who would end up going out at the other end back onto the unemployed list. The end result was that over all that period of time very few full-time, lasting jobs were actually created. So we are getting on with the job of fundamentally refonning the Australian economy. The former government, to its credit, went down that track and did a lot of the right things. But they stopped short, particularly in the area of industrial relations, of making the refonns that were absolutely essential if the Australian economy were to thrive. They took some of the",134,Representatives Main Commitiee
352,Mr Sawford,Third lowest deficit in the world!,135,Representatnes Main Committee
353,Mr Bradford,"You can twist those statistics as much as you like. We are talking about4834 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 tough decisions. They recognised that we had to find our way in the real world, that we could not hide behind high tariff barriers, and that we could not regulate a financial system in the world economy as it exists today. They took some of those decisions. But, in the end, they stopped short. We intend to carry the process on to its logical conclusion. Our industrial relations reforms are obviously an integral part of reaching that conclusion. The member for Shortland, once again, fell into the trap of trotting out the rhetoric that we have heard from opposition speaker after opposition speaker here in his criticism of our nursing home policies. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a lot of nursing homes in my electorate and, I think, the oldest demographic group in the country. SoI am very close to what is happening in that area. I believe that the end result of our reform of nursing homes will be overwhelmingly positive for older people. It is a disappointment to me and to many others that the opposition has perhaps seen a little bit of an opportunity here to criticise an element of that policy. But, in the end, what they have done, and what they set about doing, is to frighten older people into believing that there is something draconian or something inherently unfair about this policy. What they have done is to misrepresent and distort that policy. They have seen just a glimmer of an opportunity to do that, and they have jumped right in. When I have been putting people in the picture about that policy, I have been able to defend it entirely, because it is defensible. The end line of that policy-the former government would not take the step-is that we will have better quality aged care. What could be more desirable than that? What could be fairer than the underlying principle here, which was always subscribed to by the former government, that people who can afford to pay for this--or anything else, if it comes to that-should be required to do so? That is the essential element of this particular policy. It extends to nursing homes the principle that the former government introduced in respect of hostels. It means that people who can afford to make a relatively small contribution will be asked to do so. There is nothing unreasonable about that. Mr Deputy Speaker, the unfairness of the opposition's misrepresentation is that they thought, 'We will jump in and attempt to frighten as many old people as possible into believing that somehow there will no longer be a nursing home place for them, unless they either have the money or sell the family home.' But neither of those criticisms is true. We have made the point over and over again, although opposition members do not want to hear it, that people will not be required to sell the family home to move into a nursing home and people who cannot afford to pay will simply not have to pay. The principle of that is sound, and it is a principle that the former government always accepted. This has been one of only a couple of very small windows of opportunity for criticism in this budget, and the opposition has jumped on it in an attempt not to make a small opening in the window, but to throw it wide open and make people think that there is actually something draconian about this policy. I am happy to stand up here, as I have stood up in my own electorate-which, demographically, is this group-and say to those people that our policy means better aged care. Not only that; it will also address the other fundamental problem that we had with the former government, and that was a chronic shortage of nursing home beds. In my electorate, there are people who cannot get into nursing homes. There are people moving from one respite situation to another, at a very critical stage of their life, who cannot find a permanent nursing home bed. The former government did nothing to address that problem. Everything was wrong with the current system, especially the funding complexities. Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4835 We have attempted to reform that area, and I believe that we have been very successful in doing so. So, I take considerable issue with the member for Shortland for attempting to jump on that particular bandwagon. I make the point to him and to the chamber that our nursing home policy has an overwhelmingly positive end to it as far as that particular sector is concerned. The member for Shortland went a little further down the track in trying to frighten my constituents, the older demographic group, about access to Medicare offices. Once again, he failed, in terms of recognising the fact that access to a Medicare office has been and is a problem. I have got two Medicare offices servicing my electorate, one at the southern end and one at the northern end, and nothing between them. I had constant complaints from people who could not get access to Medicare offices. Our solution to that, which is a practical and sensible solution, is to provide additional facilities where people can have access to Medicare offices. There is no suggestion in that-the member for Shortland tried to say that there was that this will somehow make it difficult for older people. For a start, most of my aged constituents do not even go to a Medicare office. They do not even need to go. They go to a doctor, where their needs are taken care of, and they are bulk-billed for that service. We have indicated that that will continue. But for people who do need access to Medicare offices, for all sorts of reasons, we will increase the availability of that service. Nothing the member for Shortland said and nothing any member of the opposition can say about that can deny that fact. They can try and frighten as many people as they like, particularly older people, into somehow thinking that this is a major backdown on some aspect of health care policy. In fact it is again an improvement in the status quo and I applaud that policy. My electorate welcomes that policy overwhelmingly and fortunately most of the people in my electorate understand what the benefits of that additional access to Medicare facilities represent for them. The coup de grace, if you like, for the member for Shortland, from my perspective, is that he wants to get into the area of family policy. This a matter that is on the agenda in the main chamber today and it is a debate that I am looking forward to participating in very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. If there is one policy area that I have taken an interest in here, amongst a number of others I suppose, it is certainly the area of family policy. I stand here today in this chamber as I will in the main chamber later, very proud of the commitment of this government, as the budget indicated and underlined, to Australia's families. Australia's families were forgotten by the former government. The former government was diverted into all sorts of appeasement of minority groups and a whole range of activities, but in the end they forgot about the traditional Australian nuclear family which after all is the fundamental unit of our society. I believe that was a fundamentally important reason why the former government was defeated at the last election. It had simply forgotten the mainstream. It had forgotten the important part that families play. The member for Shortland attempted to criticise the new policy direction that we have now introduced. Underlying that policy-and he was particularly critical of the implications for child care-was our commitment to providing choice for Australian families. Australian families said on 2 March they were sick of the government telling them how to run their lives. Our policies are aimed at giving families choice-choice in child care, choice about whether both parents go out to work-and an end to conscription for mothers who overwhelmingly indicated they would prefer to stay at home and look after their children. 4836 MAIN COMMI1TEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 I dispute everything that the member for Shortland has said about what has been an excellent first Howard government budget. economic rationalists and nobody would seriously urge a return to economic irrationalism. In the 1970s a global economy developed, breaking down traditional trade barriers and the goal of national self-sufficiency. Economics rose and rose as the dominant intellectual paradigm and driving force in politics and administration. In the 1970s and 1980s economics became overwhelmingly dominant in government thinking in the West and human activity was measured by its ability to meet 'the bottom line.' It also contributed to a top down political model in which major parties competed with each other to show their toughness in making essentially short-term economic decisions, despite evidence that voters were seriously alienated. This has led to a loss of confidence in the legitimacy of governments, even democratically elected ones-a profoundly worrying phenomenon. The 1996-97 Costello budget illustrates, in a crassly triumphalist way, 20 major fallacies, and I appeal to Hansard to print my speech in the format as I set it out, including the inverted commas. The 20 fallacies: 1. 'That economics is a destination not just a vehicle.' 2. 'That economic values are more important than political or social ones.' 3. 'That the urgent must have priority over the important.' 4. 'That precisely quantifiable economic targets can be set.' 5. 'That Treasury has a wonderful track record in forecasting.' I listened to many maiden speeches by members elected on 2 March with their heavy emphasis on family values and wondered how far they realised those values were undermined, not reinforced, by the dogmas of economic rationalism. The idea that every value has a dollar equivalent is repellent but inescapable, especially in sport, but it applies increasingly in education and health too. With a gross domestic product of almost $500 biIlion, the highest OECD growth rate, the third lowest debt to GDP ratio in the OECD and a high degree of social stability, the battle cry of 'Woe to the vanquished' and frenzied pursuit of the arbitrary, largely mythical, 'black hole' is extraordinarily misplaced. As the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has conceded when overseas, he inherited an economy in very good shape. The rhetoric of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) is quite contrary. Treasurers, on both sides of politics, can become obsessed with targets expressed in absolute numbers, rather than a range of figures, plus or minus, say, 2 per cent. It then becomes a demonstration of masculinity to be able to reach the magic, if arbitrary, goal. The amount of damage caused, for example, to long-term activity such as education, research or culture is quite out of proportion to the actual sums saved in short-term cuts. It might seem self-evident that a five per cent cut across the board for, say, CSIRO or the ABC, will lead only to a five per cent reduction in activity. But it does not work like that. Most budget allocations are locked up in salaries and other inescapable outgoings. A five per cent overall cut to an agency will have a devastating impact on discretionary funding-that is, the amounts not actually locked up. Having to meet a five per cent target will often mean",135,Representatnes Main Committee
354,Mr Barry Jones (Lalor) (12.34 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, in a sense we are allThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4837 the difference between viability and non-viability, a point very well made by Dickens's Mr Micawber. An efficiency dividend might seem appropriate where applied to some areas where the range of activity is finite-for example, processing Medicare accounts or taxation transactions-but mindless when applied, say, to the acquisition of books for the National Library or setting goals for research into radio astronomy. What does it mean: 'Last year you measured 1,000 stars; this year cut it down to 970'? A research project can be destroyed with the slash of a Finance bureaucrat's word processor. It may never be restored. Short-term factors dominate. The much publicised '$8 billion black hole' is a completely arbitrary figure, relying on the assumption that the Treasury forecasts are infallible. Note that the government insists on setting absolute numbers in the budget, aimed as it is at discrediting the Hawke-Keating government, but refuses-rightly, I think-to do it in unemployment where it would be the victim if the magic target was not met. Even if the $8 billion figure were correct, it could be covered in a variety of ways: one, cutting expenditure; two, raising revenue by a small adjustment to the tax rate; or three, a judicious mixture of one and two. The Treasurer's choice is to slash and bum. For example, eliminating the dental program for the aged was harsh to the victims but saved only $400 million to the revenue over a fouryear period. The Treasury does not have a wonderful record in forecasting and has been wrong in predicting growth rates and interest rates. It gave spectacularly bad advice on interest rates during the recession of 1990-91. 6. 'That Australia is a highly taxed country.' In 1993, of total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP at market prices, of 24 OECD countries Australia ranked second lowest at 28.7 per cent. Only Turkey was lower, at 23.5 per cent. Japan was at 29.1 per cent and the US at 29.7 per cent. The OECD average was 38.7 per cent. 7. 'That Australia has an unduly large public sector.' One might expect that in a huge country with a federal system there would be a very large public sector and some degrees of duplication. In OECD's National Accounts 1996, in a table setting out current general government revenue as a percentage of GDP, Australia ranked as one of the three lowest: US, 31.7 per cent; Japan, 32.9 per cent; Australia, 33.5 per cent. Canada, with which Australia has much in common-a large country with a federal system-stands at 33.5 per cent. Government employment as a percentage of total employment is also relatively low: 16.6 per cent. Some nations, curiously, have higher government expenditure but lower employment: Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland. The US figure is 14.5 per cent-far below us-and Japan's is an unusually low 5.9 per cent. 8. 'That foreign debt is largely due to government borrowing.' Deregulation of the financial market after 1983 led to a winding down of controls on private borrowing and has been the largest single factor in increasing foreign debt. Incidentally, Australia has the third lowest public debt in the OECD. Of foreign borrowing-that is, gross debt-the Commonwealth government, plus the Reserve Bank, accounts for 15.3 per cent of the total. State governments are responsible for 17.8 per cent. Borrowing by public enterprises such as Telstra amounts to 6.1 per cent. Private sector borrowings amount to 59 per cent. With net foreign debt, the private sector accounts for 63 per cent. 9. 'That interest rates are ""current account deficit driven"".' This was stated as an absolute statement of fact by the Prime Minister in question time last week. The Parliamentary Library can find no evidence to support this. Despite variations in overseas ratings by Moody's and 4838 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 Standard and Poors, all Australian governments have 'an immaculate record' in repaying, and this is the major factor for long term investors. Short term interest rates are set by the Reserve Bank. 10. 'That Australia's employment levels fell under Labor.' There was an employment revolution which began under Fraser, continuing under Hawke, Keating, and now Howard-a dual labour market with the paradox of high levels of unemployment and high levels of employment as well. It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it is absolutely correct. What it means is that many people, for example, unskilled males who traditionally were in the labour force are now no longer in it and a number of people who traditionally were not in the paid labour force, particularly women, are now in it. So the result is that, in terms of the participation rate, we are at an historic high and we have the phenomenon-we are not Robinson Crusoe in this; it is shared with most countries of the OECD-of having high unemployment and high employment at the same time. But, with the dual labour market, it means that different sectors are involved in different ways. II. 'That cutting government expenditure will free up the economy and lead to job creation.' 12. 'That freeing up small business will generate many more jobs.' 13. 'That productivity can be increased without job loss.' There is absolutely no empirical evidence to support the last three points. This is, as Martin Luther might have said, 'justification by faith alone'. Productivity, of course, we see as being an OK word-everyone wants productivity. But productivity simply means the ratio between output and the number of people employed. In other words, if with higher productivity there must be job loss relative to output. That is what it means. 14. 'That there could be no gain without pain.' Wage cutting, and confusing flexibility with instability, will not produce a stronger economy. Countries with higher wage rates than Australia-for example, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Japan-are far more competitive internationally than Australia and have significantly lower unemployment rates than we do. The argument that we could only create jobs if we opened up the el cheapo end of the market is absolutely, totally fallacious. And indeed, to give the government credit, they are not even advancing any evidence. They simply assert it and leave it at that. 15. 'That government enterprises are necessarily less efficient than private.' This is an ideological obsession, quite ill-founded if we compare the record of Qantas versus Ansett, of the Commonwealth Bank versus Westpac, of Telstra versus British or French Telecom. The costs of telephoning London or Paris from Melbourne are far lower than the return call on a privatised system. Logic suggests that if the privatised system is much more efficient, then telephoning Australia from Britain or France should be a good deal cheaper. In fact, as every consumer will tell you, it is very much dearer. That suggests there is something wrong with the proposition. 16. 'That foreign ownership of Australian corporations will have no adverse domestic effects on employment or social policy.' The tragedy, with which all too many members are thoroughly well aware, is that if a corporate decision is made in Detroit, for example, to cut jobs, of course the people who make the decision have no community responsibility because they do not know the people, they do not know the areas, they do not live there, they do not have the social contact. The argument that a whole number of enterprises can simply go offshore and it will not have any social impact is a dangerous delusion. There are many people in the coalition parties who know better, in terms of their own experience as local members, Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4839 but who, because of the way in which the system operates, are not quite in the position to speak out as they should. 17. 'That Australia can only rely on comparative advantage'; that is, David Ricardo's concept of comparative advantage. Our obsession has been that other than raw materials there was no other possible base for our economy. That is, again, a half-truth. Of course, the contribution of the primary sector, of agriculture and mining, is absolutely profound. But if we say, 'That is as far as we need go; nothing more to be said,' that is dangerously short-sighted. Australia's greatest single economic weakness has been our conspicuous failure, over many years, to address what I have called the 'inventory problem'; that is, the lack of high value added brand name goods and services for which there is international recognition and demand, the area of fastest growth in world trade for three decades. We see ourselves as exporters of high volume, low cost exports, and little more. We have utterly failed to grasp the nature of 'competitive advantage' -that it is not just a matter of cost in exports but of value, recognition and reputation. The Republic of Korea-within the next week or so to join the OECD-understands 'competitive advantage'. We do not. They had an economy absolutely in ruins in the mid1950s-nothing to build on at all. So, what they decided was not to pursue comparative advantage, because there was no area of comparative advantage for them, but to pursue competitive advantage-to find niche markets and develop quality products. We can all see the extraordinary intervention in the Australian market of the Hyundai motor car and the tremendous proportion of electronic products from Korea. What are the equivalent products that we are selling Korea? They are all staples-wheat, wool, coal and the basic metals. We export products measured in tonnes; they export to us products measured in grams. There is something wrong with that. I commend to those honourable members who have not already read it-although I know that you are a devotee of it, Mr Deputy Speaker-Michael Porter's great book, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, a textbook that everybody in this parliament should read. 18. 'That it is illegitimate for governments to be making choices' -also known as 'picking winners' 'in priority areas for innovation.' It is true that there may be some slight modification there. 19. 'That winding down R&D expenditure indicates that Government is giving it a higher priority.' It sounds a bit contradictory, and indeed it is. I remember John Elliott saying to me a few years ago, when I was trying to goad CUB into doing more R&D expenditure, 'What sorts of signals are you giving? If you are winding it down in levels of your expenditure and then you are saying to us, ""You ought to be spending more,"" the signal is completely contradictory. If you don't think it is worth putting more money into it, why should weT This was a big defeat for the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and a win for the Treasurer. Cutting back R&D tax concessions from 150 to 125 per cent is estimated to save the revenue $2,247 million between 1996 and 2001. The Treasurer announced 'a flexible package of $340 million over the next four years to encourage highly innovative research and development'. But this involves a shortfall, overall, of nearly $2 billion. So, is it an advance, or is it a retreat? The final fallacy-one that I feel very badly about-is No. 20: 'That CSIRO did well in the budget.' In his budget speech, the Treasurer said: 4840 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 The government will provide an additional $115 million over the next 4 years for CSIRO. That sounds very generous. In fact, it is totally deceptive. With the impact of extra efficiency dividends, and a requirement to repay asset sales, leaving inflation aside, CSIRO can expect to be $10.3 million worse off by the year 1999-2000. So, far from having a $115 million increase, they will be $10.3 million worse off, leaving inflation aside. In other words, what they have said is, 'Look, we'll provide the $115 million, but we will take it back from you. It looks good and we are not going to talk about the fact that the efficiency dividend has been cranked up.' I succeeded, in part, in getting the efficiency dividend wound down. I thought it was bad enough under our government. But it has now been re-imposed, right across the board, at a higher level. If people on the coalition side are not aware of that, they ought to be. They ought to be asking their minister raising it in their party rooms. This is a miserable, mean-spirited budget. It also has the politics wrong, because it is remote from the electorate and will be destructive to community values. The community is far more than a 'market'. The worse kind of bankruptcy is moral bankruptcy. Telling the truth might be a good start. I commend the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I hope honourable members will support it. in a school play. It was the story of the king that had no clothes. It might not be surprising to those present that I was one of the tailors who conned the king into believing that we had made him a beautiful set of clothes at great cost when, of course, he went down the street in public naked. All the people were cheering and commenting on the magnificent clothes, until a very small child said, 'Mummy, the king's got no clothes on.' I make that point because today I would like to address the budget and the concept of how it and some of the contributions that have been made could be described as 'naked'. In the context of this debate, let me start with a statement of fact, which is that too many politicians measure excellence by expenditure. That leads me to the speeches of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the member for Aston( Mr Nugent). The member for Oxley, for instance, called for the closure of ATSIC. The member for Aston, in seeking to rebut the member for Oxley, quoted the acknowledged substandard living conditions of Aboriginal people. Unfortunately, I feel the member for Aston's examples were, in fact, substantial reasons for the disbanding of ATSIC and all the associated bureaucratic structures, such as the Aboriginal legal aid services and the Aboriginal medical services and land councils, that have so obviously failed to address the fundamental problems of the very disadvantaged people in Australia known as our Aboriginal people. While tens of millions of dollars are allocated in this budget to funding white lawyers to lodge land claims, there are many Aboriginal people with glaucoma who can no longer enjoy the beauty of their land. They simply cannot see it. Personally, I acknowledge the good intentions, on behalf of their constituents, of both members. The MP for Oxley, as the representative of an electorate where many white people are suffering low living standards and unemployment, feels that more attention to their problems is required and resents the special allocation to Aboriginals. The member for Aston concerns himself, quite properly, with the deprivation of the Aboriginal people, and wishes to give them help.",138,Representatives Main Committee
355,Mr Tuckey (O'connor) (12.52 P.m.),"I remember, in my childhood days, performingThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4841 I wish to give positive and genuine assistance to both groups, and I am convinced that the current method of service delivery to Aboriginal people is a total failure. Not only is it not helping Aboriginals, but it is consuming large sums of money that might go to other disadvantaged people. In fact, in delivering decentralised, conventional, bureaucratic structures for the Aboriginal people, we have created a typical third-world hierarchy: a small group of very well-off Aboriginals and a poverty-stricken majority. I lack time today to develop this further, but my solution is a complete reversal of Aboriginal funding, from our current top-down funding system, to a bottoms-up system. I refer the parliament to my letter published in the Financial Review on 30 August. In this process I propose the total removal of all the current Aboriginal bureaucratic structures, including the Council for Reconciliation. In this regard, let me say that, if we want evidence of the efficiency of this institution, let me refer you to the community-not the media-reaction to the member for Oxley's public statement. If our pursuit is for reconciliation, why do we support in legislation a native title process that, at every stage, throws interest groups into direct confrontation with one another? In any other area of land management, state government administrations stand as the determinant and thus-if I can use the word-the enemy. At this stage, in my electorate and throughout my state we have Aboriginal in conflict with Aboriginal and Aboriginals in conflict with white people, and nobody is going anywhere. Surely, it is time that we found some clothes that the king might wear. Passing to the broader effect of the budget, let me say that I support its thrust, which is to stop the process of increasing indebtedness of our nation and the burden that that applies to future generations. Put simply, during the term of the previous Labor government, this parliament, using the children of Australia as security, borrowed $70,000 million and sold and consumed the proceeds of approximately $10 billion worth of public assets such as Qantas, CSL and the Commonwealth Bank. WhilstI have had to take these figures out briefly and quickly, it is an interesting fact to note that in 1991-92, when GDP growth was three per cent, the deficit of the government as a percentage of GDP was 2.6-almost the same. In 1992-93, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 3.2-Australia's percentage growth of GDP was 4.2 per cent. The figures for 199394 were 4.3 per cent and four per cent, and I could go on. The next two years we found a somewhat wider gap of just one per cent but, in reality, they were the years when massive asset sales were brought to account to artificially reduce the budget deficit. Whilst my education in economics as a science was limited to my leaving school examination-at the end of my secondary schooling at Perth Modern School-after that I continued my education in the school of business hard knocks. Based on that experience, I must say that turnover growth-that is, Australia's GDP, which is entirely debt and asset-sale driven-is not sustainable growth, particularly when in this case the expenditure involved was almost entirely directed to consumption, rather than to capital works. For years, this country has boasted economic growth which was identical to the amount of money that the government borrowed in that year or which it otherwise accumulated by selling off the farm. With that sort of growth, we have a situation that can only take us backwards. Just briefly, let me look at the budget outlays therefore, by function, to show where the money has gone. In that regard, I want to refer to the massive growth that has occurred, for instance, in the provision of health services under Medicare. In just the life of that proposal, 4842 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 we have seen a growth in outlays from about $3 billion to $19.4 billion. But worse, in terms of investing in the future, in that same time education outlays grew from $4 billion to $11 billion. So we are pouring money into a philosophical issue that never worried us once--called Medicare-and, in the same breath, we are cutting back on education which, surely, is an investment at government level in the future. It is like a business building a new factorysomething that is there forever. This budget reduces the government's expenditure by many billions of dollars and consequently curtails that accumulated debt. However, it also must have a downward effect on GDP growth which, in the national interest, must be filled by the private sector. The previous speaker, the member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones), tried to recreate this myth that government debt does not have an effect on interest rates. But when you have a government pulling $10 billion or $15 billion a year out of domestic interest markets, of course it is having an effect. Furthermore, a lot of that paper, when sold, is bought by overseas interests and contributes to the nation's overseas debt. A number of criteria have to be met or the private sector will not fill this gap which has been created by a reduction in government expenditure. And it is a gap-government has been propping up this economy for 15 years and, as government ceases to do so, somebody else has to fill the gap or, yes, we will have economic decline. I am the first to admit it. But, as I said, the private sector will not fill this gap unless a number of criteria are met. These include the ability for business to hire and fire staff based on the staff's personal performance and the financial circumstances of the business. No-one sacks staff out of spite. That is a myth that has to be exploded. This myth has built up that people have to be protected from businessmen who get up in the morning and say, 'Who can I sack today?' I have talked to businessmen who have cried when they have had to put off staff-and I mean cried-because they did not know whether they could get such good people back when they recovered the financial circumstances of their business. The reality is that business does not hate its staff. It values it, but it has to have staff who perform. In times of economic downturn they have to have the right to put some of them off, and they cannot do that at this huge redundancy price. Their defence is just not to hire. The criteria that have to be met in order for the private sector to fill the gap also include the productivity value of such people based on international comparison. Productivity value does not imply lower wages, but does demand higher productivity per worker than occurs in low wage countries that compete with our industries at home and abroad. It was the previous government that took the decision to deregulate the financial market and lower tariffs, and I support that concept. But you cannot ask business to compete in that environment with a regulated labour market. It is just silly. The new industrial laws that are being proposed by the government are therefore essential. The argument of jobs for jobs' sake is just another king with no clothes. If Telstra employs 20,000 employees it does not need and passes the cost of those employees to industries who must compete with countries around the world, then those industries simply die or never develop. If employing public servants was the answer to unemployment, why not just double the size of the Public Service? We could fix the problem overnight-except that we haven't got the money to pay for it. Nevertheless, this budget is also topless, to say the least, because it fails to reform the Australian tax system. But the fact that it does not cannot be criticised because the governing Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4843 party promised at the last election it would not do so. It is a tragedy, but it was a promise that had to be made at the time. However, if the Australian private sector is to provide the real GDP growth and jobs we require, it is absolutely imperative that this parliament-and I do not say this government or this opposition, I say this parliament-join together to take the lead of the Australian tax system out of the saddlebags of Australian industry. There is not a politician in this place who does not agree that the Australian tax system is a mess and a huge burden to Australian employers. I pointed out last night to the member for Corio( Mr O'Connor), with his huge responsibility to people in the car industry, that $700 to $800 is the cost, as estimated by Australia's Treasury, that feeds into the manufactured cost of every motor car made in Australia, because of the Australian tax system. We blame the workers for their lack of productivity, yet we never blame the Australian tax system, and it is probably the worse of the two. I think that Australian workers have lifted their productivity; the facts are there. But, while we are blaming the workers and denying them jobs, we sit in this place being too smart by half, using the tax system as a political tool when we should be joining together, every one of us, to put down a sensible reform package for each level of government: local, state and federal. I tell you what: we would create many brownie points with the Australian community if, on an area of such national importance, we got together and demonstrated bipartisanship. I think the last person to do it was a Labor person, Mr Curtin, when he invited Bob Menzieswho foolishly, as I remember, declined-to form a government of national interest to defend Australia during the war. Of course we should get together on these sorts of issues. It is too big for political pettiness. The Australian tax system is the worse. Australia is in a tax time warp, and the rest of the world is passing us by. Let me return to my written words and say that we should all be collectively ashamed of ourselves if we cannot join together to establish a workable solution for revenue raising in all three levels of government in our country. There is nothing wrong with, at that time, addressing the difficulties for certain groups of people, the poor and the disadvantaged, of any system. But let us get together and say, 'This is the best tax system; these are the difficulties it creates; let us address them in that circumstance.' Another urgent requirement is that interest rates fall by about two per cent, if the private sector is to fill the gap being created by the public sector. Such a fall in interest rates would have two benefits: reducing the direct cost of doing business and investing in the capital assets we need for real growth; and, of course, reducing the value of the Australian dollar. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have approached the opposition representative and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two graphs that show both the exports growth and economic growth that occur when the Australian dollar falls in value compared with foreign currencies.

Interest rates will fall only when governments stop borrowing money. Inflation need not rise with a lower exchange rate. The international price of the goods that come in means that they will cost more to import at a lower dollar value and, of course, that will improve the opportunity for Australian business to fill the gaps. The simple fact is that there is no such thing as an international price for a product that has been manufactured. The price is what the local market will bear. Of course, the performance of local industry has a lot to do with that. You can buy cars in various parts of the world, but they look awfully the same to me; yet they are substantially different in price because of local market conditions. But a lower dollar value is not the reason that we will get inflation. Inflation will rise if the trade union movement seeks to steal from future generations by claiming the benefits of economic growth that would result from lower exchange rates. The joke is that, if they try to force wages up-as they are trying to do now, more for political reasons than anything else-they will force inflation up. One of the most remarkable things that I have never been able to understand about trade union leaders is that, when they go out and get the workers a pay increase and, as a result of that we have inflation, that inflation means Mrs Jones pays more down at the supermarket; but, of course, the government has taken half the pay rise through taxation before Mrs Jones even gets the money to spend down at the supermarket. In fact, all the evidence shows that there has been a real drop in buying power as a result of some of these pay increases. It is plainly silly and it should not occur. There is another group of people in the community that should be considered in this regard-children. The debt processes of the last lO to 15 years and the forcing up of inflation are a charge against the children of this country. It is outrageous that that should even be considered. We must not have people rushing out for extra money the minute we start to get the economic growth we so desperately need to repay the debts of the last decade. I make the point that we can get the growth and we can put a million people back into work. It cannot be done artificially. It cannot be done by fiddling the books. Real jobs will only come with real growth, and governments have to recognise that. I still have business contacts through my family, and we have seen some of these make-job schemes. They are heart breaking. The people arriving to do the jobs know they are not going to stay. They have no interest in learning anything. There was no future in it. So what we are saying is, 'Let's make apprenticeships affordable.' An affordable apprenticeship for an employer is one that they will contract and keep. The reality is that, by taking away the cost of the days when the young people are not on the premises and thus creating some productivity for the employer, more employers will be prepared to take on young people. It is stupid to think, as is currently the law, that young people should be paid the same wages as old people. It is back to this king having no clothes argument. The reality is that when you get to that, the kids do not get a job. They do not get an apprenticeship. It is as simple as that. Business people are not silly and we have not yet passed laws that demand they employ people. The trade union movement cries crocodile tears over youth unemployment, and yet it is the trade unions that still restrict, through the award system, the ratio of apprentices you can have",145,Representatives Main Commitiee

If we want to have skilled people so we do not have to import skilled welders from the Philippines-as occurred in my state recently-then we have to do it. I encourage everybody to get together on these issues. on behalf of the budget presented by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello). I believe it was a very responsible budget. It was, by its nature, a tough budget, but it was a budget that had to be tough. Many people around Australia understand that after the profligate years of Keating we had to do something to try and rein back the debt that was occurring in this country. I have heard many speakers on the other side talk about this being an unconscionable budget. They say there have been cuts in areas where people can least afford them and that this is a terrible government that has no compassion. They are ignoring the fact that many of them belonged to the government that ran up this enormous debt; a debt that grew from $30 billion to $180 billion during their term and a series of deficit budgets which could not continue. The last budget was brought down to bring in a surplus of more than $3 billion, and yet we found that at the end of the day, we had a deficit of more than $5 billion. That is total irresponsibility. Any company or any business that was running its affairs in such a way would be broke tomorrow morning. Australia is no different. We have to run our affairs responsibly. The members opposite who have been crying about the fact that certain areas have been cut, areas where people who are disadvantaged are not to receive the benefits that they received in the past, forget that if we continue to run deficit budgets such as that, if we continue to run up debt, then the very people they want to help most in the long-term are the people they will not be able to help. There are plenty of examples around the world of economies that have got out of control, where people have had to move in and take control of those economies. The very first thing that happens is that welfare is slashed. The people that all governments, all parties, all members of political parties want to help-the disadvantaged members of society---cannot be helped because we do not have the finances, we do not have the wherewithal to do it. It was put by the member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) that deficits have another effect. They certainly have an effect on interest rates. They undoubtedly have an effect on employment. I put to this House that, in fact, the deficit that we have run up over the last years has exported jobs from this country. The fact is that we do not have the savings in Australia for Australians to have shares in their own companies. The fact that these companies, because of the debt that has been run up, are being taken over by foreign companies is something that concerns Australians. The very basis of that is the fact that we have not had control of our finances. I keep on having people coming to me from my electorate-the electorate of Page, which is on the north coast of New South Wales-and saying, 'Don't resile from the job. Keep on with it, because we understand that we have to straighten this country out. We cannot leave a debt to our children and grandchildren and expect them to have to pay for our profligate ways.' I am sure that there are a number of people in Australia who share that view. I believe that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) touched on a lot of issues in the community which go deep into this budget and go deep into the areas that budgets are about in Australia, those of funding particular programs about which many Australians are very concerned. I have been concerned that there have been members of this House stand up and try to, in some ways, downplay what the member for Oxley had to say. In some instances,",148,Representatives Main Committee

In many instances these days, unfortunately, in Australia we are not allowing freedom of speech. We are not allowing these views to be brought forward. If someone dares to say it, they are either 'discriminating' or they are 'vilifying' and they are howled down. I believe that the member for Oxley has every right to raise, in this parliament, the issues that she raised. Mr Ted Grace-Do you agree with her? What parts do you agree with? Do you agree with her on migrants or Aboriginals? prepared to listen, I will tell you. The Labor Party, of course, have failed, because they are the ones who have created these issues. The Labor Party have failed in these areas because, obviously, they have not addressed the problems that the society sees. When people say that there are a minority of people supporting the member for Oxley, I tum them to the poll done by Alan Jones, which showed that 98 per cent of the people in the community had these concerns. I am not saying that the concerns are legitimate. But I have to say this to you: because governments of different persuasions have been pandering to minority groups for some years now, the mainstream of Australia feels left out. They feel that they are being discriminated against. I think that is the issue that the member for Oxley has raised. It is a legitimate issue for this parliament to debate. If you look at those areas where the mainstream of Australia believe that they are discriminated against, you find we have to address it. We cannot hide it. We cannot slip it under the carpet and say, 'Look, it will go away.' It will fester and it will cause problems in this society that we cannot control if we do not address the issues that are involved. People will say it is discrimination and people will say it is vilification. I do not believe it is necessarily so. I do not say that there is not any discrimination in this country. In fact, I agree that there is. But the fact is that we must address these areas of concern. It is not just within the mainstream community in Australia. If you talk to the minority groups-if you talk to the rank and file Aboriginal people-they will say to you that money is being squandered and money is not getting to the grassroots where it is needed. The very people who need the support are not getting the money, even though we have spent millions of dollars on it. They are not getting the support that is necessary. It is something we must address. We just cannot push it away and say, 'That is discrimination. You should not talk about this.' I might also say-and it goes back to the discrimination argument and the Asian statements that were made by the member for Oxley-that the real concern in the community is not to do with Asians, but is to do with immigration. They are saying, 'Here are our children. They cannot get work in Australia, yet we are bringing people in from overseas.' We are saying that we have to bring people in from overseas because they have skills. Yet our young people do not have skills. I think this government has addressed that in some way in this budget. I think that you can go further, but there is no doubt in my mind that to give assistance to apprenticeships, where you are training people in long-term skills, is very important. I have had some concerns for some time now that the apprenticeship system has served its purpose. The old indentured apprenticeship system might have served its purpose. The world",149,Representatives Main Committee
359,Mr Causley,"If you listen carefully, you will hear what I have got to say. If you areThursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4849 has changed, changed dramatically, and technology has caused that in many ways. Employers can no longer afford to have apprentices under the old system, particularly where they have to go away for quite some time on block release. That is why they are not taking on apprentices, that is why we have not got our young people trained. I think that this budget does something about that, that it gives some incentive to employers to take on apprentices and to see that they are trained. Those areas are very important and we must address them. The Labor government had a method of just pouring taxpayers' money into this. I do not say that all of their labour market programs were bad. In fact, there were a couple of programs that were pretty good but in many instances, because they were so determined to manipulate the unemployment figures, this money was entirely wasted. We saw a program on the north coast of New South Wales in the dying days of the Labor government where they threw $21 million at creating 1,750 jobs, which was ostensibly to try to save the two Labor members up there, the then member for Richmond and the then member for Page. But people saw through it. They saw that this was just a waste of their money. This is one of the attitudes that are in society today, that people are sick and tired of governments wasting taxpayers' money. I believe that this government was elected on some of that emotion. People were saying, 'We have had enough of this, we want a change, we want to get away from the systems that we have at the present time.' I believe that the member for Oxley tapped into this emotion. There is no doubt about that. This government, if it does not listen to the concerns of that great bulk of Australians out there, will go the same way as the Keating government because people believe that governments are elected to do something about the concerns that they see in their society. I want to get more specific about my electorate of Page on the north coast of New South Wales. I was delighted to see in the budget that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Sharp) had honoured a promise which probably emanated from the parliament of New South Wales where the coalition government there proposed a Motorway Pacific. It was a grand scheme for a divided highway between Brisbane and Sydney. We have an upgrade of the highway between Melbourne and Sydney, to a great extent completed at this stage, but the other great arterial road link in Australia is between Brisbane and Sydney. The Pacific Highway was a total mess 10 years ago until the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government put substantial funds into it and upgraded it. However, it needs to be upgraded substantially if we are going to have a very good economic link between those two cities. I would like to say that this is a great start. We are going to have the sections from Coolongolook to Bulahdelah and from Chinderah to Billinudgel upgraded. However, there is a link in between that we need to continue on. We should not forget that this is a start on this particular link and we should continue on. There is a link in my electorate which goes from Harwood Island bridge on the Clarence River down nearly to Woolgoolga at what is called Dirty Creek Range. That is a link that needs to be put through as quickly as possible, otherwise you will have to go back to the old meandering highway, up through the valley, and that is just not good enough for a major link. While I am extremely delighted that the government has found the funds to upgrade these two sections I am saying not to forget that project because I believe it would probably equal the Snowy Mountains scheme in days gone past because it is an extremely important infrastructure program for Australia. 4850 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 19 September 1996 I understand also that the minister took note of another road which we call the Summerland Way which takes off from Grafton and wanders up to Casino and into Queensland behind the range, up through that area. For some time the Summerland Way has needed upgrading and I understand that the minister is talking to the New South Wales government at the present time-some positive talks, I am told-about getting an upgrading of that particular road. That area takes some of the heavy traffic away from the Pacific Highway where most of the population is. That route from Grafton through to the Queensland border, past Kyogle, will certainly alleviate some of that heavy traffic in that area and I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for coming forward with those proposals. Small business was a big part of the government's election promise. I was listening to the member for Lalor( Mr Barry Jones). He was saying, 'How are we going to get all these jobs? Are you going to cut wages? Are you going to work at the lower end of the socioeconomic group? How are you going to do it?' I know the member for Lalor has been an eminent academic in his day but obviously he has never been in business, because that is where you generate the jobs. Jobs are generated in business. Unfortunately, I think, at the present time, of the wealth generating area of Australia, only about 11 per cent of Australians are employed in that particular sector. It is an area where we need to grow if we are going to get involved and if we are going to improve this economy. Obviously, small business is a very important part of that. I can tell you that from my discussions with small business, do not underestimate the effects of the anti-dismissal laws. People are absolutely terrified of them. Rightly or wrongly, they are absolutely terrified of them. When we have decisions in the courts over someone who was dismissed because they were taking money from the till and the courts let them off and say, 'Well, you didn't tell them not to', I think that is a very sad day for Australia. I believe that that is one rule that you should be taught as soon as you can talk-that you should not steal. I believe it is a law that was always taught in our community. For a court to come down with a decision such as that is absolutely abysmal. The small business community has been terrified by it. While this approach in the industrial relations laws is to modify it-it is not taking it away; it is modifying it-to remove the extremes, I think is a very good move in the right direction. The other area which has tended to be overlooked, particularly by the Labor Party when in government, is the fact that in small business all of the equity is in the business. Everything they own and everything they have worked for over years is in the business. If you are going to tax them in some way that does not allow them to enlarge that business, then you are inhibiting a very, very large sector of the Australian economy. That is what this is doing at the present time. This particular budget measure is saying that, if you want to enlarge your business, if you want to sell a business and go into a larger business, then we are not going to charge you tax on that. We are also going to allow you to retire with some of the assets that you have built up. We are not going to tax that because that is your superannuation, that is what you have worked for. Surely those are incentives that are worthwhile and would be supported from both sides of the political fence, because they are so important in our economy. I think both sides of politics agree that small business is very important in Australia and it is an area that must be helped. I noted that some of the opposition did raise the spectre of the ABC. Of course, coming from a rural electorate, I can assure you that I am very conscious of the ABC and some of the Thursday, 19 September 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4851 funding cuts that have been put forward. CanI say, though, that I believe the ABC over many years have not addressed inefficiencies, have not addressed their management structure, have not really closely looked at some of their programming. I believe that there are savings to be found. If you look at many of the major companies in Australia over the last 10 years, they have had some soul searching to do themselves. They have looked very closely at the management structures; they have looked very closely at their costs to see whether they could prune them and get profit back, and many of them have. I think the ABC is in the same position. CanI say to you, though, that I am certainly speaking out loudly on behalf of regional news and regional programs. I think that that is what the ABC was based on in the first place-to get radio out across Australia. I do not think that role has changed, quite frankly; it is a core role. I would be extremely disappointed if management did not see the need to continue that particular core element in the ABC. I would speak out strongly against it if, in fact, that were the case. In the little time. I have left, I would like to touch on the point that I probably came into politics about 12 years ago and that is forestry. I am very concerned at the present time about the fact that the New South Wales Labor government is using the national forest policy as a means to close down small country communities. I do not believe that the policies that were put in place by the federal government, and that includes the previous government, were meant to be used in such away. I know that there is a very important need to have comprehensive and adequate reserves of forest types across Australia, but unfortunately we see that extremists take this to a further point which really does undermine industry and production and employment. Unfortunately, we have elements of the New South Wales Labor government at the present time who are trying to use this particular excuse to further their green agenda. I know I have the support of the members of the Labor Party in New South Wales. I hope I have enough support because I have spoken to a few in recent days. I call on them to look very carefully at the spurious arguments that are being advanced in this particular debate. There is far too much dishonesty in the debate. If we look at the scientific facts, it is not supported by scientific fact but it can have very detrimental effects on small communities. It can have very detrimental effects on the economies of rural areas and very detrimental effects on the economy of Australia. I ask that anyone in this parliament who has influence talk to colleagues in the other states because this is a very important issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address this budget. I believe that it is a very responsible budget. I believe it will set the foundations for a very strong economic return in Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Ted Grace) adjourned.
