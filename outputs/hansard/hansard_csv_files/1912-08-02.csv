A similar course was taken tration of the Actors Union, of which the in ' regard to another family of four. [60] 'following report appears in --to-day's Ag*f' An order was yesterday made by Mr Justice Higgins in the Federal Arbitration Court directing the cancellation of registration of the Australian Actors Union, his Honor' remarking that in making the order he was "" compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice."" Although a number, of grounds were submitted on behalf of the applicantsthe theatricalmanagersin support of the application, the one mainly relied upon related to proceedings by the deputy registrar in Sydney. It appeared that the notification of the application for the registration of the union was published in the Gazette on 16th December, i g n , and on n t h January the deputy registrar granted the: certificate, forwarding a notification of the fact to the principal registrar in Melbourne. Subsequently the mistake in issuing the certificate before thirty days had passed for the receipt of objections to the registration was discovered, and the certificate was finally issued as of date 7th February last. Counself o r the union argued that the issue of a certificate' on n t h January was a mere nullity,and did not. affect the valid act after the lapse of the required period. His Honor, after remarking that he was compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice, said the mistake had hurt no one, but he was obliged to give effect to the objection, because it had been taken. At one time he had a discretion in matters of this sort, but the last amended act said that if an organisation were registered erroneously, or by mistake, the registration must be cancelled. He had drawn up a certificate of registration. in asking questions to read long extracts from newspapers. The honourable member should condense his quotation. practice of the House, I shall content myself with handing to the Attorney-General the report from which I have quoted.

Has he read the following statement appearing in one of a series of articles by the Rev. Father Mimnagh, written on a trip to Great Britain (see Bundaberg Daily News, n t h J u l y , 1912) : "" I learned on my outward journey that some of the men working on the Grosse Kurfurst were immigrants who, disappointed with Australia, were at all costs coming back to England. Emigrants with trades evidently they were who were tempted by the reports of the high wages paid to their classes under the Southern Cross, and once there finding no avenues of employment returned to their own land again. These people will have no kindly memory of Australia, and no good word to say of it, the original fault though being their own in pretending to be agricultural labourers. . . .

W ill the Minister for External Affairs appoint a temporary officer in each of the principal ports of the Commonwealth to make inquiries (during a period of say one month) amongst the third-ciass passengers and the crews of outgoing vessels bound for Europe, with a view to ascertaining how many State-assisted immigrants are returning because of inability to obtain employment in Australia? orable member's questions are as follow:1.

54,Mr Fuller (Illawarra) [10.56],"!House, to make themselves acquainted with its possibilities. All of us, myself included, who have been through the Territory, realize that in that great empty space there are magnificent opportunities for the settlement of a prosperous people. The experiments which have been made there in tropical agriculture have shown that many tropical products can be grown with great success; and I understand that the present Government are establishing experimental farms, with a view to show whether there are any further possibilities in that direction. While we are all satisfied that -there are many potentialities in the rich soil of that country, we must remember that settlers who go there to take up land and develop it, especially in the coastal regions, must labour under serious climatic disabilities as compared with people in the southerly portions of Australia. Time after time, even in the more favoured portions of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, the leasehold system-the basic principle of the Ordinance which I am moving the House to disallow-ha s been found insufficient to bring about that permanent residence on the soil, and that proper development of the country, which it is so eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to encourage . in the Northern Territory. I presume that honourable members read this Ordinance, which has been drawn up in accordance with the principles of the Labour party. It is well known that that party throughout Australia are absolutely in favour of the leasehold as against the freehold system of land tenure. Doubtless they regard its adoption as the first step towards the realization of another plank in their platform which provides for the nationalization of the land. evidence in the press from time to time, however, that they are not in favour of the application of the leasehold system to their own private dealings, and, what is more, the Government were not at all anxious to secure a lease of the site selected in the Strand, London, for the Commonwealth offices. They would be satisfied with nothing less than the freehold of the area in question. The basic principle of this Ordinance is that of perpetual leasehold. It is set out in section 15 thatLeases under this Ordinance shall be granted by the Administrator in the name of the King, and (except as regards miscellaneous leases), shall be in perpetuity, but subject to reappraise. ment of rent at the periods provided by this Ordinance, or in special cases at the periods Mr Fuller. prescribed by the regulations or provided for in the lease. apply to pastoral leases? is one of the remarkable features of the Ordinance. Great pastoral areas are to betaken up under the system of perpetual leasehold. It may be necessary for us in the not far distant future to resume all or portion of such areas, and when the day does come, we shall have to pay practically as much for the resumption of such land for closer settlement purposes as if we had parted with the freehold. When I say that I object to this Ordinance, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have in mind only its application to areas that may be suitable for agricultural, dairying, and closer settlement purposes. I certainly do not wish to advocate the adoption of the freehold system in regard to the great pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. It is the application of this Ordinance to areas that may be classified as suitable for dairying, agricultural, and closer settlement purposes to which I object. It seems to me that the House should have had an opportunity to consider the system of land tenure to be adopted in the Northern Territory before this Ordinance was issued. I recognise that it is in accordance with an Act introduced, if I remember rightly, by the late Mr Batchelor, when Minister of External Affairs, which absolutely piohibits the selling of land in the Northern Territory in fee. The Minister in issuing this Ordinance is merely following the system embodied in that Act. The Ordinance provides for the classification of land in various areas which are set forth in section 7. In We have the case of pastoral lands, the maximum area that may be taken up under class 1. is 500 square miles; in class 2, 1,000 square miles; and in class 3, 3,000 square miles. These areas may be taken up under a system of perpetual lease, subject, of course, to reappraisement from time to time. Division2 deals with agricultural lands, and provides for the issue of leases as follows:Subdivision (A) -Cultivatio n FarmsClass1 -Maximum area, 640 acres. Class2 -Maximum area, 2,560 acres. Subdivision (B) -Mixed Farming and GratingClass1 -Maximum area, 12,800 acres. Class2 -Maximum area, 64,000 acres. I have carefully examined this Ordinance, and find that it possesses several objectionable features, even from the stand-point of",18,Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance
55,Mr Archibald,That section does not,19,Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance
56,Mr Fuller,"It does, and that to me-jthose who favour the leasehold system. There is, for instance, the proposal to which -reference has just been made to grant perpetual leases in respect of large pastoral holdings which, in time to come, may be partly, or wholly, required for closer settlement purposes. I have no desire to discuss seriatim all its objectionable features, but I should like to draw special attention to the fact that it is provided under Regulation 9 thatThe Classification Board or any authorized these words^person may require any applicant for any lease -containing a covenant to reside on the land to produce to him a medical certificate of fitness. That is an advertisement to the world that the Minister believes that those who take up land in tbe Territory will have to work -under very severe climatic conditions. are severe. -"" Tommy Rot,"" while one of his supporters endorses, my view. Any one wbo tias travelled through the northern part of the Territory must agree with the honourable member for Corio. Owing to the proximity of that part of Australia to the equator, it is hot there, not only in summer, t>ut in winter. I visited the Territory towards the end of July, and throughout my stay the thermometer, I understand, never registered less than 96 degrees in the shade. The heat was very trying, and one could not indulge in any physical exertion, except at great inconvenience. Notwithstanding the Minister's interjection of "" 1'ommy Rot,"" we know that owing to the heat and the presence of mosquitoes, and other drawbacks, the Northern Territory will have to fee developed under difficult conditions. able member as to that. of seeking to impose, as is done under this Ordinance, the most harassing conditions, we should give people the fullest encouragement to take up land there. Honourable members of the Labour' party claim that they take a special interest in the well-being of the wives and children of the people. I would remind them that, under this Ordinance, it will he difficult for a man to make provision for his wife and family. It is a well known principle of law that a system of trust cannot be established under a leasehold-that in respect of a leasehold you cannot carve out a life estate for your wife with remainder for your children. Notwithstanding that a man may hold a lease in perpetuity our system of conveyancing makes it impossible to do that. Let me quote from a speech delivered by one of the most experienced gentlemen in connection with land matters in Australia. Speaking in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on 20th March last, on a Bill proposing to do away with the right to obtain' in that State any more freeholds from the Crown, he used I do not like theidea of calling this a perpetual lease title, for I have an objection to a perpetual lease title. At one time. I used to be a fairly good lawyer, though 1 suppose I have now forgotten most of my law. ber state whom he is quoting ? ruthers. the name of the honourable member's authority for I , too, propose to quote a statement made by him. statement on the subjectBut the objection to a leasehold tenure is that directly you attempt to carve out of it estates under your will , or under a deed of settlement for the protection of your wife and family, you are confronted with all the rules of conveyancing, which will not allow trusts or l i fe estates to be carved out of a leasehold. That is to say, it is held that a l i fe estate is an estate in freehold, and you cannot carve a life estate-that is, a freehold estate-ou t of' a leasehold tenure. How is the honourable member going to get over the difficulty for the people who hold that tenure? That is what I always had to regard in respect of perpetual leasehold, if I called my old tenure perpetual leasehold. That is a reference to the Act to which, no doubt, the Minister intends to refer presently. The system introduced by Sir Joseph Carruthers, in New South Wales, was specially designed to do away with dummying, which was then very rife. the speech which I have before me. Mi. FULLER -Probably I shall be able to produce another quotation to reply to that read by the honourable member. Sir Joseph Carruthers continuedThere is the law of conveyancing, and you cannot set rid of it by mere statutes. It is a very difficult thing to get rid of or to alter. It is founded on the wisdom of centuries, and you cannot carve a life estate out of a leasehold estate, although the life estate may be only in practice for five, ten, or fifteen years. And yet the leasehold estate out of which you are trying to carve it may be for ninety-nine years. Then you have to get a lawyer and go into equity to get round, the difficulty.",19,Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance

66,Mr Thomas,"He did not say so inI do not think that honourable members opposite, judging.from their expressions of opinion in the past, desire to play into the hands of the lawyersI prefer the old freehold tenure, under which you have a freehold grant, and attach your conditions as they can be attached to a freehold. Considering the difficulties and dangers of pioneering work in a. country like the Northern Territory, the leasehold system will press very much on people who go there, inasmuch as they will not be able to make provision for their wives and families out of the property on which they have spent their labour. These are not imaginary difficulties, but are well known to the law; and I should be very glad to hear from the Minister how he proposes to surmount them. I have consulted other lawyers, some of them members of this House, and I am told that what I have read is absolutely good law. The people who go to the Northern Territory ought to be given the fullest opportunity to do well, not only for themselves, but for the wives and families they leave behind; and to assist them in this, should be the desire of all who have the interests of the country at heart. This leasehold system, like a good many other experiments which are proposed from time to time by honourable members opposite, is as old as history. It has been tried in years; whereas very often, under private all quarters of the globe from the time of the Roman Empire downwards, and has proved deficient in every instance I have been able to discover. If honourable members will take the trouble to refer to the well-known historian Mommsen, they will find that the leasehold system proved a serious hindrance to the welfare and prosperity of the Roman Empire. The two Gracchi, who were the means of abolishing the system, were .assassinated for what they didj but the fact remains, as graphically told by Mommsen, that the institution of the freehold tenure was the means of placing 80,000 peasant proprietors on the land, and of saving the position. not eventually save the Empire. for the time being. The interjection of the honourable member tempts one to digress into a discussion of what really did bring about the downfall of the Roman Empire, but I shall refrain. The honourable member for Denison is very fond of quoting poetry, particularly LocksleyH a l l ; and I should like to repeat two lines from Goldhas? smith, in order to show what, in my opinion, did cause the ruin of that great Empire. Goldsmith said111 fares the land, to .hastening ills a prey, ' Where wealth' accumulates, and men decay. It was the accumulation of wealth, together with lust and loose living, that caused the decay and disintegration of Rome, and this is what we have to avoid in the Australian Commonwealth. which may suit a large proportion of the electors at the present time, but it will be for the Minister to show how much truth there is in it when he stands up to defend this Ordinance. I should now like to bring members down to the time of the French Revolution. It has been said time and again, and will doubtless be said many times in the future, that the lasting work of that Revolution was to end the feudal system and to initiate freehold peasant proprietorship in France. . There is no difference, in my opinion, between a leasehold system under a landlord and leasehold under the State, except that, under the Ordinance, the land held under leasehold in the Northern Territory 'will be subject to reappraisement every fourteen tenure, the reappraisement does not come in the leaseholder's lifetime. France so progressed under this system of peasant proprietorship that, at the conclusion of the Franco-German war, the French people were able to pay the tremendous indemnity of ^280,000,000, and to remain in quite as sound, and probably a sounder, position than that of their victors. This was entirely owing to the freehold system of peasant proprietorship. Then, again, the development of the great Republic of America has not taken place under the leasehold system. The Constitution gave Congress the sole ownership of .the public domain, and it was wisely decided that all prairie lands between the Ohio River and the foot of the Rocky Mountains could be disposed of in sections of 160 acres, halfsections of 60 acres, and quarter-sections of 40 acres, according to the quality, with' a freehold title, on payment of 7 dollars an acre. The result was that 5,500,000 freehold proprietors were placed on the domain. What has been the result?",20,Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance

I should now like to refer for a few moments to a country which, so far as its land laws are concerned, has been under the notice of the world for many years past. I refer to Ireland, and the painful history of that country's agrarian strife. It is well known that Michael Davitt was the real author of the Irish land system, and that it was he who formed the Land League with the object of placing the land' in the hands of the cultivators of the soil. History tells us that Michael Davitt was always a land nationalize!; and his idea was for the State to purchase die land from the landlords and let it out to the cultivators on leases of 999 years. However, when Mr George Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, carried through the Imperial Parliament the Irish Land Purchase Bill, he gave the people of that country the choice between leasehold and freehold. Although the tenants of Ireland, north, south, east and west, idolized Davitt, they declared in favour of freehold, adding that they had had enough of landlordism, and that they did not see the difference between being the tenant of a private proprietor and the tenant of a State. was different from that of the people in Australia. preferred the freehold system; and we are told that ^210,000,000 for the general ""purchase with ^12,000,000 besides was advanced at 3 per cent, interest by the Government. The ^12,000,000 was voted --to finish the purchase where the tenants would be unwilling to give the full price the '.landlords demanded, and this sum bears tno interest. their instalments, which are one-third less than the judicial rents they paid before the scheme came into operation. They will be the real owners of their homes after sixty-eight years' payment. The result of this legislation has already created a revolution so far as the prosperity of Ireland is concerned. Honourable members who, like myself, have had the privilege of travelling in the Old Land, must admit that, when in Ireland, there can be seen signs of a great revival of prosperity amongst the people. are receiving is., instead of 6d. a day. concerned with the condition of the farm labourer, but with the general appearance of prosperity, which cannot fail to be observed, as a contrast to the terrible tales of distress we have always hitherto heard in connection with that country. the landlord system in Ireland. able member; and I must s'ay that Ireland furnishes a painful chapter in the history of the Old Land. At any rate, the freehold system has, to a very large extent, relieved the position; and the result to-day is that the trade of Ireland is increasing, and, I think, now stands very nearly as high as that of the Australian Commonwealth. Let us now turn our attention to land tenures in New Zealand, where the difficulties to be encountered at the beginning were similar to those met with throughout the States of Australia. Land legislation and administration in New Zealand forms a very interesting history, in view of the Ordinance issued for the control of the Northern Territory. About twenty years ago, the two questions in New Zealand were whether the State should sell or lease the lands, and what would prove the most effective means of preventing land monopoly and breaking up big estates. The perpetual leasehold system was propounded in New Zealand by such well known public men as Mr Rolleston, Mr Ballance, and Sir John McKenzie, men of advanced democratic ideas. So far back as 1882 Mr Rolleston, who was then Minister of Lands, introduced into the Lower House a Bill to dispose of Crown lands on perpetual lease, the rent being fixed at 5 per cent, of the unimproved capital value, with re-appraisement after thirty years, and, subsequently, at intervals of twenty years. The Council, however, favoured freehold The tenants are now paying tenure, and amended the treasure to give",21,Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance

Mr Rolleston fought the amendment hard, but as the Council remained obdurate, it remained tn the measure. Between 1882 and 180J2 1,188,071 acres were taken up under this law, the tenure being more popular than the conditional purchase or deferred payment system until then in vogue, because the rent was lower, and there was the right to convert. This right to convert was availed of so largely that, in 1909, there were only 87,000 acres still being rented, and I have reason to believe that at the present day practically the whole area taken up under the Act-1,188,07 1 acres-ha s lance, a politician of very advanced ideas, succeeded Mr Rolleston as Minister of Lands in 1885, and his attempt to carry out the policy of his predecessor brought about a long and memorable struggle between the two Houses of Parliament, but the Upper House again prevailed. When Sir John McKenzie, who was not then knighted, became Minister of Lands and Agriculture in the Bal lance Cabinet, he proposed leases in perpetuity. Sir John McKenzie was a practical farmer, and a Scotchman of very strong convictions. He was determined that there should not prevail in New Zealand the system which had brought such disastrous consequences upon the small farmers of Scotland, and, being of opinion that when land is alienated in freehold, it is only a matter of time before all the land of the State gets into the possession of rich by the Minister and his colleagues in primen, he determined that the land of New Zealand -should be held under perpetual lease. This form of tenure was designed to give the leaseholder the same interest in his holding as ""is possessed by freeholders. The lerfses were for a term of 999 years, but were ''called leases in perpetuity. A man could take up 640 acres of first class Ja'nd arid 2,000 acres of second class land, the rental equalling 4 per cent, on the capilegitimate way I hope, to get possession of tal value, residential and improvement conditions being insisted on. The lessees were prevented from taking up more than one block each, ""and there could not be conversion at any time. A measure embodying those provisions became law in 1892. Mr One of the greatest objections to this and Rolleston, who was bitterly opposed to the .McKenzie Act, because it did not provide for re-appraisement, and, in effect, deprived -'the State of its share of the unearned increment-whic h is what the Minister of Northern [REPRESENTATIVES.] Territory.

It will not require more thantwo or three years before the people will rise against the persecutions, limitations, vexations, and annoyances such as appear under this-. Bill. There is no unearned increment to come in, no provision for revenue in aid of local government, no aid to taxation in the future. This Bill, as it must be carried out, will destroy the land revenue. It fosters evasion, gambling,, and speculation. From 1892 to 1907, owing to the greatprosperity of the country, land values in? New Zealand increased enormously. There was a great develppment of the dairying' industry, and a great increase in the exportation of lambs. When those who had taken up land under the perpetual lease system became prosperous and numerousand knew their political strength, they clamoured to be permitted to convert to freehold, and their agitation was so strong that they ultimately acquired the right of purchase, and are now practically all freeholders. A similar thing has happened in South Australia in connection withwhat a.re known as homestead allotments,in New South Wales, in Victoria, and elsewhere. Men .are not satisfied with leasehold tenure.

Coming now to the history of leasehold tenure in New South Wales, I wish to refer to a .speech made by Mr Moore when, as Minister of Lands, in T908, he moved the second reading of a Bill for the conversion of Crown leases. He then pointed out that 7,000 homestead and vsettlement lessees wished to convert to a more secure tenureThe tenures under this Act will be subject to no periodical re-appraisement. an absolute freehold, subject only to a condition that when the holding is transferred it must be transferred to a person qualified to take of their property.

This Ordinance is, of course, only in accord with the whole of the policy of the Labour party, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the different States. Mr Holman, speaking at Cootamundra, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 2i.st April last, saidWe do propose to repeal the B ill which entitles the homestead selector to convert his holding, but under any circumstance he will have all this year in which to convert, and I think' he will find that he will have six months of next year as well. We think that if we give the homestead selector twelve months' notice that at the end of that time he will lose his right to convert, he will have no cause to complain. Mr Trefle, the Minister of Agriculture, speaking at Breeza on 7th August, is reported, in the Sydney Morning Herald, to have spoken as followsHe had been specially requested by his leader ( Mr Holman) to deal f u l lv and clearly with the position of the Labour party with respect to the Conversion Act. It was true that the Labour party intended to repeal the Conversion Act this year, but in consequence of the resignation of Messrs. Home and Dunn, a meeting of the caucus decided that the repeal of the Act would not apply to those who so far had taken up holdings, and the homestead selection and conditional lease tenures. policy of the party, he went on to say, would be perpetual leasehold with re-appraisement of values for rental adjustments. value would be based on the value of adjacent private lands. That is similar to the system which the Minister has adopted in this Ordinance. Mr Beeby, speaking at Millthorpe on 24th September, was reported, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, to have said, in regard to the Labour party's land tenure proposals, thatThe Government would offer land only in living area blocks. The tenure would be perpetual lease; the rental would be 2Â£ per cent, per annum on .the capital value, which would be fixed by re-appraisement every twenty years, and the occupier could not sell his interests except to a person who had no other land. I am indebted to the Minister of Lands in Victoria, and to the Commissioner of Crown -Lands in South Australia, for particulars regarding the freehold system in those two States. The Victorian Minister has furnished me with the following memorandum with regard to the perpetual leasing of Crown lands -in VictoriaWhen the reclaimed area known as the "" Koowee-rup Swamp"" was made available for oc* cupation, a considerable number of the applicants was impressed with 'the apparent advantages of perpetual leasing, and preferred that tenure to conditional purchase leasehold, which conferred the exclusive right to freehold; but, in a limited time, the holders of perpetual leases arrived at the conclusion that conditional purchase lessees are in a better position, as the freehold can be acquired by the latter at any time after six (6) years from date of lease, and. consequently a conditional purchase lease in the seventh year is recognised as a good commercial security. . Crown lands have been available since ist July, 1899, for selection under perpetual lease, as well as under a title under which the payment of the first and subsequent rent goes towards the purchase of the fee-simple; but in rare instances has a perpetual lease been preferred. It must, however, be mentioned that a perpetual lease of a selection carries with it an exclusive right to the holder to acquire the fee-simple by change of title, and although it. practically rests with him to determine the dateon which occupation under perpetual lease shall cease, with a view to his acquisition of the freehold, yet even this privilege, together with other concessions, does not create any general"" desire for perpetual leases. I quote this to honourable members to show that if we are to induce people to go to the Northern Territory, we must, under existing conditions there, offer them something; equally as good as, and if possible better than, is being offered in the more favoured portions of Australia, yet in those more favoured portions we find that people, soThe future land far from being satisfied with the system of perpetual leasing, prefer to get the freeThe capital -hold in every instance where it is offered. The memorandum continues, In a few cases of encumbered holdings in theMallee country, where the lessees are not in a. position to discharge the mortgages or to obtainagricultural allotment leases, perpetual leases are accepted as a temporary expedient, as themortgages can be transferred thereto, and the freehold can be acquired at a later date. On. the establishment of the township of Wonthaggi, which comprises the State coal mine, it was in-' tended to restrict occupation to continuous leasing, but to limit the term in the first instance tothirty-three years; and although it was subsequently decided to seek the authority of Parliament to increase the term to fifty years anoV",24,Smith Perverte D Human A Holding By A Man S Personal Exertion

I have received from the Commissioner of Crown Landsi n South Australia also bears out my contention. time by reading it , but I should lik e to quote from the Handbook of South Australia for 1908, page 184, the f o l l o w in g passage:In i8g8, in order to meet the growing demand for land, an Act was passed providing for the purchase of freehold lands for closer settlement. These were to be let on perpetual lease at a fixed rental of not less than 4 per cent, on the amount paid for purchase money, together with any expenses incurred in connection with the purchase. Subsequent legislation provided for lands so purchased being disposed of on agreement with covenant to purchase, the purchase money being payable by sixty half-yearly instalments, with interest at the rate of not less than 4 per cent, per annum. During the 1903 session of Parliament an Act to consolidate the Crown Lands Acts became law. This Act re-enacted the provisions for Crown lands being let under perpetual lease at a fixed rental for all time, and not subject to revaluation or disposed of under agreement with covenant to purchase by sixty half-yearly payments, with interest at not less than 2 per cent, nor more than 4 per cent, per annum. The purehase may be completed at any time after the first six years of the agreement. In the case of lands repurchased by the Government and subdivided for closer settlement, more recent legislation (1905) provides for payment of interest only at 4 per cent, per annum for the first five years, after which interest and principal become payable as in the case of ordinary Crown lands. Provision is also made for those holders of repurchased lands let on perpetual lease surrendering and obtaining agreements with covenants to purchase in lieu of the perpet-jal leases. The purchases of closer settlement land may obtain the fee-simple of their holdings at any time after the first nine years on payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest up to date. Up to the 30th June, 349,802 acres -includin g 14,716 acres of leasehold-hav e been purchased at a cost of ,Â£883,150, and disposed of to suitable purchasers, most of whom aTe successfully occupying their holdings. In place of comparatively few persons on the land at the time of purchase there is now a population of 3,945 adults and children on these repurchased lands. This shews that the South Australian Government repurchased lands for closer settlement purposes, and offered them under a system of perpetual lease, but in 1905 they did away with the perpetual lease system, and, in order to get the best work out of the settlers in developing the land, gave them the right by purchase to obtain the freeholds for themselves. The system which it is proposed to adopt in the Northern Territory is part of the Socialistic scheme of honourable members opposite. The Minister of ExternalA f f a i r s, speaking The rather lengthy statement which at Broken Hill, saidThis then is what the Labour movement means.. In one precise pregnant word it means Socialism. Well, Socialism is your scheme as apart I shall not take up from all other schemes. He was speaking, of course, to the Labour leagues and the workers, to whom he was appealing for support. It is based on social growth. It is the common holding of land, and the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all. The leasehold system is, therefore, only a portion of the programme designed to bring about the nationalization and Socialism advocated by the Minister of External Affairs at Broken Hill. The first step is leasehold, and the second is land nation* alization, but although the Labour Government in New South Wales had professed to be in favour of leasehold, and boasted at the general election that if given a majority they would immediately bring it into operation, it was found when they got into power that the only man amongst them who was game to carry out his principles was Mr Neilsen, the then Minister of Lands, and he was forced to resign. able member's time has expired. 1 refer to .several other matters, I shall not ask leave to detain the House any longer. External Affairs) [12.1] I understand that the honourable member's chief objeetion to the land ordinances of the Northern Territory is that in them we lay down the fundamental principle of the leasehold as against the freehold system. Before enter* ing upon a defence of the leasehold system-if a defence of it be necessaryI think it right that I should briefly explain the particular kind of leasehold system that we have adopted. The honourable member for Illawarra will be prepared to admit that in this case we have not merely to consider the question of freehold versus leasehold, but to direct special attention to what we intend to convey by the use of those terms. There are certain kinds of leases which no sane man would accept in respect of land in the Northern Territory. For instance, leases might be issued with a currency _ of one year or twenty years, and subject to arbitrary conditions",25,Smith Perverte D Human A Holding By A Man S Personal Exertion

Then, again, we might have a freebold system subject to certain conditions to which even the honourable member for Illawarra would not agree. I take it that he does not think that the freehold system should be applied to the big pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. self has proceeded to suggest modifications in the application of the freehold as against the. leasehold system of tenures. The mere granting of land under a freehold system is not in itself sufficient to bring about settlement. That is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, although the Northern Territory was under the control of South Australia for forty years, during which time it was possible, to obtain freehold areas there in respect of pastoral areas. could be obtained in respect of land in the Northern Territory, with the exception of pastoral areas, while it was under the control of the South Australian Government, yet settlement there to-day is practically no more advanced than it was forty years ago. So far as a.white population is concerned, vast tracts of country in the Northern Territory are as uninhabited to-day as they were when Captain Cook first set foot on Australian soil. We as a Government recognise that in adopting the leasehold system we must take care to associate with it security of tenure so that people may have some inducement to take up land.. Consequently, we have provided under this Ordinance for the granting of leases .in persystem in connection with the lands of the petuity. reappraisement at the end of fourteen years, .and in others at' the expiration of twentyjsne years, but we have provided that those -reappraisements shall not be of an arbitrary tiharacter.

Board, at the end of the periods named in the leases, will reappraise the land, and if any leaseholder thinks that the rental then fixed is too high he will have the right to appeal to a judge of the NorthernT e r r i tory. Thus it will be impossible for rentals to be fixed merely to meet the. exigencies of the Treasury. They will be dealt with on just and equitable lines. Under the system we have adopted, a man who complies with the conditions of his lease will be able to hold his land for all time. tions as to forfeiture? does not comply with the conditions of his lease that lease may be forfeited. Then, again, the leases carry residential qualifications, and provide that certain developmental work shall be done in connection with them. As long as he observes the conditions of his lease, the holder cannot be removed from his land without compensation, should it be found necessary at any Freeholds time to resume it in order to meet the advancing population. useless to grant leases in respect of land in the Territory unless we insist upon residence. Without such a condition we cannot hope to settle the Territory. Honourable members will recognise that as long as the conditions of a lease are complied with the area to which it relates will practically belong to the holder, so that it will be seen that we have made f u l l provision for security of tenure. I think it only fair, in pitting the leasehold against the freehold system, to take these points into consideration. If we were to adopt the freehold In some cases there will be a Northern Territory we 'should, of course, have to alienate lands from the Crown, and I shpuld like to ask honourable members what pricethat 'land would fetch at 'auction today. I say advisedly that most of the land suitable for' agricultural purposes in the Northern Territory is to-day practically .unsaleable, not because of ,any deficiencies in the matter of soil'or climate, but because of it's inaccessibility to a market, and because at the present time, with few exceptions, land there could not be profitably devoted to agricultural purposes.

We all know Sir George Reid, who is doing a most excellent work for the Commonwealth in England. Sir George Reid, before he went to England, figured prominently in the public life of Australia, holding, amongst other positions, those of Premier of New South Wales and Prime Minister of the Commonwealth; and he cannot be said to have been associated with the Labour party, seeing that at one time he declared he was going to devote the last few years of his life to fighting that party.

I am pleased that the honourable member for Illawarra quoted Sir Joseph Carruthers, because I , myself, intend doing so. In 1895 Sir Joseph Carruthers was Minister for Lands in the Reid Ministry, and had for one of his colleagues the honourable member for Parramatta. Speaking on this subject, he saidNow, what are the advantages of this conversion ? Let ine say, for the information of those who think that the conversion will not be availed of, that the popularity of the homestead selection system has been demonstrated beyond dispute. I have thrown open in Riverina, where there has been the greatest demand for land, special areas which have not been taken up. I have thrown open there land for ordinary conditional purchase, but there have been no conditional purchasers. The moment the tenure of the land has been changed to homestead selection there has been a rush for it. The homestead selection areas which have been thrown open in Riverina have been eagerly snapped up. The honourable member for the Murray introduced to me a delegate from a large number of Victorian farmers, who subscribed together to pay his expenses so that he might interview me. It transpired in the course of the interview that he represented a large number of families and of men who were waiting for land to be thrown open, some of them being encamped on the Murray. I said that I should be declaring certain land open for selection under the old law, and his answer to me was characteristic of the feeling which is very strong on the part of those who understand the law. "" D o not do that; we do not want that; we have not the money with which to pay the deposit and to meet the initial expenses of ordinary conditional purchase. chance of taking up homestead selections; we can pay a fair rent for the use of the land; that is what we want, and have been waiting for."" This has been my experience in otheT parts of the Colony where land has been thrown open by hundreds of thousands of acres under ordinary conditional purchase, and has not been taken up. In the majority of cases where land has been thrown open under this rent system, a demand has immediafelv set in. People are beginning to recognise that the value of land is not its speculative value, but the value of the product you can get from it. As soon as people understand the difference between these holdings and the old freeholds, with their fictitious values, apply to the Territory; and we have the we shall have a larger demand for this particular class of tenure.

I might add that I am an Englishman, and that I came to Australia two years ago with the intention of taking up land.

The cause of this difficulty, I believe, is that I am a man of small capital; but in the Territory, it appears to me, I shall be able to meet your requirements, and, as regards character, I shall have no difficulty in furnishing you with references. to the Territory? In view of this discussion, it is rather interesting to know what has been done in regard to other Territories and Possessions.

The honourable member certainly dealt with the Bill from the stand-point of Papua, but, in the course of his speech, he saidGive us the It is desirable that at the outset we should set ourselves firmly against any attempt at land alienation We should avoid the mistakes made in the States of the Commonwealth in parting with the fee-simple of the public estate.

148,Mr Thomas,"Did he? At any rate,the then member for Kalgoorlie, a gentleman, who is not a member of the Labour party, but who knows a good deal of the subject, moved for the insertion of a clause in the Papua Bill to provide for the nonalienation of land, and be saidIn my judgment, it is to be deplored that the authorities of Australia In Australia, mind , not in Papua1 did not early adopt the principle which I am advocating. Had they done so, we should now be receiving a revenue from the land which would be far in excess of the expenditure necessary for the purposes of government. I may say that, at the same time, the late Mr G. B. Edwards, whose loss we all deplored, strongly advocated the leasehold principle. The honourable member for Angas, in the course of the debate, saidDuring the sitting of the Convention the preleads me to the conclusion that the unfavorable sent Attorney-General of New South Wales and myself both brought forward provisions to prohibit the alienation in fee-simple of any part of the Federal Territory, and an argument which influenced a good many members of the Convention against that proposal was that the Constitution should merely create the machinery for legislation, and should not itself legislate. No such objection could be urged against my present proposal, however. I have no desire to place words in the moutli of the honourable member for Angas, for no one could have a fairer opponent than that gentleman; but I think it is fair to infer that, in his opinion, had it not been for the fact that a majority of the members of the Federal Convention thought they were creating nothing more than a machinery measure, our Constitution would have provided that there should be no alienation of land in the Federal Capital Territory. I admit that there is a considerable difference between land in the Federal Capital site and land in the Northern Territory, but, in view of the remarks of the honourable member for Angas, and of the fact that it was carried on the voices that no land should be alienated in the Capital area-that members of all shades of political opinion were agreed on that pointI do not think the Labour party can be blamed for acting on the same principle in the Northern Territory.

I venture to say that that is the crux of the question as between the leasehold and freea hold principles.

We give every facility to people to settle upon the land, but we demand residence. We say it is necessary for those who obtain land in the Territory to go there to live. It. is of no good to the Territory that ""persons should purchase or obtain land without settling on it. Leasehold gives the Government the opportunity of offering to the present occupier every possible advantage, without bartering the rights of posterity. Freehold, which admits the "" sacred rights of property,"" to use the words of the honourable member for Parramatta, has cursed every community. We desire to save ourselves and save this Parliament from the curse of future generations, and so we have nailed our flag to the principle of leasehold. stand or fall. journed. Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2.15 p.m. Debate resumed from ist August, (vide That, in the opinion of this House, the regulation limiting the moisture contents of export butter to 15 per cent, is detrimental to the best interests of the dairying industry in the Commonwealth. the remarks that I made on this subject yesterday, I think I showed conclusively that the presence of free moisture in butter is not adulteration. I tried also to show why the presence of free moisture was a necessity, and endeavoured to explain the technical reason why 16 per cent, has been accepted by all the great butter-producing countries as the best percentage of moisture to allow, with a view of securing the greatest quantity of first class butter. have no desire to elaborate the arguments that I put before the House yesterday, but I wish to refer to one or two replies made by the Minister of Trade and Customs to questions put to him in this House-replie s which show conclusively that the information at his disposal is faulty, and based upon what, to my mind, are mere prejudices, having no real foundation in fact,' A few days ago, the honourable member for Maranoa asked the Minister whether he was aware that 16 per cent, of moisture was that allowed under the regulations of the British Board of Trade for butter imported into the United Kingdom from any part of the world. The Minister replied to that questionYes; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to or influence on the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high class butter. . . . In that answer, we have a mis-statement,' due, probably, to the fact that the Minister is not acquainted with the true situation of the butter trade in England, and two absolute misconceptions. In the first place, butter carrying 16 per cent, of moisture, which is the standard in Great Britain, is not '' heavily charged with water.'' Fourteen per cent, is recognised as the standard for absolutely superfine butter, and no one will contend that an additional On that we 2 per cent, would make a butter heavily charged with moisture. years ago, butter containing less than 9 per cent, of moisture was exported from Australia. It is possible to-day under certain conditions to manufacture afirst-classbutter containing only 10 per cent, of moisture; but it would be wrong to make an isolated case general in its application. We have in this answer to the question put by the honourable member for Maranoa the absolute mis-statement that butter containing 16 per cent, of moisture is heavily charged with moisture. be secured for butter containing 20 per oent. of moisture? cent, of moisture would be too much for commercial purposes. position be the same in regard to butter containing 18 per cent, of moisture? member had heard my statement in the House yesterday he would know why 16 per cent, has been adopted as a standard' by all the great butter producing countries. It must be evident to honourable membersthat that standard' has not been adopted) without good reason. . :",33,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If the honorablebuyer as an article containing 16 parts of water ? questions which makes one feel that it is utterly hopeless to try to convince some honourable members of the true position. It is a question which, if I may say so without desiring to be offensive, shows the honourable member's ignorance of this matter. If he had the technical knowledge which I and other honourable members possess he would not put such a question. There is a percentage of water in everything we eat and drink, and, as I have said, 16 per cent, has been found all over the world to be the best standard to fix in order to secure the greatest proportion of good butter under varying conditions of manufacture. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that the standard of 16 per cent, fixed by the British Board of Trade had been determined upon solely to allow of the introduction of Irish firkin butter into England. That is an absurd statement. British trade statistics show that the quantity of Irish butter introduced into England is a mere drop in the bucket compared with the enormous quantity imported from other parts of the world. In the last year for which statistics are available, ^25,000,000 worth of butter was introduced into the Old Country. to about ^4.000,000 worth. porters of butter to the Old Country we are second only to Denmark, and I have no doubt that before long we shall outrival our greatest competitor in the quantity we send there. .get better herds. record in the matter of herds. cattle in Australia at present, but I admit that we shall have better herds as time goes by. [ have no desire, however, to deal today with the question of dairy cattle. The Minister, in reply to the question to which I was referring when interrupted, stated that the object of adopting as the Aus-: tralian standard 15 per cent, is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class ""butter. I think I have shown that the presence of water in butter is not adulterat on. ; says when a complaint is made that there us water in his milk. there is a percentage at which the presence of water would amount to adulteration ; but so far as moisture in butter is concerned, one of two things is inevitable. You must either have buttermilk or water in butter. If you choose to have buttermilk, you will have bad butter; if you have water you will have good butter. have the better the butter will keep. those fallacies which are just now obsessing the mind of the Minister. I showed yesterday afternoon that there is a point beyond which you cannot press water out of butter without producing an article that will not keep as well as if the water had remained in it. Let us take the case of two samples of butter, each containing 8 per cent, of water. In one case the butter, in grain and general appearance, might be all that could be desired, whilst in the other it might be so overworked that it would not keep. One must be aware of these facts in order to be able to express an opinion on the subject. The Minister's contention that the less water you have in butter the better it will keep is mere nonsense. Everything depends on circumstances. I impress on the Minister of Trade and Customs, as I stated in my opening remarks yesterday, that the method of Denmark, our greatest competitor in the London market, is to draw together the whole of those engaged in the industry, and to associate them with the Government in the making of regulations, some of which, I willingly admit, are necessary. The Minister of Trade and Customs has a grand opportunity, if he will avail himself of it, to so associate himself with the dairymen of Australia, who have now, practically, complete control of the industry in this country through the co-operative channels. They .have appointed their own agents in London to assist in the sale of their produce at the other end of the world; and if the Minister is really desirous, as I believe him to be, of framing -regulations which will assist the industry, I suggest that he take steps in the direction I have indicated. There is now in Australia a body which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of butter, and which, I believe, would be only too ready to offer the Minister every assistance possible. For a number of years, the dairymen of Australia have been gradually drawing their interests into one common centre; and,",34,Moisture In Butter

It will readily be conceded, under the circumstances, that the dairying industry is entitled to the fullest consideration at the hands of the Minister; and he ought to hesitate long before he makes any recommendation or regulation which is diametrically opposed to the opinions of the dairymen who have done so much for the producers, and for the country as a whole. have no experience as a farmer; but, with other honourable members of the Labour party, I claim to have a great deal of sympathy with farmers in their struggles to make a living. They have all kinds of difficulties in the first place to obtain their land, and, after they get it, much labour and money have to be expended; and, when their improvements are made, they are confronted with all sorts of risks from fire, pests, and so forth. Labour party has been in the direction of improving the lot of the farmer. farmers do not say so. Labour party towards this question is that, while we do our duty by the farmers, we have also to protect the general public, the consumers. I do not believe there is a single honest farmer who would object to the efforts which are made by the Commonwealth Labour Government to protect the consumers, and see that they get the goods they pay for. The honourable member for Richmond, in the course of his , remarks, used the phrase "" commercial butter."" What is ""commercial butter""? ' Apparently "" commercial butter "" is butter which is sold in a market, in which an agreement has to be come to like that of the two card-players, who were cartooned in the Bulletin many years ago, and who, as a prelude to the game, had to decide the question, "" Shall we play fair or all we know?"" tude is, "" I am willing to play fair in regard to the butter produced and sold in Australia, but I want to be allowed to play all I know when I go into the London market."" for Capricornia, and no one else. the honourable member for Richmond. member propose to amend the motion by providing for "" butter for export "" ? the only kind of butter with which the Commonwealth Government has power to deal. does not propose to start an agitation throughout Australia to allow the local butter-sellers to put 16 per cent, of water into the butter, or to allow 16 per cent, of water to remain he desires, as he says, to be placed on the same footing as the sellers of butter in London. I have here a copy of a resolution passed by the Co-operative Dairying Association of QueenslandMoved by Mr R. T. Read (Downs Co-operative Dairy Co. Ltd.), and seconded by Mr P. M. Bayley (Pittsworth Co-operative Dairy Co. Ltd.) :"" That the feeling of this meeting is that whilst the London Board of Trade standard for moisture is 16 per cent., the moisture contents of Australian butter should stand at this figure, and not be reduced to 15 per cent, as required by the Commonwealth regulations, and that the Secretary forward a copy of this resolution to the whole of our representatives in the Federal House."" twelve months ago.

Those great butter-producing countries, when the law stepped in and made 16 per cent, the legal limit, said there was no obligation on them to furnish dry butter; the law would condone an amount of water up to the extent of 16 per cent. I am sure that the amount of water in butter now is larger than it was when we took up the question, and the consumer would have been better oft if we had never handled the question of water in butter at a l l .

The House of Commons will then pass legislation giving the necessary protection. Dr. Thorpe says that there is no doubt whatever that the effect of the limitation as to the amount of water which may be in butter has worked out to the detriment of the consumer. In Victoria, since 1906, and in New South Wales, butter cannot be sold locally which contains more than 15 per cent, of moisture, and, during the past three seasons, the percentage of moisture in the butter exported from the Commonwealth has been considerably below 14 per cent. expert of Victoria, is of opinion that the 15, per cent, maximum has been of considerable benefit to manufacturers, as it has been found that the lower temperature necessary to keep the moisture within the standard assists in recovering more butter fat in the churning, and thus compensates the facO'Callaghan, the New South Wales dairy expert, has pointed out that butter with a low percentage of moisture is of undoubtedly better quality than butter with a high percentage. The mover of the motion said that increased moisture did not deteriorate the quality of butter. rect. to an expert opinion. Mr O'Callaghan saysI t is a well known fact that if we increase the percentage of water in our butter to anything like 16 per cent., we shall, without a doubt, cause a falling off in the quality of our manufacture. The keeping quality is bound to suffer to a considerable extent, because the process of fermentation which is brought about by bacterial agency will be carried on much more rapidly in the presence of 16 per cent, of water than of 12 per cent. . . . A salted butter containing 16 per cent, of water, unless the maker is a very good artist, will undoubtedly be of a weak texture, and will show a lot of free moisture on being tried with the butter borer. Thus the intending purchaser is prejudiced, and will not feel disposed to buy at top prices. . The more one looks at this question in detail, the more one is inclined to ask the question"" Is the gain that is possible by the manufacture of a butter on the border line of the moisture boundary worth the risk of the bad advertisement which any factory, or country, is sure to gain, if its produce is frequently found on its arrival in England to contain an excessive amount of water?""

In his report for 1910, the Agent-General for Queensland saysNo fault to be found with Queensland butter this season, and we have not had a single case of excessive moisture; this trouble seems to have ceased as regards Australian butter. The increase in imports from Australia is 45 per cent. and 10 per cent., taking Australian aud New Zealand butter imports together. With the improvement now seen in butter imports into this country, the public, finding a better quality available without any increase in price, are buying greater quantities. Give the masses a thoroughly food and reliable article, and a greater consumption may be expected from the same number of people.

I am not here as a special pleader for the dairying industry, but they are asking now, as they have asked continuously for the last twelve months, to be given the same treatment that other-countries are getting. official opinions. Mant to the Minister, dated 22nd February, 1911. He is the butter expert for Messrs. Aplin, Brown, and Crawshay, in Brisbane. He has tbe interests of the industry at heart, and wants to see the right thing done by it, both here and in the Old Country. His firm, who are exporters of butter, are not anxious that the moisture standard should be increased, except to put them on the same footing as exporters from other countries. He saysYou will observe that I advocate 16 per cent, pert; but my own opinion is that inferior maximum, whereas the Federal new regulations are to be 15 per cent, maximum. The London buyers are quite satisfied with 16 per cent, maximum. It is most difficult for a factory to tell exactly what percentage of moisture there is in butteT. I should like the honourable member for Capricornia to listen to my expert's opinion, as I listened carefully to his. great interest, because this matter affects a numerous body of my constituents, and it is only fair that ""the man who represents them should voice their sentiments in Parliament. Mark you, I am doing this, not only on behalf of my constituents as dairy-farmers, but also because I believe their demands to be honest and right. I . am taking this stand more for that reason than for anything else. I think if you were to make inquiries at the out of the pockets of the dairymen. offices of our Department of Agriculture, you will find that the average percentage of moisture in butter exported last year from Queensland is less than 144 per cent. At first glance it would appear that if the average is only '4Â£ season, say, another ,Â£1,150, at 1 per cent., at per cent, why object to 15 per cent, maximum, but it was 14^ per cent, because the factories do not care to run any risk at all of being fined for excessive moisture at 16 per cent. If States. You will observe from these figures this reduction to 15 per cent, maximum comes into force, the factories will pay the dairy farmers 1 per cent, less for their cream, consequently the dairy farmers are 1 per cent, worse off. That is another consideration that appeals to me. We want to benefit the consumer, but the man who is going to lose under this regulation is the man who sends his milk to the creamery. benefit by the adoption of this motion? benefit at all under the present regulation. By requiring a reduction in the percentage of moisture in the butter exported, we simply benefit the butter mixers at the other end. the other end ? not going to trap me in that way. If water were, to be added in the way suggested by the honourable member, the result would be wholesale adulteration, and I should not support anything of the kind. WhatI say is that I believe they mix our butter, which contains a reduced percentage of moisture, with inferior butter. fat, not water. butters, manufactured in, or imported into, Great Britain, and containing a large percentage of moisture, are mixed with the good butter obtained from Australia, so that the moisture contents of butter sold as of Australian production are thereby increased. Mr Mant continuesThe present chart by which cream is purchased from the factories is worked out on the basis of 84.01 per cent, butter fat for 1 lb. of butter, and it is proposed now to prepare a new chart for 84.85 per cent, butter fat, in other words, pay the dairymen the same price for 84.85 per cent, butter fat as against 84.01 per cent, in the old chart. I hope you will induce the Minister not to bring the new regulations into force on the ist July, but get the matter put off until it can be thoroughly threshed out, if . necessary, in Parliament, because it means a tremendous loss for possibly a small gain. During 1909-10 season the imports of Australian butter into England were, say, 1,150,800 boxes, at Â£ 2 ios -,Â£2,877,000 , which, at 1 per cent., means ^28,770. A fairly tidy sum to be taken This season it would be over ,Â£40,000 if the present rate of export continues. Then, besides this, there were some 46,000 boxes exported from Queensland to other places during the 1909-10 a very low valuation, also all the butter that is consumed in Australia as well as the quantity exported to other places by the remaining that it is rather an expensive matter to the dairymen, and it is in no wise a certainty that the butter will bring a higher price by having the moisture reduced. The Federal Government may also argue that Mr Meares, of Sydney, stated that the co-operative companies were prepared to accept 15 per cent, moisture (he did this as the Government in the first instance wanted to make it 14 per cent.) thinking, no doubt, that "" half a loaf was better than no bread,"" but he did not speak for everyone, and",40,Honourable Members H A Ha

324,Mr Page,"1 do not pose as an exhad the' matter been put in the light that I have tried to put it, surely the Government would have agreed to 16 per cent. I fancy the arguments used by the Federal Customs are that they wish the quality of Australian butter to be raised to a higher standard by reducing the maximum moisture to 15 per cent., and they say this ought to assist their object. As far as Queensland is concerned, when the Agricultural Department have any butter submitted for export giving over 16 per cent, moisture, the factory is fined, and the butter must be re-worked and brought down to the correct percentage before it can be exported, and I understand that in only very few instances in England, Queensland brands of butter are fined for excessive moisture, but I believe that the State laws in the South are somewhat different. As far as conveniences of checking the moisture by the Government are concerned, in Queensland the churn marks are put on all the boxes, but in the SouthI believe there are no churn marks put on. The consequence of the latter is this, a consignment of 800 boxes may come in from a factory, the owners do not want it grade marked, so the Government officer picks out 80 boxes, they may only be from five (5) churns (he cannot possibly tell) and they may be found to be right as far as moisture is concerned, and he puts the "" approved for export"" stamp on the whole lot, whereas, there may be some of the' churns that contain excessive moisture, which latter are all exported. In Queensland one box is taken from each churn and the moisture carefully checked. The result is that in Queensland butters the fines in England can be practicallv counted on your fingers, whereas, I understand that there have been hundreds of fines imposed in connection with Southern butters. Possibly this is another argument the Federal people may use for reducing the moisture to 15 per cent., but I should think it is rather rough on Queensland to have to suffer until the present system in vogue in Queensland is given a trial as far as the other States are concerned. That is the opinion of an export agent, and I am satisfied that it is a fair and unbiased one. When I received this letter I made inquiries, both on the Darling Downs and up in the Maranoa, as to the accuracy of the statements which it contained, and every one to whom I spoke-bot h factory managers and dairy-farmers-assure d me that they were absolutely correct. Here is We certainly think that, as far as Queensland is concerned, at any rate, 16 per cent, maximum is necessary. We fail to see why it should be altered, considering that this standard passes the London market, which practically rules the world. If the moisture limit is reduced to 14 per cent, the buyers in London are more likely to reap the benefit than the producers, and there is no doubt about it that butter containing 16 per cent, moisture can be of excellent quality. 1 have no I know anxious to the House revision of the regulation. As' a matter of fact, if J. were the Minister, I would not allow the motion to proceed to a division. The dairying industry ranks third among the industries of Australia, and its exports to England in 1909-10 were approximately of the value of ,Â£2,877,000. Surely that is worth some consideration. I ask the Minister now to agree to the motion. South Wales butter intended for local consumption must not contain more than 15 per cent of moisture. We consume locally s half the butter produced in Australia. New South Wales and Victoria, from the point of view of populaF'on, are the two largest States. Minister posing as a "" States frighter."" He says, in effect, that because a certain thing is required in Victoria and New South Wales, the Commonwealth should take up the same stand. dard should be as good as that of any of the States. argument? Perhaps the honourable member contends that we should keep all the butter, as well as all the money, in the country. If this is another Protectionist argument, then I can well understand the attitude taken up by the Minister, because I regard him as one of the hardest-shelled Protectionists, not merely in this House, but in Australia. so now. has had the opportunity of meeting the Minister in another place, and I ask him whether he ever heard him talk there of Free Trade or Revenue Tariffism?

I am afraid, however, that the Minister is trying to side-track me.

We are not going down on our knees to him. We are not supplicating any favour. the case. has always received my representations with the greatest courtesv. to make this statement; but T feel sure that if the decision of this question were left to him, he would deal with it forthwith. The trouble is that he is tied up with official that there is nothing 'more deceptive than red-tape, ancl is listening to officialdom talking with a big trumpet. better than does the honourable memher that what I say is correct. Ministers is tied up with red-tape, and I am one of those who are ready to come along, not with a pair of scissors, but with a big pair of shears to rip off the red tape and set them free. I ask the Minister to come out of his shell; to do away with officialdom in this matter, and to agree to this motion. have no desire to pose as a dairy expert, but I may say that I have learnt everything relating to dairying, from the milking of the cow to the manufacture of the butter, and the placing of it on the market. As a matter of fact, during the last forty years I have spent my whole energies in the manufacture of butter, so that anything I say to-day will describe my own experiences and express my own opinion. I have no desire to quote the opinions of others, except, perhaps, for the purpose of refuting them. cornia quoted Mr O'Callaghan and Mr made in this House and outside by some of Crowe as dairy experts who he contends have recommended 15 per cent., but if the honourable member will look at the Journal of Agriculture of Victoria of see, under the heading of "" Butter Analysis,"" a table showing the difference in Political ghosts, as we all know, results between butter containing boric acid and butter without any, together with the composition of each. It is shown that in sample numbered 19, the butter contained 83.92 per cent, of fat, 14.50 per cent, of I would vote to-morrow to moisture, .43 per cent, of salt, 1.06 per cent, of curd, and .092 of boric acid, and that the points awarded were 90 per cent. This means, I suppose, points awarded either by Mr Crowe or by some of his experts. In another sample, numbered 37, the fat contents were 88.68 per cent., the moisture contents 9.00 per cent., the salt 1.55 per cent., the curd .77 per cent., and the points awarded were 87 per cent. It will be seen I do not say that that is from this that butter which contained 14.50 per cent, of moisture was awarded three more points than butter which contained only 9 per cent, of moisture. Points may be I am sorry to have awarded on the taste and smell of the men who judge the butter, but analysis is the only sure way of ascertaining the amount of moisture. I know from long experience the moisture contents of butter; it is almost impossible for any one to judge by looking at the butter, or by sticking the trier into It is not. No one knows it. I am surprised to see the evident anxiety of the honourable member for MelEvery one of our bourne to curtail the moisture percentage, and I think such views come with bad grace from a member of the medical profession. I remember, some time ago, I paid a medical gentleman 7s. 6d. for a prescription made up of 1 oz. soda hypo, and 15 ozs. aqua -pura, and I paid a chemist 2s. 6d. for making up that prescription; but I can believe that the water was the better part of the medicine. Some twelve months ago, when a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Co-operative Companies, he said he would give the 15 per cent, regulation at least twelve months' trial, although experience all over the world has fixed 16 per cent, as reasonable. In order to show that the industry is an important one and deserves some consideration, I may point out that the figures for 1910, whicli are the latest available, show that there was in that year exported from Australia 87,894,943 lbs., The honourable member for Caprivalued at ,Â£3.951,131.

I wish to emphatically deny the imputation that butter manufacturers have any desire to adulterate their product. The honourable member for Richmond has made out a very good case, and 'has given us a let of expert opinion as to how butter should be manufactured, and so on. absolutely necessary, in order to make good butter, to wash it thoroughly, and the next question is-Ho w much moisture should be taken out, or how much should be left in, good butter? Of course, what the honourable member for Capricornia desires to pump into the ears of the people of Australia seems a terrible indictment, but may T remind him that every ton of bread which is consumed contains half a ton of moisture? Vet nothing is said about that matter. I think that this new regulation will confer no benefit upon the producers; but, in time to come, it will undoubtedly lead to more adulteration than exists at present. Its only object is to protect the consumer on the other side of the water, who, 1 am quite sure, is well able to protect himself. It simply means allowing blenders oversea to manipulate our dry butter to their own advantage. M.'r. HIGGS -Ho w can it be manipulated ? of our butter is being bought up for blending purposes. Quite recently a considerable quantity of it was sent away in an unsalted condition. That butter will be bought up -by blenders on the other side of the world, I believe the commercial and milk, and probably water, will be pumped into it. Every ounce of moisture that we take out of it here merely affords -an opportunity to blenders oversea to put exactly that much more into it. I wish now to refer to an answer which was given by the Minister of Trade and Customs to a question which was put to him on the 10th July by the honourable member .for Maranoa. The honourable member askedAt Whether he is aware that the British Board of Trade regulations allow butter containing up to 16 per cent, of moisture to be imported into Great Britain from any' part of the world? I am quite sure that the Minister was not responsible for the reply given to that question, which reads1. Yes; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to, or influence on, the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class butter, and enhance its reputation abroad. The following, table shows the average moisture contents in butters tested for export from the Commonwealth and New Zealand during the past three years :State. inoo-io. i g i o n. Per cent. Per cent. N.S.W., all butters ... 13.3 ... 13.8 Victoria, all butters ... 13.07 ... 13.8 Queensland, all butters ... 13.5 ... 13.6 It is S. Australia, all butters * ... 11.85 New Zealand, all butters 13.27 ... 14.02 Now. it has been contended that since this new regulation came into force there has been an increase in the moisture contents of butter. I do not think that tlfat is the case. It is a well-known fact that during the past year the Department which has charge of this matter has paid a great deal more attention to butter than it did pre. viously. During the past twelve months more samples have been tested by it than were tested formerly. HereI may be permitted to interpolate that it is not the sample that shows the most free moisture which contains the most moisture. The honourable member for Richmond was a little mixed upon this aspect of the question, but with tbe remainder of his speech I am in entire agreement. When I refer to "" free "" moisture, I mean moisture which will run away from butter or shows itself freely. I wish now to refer to an article which was written by Mr Crowe, and pubA large proportion lished in the Agricultural Journal. It is a very useful article, although, to some extent, it tells against the argument which I am now advancing.

In speaking of the moisture contents of butter, he says that the average moisture contents of all samples analyzed during the past year was 13.91, as against 13.82 for 1910-11. That is an increase of only .9 per cent. He further says that the Western District averaged 14.12 per cent., the Co-operative factories showed a percentage of 14.9, and the proprietary of 14.15. In Gippsland the average was 14.06; Co-operative, 14.12; proprietary, 13.89. In . the north and northeast, the average was 14.01; Co-operative, 13,96 ; proprietary, 14.16. In the city the average was 13.74. This is what I particularly wish to call attention toOne hundred and thirty-one consignments, representing Ave thousand and eight boxes, contained over fifteen per cent. The following is a summary of the 3,394 samples analyzedover 16 per cent., 45 samples, 1.33 per cent.; over 15 per cent., 154 samples,. 4.53 per cent.; over 14 per cent., 1,458 samples, 42.96 per cent.; ported the matter to the manager, Mr Grant. over 13 per cent., 1,231 samples, 36.27 per cent.; Will the Postmaster-General have inquiry _ at under 13 per cent., 506 samples, 14.91 per cent. It will be seen that, although the average moisture contents in Victoria were 13.91, a large number of samples were tested which contained over that amount, whilst 199 odd samples contained over 15 per cent.

I think that the position of 1 politicians generally 'is this-that newspapers can say whatever they like about them, as long as they report them fairly, and give the public an opportunity of learning the true facts on which the journals comment. Unfortunately, however, that is not the experience of honourable members in this House. For instance, I hold in my hand a copy of a report sent to the Sydney Morning Herald about the debates in this House last week. Of course, this is not the first time that the creature who is responsible for these reports-and I say, as an old newspaper man, that in my opinion he is utterly incompetent for the position in which, he is placed is the only way to make them sit up.

He speaks of the action, of the honourable member for Herbert in opposing the adoption of the Queensland scheme as being a "" pitiable appeal to his fellow-members to get him what he called a fair deal."" Then there is an implication that Ministers were insincere in voting in favour of the report of the Commissioners, and that the whole thing was a put-up job. The real truth is, of course, that Ministers took a very high stand, quite different to that of the late Government in similar circumstances. isters had followed the precedent established by honourable members opposite, they [61] would have voted for the rejection of the Commissioners' report. I think, personally, I happen to know sufficient about that Ministers acted under a mistaken sense of loyalty to the Commissioners. The. latter are fallible human beings, liable to err like the rest of us; and if the House thinks they have made an error, there is no . reflection on them in sending their report back for reconsideration.

External Affairs) [4.15] -On behalf of the Postmaster-General, I undertake to make inquiries into the matters to which the honourable member has referred. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [4.16] I wish to ask the Attorney-General when his Department will be in a position to announce the best way of giving effect to the policy of the Minister of Defence on the question of the fining of cadets for non-attendance at drill ? _ Industrial authority; and shall to the extent of justice seems to have been meted out in a number of these cases in New South Wales. The lads are called up before stipendiary magistrates, and bundled through without any consideration being given to their cases. In Several instances it could have been shown, if the boys had been allowed to state their case, that it was impossible for them to attend the drills, but the magistrates, as I have often noticed in Police Courts, have the lads simply bundled up and charged, no statement of the case is allowed, the cases are run through as fast as possible, and a fine or imprisonment awarded. I understand that the Minister' of Defence has decided to adopt a policy of fining the lads 2s. for each hour lost at drill, and compelling them to make up their lost time. He stated that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's Department on 25th July, so that the necessary steps could be taken to enable the Governor General in Council to give effect to his ideas. I wish to impress on the Attorney-General the urgency of inviting the officers of his Department to go into the matter immediately, so that the cases of injustice which are occurring under the law as it stands may be remedied. Another matter to which I wish to direct -the attention of the Attorney-General is the' Bill that has been drafted by the . Victorian Cabinet to provide for the voluntary surrender to the Commonwealth of various additional powers and functions, on the lines agreed upon at the State Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne early this year. The measure proposes to refer to the Commonwealth, under section 51 of the ConstitutionThe control of labour and employment, so far as is necessary to enable the Federal Parliament to prevent and settle industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, and to provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order of any authority constituted under any law of the Commonwealth for the prevention or settlement of any such industrial dispute shall, if such authority so .determine, be a common rule of the industry concerned in the case of any State or States where1. Wages or conditions of employment in the industry have been determined by a State industrial authority, or 2. There is no State industrial authority empowered to determine wages or conditions of employment in the industry. Provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order or common rule of such authority shall be binding upon all persons subject to such award, or common rule, notwithstanding that such persons may be subject to the award or order of any State inany inconsistency prevail over such last-mentioned award or order. That is so involved that I , as a layman, cannot understand what the proposed transfer of industrial powers amounts to. Will the Attorney-General arrange with tbe officers of his Department to draft a memorandum indicating to honourable members what it really means? There is another proposed transfer of power with regard to monopolies which is stated in this wayOn the question of monopolies, the Bill will provide for the surrender to the Commonwealth of authority overCombinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services so far as is necessary to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to control or to acquire on just terms the business or industry of any such combination or monopoly, when such business or industry extends beyond the limits of any one State, and when such combination or monopoly has been declared by the High Court to be in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or to carry on the business or industry so extending by or under the control of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to the exclusion, if the Parliament of the Commonwealth so determines, of all other persons; or to acquire upon just terms any property used in connection with such business or industry of any such combination or monopoly. I am in the same position with regard to this proposal. This is a matter which concerns the Commonwealth Parliament as well as the State Parliament, and I think that honourable members might very well have the services of the Attorney-General's",48,National League Mis

Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes, there is a full stop there. colon. Mr J. H . CATTS -This explanation reminds me of a definition of monopoly which I saw in an American Act, and -which it took me a quarter of an hour to read. It seems to me that all that is necessary to complete this wonderful explanation of the third power proposed to be transferred is that there should be added to it the American definition of monopoly which I have mentioned. decided that, that was "" bunkum."" Mr J. H . CATTS -The Legislature of the United States took practically a -whole page of a Bill to define a monopoly, and in an American case, the record of which I saw, the Judge decided that the -combination concerned was not a monopoly. It is very desirable that we should have a memorandum prepared by the Attorney General's Department, to supply us with precise information as to the extent of the proposed transfer of powers from the States to the Commonwealth. There is another matter to which I refer, which concerns the Minister of the Departrnent for External Affairs. As the honourable gentleman is not present at the moment, I hope that he will see the report of my remarks later on, and will make inquiry into the matter. In the Sydney Sun during last week, an article appeared from the pen of Harry S. Gullett, dated from London, 21st June, in regard to the immigration policy of the New South Wales GoI quote the following paraTBI FAMIL Y SCANDAL. Another point about which the emigration agents are concerned is the almost absolute refusal of New South Wales to accept working men with families. LatelyI have heard of .a number of cases of farm labourers of the best kind, and also of small farmers possessed of a little capital, who have been refused assistance to New South Wales. They are told that they cannot be accepted because of their children. One recognises the difficulty of placing such men in country employment. Obviously the farmer who wants a labourer fails to sec why he should be obliged to support the labourer's wife and half-a-dozen youngsters too young to be of any assistance. But, while adimmigration movement should find it impossible to include the very best material that is on offer. The proportion of ultimate failures among child emigrants would certainly be much lower than that among adults. It is extremely difficult to explain to the British people that an immigration scheme which is really sincere can find no room for the healthy growing child. New South Wales has been especially hostile to children; Queensland has been far more sympathetic, and so has Victoria; while Canada has also had an open door for them. They are carried cheaply by the shipping companies, and it is a great pity that the State Government cannot devise some means to receive all that are on offer. I do not know whether that statement is correct, and I should be very sorry to think that it is. I refer, to the matter because this Parliament cannot altogether escape responsibility in connection with the question of immigration. It is one of the matters over which we have authority under the Constitution. If we find that the State Governments are carrying out an unsatisfactory immigration policy, if is, in my opinion, our duty to exercise our authority. I suggest that the Minister of External Affairs should make inquiries from the New South Wales Government with respect to the matter to which I have directed attention. rise to correct the honourable member for Coolgardie. He stated that at Ashburton there were sixty-four votes. That is not accurate, because, as a matter of fact, there were only fifty-four electors enrolled there.

I do not think that any member of a Commonwealth Government has so far been so ridiculous as to employ a courier. Such a statement as I have referred to should be corrected at the earliest possible moment. Another statement which could only emanate from a lady of not very high intelligence, but vast imagination, was that we shall have to spend ,Â£50,000,000 in the next two years because the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches.
