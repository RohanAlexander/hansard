What has become of the cheaply paid labour in this industry in Great Britain? Why do not the confectionery manufacturers who employ cheap labour sweep out of existence the workmen employed by Cadbury's, Fry's, and Rowntree's? The truth is-as has been pointed 'out again and again by political economists-that highly paid workmen do not require protection against poorly paid labour, because, of the two, the latter is the most ineffective. The honourable member for Yarra, recognising that the reputation of. such firms as Cadbury's was beyond assault, took refuge in the insinuation that certain Scottish firms sweated their employees, and that large quantities of their confectionery were imported into the Commonwealth. firms have representatives here, and One of those representatives who heard the insinuation in regard to the bad conditions imposed upon the operatives, immediately took action to refute it. It is to be regretted that an honourable member will utter words which are put into his mouth by interested people, without first taking the trouble to satisfy himself as to their accuracy. that anybody put the words into my mouth. member made the statement which he did, he ought to have supplied the Committee with facts. with the Scottish firm .in question ? successfully indeed. I hold in my hand a copy of two telegrams sent by a representative of one of these Scottish importing firms to his firm in Glasgow asking them to telegraph immediately what is the average wage paid to their workmen. The following is the reply received, adding necessary words to make it intelligible:Above the age of eighteen, the average wage had, in 1906, increased to 1,043. is 32s. weekly. The honourable member for Yarra is sufficiently well acquainted with the labour conditions in the old country to know that such is by no means a sweating wage, but that, as a matter of fact, taking the difference in the cost of living as between the two countries, it compares favourably with the average paid in Australia. At any rate, here is proof positive that one of the Scotch firms, regarding whom insinuations were made, pay what is, so far as the old country is concerned, a high wage. The principal witness before the Commission on this subject was Mr Robertson. His evidence was undoubtedly given frankly, and with the object of supplying all reasonable information; and he did not for a moment insinuate that he had to compete with sweated labour in connection with importations. He stated what I believe is the fact, that, so far as the higher classes of confectionery are concerned-and these form the bulk of the importations-hig h wages are paid, not only in Great Britain, but even on the continent of Europe. Some of the men employed on the continent earn as much as .£3 o r £ A a week; but these are special cases, and that rate does not apply to the Fortunately, these majority. Here, at any rate, we have an Australian industry which has to face a certain amount of competition, not from poorly paid labour, but from well paid labour. The honourable member for Yarra, while pointing out the increased importation of confectionery, had to admit that there has been a certain increase in local production, though he argued that the local increase is not proportionate to the importation. However, I say think that if the honourable' member for Yarra goes into the figures again, he will find that the increase in the local production is in greater ratio than the increase of importation. increase in the local production is represented by 13 per cent., while the increase in the importation is represented by 42 per cent. ness of the honourable member's deduction*, If we take Victoria as a fair illustration, we find, according to the report of the Inspector of Factories, that in 1905 the number of hands employed in the confectionery industry was 797, which number refers to appendix B of the same report, he will see that the increase in the number is only fifty-five.

62,Mr Henry Willis (Robertson),"practically the trade is in the hands, of AusAustralia, and is a. credit to the Common' tralians; and if a duty be placed on importations, the result, undoubtedly, will be to increase the cost of imported goods. We must remember that whatever duties we impose there must be some importation of all classes of goods; and the increase in price caused by the Tariff enables the local manufacturer, who has command of the trade, to increase his price to the consumer. That is a natural result of a highly protective Tariff; it ceases to be protective, and becomes taxation. Theduty in itself will result in only a small amount of revenue, but, as a matter of fact, it is imposed on the whole consumption, though in regard to the latter we, of course, have no statistics. It seems to me that such a duty confers no benefit on the general consumer, though, of course, it is of great advantage to those engaged in the trade by enabling them to obtain higher prices. Statistics go to show that their output has increased enormously, and that there has also been an increase in the number of persons employed in the making of the various brands of confectionery. According to a return furnished to the Tariff Commission, the number of employees in the confectionery business in New South Wales in 1899 was 613,. and in 1904 839, while in Alctoria the numbers were 727 and 995 respectively. Therefore, in this State, in five years the number of the employees in the' business has increased by more than 250. . These facts show that the industry is by no means declining, and that it will not suffer if we do not increase the duty on confectionery. Last night the > honourable member for Yarra stated that although the higher rates of duties are now being collected, prices have not been increased to the consumer, that the child who enters a lolly shop gets as much for his pence as he received formerly. the retail sellers have to pay more for their supplies. The honourable member for Yarra spoke of this condition of things .as something in favour of the Trust; but I interjected that the small storekeepers were really being sweated, and I' contend again now that, in supporting the present arrangement, the honourable member is giving countenance to the sweat-' itig of the labour engaged in the work of distribution, because, when 'goods are sold by the ounce, those who sell them may well, be spoken of as labourers. The confectionery industry is well established in' Mr Henry Willis. wealth. Free-traders like to see up-to-date factories' which are able to stand alone, and it is an eye-opener to go through some of the factories here.. The industry being so well established, it is absurd to speak of fostering or protecting it. Higher rates of duty are not. necessary for its protection, and, if agreed to,, can only have the effect of taxing the community for the benefit of the manufacturers in the industry, who. have practically the command of the trade of the Commonwealth. Therefore, it is no longer a question of free-trade or protection. One of the witnesses examined before the Tariff Commission, said that, the importations of confectionery did not affect the local manufacturers, that the over-sea competition was not worth considering, the local trade being strong enough to stand on' its own. According to him, it is the Australian competition that is affecting the local makers. They are cutting into one another's trade, and thus reducing their profits. It is not the duty of Parliament to interfere under these circumstances. Competition is the soul of business, and firms that are not up-to-date and able to compete with, 'their rivals must go under. Prior to the passing, of the Kingston Tariff, there were in New South Wales manufactures which had not been fostered by hot-house treatment, but established under free-trade, and when, on the consummation of Federation, were able to compete on equal terms in the Victorian market, the Victorian manufacturers had speedily to get rid of the obsolete machinery with which they had been making a good living under the old Victorian Tariff. Of course, the man in the street is always ready to give information on this or any other subject; but a witness who is under examination on oath, and liable to But punishment for giving false testimony, is much more ctareful. Therefore the statements contained in the evidence attached to the reports of the Tariff Commission must be taken in preference to irresponsible statements. Some of the witnesses who asked for higher rates of duty had commenced business only since the imposition of the Kingston Tariff, and', notwithstanding, were doing very well. They thought, however, that if the importation of confectionery were reduced, they would get a larger output. But, as I have shown, it is the local competition that does most to reduce prices, and men who have been in business for only a short time can mot expect to be so successful as firms of long standing, who have agencies everywhere., and ;are doing things ona large' scale. If the small makers -are earning a good living, ""we ""may be sure that the large -manufacturers .are Amassing wealth. It is highly creditable to the industry that wages have increased; .that the employers who ;are doing well themselves are paying .good wages to their workmen. Of course, they expect high-class work from them. In some of the factories .in Melbourne, artists .are employed in the manufacture of confectionery, and, -of course, must be paid high wages. Employment is -given to large numbers of active, well-dressed, respectable girls, who are well paid. This 'being the state >of the industry under ,the old duties, why .should -we increase the -rate, seeing that ithe effect of such action 'can be -only to increase prices or to sweat the retailers.? . worth of confectionery is imported annually.. Sir -WILLIAM LYNE --Tb e total importation is valued at ^120,000. confectionery imported -consists .of high class chocolate manufactures and preserved fruits, which are most delicious, and are ;got up most .attractively, largely by French firms. This is confectionery which you can put on your table without the fear of causing dyspepsia to your guests, ancl we should take steps to make it reasonably cheap, and within the reach of all classes. portation of high-class confectionery from abroad, the trade of the local manufacturers is increasing largely, and I -understand that nowhere in Australia is better confectionery made than in Victoria. Under these .circumstances, the 'Committee -w'll :be well advised if it adopts the sugposing duties much higher than those recomgestions of the Tariff Commission. I find that in respect to some of these items both -sections agreed that certain duties be imposed, and I fail to understand why the Minister should have taken tlie extreme course of imposing duties, 50 per cent., -and, in some cases, roo per cent., in excess of the increases -recommended even by the protectionist section of the Commission. The confectioners of this State, who appeared before the Commission, showed that they were able to thrive under the Victorian Tariff, and the Commission, recognising that a considerable' sum had been invested in"" the industry arid that it was worth preserving, after a careful consideration of evidence put before it by trade experts, made certain recommendations, the adoption of which by the Parliament would it believed do justice to the industry. Surely those recommendations ought to have some weight with the Committee. The free-trade and protectionist sections of the Commission agreed that on the ordinary class of cheap confectionery in respect of which there is no competition worth mentioning a duty of 2d. per lb. should be imposed. The Government, however, have proposed a -duty of 3f d. per lb. 'On orna mental confectionery the 'Government pro pose a duty of 25 per cent., whilst the protectionist section of the Commission recommend a duty of 2d. per lb. ©ID -cocoa and chocolate the -Government propose a duty of 2^d. per lb.; the free-trade section of the Commission recommended that a duty '©f i d . per lb. should be imposed, whilst the protectionist -section recommended a duty of 2d. per ""lb.

Under; the circumstances, I control myself, and say no more than I can possibly avoid; a Minister who desires expedition must not speak too often or too long. While I am on my feet, however, I wish to urge upon honourable members that the existence of a combine has nothing whatever to do with the Government proposal. I may say that I have information which leads me to suppose that there is a combine; and I think I am at liberty to go 61 so far as to say that the matter has been inquired into by the Crown Law Officers, who have some very important information, on which action is likely to be taken.

It has been contended that the .Government proposal means a large IfI increase of the duty. I take it that before Federation the States may be taken to have known something of their own business in regard to fiscal matters. I have here figures which show that before Federation the duty on confectionery in New South Wales-owin g to the same influence which is felt on the benches opposite-wa s onlyid. per lb. dustry was flourishing. In Victoria, prior to Federation, the duty was 2d. per lb., or 25 per cent.; in Queensland, 46. per l b ; in South Australia, 3d. per lb.; in Tasmania, 2d per lb.; and in Western Australia, 4d per lb. In Canada, at the same period, the duty was £d. per lb., and 35 per cent., which worked out at an average of 3 d. per lb. This inx formation has just been handed to me by the Comptroller-General. The duty that was first proposed on this particular item in 1002 for the Commonwealth,, was 2d. per lb., and 15 per cent.; but that was rein 1902, on cocoa and chocolate, was i d . per lb., and on other confectionery 2d., with 20 per cent, on ornamental confectionery and so forth-the duties varied.

For thereasons that I have stated, I do not wish to dwell on this subject, but I have given shortly the grounds on which the Government have proposed to increase the rates, which, undoubtedly, were too greatly reduced'by the Tariff of 1902. I wish to see the making of confectionery in Australia increase; we should not import any. If there is a nettle in the shape of a combine, we should grasp it . firmly. and have been urging certain action in connection with this and with others. Something should be done, and when the Bill which is in the other House is passed, I think that pretty drastic action will be taken, which will show that we mean business. haps it is well that the Minister does not often address the Committee in explanation of the items of the Tariff, because he seems unable to get on his feet without making personal and offensive references tothose who sit in Opposition. Sir WILLIAM LYNE not give us the information we ask for, he should at least set an example of courtesy. Ministers are the worse offenders, they are the most discourteous men in the Chamber. But they are mistaken if they think that they can bullock the Tariff through, and silence honourable members.

If the Minister will not give an explanation, the item""' will not be passed as quickly as he may think. We shall insist on getting an explanation from some quarter. The facts which have been laid before the Committee show that there is a combine among the manufacturers of confectionery in Australia whose operations are injuriously affecting both retailers and consumers, their object being to restrict trade and to increase prices. In spite of the denials made last night, a price list was read, which shows that increases have been made in a large number of linesI think over fifty.

Not only is the confectionery combine dealing unfairly with retailers, and raising prices, but it has even resorted to methods of cheating. That is shown by a series of complaints set out in a letter in my possession, in which the writer, a well-known retail confectioner, says, after referring to several grounds of complaintThis shows that the public of Australia are already very heavily handicapped and the shopkeepers here are in a worse position than those in England, for we have not got the population to completely and withwork on, our rents are higher, cost of gas over curtailment.

The traveller told me there was trouble about my delaying the carters, and that I was to weigh them myself, and what was short he would always (and did) allow me for. ( I pity the shop-keeper who was not sharp enough to find out the above.) Those who have been shrewd enough to weigh their boxes, and thus to discover that they were getting short weight, have been able to demand that it shall be made up, but those who have not suspected trickery have been, and probably still are, the victims of it. strong enough to punish those who do these things. that is necessary.

One manufacturer who refused to join has been debarred from handling the goods of those in the Combine, and the middleman had to, and did, close their account with the manufacturer because he refused to join the Combine; and he told me in confidence that he had good reason to believe the Combine has tried to sjtop his sunnlies of sugar. I respectfully submit that there is need for a Government inquiry, and I honestly believe, if instituted, we can procure, evidence that would be the means of showing that a great attempt has been made to introduce the muchdreaded American combine or trust system. I agree with that contention. The writer makes allegations, which I understand he is prepared to substantiate, showing that there is ample reason for making an inquiry as to the composition and operations of this Combine, and others which are said to be carrying on business in the Commonwealth-and more particularly in Victoria-and whose monopolies we are asked to bolster up by increased duties.

At the same time, it must be admitted that no more time has been occupied in this debate than is necessary to place the case clearly before the Committee. It has been stated by at least one retail confectioner in Melbourne, in a letter to the press recently, that, so great is the demand 'for imported confectionery, as compared with the demand for the local article, that forty-nine boxes of imported milk chocolate can be sold for one of local -manufacture. This is evidence that the public taste inclines for the imported article, so far as this particular class of -confectionery is concerned. there are other branches of the trade in which the local product can command a -ready sale, and hold its own against competition from any source. Chocolate and cocoa should not be regarded as ordinary hard for the extra duty. -confectionery, seeing that they are the -staple food of the sick room and the employers or operatives for asking for a nursery, containing as they do very valuable nutritive properties. A duty such as that proposed by the Government really places an embargo on the best classes of chocolate and cocoa; and we ought to discriminate between such articles and confectionery which is used simply for pleasure. Under free-trade conditions in New South Wales, Messrs. Griffiths Brothers were able, not only to manufacture cocoa, but to successfully compete with the Victorian manufacturers, who were protected by a duty of 3d. per lb.; and one of the first actions of the Victorian Combine was to endeavour to prevent New South Wales So that we are manufacturers from doing business in that State. Mr Robertson himself, in his evidence given before the Tariff Commission, admits that there is no justification for the proposed duty. He says that the continental competition does not seriously affect his business; and he added that he did not think that, so far as some of ""the continental manufacturers were concerned, he was placed at a disadvantage, because he had been told that the men who tolerably well paid, receiving £ 2 , £ 3 , so? £ 4 , and in some cases as high as £ 5 per week.

Act which was passed last year provides that every article shall carry a tag giving information as to weight and so forth, so that MacRobertsons, if this slip were not included in their boxes of confectionery, would be breaking the law. This, I think, is sufficient to show that the firm referred to is not doing the class of business suggested by the honourable member for Grey; indeed, the firm has no need to do so. The only argument that the honourable member for Grey can find in opposition to the proposed increase of duty is the fact' that there is a combine in the confectionery trade.

I have shown that the statements of the honourable members for Dalley and North Sydney were incorrect, and that the honourable member for Grey objected to the proposals of the Government merely on the ground that there is a combine. But the manufacturers and workers of Australia haying asked for extra protection, I appeal to the Committee to grant it to them, and to keep out importations which, last year, were valued at jQi20,000. We can make our own confectionery. Even the honourable member for Parkes has admitted that Australian confectionery is nearly as good as the imported. He could hardly be expected to say quite as good; but, twelve months hence, he will find it equally good. I shall have much pleasure in supporting the proposals of the Government. I hope that Ministers will stick to their guns, and carry the rates set down in the schedule. regret that the debate is not proceeding more rapidly. If second-reading speeches are to be made on every item, it seems to me that we shall not dispose of the Tariff for another two years; but if the Government are prepared to adopt reasonable measures to expedite the discussion of the duties and I feel satisfied that if we were to calcuI shall be very glad to assist them. My desire is that we shall push on with the business of the House in order that the affairs of the Commonwealth may be attended to in the way that the people expect. I have listened to this debate with a good deal of interest, and although I do not profess to have an expert knowledge of the manufacture of confectionery, I think that a case has been made out for an increased duty. Under the States Tariffs the duties on confectionery were as follows.:-Victoria, 2d. per l b . ; New South Wales and Queensland, 4d per l b . ; South, Australia, 3d. per l b . ; Tasmania and, I understand, Western Australia, 4d. per lb. Under the Victorian Tariff certain drawbacks were allowed in respect to sugar and glucose used in the manufacture of confectionery, the effect of which was to place the manufacturers in a much better position than the mere imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. would suggest. Under the first Federal Tariff the duties were reduced to i d . and 2d. per.lb., with the result that the value of our importations of confectionery increased from ^71,575 in 1902 to £110,281 in 1906. There was a steady increase of imports under the old Tariff. I am prepared to admit that the conditions of labour in the old country are in certain respects very reasonable. There is no occasion in this connection to talk about the existence of sweating in Great Britain. We know that most of the manufactures imported from the old land are made under very favorable circumstances. But it is our duty to look first of all to the industries of Australia. Older nations have to compete with exportations from Great Britain, and although they should be able to carry on their industries under a much lower Tariff than Australia can do, we find that they are not doing so. I have in mind Canada, the United States of America, and Germany, which are not exposed to the same dangers that confront us, and do not need population as we do. The industries of Germany and the United States, and their sources of production, are well developed. side their most formidable competitors. phase of the question. I am not greatly impressed with the argument that is con-, stantly advanced that our importers labour under special disadvantages owing to the long distance freights which they have to bear. Ocean freights at present are extremely low, late the amount of freightage required to distribute goods from Melbourne or Sydney to every other part of the Commonwealth we should find that the manufacturers in those cities have no advantage over the manufacturers of Great Britain, who are distributing their goods throughout Australia. I shall probably be met with the reply that the Melbourne manufacturer should confine the distribution of his goods to Victoria; but .1 would remind the Committee that our intention in establishing Inter-State free-trade was that manufactories indigenous to the different States should be able to distribute their goods and wares, all over the Commonwealth. Taking that fact into consideration, I fail to understand in what respect the manufacturer in Melbourne or in Sydney is in a better position in regard to the distribution of his goods over the Commonwealth than is the manufacturer in Great Britain who exports to Australia. The argument as to the natural protection enjoyed by our producers is one which if properly sifted will be found to have very little force. According to the Customs returns, the percentage of duty on confectionery under the old Tariff was about 25",32,Thomson I T Is The Duced To I D The Duty Which Was Fixed

The Canadian duty is equal to about 40 per cent.; the duties under the United States Tariff range from 50 to 100 per cent.; and those under the German Tariff from about 40 to 50 per cent. I think that the duty proposed by the Government is rather high, and my present intention is to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Fawkner, that the general duty be reduced to 3d. per lb. and that against imports from Great Britain to 2|d. per lb. The duty of 3d. per lb. would be equal to about 37 per cent., or less than those imposed on confectionery by the well-established nations to which I have referred. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the possibility of being able to meet the honourable member for Fawkner, whose proposal I shall have much pleasure in supporting. [2.52] I congratulate my honourable friends in the Opposition corner on their extreme generosity and moderation. They are prepared to stretch their fiscal conscience to the extent of giving the manufacturers in Melbourne all that they have ever asked for. The Tariff Commission, having sifted their statements, recommended a duty of 2d. instead of the 3d. per lb. for which they asked. son appeared before the Commission, the Chairman put to him the following questionI t has been suggested by one firm that a duty of 3d. or 4d. per lb. should be placed upon confectionery in order to remove your grievances. What do you say to that proposal? The witness repliedMy own suggestion, which has been endorsed by the Victorian Manufacturing Confectioners' Association, is that the duty should be increased to 3d. per lb. My honourable friends in the Opposition corner"" will therefore see that in the generosity of their hearts, and after analyzing the whole situation, they are falling into the position prepared for them by the Protectionist Association of Victoria.. It is evident as we proceed with the consideration of these duties that the schedule has been specially prepared for the purpose of enabling the Government to make concessions to the Committee. The statement made by the Minister and published in the Daily Telegraph on Monday last is quite correct; he expected that reductions would be made, and, in framing the schedule, provided for them. This is one of the duties which have been specially set up in order that they may again be removed by the Minister with a show of apparent generosity and fairness. All that the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria have ever asked for is a duty of 3d. per lb., and the Minister simply imposed a duty of 3fd., in order that he should be able to take off the extra f d . when pressed to do so and still reach the point for which he set out-givin g the manufacturing confectioners of Victoria the duties they want or expect. It seems that the industry has been suffering from the 1 imposition of duties on its raw materials. That is made clear by the evidence given by Mr Robertson when before the Commission. duty on some of the raw materials used by confectioners has been increased by i d . per lb. that the honourable member will vote for that increased duty. He is about as strong a protectionist as I have met in this Chamber. So far as the policy of protection is concerned he is much stronger than the man he displaced. In our efforts to reduce the duties, we could get a little help from his predecessor, but I look in vain to the honourable member for any fiscal moderation. When before the Commission, Mr veloped and prospered, that his Inter-State trade had expanded, and that everything that could assist to make him a rich and prosperous manufacturing confectioner was really taking place under the old duties. All that he urged before the Commission was that he should be relieved of some of the duties on his raw materials. If that were done, he said, he would be perfectly content. He was examined by Senator Clemons as followsYour chief trouble is the cost of your raw material?-That is a very .serious infliction. Your principal difficulty arises not from the operation of a low Tariff but from that of a high Tariff ?-It cuts both ways There is a high duty upon our raw material which did not previously exist, and a lower duty upon confectionery. Which of the two hurts you most?I am inclined to think that it is the increased Tariff upon the raw materials. You are more concerned in obtaining a reduction of the duties at present operative than an increase of them?-The confectioners seek both a decrease upon their ,raw materials and an increase in the duty upon imported confectionery. But you chiefly seek a decrease of duty?-Of course, it is a matter of calculation; but from a superficial view I would prefer to have the duty removed from the raw material.",33,Thomson I T Is The Duced To I D The Duty Which Was Fixed

219,When Mr Robert,"Robertson said that his industry had deto give particulars about the cost of glucose. well alone, instead of imposing upon these Glucose has not been increased in price. It is quite clear that Mr Robertson was prospering under the operation of the old Tariff, and all that he asked was that ; he should be relieved of some of the duties which were imposed upon his raw materials. If those duties were retained, he desired that the dury should be increased to 3d. per lb. 'The Government, in their generosity, propose to make it 3!3. per lb. It seems to me that Victorian manufacturers have merely to prefer a request in order to have it granted. Why should this Parliament, which represents, not only the manufacturers, but also the consumers, accept the statement of any manufacturer who chooses to come along ? We do not act in that way in connection with ordinary business bargains. So far as I am able to ascertain, we have every reason to be proud of the position which our manufacturers occupy. I only hope that they will continue to grow and prosper. time ever arise when they are able to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth in the matter of confectionery, none will rejoice more than I will, so long as they supply them upon reasonable conditions. I believe that Mr Robertson conducts an establishment which is a credit to him in every way. I have tasted his confectionery, and I pronounce it to be excellent. I only hope that great prosperity will attend the efforts of those who have embarked their capital in this enterprise. But it seems to me that they have already attained a fair measure of success, and that there is no justification for piling the proposed duties upon the consumers. Statistics show that last year, in Victoria alone, there was ah increase in the number of hands employed in this industry of 248. The honourable member for Yarra stated last evening that the importations of confectionery have materially increased during the past few years. But even he had to admit that there has been a large increase in the local manumuch imported. facture of confectionery. The fact is that the increased importation is the best possible index to the increased prosperity of Australia.. In good seasons our importation of confectionery must necessarily increase to a greater extent than the local product, because that importation consists largely of particular brands of confectionery which have not yet attained to their proper development in the Commonwealth. Seeing that the industry is doing well-that it is prospering in every way-w e ought to let articles higher duties, which will most assuredly be passed on to the consumer. The honourable member for Batman has man, of Sydney. It is almost a pity that the names of individuals have been mentioned during this debate. It would have been far better if the names of Mr Robertson and Mr Stedman had been kept out of the discussion, and if we had debated this question in an impersonal way. I do not know any of these gentlemen personally, but I believe that they are men of high repute and of strict integrity. Reference-has been made to the fact that Mr Stedman did not appear beforethe Tariff Commission to ask for an increased duty. But his absence has been explained by the honourable member for Batman, who has son to make the request for him. Why should Mr Stedman, who is almost solely Should the an importer of confectionery, depute Mr Robertson, who is interested in its manufacture, to represent him before the Tariff Commission? The fact that he did so is conclusive evidence, to.my mind, that Mr Stedman is a member of the Confectionery Combine, which has now reached Inter-State proportions, and whose operations, I venture to say, will have to be investigated very shortly. Everybody knows that this Combine is spreading all over Australia, and that it not only controls the manufacture of confectionery here, but that it virtually controls the importation of chocolate as well. I think that the Treasurer ought to promise to have a strict inquiry made into tlie conditions surrounding this industry. If what is alleged be true, the Confectionery Combine is already beginning to act in restraint of trade. We are told that a higher duty is required upon confectionery. Why? member has not answered my question, but has merely put it a stage further back. Why is an increased duty required? not sufficiently protected. all roads were supposed to lead to Rome, and, with the honourable member, all roads 'lead to protection.

227,Mr Joseph Cook,"In the old daysingredients which enter into the composition correct the figures of official statisticians of confectionery? One of its constituents is milk. But I have been informed that all the milk consumed upon MacRobertson's premises is Nestles imported milk. It is really wonderful how these manufacturers prefer an imported raw product to a locally-manufactured article. Another ingredient is sugar, upon which there is a high duty, and which, therefore, according to the dictum of the Government Whip, ought to be cheap. milk, sugar, dried fruit, and paraffine wax, tion in the case of the Australian inall of which enter into the composition of confectionery, are dutiable to-day. Consequently, according to the doctrine of protectionists, these articles ought to be very much cheaper than they would be otherwise. There should be an abundance of these cheap raw products for the manufacture of confectionery in Australia. Yet Mr Robertson had to cut right across that theory when he was giving evidence before the Tariff Commission. He had to complain that, because of the duties imposed upon his raw products, they were dearer than they otherwise would have been. have spoken for a whole ten minutes today. member tell us the duty which is levied in I have been told that the average wage Great Britain? made any reference to the duty operating I do not make that statement with any in that country.

It has been said that it is necessary for the protection of the confectionery industry to increase the duties on confectionery; but, from the statements made from all quarters, I judge that, of all industries in Robertson told the Tariff Commission that, thirteen years ago, when he employed comparatively few hands, he was not satisfied with the Tariff. satisfied. ever satisfied, however high the duties. tectionist manufacturers, asked for proLike a' child crying for the moon, he tection for his industry,, he wishes to get does not know what he wants, half the his machinery in free. time.

It would furthermore deprive poor children of what may be regarded -by .some as luxuries, though they have really become necessaries; because what we regard in the first instance as a luxury, gets to be a necessary when we have become accustomed to it. .The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will find that that remark applies to the possession of a seat in Parliament. Regarding the comparison of wages that has been made, I I have said that think that there can be little doubt but that English wages are higher than Australian wages. Furthermore, only eight I am glad to hours a day are worked in England. The' chairman of Messrs. Cadbury Brothers, whose statements, I presume, can be accepted with the utmost confidence, stated some time ago that the firm's employees get through more work in eight hours than do continental workers in ten or even twelve, and that although they are paid higher wages, actually less is spent on labour. But the employees of that firm, and of other English firms, enjoy many advantages which are not granted to the operatives of Australian manufacturers. Notwithstanding that there is no protection in Great Britain, wages in this industry are higher there than they have been in Victoria, while on the Continent they are also very high. member say that there is no protection in Great Britain? is not so high as is asked for by the Government here.

I am not going to say that the Combine in relation to this industry is doing anything that is very unjust. I believe that some men have been bought out and paid less than they ought to have received, but I am not going to blame all the manufacturers for that sort of thing. Factory legislation now applies to the industry, and at present the employees are working under fair conditions. I do not suggest that they are as good as those prevailing in Cadbury's establishment, but I hope that they will be. Cadbury's are to be commended for the treatment of their employees. Fry's also treat their employees well, and the same may be said of Rowntree Brothers. The members of these three firms belong to the Society of Friends, but Rowntree Brothers were more loyal than were Cadbury's to the principles of their society when they received the offer of a contract to supply £30,000 worth of chocolate for the troops in South Africa. As members of a society that is opposed to war, they refused to take that offer, as they did not believe in the wicked South African war, whereas Cadbury's did not hesitate to accept it.

I think honourable members will agree that I am usually very careful regarding the substantial accuracy of any information that I put before the Committee, and that if at any time. I make a mistake I am perfectly willing to correct it as soon as it is pointed out to me. It is true that I said yesterday that Mr Stedman had made representations to the Tariff Commission in favourof a lower duty. The honourable member for Batman said that it was on that ground that I opposed the Government proposition. the grounds of the honourable member's opposition to it. posed to the duty on the ground that, even from the protectionist point of view, it is unnecessary, and, in proof of my assertion, I pointed out that Mr Stedman had made the representations in question. The reply of the honourable member for Batman to that is that Mr Stedman favours the higher duty, -that he did not appear before the Commission, and was satisfied to ""allow Mr MacRobertson to represent the trade. That is what I understood the honourable member to say. I admit that I was wrong in thinking that Mr Stedman had made his representations to the Tariff Commission. He did not make them to that body, but to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I hold in my hand a document from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, which statesThat Australian manufacturing confectioners are by no means unanimous in desiring increased duties, three well-known msnnfacturers in New South Wales (James Stedman Ltd., leading), and one in Queensland, have petitioned the Minister of Customs against anv increase beyond an all-round duty of 2d. per lb. That is my authority for the statement which I made, and whilst I was in error in thinking, that Mr Stedman had made his representations to the Tariff Commission, I was absolutely right, so far as the effect of those representations is concerned. prepared to support the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission in respect of this item. If the amendment be defeated, I shall move that a duty of 2^d. per lb. be imposed under the general Tariff, and that a preference of Jd. per lb. be granted to the manufacturers of the United Kingdom. the Treasurer whether he intends to report progress ? I shall be compelled to lose my train, but nevertheless I have a duty to perform.

288,Mr Poynton,"Then I suppose thatprices enormously under penalty. The increase of some leading lines was notified to the shopkeeper Monday, the twenty-first inst., by circular, and printed information is given that lists of further lines are in preparation, and will be issued in a few days. Present printed quotations of the Combine as compared wfth those in existence prior to the twenty-first instant show the following increase :-Com mon mixed lollies, from twopence three-farthings to threepence farthing. Conversations, Scotch mixtures, and peppermints from threepence and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny per pound. London mixtures from threepence farthing and threepence halfpenny to fourpence halfpenny. to fivepence halfpenny. Caramels, frosted and cream, from sixpence to ninepence. Jelly beans from sixpence halfpenny to ninepence. late creams ancl mixtures from sixpence to eightpence. The writer, after thirteen years in the retail confectionery of this city, and holding two of the leading retail shops, exclusively confectionery, aggregating rentals approximating four figures per annum, was told only yesterday by the principal of a firm of over fifty years' standing in this city and a member of Combine,that while in the past the manufacturer waited on the retailer, in future the manufacturer would be master. If leading vendors are plainly told this, what about aged spinsters and widows, by whom this trade is largely conducted outside business centres? Could say a good deal more on information received first hand, but in the absence of documentary evidence desist. The accuracy of the statements which I made last night has been challenged in some quarters. I affirmed that prices had been increased in Victoria, and in support of my allegation I quoted not twenty-five lines-as stated by the honourable member for Batman-bu t fifty-nine lines upon which an increase had taken place. These increases upon the old rates range from . £ 4 13s. per ton to ,£37 6s. 8d. per ton. It has been argued that the increases are due to the duties which have been imposed upon the raw materials of the industry, but I venture to say that protectionists will experience a great difficulty in proving that. Last evening I quoted from a letter in which the statement was made, not only that prices had been increased, but that short weights were being delivered. The accuracy of that assertion has been challenged. I have since been informed, not only that short weights have been delivered once, but that they have been delivered repeatedly even after complaints have been made by thejaarties aggrieved. The honourable member"" for Batman has declared that every box of confectionery sent out by a certain firm contains an enclosure intimating that if there is any short weight upon a box it will be made up by the manufacturer upon being informed of it. There[ ' 8 5 2] upon, I asked him whether it was the practice of the firm to send out a similar enclosure with every box, and he replied that it was. I then sent down to a very reputable firm in this city, and obtained two boxes of confectionery, which were opened in the presence of witnesses, who can testify that neither of them contained the enclosure to which reference has been made. If further proof of my statement is necessary I am in a position to supply it. It is generally admitted Jeliy jubes, threepence thTee-farthings that a confectionery combine does exist. Indeed, there has been no effort to refute Chocothe statements I made last night. Not only is there a combine, but it is so effective that it almost succeeded in confining the trade to a particular State, and it has succeeded in arranging that no goods shall be sold under the price fixed by itself. The idea of the honourable member for Wimmera that under protection competition protects the consumer and the retailer is not borne out by facts. The majority of honourable members seem to concern themselves entirely with the men who are employed in the industry; but we must not forget that there are hundreds of retailers, most of them people of small means, who are equally deserving of consideration. By means' of this Combine retailers may be practically fleeced, whilst at the same time it has been arranged to pav 15 per cent, to the middlemen. The Government propose the magnificent preference to Great Britain of Jd.' out of an increased duty amounting to i j d . Of£ 1 1 6 , 0 0 0 worth of imports last year £ 9 3 , 6 7 4 worth came from the United Kingdom, as compared with only £ 1 , 0 0 0 worth from France, and £ 1 , 2 0 0 worth from Germany. The industry is in such a sound position that last year the exports were valued at £ 1 3 , 7 8 1 , and in spite of the duty of 2d. per lb. in New Ztealand,Australian manufacturers can export to that Dominion and undersell English manufacturers. In my opinion, the proposed duty is most iniquitous, and yet not one word in justification of it have we heard from the' Treasurer. When we ask for fair play and honest trading we are'accused of supporting the foreigner; but surely no one can say that the retailers of Australia are foreigners, or that they are not just as much entitled to consideration as are the manufacturers. In the face of what has been proved in connection with this Combine, we are told that we must leave it to be dealt with under the new protection scheme. In my opinion. however, this is the time to teach the manufacturers that if they are given the advantage of high duties they must 'deal honestly with others who have as much right to live as they have. While we are waiting for the Government to introduce the new protection legislation, and, probably, to amend legislation already in existence, the retailers are left in the hands of the Combine. It is proposed that when there is clear evidence that prices are unwarrantably' increased, or that there is a combine created to take unfair advantage of the public, duties shall be reduced, and I am only asking honourable members to take that step now. If we are in earnest we have an opportunity to show the manufacturers that they will not be allowed to enter into a cold-blooded combination for tbe purpose of .fleecing those with whom they have to do business. not think it better to employ 3,000 hands .in Australia than to employ' none at all? Have those employees no claim on our consideration ? Mr .POYNTON -The greater part of my life has been devoted to the protection of the working man, but I recognise that there are many others concerned besides the employees. If only the working men have to be considered here, then the sooner I know the fact the better. I take it that we are sent to Parliament to deal fairly with all concerned-no t only with employees but with consumers-and all I am asking is that we should give the retailer a fair opportunity. This Combine should have the slap in the face it deserves, and be taught a lesson. If manufacturers come to Parliament for high duties, they must' not be permitted to form themselves into combines for the purpose of robbing the public.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.22] I move That the House do now adjourn. I _ am moving the adjournment now, because I know that honourable members wish to get away to catch trains to other States; but I desire to point out that we must make better progress in future. If we do not get more business done during the ordinary sittings next week, we shall have to meet earlier or sit later, or, perhaps, do both. I am sure that honourable members will not take umbrage at that proposal, seeing that the Government are anxious to pass the Tariff before Christmas, and that cannot be done unless we'apply ourselves able members will ibe asked to sit each night until a certain amount of progress has been 3 made.
