Prime Minister, in the interests of art in Austral.a, if he will make inquiries and inform the House what officer has been to blame for this piece of gross carelessness. a statement made by yourself to the House yesterday, Mr Speaker, you remarked that the clerical staff of the House of Represen tat v«3 cost £ 6 0 less to-day than twenty years ago. In view of that statement, will you take immediate steps to place the staff upon at least a living wage? clear yesterday that, although the amount of salaries in the aggregate was less now than twenty years ago, that did not imply that there had been any reduction'in the salaries of any officers of the House. Quite the contrary is the case. cost of living ? provided for. There has been no complaint by any officer, so f a r as I am aware, on that score. There has been no reduction in the salary-of any member of the staff. Many, iudeed, have received increases. But the saving was consequent upon a re-arrangement of duties, and this did not involve any financial disadvantage to any particular officer of the staff. of the Prime Minister yesterday, regarding fche intention of the. Government to deal only with the Tariff, this session, I wish to know if the ri?ht honourable gentleman can give the House any idea of the period during the life of the present Parliament when it is intended to submit a Bill to provide for the holding of a Convention to consider alterations in the Commonwealth Constitution that yesterday. work of the session, I spoke in the language of hope rather than that of experience. I thought that this House would accept my words as an indication that as soon as it had finished with the Tariffi t need not, unless it liked, do any more work u n t i l my return from England. But, of course, as I indicated in reply to another honourable member just now, if this House wishes to do more it may. The Convention proposal w ill be dealt w i th later on in the year. Whether that I will make inquiries. period may be regarded as in the same session, or as in another session, is not very material. Before the end of this year the Convention Bil l will have been passed into law. A t least, that is tile intention of the Government, and it is one which will be acted upon. An election of delegates to the Convention will be held at the earliest possible moment in the new year, and the Convention itself will be inaugurated . immediately afterwards. When I stated that the House was to be asked only to consider the Tariff, I think I made it I meant that that was all that we proposed to ask honourable members to deal with immediately. I said yesterdayand I propose to make a statement in regard to the matter this afternoon-that a Conference was to be held in London in June next, and that in view of that fact it was not the intention of the Government to ask the House to proceed T h a t factor has been with any further business except the Tariff. I would only like to remind the honourable member that those of us who were here when the last Tariff was under consideration have a somewhat chastened experience of what that means. The honourable member,' perhaps, is more optimistic than we are. He is probably right, but as far as I can remember the consideration of the original Tariff extended over something like fifteen months. A t all events it occupied our attention for a very long t i m e .. I feel sure that In view of the statement the discussion of the new Tariff will not cover so long a period, and when it has been dealt with all the business that this House will have to deal with will be that which it deliberately brings on itself.

Five (5) of these positions are at present filled 3. The applications lodged have received consideration; but, pending the settlement of the staff position in the Taxation Branch, Western Australia, consequent upon the amalgamation of the Federal and State Taxation Departments in Western Australia, and as a result of which it may be necessary to transfer certain officers from the Taxation Branch, Western Australia, to the Taxation Branch, South Australia, no definite recommendation for the filling of the vacant 4th Class positions in the Adelaide office can be made. 4. The Commissioner of Taxation, accompanied by the Deputy Public Service Inspector for Victoria, left for Perth, on the 30th March, 1921, for the purpose of finally arranging the amalgamation of the Federal and State Taxation Departments in Western Australia. It is anticipated that, upon the Commissioner's return from Perth, about the end of this month, he will be in a position to submit recommendations for the filling of twenty (20) additional 4th Class positions in the 'Taxation Branch, South Australia.

It has been assumed by the press, and stated from the public platform, that this Conference has been called to consider changes in the Constitution. That is not the case. The Conference to consider alterations in the > relations between the different parts of the Empire is to be held, possibly next year. The Conference to be held in June next is called to deal with certain definite matters, which I shall mention in detail. In view of the fact that it is not proposed at this Conference to deal with constitutional relations between the various parts of the Empire any lengthy discussion in relation thereto would be out of place; but, having regard to what has been said on the subject, some few remarks from me seem to be called for. It would appear that those gentlemen who have rather severely criticised me for refraining to disclose what are my opinions in regard to the Constitution are profoundly dissatisfied with the Empire as it is. What they desire, if one is to deduce their intentions from their words, is to substitute for this structure, fashioned by time and circumstance, under which we have, progressed and flourisheda structure empirical and illogical, but which is the most convenient and flexible ever conceived for the purposes of a free people-they , I say, desire to substitute a Constitution based April, 1921, on some logical plan which they themleaves Meltrip in conselves have devised. Precisely what that contract. plan is we are not told, but if one is to read between the lines, they desire to create some sort of Imperial Parliament-althoug h I admit they repudiate that suggestion-or , failing an I mperial Parliament, an Imperial Council, which, although, perhaps, not clothed with legislative powers, will have authority to deal with matters now entirely in the hands of the various Legislatures of the Empire.

43,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minisme that they are entirely ignorant of the historical, geographical, and ethnological principles and circumstances of the Empire. that this thing which we call a Constitution-if we can apply so definite a term to a thing so indefinite is, happily for mankind, not the work of philosophers or Constitution-mongers-ha s not been devised according to any plan, and has .developed, not of deliberate purpose, but haphazard. There never was a time when this so-called Constitution of ours was crystallized. It is now, .as it always was, in a state of flux. Its basic principles aro the full and free recognition of the autonomy of the various parts of the Empire, and its complete adaptability to the changing circumstances of a -progressive people. If we -look back across our comparatively short history, and contrast our relations with the Mother Country in the days of our infancy with those of today, we see great changes in form, but none in substance. As our circumstances have changed, as we have progressed, authority and power suited to our requirements have been given to us. There was a time when the handful of people who were settled in this country were governed by nominee Councils under the direct control of the Colonial Office. ""When the Colonies had sufficiently advanced, independent self-government was granted them. from infancy to adolescence, and at last stood on the very threshold of manhood. With every advance our powers of self government increased until at length, some twenty years ago, dignity and added authority'were given to us by the Federal Constitution under which we are living to-day. our country progressed, and its circumstances changed more than in a generation of peace. In the supreme hour of ' the Empire's trial the Dominions proved themselves worthy of their breeding. The whole world recognised tliat they had put on the toga of manhood and become nations. The nations of the world recognised us as their equals, and we were admitted into the League on a footing of equality. If we look at the form of the relations between Britain and ourselves during the interval that has elapsed since Australia was first settled, we see considerable changes, but in substance our relation remains the same. In my opinion, no constitutional changes are. called for. impartial history will record the factThey do not seem to understand that the British Constitution is the supreme achievement of the genius of our race for self-government. History may be ransacked in vain to find a parallel. If I were asked what is, as it were, the legal tie that unites the British EmpireI say deliberately it is the King-the Monarchy. I cannot conceive of a British Empire held together under any other form of government than a monarchy. The people of Australia' would never consent to acknowledge as their ruler a President elected by the British people. The Monarchy is the' constitutional principle which binds us together. Ties of race, of kindred, of common tradition, of language^-al l these, taken together go to weave that web which neither the storms 1 of adversity nor the passage of time has been able to destroy. Buti f we are asked what is the material foundation of our greatness, what are we to say? Upon, what does this mighty Empire of ours rest? It rests, and always has done, upon the British Navy. As surely as we stand here this Empire of 'ours would never have. been built without British control of the seas. By an all-powerful British Navy this Empire has been built up; only by a powerful British Navy can Time passed, we grew it be maintained. I leave all further reference to the Constitution at this point, which is the most convenient for dealing with .the matters which are to be considered at ithe forthcoming Conference. The Conference has been summoned to During the five years of war deal with questions of foreign policy, naval defence, and the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Certain other more or less subsidiary matters are also set out on the agenda-paper. One relates to communications, including wireless, between Uhe various parts of the Empire, but I shall direct my remarks mainly to those matters which are of fundamental importance. I take, first of all, the question of foreign policy. The attitude of the Australian people towards -foreign policy before the war was one of indifference, partly begotten from our geographical circumstances and our remoteness from those centres of population which were, in the very nature of things, regarded hy us as being most potent in directing the affairs of tbe world. ference cause. We had lain so securely sheltered under, the wing of fche British Navy from 4 the very day of the foundation of this country that not only did war, which devastated.and destroyed other parts of the world, pass' us by unscathed, but even rumours of war left us unaffected. The very completeness of the protection which the British Navy gave us was responsible for the fact that the Australian people took no heed of those things which vitally concerned other nations, bringing to them war, turmoil, and destruction, and those upheavals which have made history during the last 100 vears. But the recent great war 'changed those conditions. I made it necessary that we shall take a keener interest in foreign policy. No oire would have imagined that from the assassination of some obscure scion of a royal house .at Serajevo, war could have come to this sea-girt Australia, and to the whole world. time you were to have put 100 Australians up against a wall and 'threatened .to shoot every one who did not know where Serajevo was, I suppose you would have had to shoot ninety-nine of them. Yet from, such an incident out of a clear sky the greatest war in history loose upon the world, and we, in distant Australia, were involved in it. Ifc is a far cry from Australia to Belgium, yet but for fche violation of the treaty of neutrality made by the great Powers with Belgium, a treaty of which the overwhelming majority of Australians were in entire ignorance, England, would probably not have gone to war on the 4th August, 1914, and, if she had not gone to war the whole history of the struggle would have been changed. As a result of leaving this country 400,000 of our young men have seen and learned many things of kindred have been naturally interested in all the movements on that great -stage upon which our soldiers played so splendid Afr. Hughes. have at length become alive to the fact that in the modern world no nation can And our indifafford to be indifferent to what other arose, too, from another nations do, and that war may come upon us from the most' unexpected quarter and upon tlie most trivial pretext. We ci-nnot afford to ignore the foreign policy of other nations of our own .Empire. Honourable members know very, well that from the. beginning -the foreign policy of the Empire has been determined exclusively by Britain, and, very properly so, for if the Empire became involved in war, it was mainly on fche shoulders of the British people that the burden of war fell; it was certainly upon them that the burden of preservins: the security of the Empire fell, whether in times of peace or in war. This brings me to one of the subjects to which I desire to direct the attenCircumstances, to which tion of honourable members. Certain shall allude later, have: now matters relating to the foreign policy of the Empire are to be considered at this June Conference. We have been invited by the British Government to take our part in the councils of Empire, and to express our opinion in regard to these matters which it is now clearly understood involve If at that us as much as any other part of the Empire. I shall come later to a consideration of what phase of foreign policy most intimately affects us. A t this stage I turn to the question which is so intimately related to it, that of defence. To sea power we owe 'all that we have was let -ou r freedom, our glorious heritage, the glittering promise of our great destiny. Erom the day Australia was founded to the present time we have been a free community, enjoying all those privileges for which the people of Britain fought for centuries, and, having ach eved, applied : to the varying circumstances of a worldwide Empire. There is no privilege or liberty that the British people enjoy they have not freely handed to us. And, securely sheltered under the broad wing of the mighty British Navy, we have been able to maintain those liberties and that freedom to develop our heritage and enjoy in overwhelming measure the blessings of free government. And, as I have foreign countries, and their said, all this-ou r wealth, our libertieskeenly rests upon the broad and sure foundation of sea power. This brings me to the point to which I wish particularly to direct the a part. We attention of this House and the country. Quite recently a statement was made by the British Government of a most portentous character, so far as Australia and the Empire are concerned. It was that Britain was no longer able to maintain the navy at the strength necessary for the complete protection of the Empire, and that the Dominions must do their share. We ought not to be surprised at this declaration, because during; the great war Great Britain incurred a debt of some £7,000,000,000 or £8,000 000,000. She is still staggering under the tremendous blows received during the conflict; she is exposed to the fiercest industrial and commercial competition; she is torn with industrial strife and internecine struggles. Her people are demanding, quite rightly, th""at attention should be paid to domestic reform, that expenditure on naval and military defence should be reduced. No exception can be taken to this from the stand-point of the British people, but what does this mean to Australia? We are 5,000,000 of people, we have a continent very rich and capable of almost infinite development, but within a few weeks' sail of the great mass of the population of the world. announced that we intend to retain this continent for ourselves, and we have set up the banner of a White Australia. The overwhelming majority of the people of Australia believe in this principle, but, in all the circumstances, it can hardly be expected that the overcrowded countries of the East can see the matter from our point of view. How long would that banner fly unles3 behind it there were massed the legions of the Empire, or unless ringed about it there was the protection of the British Navy? But we are now told deliberately that the British people can no longer maintain this Navy at a strength adequate for the defence of the Empire. To Rome there came a crisis similar to that which now confronts us. The Roman legions had invaded Britain and held it for some centuries, but the onslaught of the barbarians made it imperative that the oversea legions should be withdrawn in order to protect the citadel of the Empire. The Romans withdrew, and Britain was left to her .own resources with the result we knr>w of. What is the Empire to do in this crisis? The position could hardly be graver. Last year we spent £3,352,000 or thereabouts on our Navy. It is only fair to Australia to point out that we have spent on naval defence very much more than all the other Dominions put -together; but our Navy is ludicrously inadequate to defend this country. We cannot defend ourselves. We have -not even a plan of campaign for the Pacific. Quite recently a conference was held at Singapore which the Admiral of the Australian Fleet attended, to consider the defence of that portion of the Pacific covered by the Australian Fleet and the China Squadron; but as yet no plan of operations has been agreed upon for the China Squadron of the British Navy and ourselves. Sir, we are confronted with a position grave in the extreme. What are we to do? What is our policy to be? We depend for our very existence on the maintenance of the control of the sea by Britain. Britain says that she can no longer afford to maintain the Navy at its relative pre-war strength, and .calls upon the Dominions to consider the question, and presumably to contribute their We have boldly share. What are we going to do ? The Conference has been called to consider the question. Upon its decision rests the safety, the very existence of this Commonwealth, and, indeed, of the Empire itself. For just as the Empire was built up by and rests upon sea power, so will it wither and decay as that power slips from the hands of the British race. In order that we may the better understand all that is involved in any policy insuring effective naval defence of Australia, it is neeessary to consider a matter most intimately related to it. I turn, therefore, to the consideration of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. We live in a world which, thanks to the war, we know, or ought to know, very well. We are under no illusions. The veil has been torn from our eyes, and the purposes of nations have been revealed. One great menace to the safety of mankind has been stricken down and humbled; but will any oue say that the war, wlrch was waged to end war, has removed all danger of other wars? Has What can Australu dn?; there been a day since the signing of the armistice, on the l l t h November, 1918, when war has not raged somewhere? I may be reminded of the existence of the League of Nations. disguised my opinions of the League. Yet, because Peace is a thing so greatly -to be desired, I have endeavoured, by inducing Australia to become a member of the League, to enable it to exercise that influence upon the counsels aud acts of nations which its creators claimed for it. But what are the facts? The League was created to banish war by creating a tribunal to which the nations could appeal, substituting reason for force. Yet within two days' journey of Geneva, where its Assembly recently sat, war was raging, in which two members of the League were involved. In the long list of resolutions of to protect Great Britain itself. But in the assembly there is not the briefest reference to the fact that the thunders of war, which the League was to banish from the earth for ever, were shaking the earth almost at it3 very doors. If , then, any Australian is asked whether he will trust his fortunes to the League of Nations or to the sea power of the British Empire, will he hesitate for one moment in his answer? Let us not throw away the substance for the shadow. to have changed many things, and has done so; but how deep does the change go? Has it changed the hearts of men? Do they now seek to settle their quarrels by an appeal to reason instead of to force? If not, the change is only skin deep, and war is still the one great dominating fact of national life. Long ago it was said by Marcus Aurelius, ""Wouldst thou confer upon any country the clouds of war, then induce its Government to disarm."" Is it not clear that if we are to have peace, and that security which is essential to the development of our heritage, we cannot rely either on the League of Nations or on ourselves, alone? Are our resources and our numbers such as could in any circumstances insure adequate defence? ""We must confess frankly that they are not. We speak at times boastingly-I guard, in this. We speak of ourselves as a nation, and ouir claim to be recognised as a nation does not rest merely on our own assertion. For the nations have admitted us to their councils on a footing of equality. We are a nation. But let us nor, he vainglorious or blown out with conceit. We are a nation only by Afr. the grace of God and the power of the I have never British Empire. But for these our Jiouse, splendid and glorious though it is, would be as. a house built upon quicksands. If the British people asked, "" What is the Empire to us? Will it feed or clothe or help us? Let us look to our own affairs,"" would they not be well within their own rights? Why should they spend their money to defend us? What do they gain from us? I do not ask what rk> we gain from them, because our gain is obvious. They might say, "" Let us look to ourselves."" A Navy incomparably smaller than that required to police this mighty Empire would suffice that case what of usI speak not of the other parts of the Empire but of Australia, which stands as a free nation on the foundation of sea power, and on that alone. At this Conference our circumstances and those of the whole Empire must be placed before the people of Great Britain. In these days much is heard of economy, and the outcry for it has not come too soon. But it is heard, not in this country alone, but in all counThe war was tries, and is the natural consequence of the reckless but inevitable extravagance of the war. If Great Britain chooses to -economize, and commences with her Navy, how will it go with us ? What shall we do? I come now to deal more in detail with the Anglo-Japane3e Treaty. This Treaty would have expired last year, but was renewed for twelve months, in order that there might be an opportunity for its reconsideration. newal.

47,Mr Hughes,"Unless the Treaty is that has meant to us, and what it means to the world at the present time, should be considered carefully by this Assembly. What it means to us is evident. If we were told that there was danger of war, we should naturally ask, from what quarter? Who threatens us? We are a peace-loving Democracy. Whom have we assailed, or whom do we threaten? Is auy nation less blood-guilty than we? Every citizen of Australia realizes that the destiny of this country is to be played This is no party question. I hope that on the mighty stage of the Pacific. Therefore, when we speak of war and foreign policy, we speak of foreign policy in relation to Pacific problems and of war as it may come out of the Ea6t'. No man can deny that it is a thing more precious than rubies that we should have an alliance with the greatest Power in the East; and no man who was not a criminal, who was not utterly dead to the duty that he owed to his country, would do anything that might involve this country in war. So, when we are asked what the Treaty means to us, either in its present or any other acceptable form, we are to say that it means everything to us. For we should recollect that it is an alliTreaty. Yet that treaty is anathema to ance between that Power under whose wing we have been sheltered from the day of our birth till now, and that other great opinion; he may be more intimately acEastern Power which has sprung up within the lifetime of honourable members of this House. So, in thc face of these facts, We read almost' every day of disturbing if we are asked, are we in favour of a renewal of that Treaty, I take it .that, as ing for peace resounds ' with the clangAustralians who want peace, there can be but one answer, we are. We must recollect that we live in a glass house. We must not forget, though we speak boastingly-and I am not chiding the Australian for so speaking, since he has much to boast ofupon what pedestal we stand. We must remember that our greatness is duemainly due, at any rate-to our occupancy of a pedestal which is not ours at all, but whom? She has left the world in no which has been given unto us for a century or more by Britain. What are the chances of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty being renewed ? What are the difficulties in the way? which I must now invite the attention of honorahle members. fectly well known that the Japanesean ambitious and an intensely, passionately, patriotic people-hav e imagined that they have causes for quarrel, or, rather, of complaint, with ourselves be[294] cause of our policy of ' a White Australia. And, as we have seen lately, there has been much talk of strained relations between the United States of America and Japan. Now, in this last lie the germs of great trouble, the possibilities of infinite disaster to rhi3 world. What is the hope of mankind? What do thinking men everywhere strive and pray for? Peace on earth. And how is this to be secured? every honourable inember will express himself freely, remembering only that every word said here in relation to other nations is one which must be well weighed before being uttered. Words of counsel I welcome; words of warning, too; but not words which, lightly uttered, would make a task that is now sufficiently difficult, almost impossible. What is the hope of the world? As I see it. it is an alliance, an understanding, call it what you will, between the two great branches of the English-speaking peoples. Now, here is our dilemma. Our interests, our safety lies in a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese the Americans. An honourable member at my right, who dissents, has his own t quainted than myself with the viewpoint of the American people; I hope he is. rumours of great navies, the world longing of hammers, nations fervently building more and more war ships, and there is rivalry openly expressed between those two great nations, the United States of America and Japan. America has said that she must have the greatest navy in the world; that she must have a navy sufficiently strong to defend herself. To defend herself against doubt, or in very little, on this point. And these things concern and disturb us greatly. For we not only have no quarrel with America, but we have no quarrel These are thc questions to with Japan. We have our ideals; Japan has here. There is room in the world for It is perboth of us. We want to live on terms of amity with all the nations of the earth. If I know the Australian people, they desire with all their hearts to concentrate themselves on those domestic problems which mean more to the people of the world than"" anything else. ""War is a curse, and we' must do all things within our power to endeavour to prevent it ""What is the ideal at which we are to aim at this Conference, and elsewhere, hy every means at our disposal? It is, as I see it, a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in such form -modified, if that should be deemed proper-as will be acceptable to Britain,, to America, to Japan, and to ourselves. That is the ideal. It may be said that is impossible. It may be. I do not think so. When one comes to the alleged causes of the disputes between Japan and America, they appear to be trivial compared with the tremendous evil which war would inflict upon both nations. What do the Japanese want? They want the right to hold land in America, the right of entry for such of their nationals as so desire into the TJnited States. What our attitude is very much like that of the people of the western States of America towards Japan. honourable member who,, like myself, has been to the western States, will say that for all practical purposes we view this problem almost eye to eye. What have the Japanese to complain of in regard to our treatment? First, let me say-speaking now, as I believe, as the spokesman of Australia upon this matter-that desire above all things to live in peace and friendship with Japan. It is utterly wrong for the Japanese people to think that because we have passed certain, laws we regard them as our inferiors. We do not. We admire.their splendid patriotism. those who are loudest in admiration of their magnificent achievements; for' no other nation has advanced so far in so short a time. But, as I had the honour of telling the representative of Japan at the Peace Conference, while we were the friends of Japan, and while we considered them the'equal to ourselves, we do not al'against herself. For this is the dilemma ways invite all our friends into our house. We have our ideals; they have theirs. AndI want the Japanese people to understand clearly that we, the Australian people, are anxious to live in peace and friendship with them. plain of any act of ours, I think they complain without reason. Let me remind Mr Huahes. them of their laws in relation to foreigners. No foreigner may hold land in Japan. Unskilled labourers may not reside outside the 'foreign settlements, except with the permission of the Prefectual Government. For all practical purposes, the foreign labourer is excluded; and, under the provision to which I have just 1 alluded, Chinese have been deported from Japan. Naturalization is extremely difficult, if not impossible, in Japan otlier than by marriage with a Japanese person. Japan reserves her coasting trade for her own ships. Our treatment of the Japanese will compare quite favourably, I think, with their treatment of foreigners in general. We do not complain of her treatment of our nationals. We say, "" Those are our ideals. This is our country; Japan is yours. We shall"" treat you with courtesy. We desire your friendship. We want to is our own attitude? For trade with you. But we cannot go any further."" The Japanese are so intensely patriotic that they do not Indeed, any recognise naturalization by any coun-' try as denationalizing any Japanese. A Japanese, no matter what he does, cannot divest himself of his nationality. The patriotism of the Japanese could not be displayed in any more effective way. The admission of Japanese labour, the right to hold land: These are the main we grounds of bhe differences of opinion between-.the United States of America and Japan. Do honourable members tell me that such matters as these are not captable of adjustment by peace-loving nations? Do they not rather tell me that bravery, their it is the bounden duty of Australia to use We stand among every means at her disposal to -effect such a modus vivendi as will secure a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in a form acceptable to Japan and the United States of America? Whether she is a party to it or not is not material so long as she does not regard the renewal of it as an unfriendly act by Britain directed in which we are placed. While making every effort to retain the friendship of Japan we cannot make an enemy of the United States of America. Nor oan Britain do so. We must steer our If they combarque between Scylla and Charybdis. In some way we must attain ithe calm waters of port. That is the mission -which, the representative of Australia has to fulfil. I have put the matter to the House as well as I could, and even if I laboured it at greater length I do not think I could make it clearer. I hope that honourable members will realize quite clearly that, treaty or no treaty, the power of the British Navy-whethe r it be an Imperial Navy to which we contribute sub-' stantially or not-is the foundation of our greatness, the greatest assurance of 'the peace of the world, and must remain. If thatNavy should sink to the level of a second-class Power, then no treaty is worth the paper it is printed on. Seapower is the foundation, not only of our greatness, but of our very existence. Let the teachings of history guide your feet. Be not deluded by phrases or by vain , hopes. is but one way by which this Empire has been built up, and by that way only can itbe maintained. As for the AngloJapanese Treaty, if we consider the question from the stand-point of Australia, and ask ourselves what we have to gain by its renewal, the answer is plain; we have everything to gain. If we cannot secure a satisfactory treaty, then it is obvious that any adequate soheme of niaval defence will involve us in much greater expenditure, and this at a time when our resources are strained to the uttermost. As I have already said, there. is much cry at the present time about economy. This is-a direction in which economy can most hopefully look for success. A satisfactory treaty would lessen the expenditure of Australia by millions per annum. Failure would throw upon us obligations that I venture to say could hardly be shouldered by 5,000,000 of people. This, then, is the position as I see it . and I submit it for the consideration It may be put in a more favorable light; but I have put it fairly, neither exaggerating the difficulties nor minimizing them. I have set them out so that men may see and judge for themselves just* where they stand. The question of what is adequate naval defence for AustraliaI mean, of course, a naval scheme in which Australia co-operates with Britain, and not a scheme' in which Australia assumes the 6ole responsibility, since that oould not be thought of-depend s on the outcome of [294]2 this Conference. Oan we make such a satisfactory treaty with Japan as will be acceptable to Britain and America? That is the point. One might easily say more than one should on this matter, but I think that I ought not to have said less than I have. I have endeavoured to put the issues fairly, and I leave it to honourable members to say whether or not Australia should be represented at such a Conference. Whatever may be true of Canada -and , so far as I know, all the other dominions are to be represented-Australia has the most to lose and the most to gain at that Conference. Canada's position is different from our own. We have a coastline nearly three times as great as that of the United States of America, comparing^ mainland with mainland, and, if we add her dependenThere cies and include our own, the proportion is undisturbed. We are vulnerable on every side. Canada's boundaries, on the other hand', extend for 3,000 miles along the great American Republic. It is inconceivable that the United States of America should attack Canada. > The utmost good feeling prevails between the two peoples. Canada is vulnerable on only one side, because on the other the British Fleet is always within a few days steaming distance. We, however, are at the extremities of the earth, and nothing but a scheme of naval defence adequate to circumstances of the then existing 'foreign policy , whatever that may be, will suffice. If I am asked whether the Commont wealth is to be committed to anything done at the .Conference, I say quite frankly that this Parliament will have the amplest opportunity of expressing its opinion on any scheme of naval defence that is decided upon, before the scheme is ratified. As to the renewal of the Treaty with Japan, this is my attitude, of honourable members: I am in favour of renewing the Treaty in any form that is satisfactory to Britain, America, end ourselves. I am prepared to renew It in those circumstances. If it is suggested that the renewal should take a form which would involve the sacrifice of those principles which we ourselves regard as sacred, I am not prepared to accept it. In such circumstances, I shall bring back the Treaty to this Parliament. I think I have put the situation fairly, and since these matters have sometimes to be settled quickly, I want honourable members to say whether they will give me the authority I ask for. With regard to the expenditure involved in any naval scheme, the House will not be committed to the extent of one penny. The scheme will be brought before Parliament, and honourable members will be able to discuss, and accept or reject it . members say that we ought to accept the Treaty in any form, whether it involves the sacrifice of those principles in which we believe or not, I cannot agree; but ] am prepared to agree to anything short of that. I have a copy of the mandate given*to us over German New Guinea and all the ex-German places south of the equator, excepting Samoa, and, in order to enable the whole matter to be debated, I move That th-j paper be printed. adjourned until Wednesday next. The matter is one of great importance, and such an adjournment would give honourable members an opportunity, before the resumptiou of the debate, to read in Hansard the speech just delivered by the Prime Minister. other honourable member should also express an opinion. I want to get the sense of the House as to what should be done leave) -As an individual member, I . think we ought to support the request made by the Leader of the Opposition for the' adjournnyjiit of the debate. The speech made by the Prinie Minister( Mr The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), at Hughes) has covered a wider and more important ground with regard to foreignpolicy than has ever been covered before by a Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I agree with the warning he has issued to honourable members to be temperate in thought aud language in thc discussion of these issues, and in order that Ave may discuss thc question in moderation and temperance, I think the adjournment of the debate is essential. I have one suggestion to make. I do not think there is an honourable member out side the Government who has read the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and if the arrangement made with the British Government will permit of it, I suggest that, between now and' the end of the week, every honourable member should be furnished with a confidential copy of that agreement. adjourned. If honourable In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 6th April (vide page 7225), on motion by Mr That duties of Customs and duties of Excise (vide page 726), first item, be imposed. Last night, when the House adjourned,. I was endeavouring io give honourable members my opinion, not on .the merits of Free Trade versus Protection, but on the way in -which the Tariff as submitted by the Government will operate against the interests of primary . producers. A number of interjections then made conveyed some rather curious predictions as to my fiscal belief generally, particularly those by the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine); and I propose now to give an outline of that belief. I shall enunciate the principles which I . hold, and if the honourable member I have mentioned, or any other honourable -membei', labels them as Free Trade or Protectionist principles, that is a matter which concerns themselves. My chief objection to the Tariff as it affects the primary producers is not so much an objection against the policy of Protection. Bendigo, loudly proclaimed that the Tariff to be introduced would be satisfactory to the manufacturers of this country; and, judging by approving interjections from representatives of wage earners, it seems that it will also be satisfactory to a large proportion of our workers. I repeat that I do not object to the Tariff so much because I disbelieve in the policy of Protection. As a matter of fact, with the situation as it is today-wit h varying standards of living in different countries, with some countries 1 Free Trade, and some with high and some with low* Tariffs-it is, in my opinion, expedient in certain cases to levy protective duties.

When the War Loans, and subsequently Peace Loans, were being floated, the appeals made to Australia as a whole indicated quite clearly on what, in the opinion of the Government, the welfare of Australia is founded. On placards posted throughout the length and breadth of Australia, inviting subscriptions, we were not shown pictures of factories and* smoke stacks in the capital cities, but pictures of a flock of sheep, a herd of dairy cows, of the honourable member's party who ar a field of growing grain, and stamped advocate the closing up of factories in across them were the words "" Invest: order to make labour cheap; they say Australia's security is behind.""

If it be insisted that primary producers shall purchase their means of production in protected markets at protected prices, we demand for them a protected price for what they have to sell. We hear a cry in this connection from those who are not primary producers, and peculiarly enough it comes from those who are Democrats, or who loudly proclaim themselves to be Democrats and repre:entatives of the working men of the country. I have heard it claimed over and over again that, when there is a great wheat harvest, 'or if meat or any other primary product is plentif u l , it should be cheap.

I do not believe that we in Australia can isolate ourselves, and ignore conditions in other parts of the world; we cannot create an earthly paradise in this great country of ours. There are some in Australia who believe that we should export all we can, and import nothing; and we occasionally have leading articles to that effect in a newspaper He thought I was an escaped sailor, and published in Melbourne. They expect other people to buy everything we have to sell, but we must not in any circumstances purchase from them. They do not seem to realize that no country can without limitation export more than it imports.

I believe it would be better if the duties upon tools of trade made within the Empire for use in primary production could be purchased in the markets of the world free of duty. The wheat growers, wool-growers, butter producers, and meat raisers are prepared to take the world's market rates for their produce if those rates are allowed to prevail in Australia in respect of their tools of trade; but is it fair to forbid them access to the world's market for the purchase of the niieans of production compelling them to pay Protectionist prices for their tools of trade, and at the same time feed the Australian people with primary products at Free Trade prices? My advice to the Committee is to strike out the duties on tools of trade used in that iudustry which has financed Australia in the past, and will always finance it in the future. admit that it is necessary to manufacture those articles in Australia? that the whole of our tools of trade should be made outside this country.

This question is vital to the primary producers. If they are to be compelled to purchase within Australia tools of trade at prices far exceeding the world's rates, if this Coms mittee forces this Tariff through in the form in which it is drafted, there can be no alternative for the primary producer but to organize and fix the prices of his products ip Australia, not at the export parity, as at present, but at the import parity. The policy I advocate is that the duties upon the tools of trade should be struck off-allo w us to purchase in the world's markets tools made within the Empire, and I shall be prepared to sell my primary products at export parity. But if you deny us the right to go into the world's markets for the purchase of the means of production, and yet compel us to sell our products at Free Trade rates, you are asking of us something you have no right to ask, arid something which we will not do. -With all due respect to honourable members of the Country party, I say, from my knowledge of a great number of the farmers in Victoria, at any rate, that they do not agree with the fiscal views which have been expressed by the two honourable members who have spoken from the corner benches. Amongst the strongest Protectionists in regard to agricultural machinery and . other articles are men who belong to the farming community. Apparently the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) and the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr order to wipe out the local industry, and Stewart) have a very serious grievance against the Australian manufacturers of agricultural machinery because of the high prices which they charge to the primary producer. The farmers have shown in other directions a means of coping with those people who they say have acted to the detriment of their interests. Commonwealth, both in respect of primary production and the sale of products from the land, great co-operative; movements are afoot, which have saved to the producers millions of pounds by enabling them to conduct their own business in their own way. Therefore, I suggest to the honourable member for Swan that if the primary producers are in the dire strait3 which he has mentioned on account of being fleeced by the manufacturer of agricultural implements, there is an easy way out of the difficulty. There are in Australia the. men who can manufacture for them the implements they require of a quality equal, if not superior, to that of the implements which come from abroad. If they are not satis fied with the present manufacturers ox implements, let them start factories of their own,-and supply their own requirements. They can in that way redress their grievances without trying to wreck a great National policy which, notwithstanding the protests from the members of the Corner party, is beneficial to the primary producers in common with the rest of the population. From' the quarterly summary of statistics dated March, 1920, I find that the number of factories in Australia is 15,421; the number of employees in those factories, 328,049; the wages paid, £38,379,000; the total value of the output, £225,000,000; and the value of goods in the process of manufacture, £79,500. If the policy advocated by honourable members of the Country party were carried into effect, it would be comparatively easy to close a large number of those factories, and' thus throw a large number of people out of employment. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) knows as well as does any other man that once we break down our protective wall, and allow the importer to' compete successfully with the local manufacturer, the wealthy combines in other parts of the Empire will, for a time, sell agricultural implements below cost in when they have achieved their purpose, God help the farmers, for they will ""then be charged ""through the nose,"" and made to pay for the losses which the oversea manufacturer has sustained in knocking his local rivals out of the market. That is the position in which the honourable member and those associated Everywhere throughout the with him will find themselves if they succeed in tearing down the Tariff wall which has been raised for the protection of the Australian manufacturer.

If the honourable member for 'Wimmera wishes to secure a true and lasting Protection, he should advocate, instead of the removal of the Tariff wall, an amendment of the Constitution which would give this Parliament more definite powers to deal with the manufacturer, so that he may not fleece his customers. The High Court has ruled against that power on the ground of its unconstitutionality, but I believe that if the Ministry had any backbone, they could test thab decision, when it would be found that this Parliament has power to fix the price of articles in the factory. That is a means of redress that will be more lasting and less dangerous than the wrecking of the National Protection policy of this country. Oan any honourable member name a nation that, during recent generations, has made forward strides by adopting an absolutely Free Trade policy? As a matter of fact, with the exception of China, there is no really Free Trade country in the world. States of America have shown marked improvement since they adopted the policy of Protect'on. would, ask my friends opposite not to be so persistent in their effort to bring about in this Tariff that which in the long run would cause injury to themselves. I spent my early life on a farm. At that time the farmer used a reaping machine. One man was required to drive the horses, ai.d another was employed at the back of the machine tipping the corn off the board. long list of binders to bind the corn into sheaves and pile them in stooks. others were needed to cart the sheaves from the stooks to the stacks. wards the thresher with his threshing machine and his fifteen or twenty employees proceeded to turn the corn into a marketable state. was a most expensive one. What happens to-day? horses and a good harvester the whole of thg work is done in one operation. Compared with thirty years ago, farming operations can be carried out ten times as cheaply, and this is largely owing to the f:u-t that the manufacturers of AusAfr. Fenton. tralia and the employees in Australian factories have invented, made, and brought into use machinery which enables the farmers to carry out their operations in so simple a f ashion and at such a reduced cost. Surely these men are not always to be regarded as enemies of the farmers? Surely those who have invented agricultural implements and so improved them have done as much for primary production as have'the men who have sown the grain and reaped it. I would like to prevent tbe operations of those who carry on nefarious practices by overcharging the farmers who purchase their machines, but there is a method by which that can be done. By an nrnendment of the Constitution Act this Parliament should be given the right to protect the worker as well as the .manufacturer by putting into practice the. new Protection ideal, which is a plank in the Labour platform. Apart from my earlier experiences, I have moved among farmers in recent years, and at their annual meetings I have been assailed by them for my proCanada and the United tective principles. Invariably my reply has been what I said to one man who stood up as a stout Free Trader. After Therefore, I letting him go for some time, I said, ""You have sons?"" He said, ""Yes,"" and told me he had four. Thereupon I asked him to state in the presence of others who were there whether he expected all of his boys to follow 'him on the farm and become farmers. "" No , "" he said, "" I can see already that there tire two, if not three, of them who will not become farmers, but have an aptitude Following the reaper same a for some other occupation."" I said, "" If you intend to carry out your.Free Trade Then policy, which <means practically wiping out the manufacturing industries of this Aftercountry, what scope will ther<5 be for the aptitude of those boys, and what opportunity will they have in their after life to provide for themselves and those who are The whole process dependent upon them?"" I pointed out that there were thousands of farmers' With a good team of sons employed in various factories. If I could go into the Sunshine harvester works or the Newport workshops, or any other big industrial concern in Melbourne and assemble all the employees just' to ask them one question, ""How many of you are farmers' sons?"" up would go a forest of hands. Why are they there? Because the farmer's lad, when only a boy, said to his father, "" I am not cut out for this game, I do not wish to be a farmer. I prefer to be a blacksmith, because I think I would be a good blacksmith."" work. More sweat drops fall from the blacksmith than from the farmer. But honourable members know that these are the facts. Do they propose to close up all the avenues of employment for these farmers' sons, who, if left on the farms, might make an awful mess of the calling, but might make a great success in life if allowed to follow their natural bents and become blacksmiths, carpenters, and so on ? Divers'ty of employment and variety of occupation are the outstanding features of nations that have made strides in history or become important from an industrial point of view. I did not remain on the farm. My mother apprenticed me to a trade; but when I had served my time. I was obliged to come to the city to follow my calling. I would have preferred to remain near my people, and I asked to be given a journeyman's wage; but my employer said, "" No ; we will struggle on for a time, and put two boys iu your place -"" Some farmers' sons have no possible chance of settling in country districts. Of course, I recognise that one of the great evils of Australia is the fact that there is too great a concentration in our capital cities, and as long as I remain in this HouseI shall assist the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) and others in endeavouring to provide every facility that will induce people to remain on the land. But honourable members sitting in the corner are on the wrong track if they seek to do this by pulling down the Tariff wall. Those who desire to see the industries of Australia reduced to ashes are a menace to the country. It is all very well to talk about purchasing agricultural implements within the British Empire, but if the Farmers' party could induce the Government to accede to their request and reduce the protective duty on some of the implements they wish to purchase, there would be great rejoicing among the farming implement manufacturers of Canada. These gentlemen know that, with the immense sums of money they have at their backs, they could very soon squelch the Australian manufacturer, and then start out upon a splendid expedition with the object of fleecing the primary producers of Australia. I know some of these men who pose as friends of the primary producers. They have beeu quite prepared to selltheir implements to the farmers at a loss until opposition has been knocked out, and then up has gone the price. What did we pay for our reapers and binders before a duty was imposed? The Canadian firms and some English manufacturers had then a practical monopoly of the sale of these implements in Australia, and made farmers here pay through the nose for them. But their prices speedily came down when local manufacturers commenced operations. I warn the farmers' representatives in this House that what they are seeking to do will be very detrimental to the interests of the people they represent, because if we close up these avenues of employment to the large numbers of young people in the country districts who are not prepared to become farmers, we shall be doing something very disastrous to the community generally. Does the honourable member for Cowper believe that there is any better customer for the Australian farmer than the Australian himself? The hundreds of thousands of people employed in the factories are the very best customers the farmers could have, and the better wage they are paid the more money they have to spend on purchasing what the farmer produces. If , on the other hand, they are thrown out of employment through the closing up of industries, they must seek work in some other country. No better inducement could be offered to them to leave Australia. The best inducement to offer to people to come here, or to stay here, is to provide them with remunerative employment. But that cannot be done if our industries are closed up. the honourable member refer ? ticularly to the manufacture of agricultural implements. manufacturers manage' during 1914",34,Greene

I have been interested in witnessing the burning to ashes of the various industries of Australia by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. I have listened with interest to his charge that the party to which I have the honour to belong desires to destroy Australian manufactures. At the outset, on behalf of my party, I give emphatic denial to such an accusation. Whatever opposition may be shown by members of this party to the imposition of the Tariff, it will not be with the a intention of putting any of the workmen of Australia out of employment. Such opposition will be demonstrated, rather, against political pressure being brought to bear in behalf of certain vested interests in order' to continually bump up prices against the best interests of the com1 munity at large. Here, I wish to say that if any manufacturer of any kind of implement, whether for agricultural use or otherwise, cared to bring before us indisputable proof, and were to lay his books open for confidential inspection in support of his claim that Protection, up to a certain degree, at any rate, was necessary to the welfare of his industry, this party would be most willing to assist inaccording such a degree of Protection as would enable him satisfactorily to carry on. which, while they were previously fixed at specific sums, have now become ad ' valorem; they are either ad valorem straight out or alternatively, whichever is the higher. be forgotten that there is a remarkable difference between an ad valorem duty imposed in 1914, or in 1911, or 1908, and an ad valorem duty fixed at the present time. That difference lies in the fact that the purchasing power of money to-day has enormously decreased. The unit figure at this time would be something over 200, where it would have been 100 about five or six years ago. An ad valorem charge, while nominally the same to-day, provides; an infinitely greater degree of Protection than it would have appeared to do six years ago; because as has been the experience following upon all great wars, we are on the eve of a slump; ' but this will be an unprecedented slump so far as concerns the price of raw materials. The depression is bound to last for three or four years at least; and, while it continues, the people of Australia will be burdened, if the present Tariff is continued, with rates of duty which, upon the ad valorem scale as it now stands, will prove doubly hard. I was much struck, when perusing the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), to notice certain terms, first, as they were used by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in his Bendigo speech with regard to the introduction of the Tariff, and the general terms employed by the Minister for Trade and Customs himself. It is remarkable that Mr Hughes said the.Tariff would prove satisfactory to the manufacturers of the Commonwealth; that it would protect industries born during the war, while encouraging others which were desirable; and that it would diversify and expand existing ones. There was no mention, however, of the oldest industry of all, namely, the agricultural industry. ber cannot say that as regards my speech. sequently with the matter of the amount of incentive offered to primary industries by this Tariff. Years ago, when the fight occurred between Eree Trade and ProThere are certain lines of duties tection in England, the struggle was not over the Protection of manufactures, but was waged upon the principle of Protection or Eree Trade as applied to primary products. It is strange to-day that, in It should not an Australian Protective Tariff there should be .no mention of anything except manufactures. We have in this country some industries which are not productive of quite sufficient to meet our requirements, and we import what is necessary to fill those needs. These industries require assistance to enable them to carry ou adequately. At the proper time, I will deal with the measure of Protection which I maintain should be meted out in such circumstances.

Of themselves, duties imposed thereunder are, apparently, no! sufficient, because there is a continual exodus from the country to the cities. actually decreased in the past ten years, as regards primary production, to the extent of some 15 per cent. What is necessary in addition can be illustrated with regard to copper, which is-practically a primary product and basis for other manufactures. . We produce something like 40,000 tons per annum, but only about one-tenth of this is absorbed by Commonwealth industries. The surplus is exported. Germany, and get it back in a manufacpropose to show how the duty on the initial product operates against manufacturers .while being of little use to itself in the secondary industries in which copper is employed.

The producerof copper here gets the world's parity, plus 10 per cent. honourable member is wrong in suggesting that the local producer gets 10 per cent, above world's parity. additional 10 per cent, represented by the duty, and adds freight and other costs. I only instance this item as showing clearly that the mere imposition of a duty is not the only means of encouraging an industry, and . especially primary industries of the character I have mentioned. I am not speaking in a narrow sense, nor has any honourable member of our party done so, in asking Under present for the removal or reduction of duties on tools of trade and agricultural implements. thinks that the tools of trade of all industries should be free of duty? Production in the country has in many instances, they should be free in order to assist and encourage the establishment'of industries here. There must then be methods of encouraging primary industries, and especially the agricultural and pastoral industries, other than by the imposition of protective duties. Such industries may be assisted by means of bonuses, not necessarily in cash, but in the form of substantial facilities which will enable their production to be increased: The Minister, in introducing the Tariff, spoke of subdividing into small blocks land 40 or 50 miles from a railway line, and making it productive; but no one knows better than he I does that it would be useless to subdivide land so situated, and try. to make it productive, without providing facilities to carry its produce to market. It is interesting to note that while this Tariff provides for bonuses or duties to encourage the production of pig iron, it does not provide for bonuses or duties to encourage the production of pigs. bacon. but when there is a shortage of bacon, no Ministry has courage to enforce it. Some time ago the honourable gentleman, when Minister in charge of price fixing, took action to encourage the production of carbide, and spoke rightly of the encouragement of natural industries; yet three or four years ago he proceeded to fix _ "" the price-of beef. If there is one thing more than another that has discouraged primary industry in Australia, it is price fixing. We have to-day a Protectionist House.

The duties in this Tariff were purposely made high, so that they could stand reduction, in the belief that during the necessarily long time that would elapse before they could be discussed, and finally dealt with, they would yield a very large amount of revenue. That, no doubt, is good business from the point of view of the Government. In this admittedly Protectionist House we have a continuous clamour on the part of the Labour party for high duties, and at the same time for cheap bread. Honourable members opposite are anxious for the imposition of high duties which will enable big revenues to be collected. They appreciate the fact that if local manufacturers, as the result of the Protection afforded them, increase their prices to just below those at which they can bo undersold by the importers, the general public-no t merely the primary producers, but the people as a whole w ill be at a loss to know where to look for the actual cause of high prices. P it t , something like 150 years ago, pointed out that by means of indirect taxation it was possible to tax the coat off a man's back without his being conscious of it . And that is what is happening under this Tariff. A man so taxed wonders what is responsible for high prices, and does not know who to blame. Yet the same members object to pay world's parity for foodstuffs. I agree with the Minister for Trade and Customs that in order to enable real encouragement to be given our primary industries the Commonwealth Parliamentmust be given additional powers. should have, for instance, power so to control primary industries as to encourage and increase them. One of the first steps to be taken, with that object in view is that of liberalizing the conditions under which our rural dwellers live. Especially should we liberalize their postal, telegraph, telephone, power, and transport facilities. to the Government a splendid opportunity to encourage and increase our primary industries by liberalizing the systems under which the perishable products of the farmer can be transformed into imperishable products capable of being retained for a relatively long time, and so rendered independent of market vagaries. By the conversion of our starch into glucose, our potatoes into flour or starch, and the canning of our fruits we would render such products practically imperishable; In this -way many perishable products could be made fit for use even twelve or eighteen months after production; the market prices of the product would be stabilized, and ultimately the consumer also would be helped, since the waste which follows every glut at the present time would be avoided. Every one knows, for instance, what"" occurs when we have a good season for potatoes. In the Clarence River district this season, owing to the want of such facilities many farmers with 50 or 60 acres of potatoes to market had to send to their commission agents some £50 or £60 to make good the actual losses on sales caused by the necessity for dumping ithe perished article into the sea. member think that it would be better so to arrange things that there would hie more people in Australia to eat our potatoes, rendering it unnecessary to convert them into starch. the objects I have in view; but I do not think that any rapid increase in the population of Australia is possible while our Constitution remains as it is, and especially while we have our present unwieldly States. but it does not touch the question which I asked the honourable member. irrefutable proof that it is practically impossible by means of a Tariff alone It such as this to establish rural industries. All that we can do under present conditions of constitution and size of States by means of such Tariffs is to continually increase the population of the big capital cities, where the living conditions are rapidly becoming worse and worse; where the health of the children There is also open is deteriorating, and where their chance of becoming physically strong is becoming less and less, while at the same time people are fleeing fro m the country districts as from a land of desolation.

We have in the attitude taken up by our sugar producers during the war a happy illustration of the good results which attend the policy of treating the primary producer reasonably, and giving him something like a fair show. For many years, largely with the object of supporting the policy of a White Australia, aud to make it possible for us to hold the north, the Commonwealth Parliament subsidized the sugar industry. Then came the period of the war, during which the price of sugar in other countries soared enormously. Australian producers of sugar hold out for the world's parity ? No! They were willing to take one-third of the world's parity so long as they were given a reasonable assurance of the stabilization of their industry for a term of only three years. We shall have the same experience in relation to every primary industry if our producers are given an opportunity to do their best, and having done their best, are allowed to obtain a fair price for their produce. Tbe Tariff could be so framed as to help very largely in the establishment of secondary industries in country districts, and more particularly near the sources of supply of raw material, by penalizing to some extent the imports, say, of rice, so as to. prevent the manufacture of starch from rice grown abroad instead of from maize grown in Australia. If we are going to do any good with our industries, if we are to people Australia as rapidly as is necessary, if we hope to hold this country and mean it to be of any avail instead of a mere drag on the Empire, we must provide for thoroughly comprehensive power schemes throughout the Continent, such as will enable country industries to spring up, and to make the fullest use of their opportunities. Since Protection became the national policy of Australia some eighteen years ago, the population of Sydney has enormously increased; but with the exception of ""Newcastle, practically no other city or town in New South Wales has expanded or grown up. With a comprehensive plan of power distribution the position would Dr. Earle Page. The Minister deserves the be different. The control of such a scheme must be Federal. By reason of the long distances, electric power can be transmitted by modern means. Practically all water power propositions, and many of the fuel power schemes, must be interState iu their incidence, and unless there is some Federal power of initiative and control they will never be started, as the districts they will supply and develop are remote from the capital cities of their respective States. The Kievva water scheme near the Murray will influence the Riverina as well as Victoria, the Snowy River scheme will influence southern New South Wales as well as Gippsland, while the Clarence scheme will influence Queensland as well But did the as New South Wales, and so on. If there is not constitutional power for the Federal Government to initiate them, power ought to be sought in the Convention so that the needs of every State may be supplied. Our aim in Austral a should : uot be to build up huge industrial cities, but right through the country, cities of a size which has been proved by experience to be the best for manufacturing, health, and social purposes. The best size of such cities is no mere guesswork now; it is known that when a city becomes over a certain size it loses its manufacturing value, because workmen have to travel too far to work, and. departs from its proper' functions, involving degeneration and ill-health of its population. Owing to the lack of power facilities, and the way in which the State railway systems have, quite unconstitutionally in my opinion, imposed differential rates, certain promising towns have been prevented from developing. Towns in the State of Victoria are a case in point. There are many towns in this State, like Bendigo and Castlemaine, which had good opportunities for becoming manufacturing centres, but have been prevented from developing owing to the causes I have mentioned. A t present there is a recrudescence of interest in various Victorian towns; butthere is no doubt that as soon as any one of them makes any headway, and promises to rival the big commercial centres, the differential rates will again be called into play, their industries strangled, and under such conditions it is very difficult to procure the introduction of capital country manufacturers and foundries. for country industries.

Under the new order of things, if a farmer at Tamworth wants any corrugated iron, or fencing wire, or wire netting from Newcastle, he will be compelled to purchase it from the local manufacturer, or, if he desires to have imported goods from England or America, he will have to pay extra freight, i.e., if he desires any of those commodities, the freight will be £2 4s. 2d. per ton for local manufacture, and £3 2s. per ton for imported. The same rates and difference would be maintained throughout the State, according to disCance. He has already paid his Customs duties, and on the top of that he has to pay the extra freightI am very much surprised to see this new clause brought into operation, as it appears the Commissioners would penalize the farmers for the use of the State Government. for purchasing imported materials. I am naturally a Protectionist, but I think the proper method to give the manufacturer Protection is the Customs House; I think that that is the general opinion. The Country party believes that Australia should be self-contained and selfpopulated. that can be done under Free Trade? cating Free Trade, but, under present conditions, it seems impossible to decentralize industry without some constituthe rate on tional change; and, in my opinion, that change should have been made before the I suppose it is Tariff was imposed, and not afterwards. It has taken fifty years to double our population, and if it takes another fifty to double it again, Australia will be lost to us, and the British race. The oniy method to prevent this is, as has already been suggested, to increase our population in scattered areas in order to secure many manufacturing communities by subdividing the present big States and enabling them to prevent themselves being penalized in their use of the State railways, and with sufficient influence on metropolitan communities to insure a fair deal. This has always proved to be the only way to insure rapid development and rapid increase of population, and secure a rural population. To do any good we must first populate the country, and then the city ; and to endeavour to do this by continually increasing the duties on articles essential to country industries other point is that of machinery essential for these industries, especially that for the production of power. It is necessary to have protection for a l l, but some industries need it in the form of duties, while others need it in the form of a bonus.

A revenue Tariff is dangerous, because it is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring, and it detrimentally affects the industrial section of the community more than it does the people who are in affluent circumstances. In respect of commodities which can be produced in Australia of a quality equal to that of the imported article, prohibitive duties should be imposed. A person who is so enamoured of his friends overseas that he w ill not use articles of Australian origin should be compelled to pay a heavy duty for his fancy. Therefore, the present Tariff does not go as far as I would like in respect of some items. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert-Best) was concerned during the war because he could not purchase English chocolates.

Minister for Repatriation) [8.1] -Be tween the adjournment of the House, last November and"" its reassembling yesterday, the Government took action to declare null and void the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel James Walker as War Service Homes Commissioner, and in support of that action I wish to make a statement. On the 9th March, as the Acting Minister, for the first time. I received information that Lieutenant-Colonel James Walker, at the date of his appointment as War Service Homfis Commissioner (6th March, 1919) was an uncertificated insolvent. The War Service HomesA c t provides (section 6) that "" the Governor General may appoint a fit and proper person to be Commissioner,"" and (section 7) that "" a person who is an uncertificated bankrupt or insolvent shall be incapable of being appointed Commissioner."" On the same day (9th March) I gave instructions for the correctness of the in formation to be investigated, as, obviously, if the information were correct, LieutenantrColonel Walker was incapable On one of being appointed Commissioner, and his appointment was null and void. On 10th March a report was received by the Solicitor-General that LieutenantColonel Walker had been adjudicated in solvent in Queensland on 25th October, 1915, and had remained an uncertificated insolvent until 19bh July, 1919. when the adjudication was annulled. This report I was referred to me on l l t h March. I immediately communicated the in formation to the Prime Minister, who consulted with his colleagues, and the Government decided to take immediate and definite action. Accordingly, on 10th March, I sent for Lieutenant-Colone'l Walker, and questioned him on the subject. LieutenantColonel Walker admitted that the facts were as stated, but said that the circumstances of his insolvency were not discreditable to him, and that the facts were known to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D . Millen) at the time of his appointment, as a telegram on the file would show. As Senator E. D . Millen had not vet returned from the Geneva Conference, the Government decided to take no final action before his return; but immediately granted Lieutenant-Colonel Walker a week's leave of absence to cover the in terval until he would get back, instructing him meantime,not to perform auy administrative acts, and appointed ColonelJ . M . Semmens as Acting Commissioner during Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's absence. I also informed Lieutenant-Colonel Walker that he would be given an opportunity of meeting Senator E. D . Millen on his return, and making any statement he desired before final action was taken. SenatorE . D . Millen immediately on his return informed his colleagues and Lieutenant-Colonel Walker that he had never bsen aware of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's insolvency, and LieutenantColonel Walker thereupon said that he accepted this statement. A t no time, until questioned on 10th March last, did Lieutenant-Colonel Walker take any steps to inform the Minister or any member of the Government of his insolvency.",46,Earlepage T H At Is No Makes The Task Hopeless The Only
167,Mr Rodgers (Wannon,"AssistantThe Government decided that, on the above facts, no course was open to it but to treat Lieutenant-Colonel Walker's appointment as a nullity, and at an Executive Council meeting held on 18th March the Governor General in Council accordingly declared the appointment to be null and void. Those are merely the facts and dates relevant to and supporting the action of the Government, and I propose to take an early opportunity to make a f u l l statement concerning the general administration of the War Service Homes Commission, and to announce more fully the Government's intentions regarding future operations. I move That the paper , be printed. pected, from the Minister a much fuller statement than -we have just heard. He has told us that the reason for the suspenthe defendant, returned from the war, sion and subsequent dismissal from office of Lieutenant-Colonel Walker was that he at the time of his appointment was an uncertificated insolvent. Now, there is a good deal to be said about the facts of the insolvency. Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, with four others, was a guarantor to the Bank of Australasia for an advance to provide funds to buy machinery and pay for the sinking of shafts and prospecting work generally in connection with a gold and copper mine at Charters Towers, a venture which proved a failure. Subsequently, the bank sued Lieutenant-Colonel Walker for the amount it had advanced. He was the only guarantor who was sued, the chairman of the company, also a guarantor and the owner of 18,000 shares in the company, being the principal witness against him. Neither the chairman of the compnay nor any other-guarantor except Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, who was made the scapegoat for all, was interfered with. Walker was away at the war at the time. then a member of the Australian Imperial Force. Front when further proceedings were taken. It was not until the war was over that he was able to defend himself. I have here all the documents relating to the case, but I shall not weary honourable members with unnecessary detail. This is a resume of what occurred: On the 13th May, 1915, the Bank of Australasia issued a writ for £2,865 19s. Id. against Lieutenant-Colonel Walker on the joint and several guarantee of the directors of the Carrington Land and Mining Company, that guarantee having been given on the 10th June, 1910, four years before the outbreak of war. The bank took no action against the other guarantors. A t the issue of the writ, Lieutenant-Colonel Walker was in camp, and left shortly after. There were really three guarantees dated 16th September, 1909; 24th April, 1910; and 10th June, 1910. On the 2nd July, 1915, judgment was given against the defendant, and on 10th July, 1915, a debtor's summons was issued, and an order for substituted service made. During the same year the defendant was adjudicated insolvent, and his only creditor was the bank. In 1917, and his solicitors entered into some correspondence with the bank with a view to getting the insolvency annulled; but the defendant returning to the front, nothing more was done. On 14th July, 1919, an order of annulment gave as the reason, "" Insolvent having obtained a release of the debt due to the Bank of Australasia, the only creditor who had proved against his estate."" An order of annulment is only made when. creditors give release, and otherwise a certificate of discharge is applied for. The bank had annulled the insolvency, and realized on the assets of the company, which fully discharged the liabilities of the guarantors. An order, of annulment is only made when the creditors give release, and unless there is anything of a questionable nature involved, it merely becomes a matter of granting a certificate. In this case a certificate was not granted, but the insolvency was annulled. The Judge who heard the case expressed his sympathy with LieutenantColonel Walker, and, so far as I am able Lieutenant-Colonel to understand, said that it was a serious matter, because the bank had been unnecessarily severe, for, as LieutenantColonel Walker was the only one of the guarantors who was in a position to pay, he alone was proceeded against. I submit that Lieutenant-Colonel Walker was fully qualified to hold the position to which he was appointed.

Many of the vocational trainees are to-day being fooled in the most absurd fashion. They would learn more with a private employer in three months than they learn under the existing system in eighteen months. As a matter of fact, it frequently happens that after they have completed their course of training they are obliged to go outside and -mlearn all bhat they have learned'. As the Minister himself knows, I have upon several occasions privately urged h i m to take some action in this connection. I made similar requests to his predecessor, the present Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton).

I have been told by returned soldiers in Queensland that War Service Homes which they were informed would cost them from £650 to £750. ultimately cost them an additional £200. Is this dismissal of Lt Colonel Walker mere camouflage on the part of the Government with the object of throwing on him the blame for blunders that have been made by them? Are they trying in this way to protect themselves from the result of their own sins of commission?

He does not ask to be retained ; all he wants to know is what the Government are dismissing him for, and I say to the Government, "" For Heaven's sake, tell him."" [8.52] -l t is evident that the Government have made either too full a statement, or what amounts to no statement at all. Lieut -Colonel Walker had charge of a Department with enormous ramifications, and responsible for great expenditure. That Department has had many supporters, and on the other hand its operations have, been strongly opposed by several sections of the community, notably that section whose business it is to contract for the building of houses. We have been told that it caused a dearth of building material, and, rightly or wrongly, the public will believe that the Government are availing themselves of a technicality in order to get r'd*of Lieut -Colonel Walker. Oue honourable member suggests that the returned soldiers will not be sorry; but I know ""two returned men who have growled most about the War Service Homes, one of whom was the inspector for the district in which his house is built, the other being the foreman of the house. We know from the building section of the community that the ""War Service Homes are quite good houses, and better than those that are built by contract. If the complaints of other returned soldiers are of the' same character as those of the two men I have mentioned, we cannot believe much of them. Many of us did not agree with much that was done by the War Service Homes Department, and I am certain that both the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) and the Assistant Minister( Mr South Australia is that there they allowed Rodgers) have had differences of opinion with their departmental officers. They would not be human if they did not. The Minister may have made his statement today with the best of intentions, but surely he can see that unless some further explanation is offered the public will, believe that the Government have availed themselves of the peculiar circumstances under which Colonel Walker was engaged to get rid of him to satisfy the cormorants of Australia, because he beat them. I was. told in Queensland a few weeks ago by contractors that the action of the War Service Homes Commissioner kept down the price of building material. That statement is true not only of Queensland, but of New South Wales and Victoria. Government gave Lieut -Colonel Walker a fair deal? do on the-information at present before me. I want to know more of the facts. The Minister has said too little or too much. Anyhow, I have indicated the way in which the public will look at the matter. I was told two vears ago by two Melbourne contractors, who for the pastthirty years have been building cottage homes as a speculation for sale, that it was the fight put up by the War Service Homes Commissioner that kept down the price of all building commodities in Melbourne. That applies to lime, cement, timber, bricks, and paint. in South Australia all round. the honourable member directly. I wish, if possible, to leave the South Australians alone, as they are suffering very badly from a swelled head, which I fear will ultimately burst. It was a dirty game that they played over there in connexions with the building of homes. The War Service Homes Commissioner even compelled the ironmongers of Melbourne to sell their goods to the public at a price some 20 or 30 per cent, less .than they wanted to. ' With this knowledge in their possession, what we have heard to-night will make the public believe, rightly or wrongly, that the profiteers have got to work with the Government, and demanded Lieut Colonel Walker's discharge because he fought^ and beat them. The peculiarity in the contractors to beat the Government. That is why South Australian members do not like the question to be discussed. In South Australia they set out to build homes for the ordinary workers, and the undertaking was a failure. When there was a necessity to build for returned soldiers, they dropped the building for the workers, and started building for the others.

Then the South Australians tried to come over lfere, and teach their "" grandmother to suck eggs,"" but they found they could not do it . It is of no use to mince matters. Unless Ministers will tell us more than they have told us to-night, the public will form the impression that Lieut -Colonel Walker has been beaten by the combines of Melbourne. That is what I am going to believe unless I hear something more. As I say, there was much done under the War Service Homes scheme with which . I -and many others did not agree, and I was somewhat surprised to find that there was no money for certain work because it had already been spent in other directions. The cost of the purchase of the timber supplies should never have been charged to current account, because that will be an asset when the work is finished, and the extra money could have been obtained to continue other work if the Department had wanted it . I cannot understand the Minister's motive in making the statement he has made to-night. AmI to understand front the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) that the Government are not prepared to make any further statement regarding Lieut -Colonel Walker? I know it is not fair to ask the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to taket he matter out of the hands of his colleague, but surely we should have more information than has been vouchsafed. Perhapsi f I sit down the Treasurer will act upon my suggestion. If my information is correct, I consider ' £he Government have been more than kind to this man, for it shows that he is possibly the worse man who could have been appointed to the position. There is a letter referring to this case in the hands of the Attorney-General( Mr Hughes), and I moved yesterday that the evidence should be printed, because a request to that effect had been made by three leading legal firms in this city, who desired it to be available for reference. I believe that charges amounting to actual perjury will be laid against Lieut -Colonel Walker. soldiers and officers who know him how they have been treated. Honourable members should ask Captain Burkett his opinion of this man. I shall read a few clauses of the letter to which I have referred as in the possession of the Attorney-General, as follows:The Commissioner, to destroy Caldwell's testimony and his bona fides, deliberately volunteered (by producing his file) a single sheet which, he' said, was signed by Mr Caldwell in his presence, and in the presence of the architect and the accountant. Fortunately, Mr Caldwell and I were present, and I insisted upon Mr Caldwell examining it ; and I examined it afterwards, and I publicly said that it was not signed by Mr Caldwell. The Committee then insisted upon detaching this sheet from the file, and Colonel Walker was severely cross-examined by Senator Millen, and he broke down, and ultimately withdrew his sworn statement as untrue. He was trying to ruin, another AustralianThe importance of. this was that Walker, in order to bolster up his untruthfu l statement on oath to impress the Committee, audaciously challenged tlie Committee to call a writin g expert who would prove what he swore, namely, that this document was signed by Mr Caldwell. This was supposed to be a written statement which Mr Caldwell had signed, and in which he was called the "" lessee."" When Walker was under the cross-examination of Senator Millen, he tried to substitute a four-page document for the single-page document, which Senator Millen1 strongly resented. Having regard to this deliberate and malicious attempt to further injure Mr Caldwell's rights by a malevolent official, I have now to formally request, on Mr. Caldwell's behalf, that he be prosecuted forthwith for perjury. The evidence is complete, the shorthandwriter can be called, and the secretary to the Committee. Senator Millen can also verify these facts. Mr Caldwell w ill give evidence, aind the pressmen present can also bo called to testify to this incident. I w ill be glad if you w ill give forthwith ths necessary instructions for the prosecution of the malefactor. It is obviously your duty as the highest law officer to see that the law is maintained and enforced. Perjury should be punished. , I w ill await your reply for seven days, after which Mr Caldwell w ill act as he is advised for the purpose of seeing justice; done. . . . That letter was written by Mr Joseph Woolf, one of the leading legal practitioners in Australia. I hope that a strict inquiry will be made into this matter.

238,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [9.0],"honourable members who know the work that officer did during the late war, and on the platform, will admit that he is a man on whose statements we can rely. I have no personal interests in the case. I received this correspondence only this afternoon; and had I known that the matter was coming up to night, I should have given the dinner adjournment to a study of it. If this man has been wrongfully dismissed, by all means let him have an opportunity to prove his innocence. To produce a document which is absolutely forged, in order to ruin another Australian, is infamous. I know that the soldiers have not been treated as well as, perhaps, honourable members would desire. Any man put into a position such as that occupied by Colonel ""Walker ought to be of a character absolutely above reproach; but the streets of Melbourne, actually shriek at his name. I do not love the Government, and would gladly have voted against them last night if given the opportunity; but, in justice to them, I repeat that they have been more than kind to Colonel Walker. I personally asked the Attorney General to take notice of a letter which contains accusations so serious, for if not . we may have a case only equalled by that of that unfortunate gentleman, the Rev.

How those honourable members can reconcile the two positions I am at a loss to understand. I am quite prepared to assist the primary producers to get a fair return; but how are they to sell their products if the people in the cities have no means with which to purchase them? I remember that in the early days, when Free Trade was the policy of New South Wales, I was regarded as a great curiosity, and called all sorts of funny names, for advocating that Australia should be self-contained. I am not going to call my honourable friends in the Government corner names; because I think that an intellectual re-adjustment on their part may cause them to realize the possibility of making Australia self-contained. I ask those honourable members who are not in accord with my views on Tariff matters if they are prepared to destroy the great steel works at Newcastle, controlled by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company; to destroy Thompson Brothers establishment at Castlemaine; and the great works controlled by Walker Brothers, of Maryborough; or, again, if they are opposed to the establishment by Cadburys, of England, of a big manufacturing industry in Tasmania? I think it has been said that the statesman is a man who can look some centuries ahead; but members of the Corner party appear to be able to see only the length of a cow. We want in this Parliament men who will do something to build up the nation. We want more than we are getting at present for the expenditure of millions of pounds upon the education of our people. It was my misfortune that the opportunities, now available to the younger generation, were denied to me. Hadi t been otherwise, I would have been much more effective than I have been in my attempts at social reform for the purpose of increasing the comforts of the people. We should see to it that the younger generation are not denied the opportunity of entering into those avenues of industry for which Australia is so well suited. Free Trade, no doubt, > is an admirable doctrine, mentioned in the Scriptures; but as a practical, working principal, it is a fatal barrier to progress. It is, and musb be, the duty of this Parliament to make it possible for our people to be profitably employed. I agree that it is most unfortunate that our population is so distributed that about 49 per cent, of the people in Victoria are gathered in the city of Melbourne, about 41 per cent, of the people of New South Wales in Sydney, and about 54 per cent, of the people of South Australia in Adelaide.

She began her successful career as a manufacturing country when she put up a protective wall which prevented outside competition with her manufactures. Who will contend that that was anything but good for America? Let us consider the question of the beet sugar industry. In the early seventies the sugar trade of the world was controlled by Great Britain, and yet, fifteen years later, Germany collared the sugar trade of the world with her beet sugar industry. Because of this Great Britain lost the West Indies trade, and was entirely dependent on Germany for sugar. Great Britain had no trade in sugar in 1914, whilst at that time Germany produced S,500,000 tons of beet sugar.

It must be admitted by honourable members opposite that the primary producers, particularly the farmers, have no beneficial Protection. tion with local manufactures. They are getting a little out of butter at the present time, but not from any Protection. Protection om wheat. In fact, they are obliged to sell their products throughout the world's markets without any Protection. On these grounds, the honourable members for Swan and Wimmera claimed that the farmers ought to have a practically free market .for their machinery; and the honourable member for Wimmera even went further, and became somewhat abusive in a way that was not at all justified. We in Australia ought to be proud of the men who have given us our agricultural machinery. We ought to be proud of our Australian inventions, and of those who have taken up the ideas of others and manufactured a . class of machinery that is not equalled in any other part of the world. in any other part of the world. so sure of that. The honourable member for Swan erred in his reference to binders, hot so much in his statement that there has hitherto been no duty upon them, but because he failed to realize that, without the competition of Australian manufacturers, Canada and the TJnited States of America could charge the Australian producers whatever they liked. This year, for the coming season's requirements, imported binders were quoted at from £120 to £130; but when the local binder came on the market at £100, the imported article dropped in price to £100. posed on binders, the imported binder was selling at £80. In January last, the price quoted was £120. perfectly true. The imported article rose to £120. of the Tariff. of agricultural machinery was increased generally because of the higher cost of raw material brought about through shipping. The price of the imported articles was increased generally by an amount which was double the increase on the implements which came into competiI hope that, in the consideration of this Tariff, honourable members will keep in They have no beneficial view one special feature. About three years ago, many honourable members, in anticipation of Tariff alterations, sought to have 'a thorough investigation by capable men of the position and outlook of Australian industries. The Government complied with that request by instructing the then Inter-State Commission to make a thorough investigation. I followed the Commission's inquiry carefully, and, in my opinion, it was the most thorough and practical that has ever been attempted. The result was to give honourable members good, solid information regarding the real needs of our industries, and such as might guard them against decisions which would unduly fatten our manufacturers, and build up in Australia millionaire employers, such as we hear of in America, whose example we do not wish to follow in that respect. The investigations of the. Inter-State Commission provided reliable and valuable information on which to consider Tariff questions. I regret that we have not the conclusions of the Commission in a condensed form. buted to honourable members a book containing these conclusions in condensed form. still available? merely enough to give one to each honourable member. should be exceedingly valuable to honourable members.

If we do not get revenue by means of duties, how are we to get it ? the farmers would be called upon to provide all the revenue instead of the whole community contributing to it. that makes me more of a tariffist than I should otherwise be. Members of the Country party sometimes speak as if all knowledge regarding country interests were in them, and I ask them to remember, so far as the income tax is concerned, that it is levied on a progressive scale, and that the higher rates have been levied largely on an annual value of wool amounting to £50,000,000. Next year, however, there will be only £15,000,000 worth of wool to tax. much. lowing year there may be still less. That will diminish the revenue from income taxation. But there are others besides the farmer and the manufacturer to be considered. There is the great public, the general body of consumers. I am anxious to know if the consumers are going ""to have a fair deal. I am not a believer in the policy of price fixing; and I challenge any honourable member of this Chamber to prove that it has been the means of keeping down the cost of living, particularly during the period of the war. I believe it has been the means of increasing it. In dealing with the Tariff, we have to consider the future of Australian industries, and how far it is possible to extend them beyond what we .have already achieved in converting raw materials into the finished article,, or, at all events, up to the point of Australia's complete requirements. At the same time, we have to protect the public. How are we going to do it? I do not believe in price fixing such as we had during the war period; and if we are going to face this "" Massy Greene"" Tariff in its most extravagant phases, we must consider how we are going to protect the consumers. This is a serious matter, because we have no right to saddle our people with an unjustifiable burden, and go beyond the point which will give to the promoters of our new, and also bur old, industries a reasonable possibility of success. We can do it without injuring the farmer, who is at all times a most reasonable man. It is wrong to tempt the farmer into believing that he represents the most important section of the community, and that Parliament or the country have no interest in his welfare, because that it absolutely untrue.

We were informed by the Government quite recently that the Inter-State Commission no longer exists, because its work has, so far as the purpose for which it was created is concerned,, been completed.

There are two results which are very obvious with respect to the Tariff. Whatever may have been the intention of the Government, one of those two results is that the Tariff has proved the means pf collecting a colossal revenue.
