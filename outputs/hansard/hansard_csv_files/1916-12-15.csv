0,"Copper For The Manufacture Of Munitions Of War ? Question In Black And White, So That I Can See Whither It Leads Me. When We Are Dealing With A Commodity, The Price Of Which Is Fixed In The Markets Of The World, And The Local Consumption Of Which Is Infinitesimal Compared With The Oversea Business, One Must Hesitate A Good Deal Before He Attempts To Depress The Local Price Of The Raw Material Below The World's Price. Of Course, I» Shall See That The Local Price Is Not Inflated Beyond Ference To The Imprisonment Of His' Son The London Parity, But There Must Be Some Very Good And Sufficient Reason Be","fore we endeavour to depress it below that parity. We do not attempt that in connection with any other commodity. For instance, we are selling wheat now at 4s. 9d. f.o.b., and 4s. 9d. for local consumption. The same condition applies to products generally. for Trade and Customs inform the House generally at what stage the proceedings are in' connection with the proposed arsenal? Is it the Government's intention to go on with the work now, or are they going to take the wiser course of postponing it for further advice? Treasurer stated that a report on the question was now being prepared by an expert, and nothing will be done until that report is presented.

11,Mr Tudor,"I rise to make a perof that letter. Senator Russell knew that. -The Age endeavours to make it appear that my resignation was on account of the receipt of that letter. I received no such letter, and my intention was well known to Ministers. I did not make it known to any outsiders u n t i l I had written to the Prime Minister, but he knows that I notified him as to the course of action I proposed to take. The Age is doing me an injustice in saying that I resigned in obedience to an instruction, when, as a matter of fact, my mind had been made up long before any such letter as that mentioned by Senator Russell was written. .General taken cognisance of the fact that various trade unions are passing; resolutions in favour of the Industrial Workers of the World, and that some of them are reflecting on the justice of the Court which tried certain men ?

I have expressly refrained from saying more in connection w i th this matter than that, in my opinion, no peace will be satisfactory that does not place the countries which have been invaded, outraged, and destroyed back where they were, with an indemnity sufficiently large to re-establish their industries and rebuild their ruined cities, and, in addition, insure that this international criminal, that has outraged the world, is prevented from ever again doing so. my question.

Minister and Attorney-General) [11.41]. -The honourable member for Yarra did not deal with the Deluge, but he touched on almost every other subject. He passed very lightly over tlie fact that this House is very jealous of its privileges, and that the Senate, which has made this request to us to cut down Supply from three to two months, is thereby seeking to take out of the hands of this branch of the Legislature the control of the purse that properly belongs to it . If the question is solely one as to whether we should remain here to do our duty, I am bound to say I see no reason why we should adjourn over the Christmas holidays. Either certain measures are urgent or they are not. If they are urgent, there is no reason why we should adjourn except over Sunday and Christmas Day. One would imagine, after hearing the honourable member for Yarra's speech on the urgency of the iron bounty that unless it was dealt with forthwith dreadful things would happen. Notwithstanding the urgency of that matter, however, he contemplates that we should engage for at least a month in a recruiting campaign. on the position that this House has to determine how the moneys of the people shall be spent. It has also to determine the length of Supply necessary for the purposes of the Government. It determined by an overwhelming majority that three months' Supply was necessary. the House was unanimous. overwhelming majority in this Housei n favour of granting the Government three months' Supply that the honourable member for Yarra and his followers were not. prepared to challenge us. No argument is put forward in support of this request except that we ought to go on with some work. I am prepared to go on with work every day in the week except Sunday, but like an offer I once made to cut down all salaries to 10s. a day, it is quite clear that such a proposal does not evoke any enthusiasm. I do not think that any Government would live long that ventured to ask Parliament to sit six days a week. If Parliament did sit six days a week the sessions would be short, which would be a salutary reform. I am prepared to fix a date for the re-assembling of Parliament which will enable us io deal with the Tariff and the iron bounty, both of which must either be passed practically without discussion, or must take five or six months to discuss. The alternatives are to legalize what has been done, or to thresh out the subjects at length. If the iron bounty is unsuitable, let it run out at the end of the year. If not, let us consider it under the new conditions. The iron industry is in a better position now than it was when the bounty was granted. If we accept two months' supply, Parliament will have to re-assemble in the last week of January, or in the first week of February, and it is desirable, for the sake of the recruiting campaign, that we shall adjourn u n t i l , say, the third week in February. be started in the wheat districts for a month to come. u n t i l after the holidays, and then a f u l l month will be needed to start the campaign. We ought not to contemplate reassembling before the thir d week in February, or the first week in March. That should be a satisfactory arrangement for I take my stand all parties. It would give sufficient time for the recruiting campaign, in which all parties can earnestly co-operate. On reassembling, we shall have time to deal with the matters that have been mentioned. No case can be made out for the unprecedented attempt of the Senate to take the control of the public purse from this House, a control which it should never surrender, and the circumstances do not warrant the granting of a lesser supply than that for which we have asked. do not, and I am sure the Committee does not, regard the request of the Senate as unprecedented. That body is quite within its rights in asking us to provide for two months' instead of for three months' Supply. Y e t the Prime Minister has exalted its request into a refusal to grant Supply, and into an attempt to take from this House the control of the purse. Is not that'an exaggeration?

(Capricornia) [11.51],"I have been sent to it without sufficient time being allowed for their proper consideration. this SupplyB ill was discussed in the Senate for a much longer time than was given to any of the Supply Bills introduced by the honourable member. Liberal party, who is the strong supporter of the present Government objection to him is that he is not a strong supporter of the House of Tudor. the Liberal party w ill say that the last Government, just prior to the 30th June last, was able to pass expenditure, amounting to millions of pounds, in a few minutes; but the reason why the Estimates for last year were not considered at an earlier date was that the Prime Minister was away in Englandf or a considerable part of the year. He had in tended to be away for four months only, and with our consent remained away for seven months. If the Prime Minister is willing that Parliament shall re-assemble in the third week in February, two months' Supply will be ample. That will carry the Treasurer to the 15th February, after which date he can provide for expenditure out of the Advance. In his interim financial statement the honourable gentleman said that on taking charge of the Treasury he found that his predecessor had authorized the expenditure since the 1st J u l y of the whole amount of his £1,700,000. £5S,000 to that. gave a table showing the amounts provided in the SupplyB ill paid for in the State, although in some States the popuprevious year from loan funds, authority being taken from the Treasurer's A d vance for the expenditure of £1,020,000.

The SenateI might have added has as much right as the House of Representatives to supervise the public expenditure. Why was the Senate constituted as it is, with six representatives from each lation is quite out of proportion to that of large States like New South Wales and Victoria? Why is it that Tasmania has six representatives in the Senate, while New South Wales, with a very much What is the larger population, has only the same number? The reason is that if the Senate had not such representation it would be a very easy matter for the honourable member for Barrier and other representatives of New South Wales, together with representatives of Victoria, to vote away money as they liked, quite ignoring the interests of the smaller States.",14,Supplybill No 3 1916 17

There is not one constitutional writer who does not point out strongly that when a legislative body is given power to suggest and reject, it has practically most of the powers contained in the right to make amendments. Therefore, it is improper for this House to say that the Senate, in exercising the functions vested in it by the Constitution, is infringing the rights of this Chamber. I cannot imagine a more dangerous practice than that, in order to get an immediate party advantage, the rights of the second Chamber should be interfered with.

I believe the burden of making a success of this campaign to rest mainly on the Labour Opposition, who declared themselves utterly opposed to compulsion, and in favour of the voluntary system. ber cannot say I killed it , because, in the part I took in the campaign, I do not think I antagonized one single man. Personally, I have no hopes that the voluntary system will give us the necessary reinforcements, and I predict that, in a few weeks, all the men now in camp will be on the water, and practically very few recruits will take their places. We shall then find ourselves with a costly war organization, suggestive of a huge industrial factory, with everybody on the pay-sheet, and f u l l steam up, but no raw material. For all this the country w ill have to foot the bill, and, at the same time, we shall have no reinforcements. I am not personally keen on the proposal p u t before the country as a war policy, either as a means of raising men or of getting money. We shall not get reinforcements unless the Opposition Labour party can assure us that they are sufficiently in touch with their constituents to make it certain that the voluntary system can be resuscitated and produce the numbers. I have taken opportunities presented to consult residents of parts of my constituency-of consulting recruiting sergeants and others who ought to know the facts, and I find that some parts of the district have done splendidly-so closely have they been combed out that not an eligible man is left. And yet we are now asked to go back with an indiscriminate appeal, and allow public men to be made cock-shies of in their attempt to do a job that has already been declared to be a failure. There cannot be any one, from the Prime Minister downwards, who in his heart believes that the proposed scheme will give us the necessary reinforcements. native.

Not more than a fortnight ago it was declared throughout the world that Germany was organizing on a mammoth scale her manhood Prime Minister spoke of it power, munitions, and so for t h , and that more a she was about to deliver a staggering blow such as humanity had never before experienced. What was our answer to that? a referendum under which the vote was "" No . "" This casts an obligation on somebody, arid that somebody is represented by those responsible for the "" No "" vote; on them is cast the responsibility of making the proposed campaign a success. I , of course, shall do all I can, b u t I cannot believe the scheme will succeed . To the Mother Country, on whom most of the burden of the war rests, we owe a greater duty than that of reverting to a system which has proved a failure. I really think that we might call a truce in politics. L e t us p u t aside a l l our political differences, and agree unanimously as to the attitude we shall adopt in the prosecution of the war. This of all times is the time when the Empire should be one united people. I suggest that tlie Prime Minister, with the consent of Parliament-if not the present Prime Minister, some other oneshould take the initiative in inviting the Mother Country to call a council of the Empire. A post-war conference to divide the spoils has been suggested, but now is the time when all the brains and strength of the Empire should be utilized in bringing this war to an end.

How long can an Empire be maintained on the principle that one portion only should be compelled to do the fighting? How long would the German colonies, if they were available to the Kaiser, be permitted to remain outside the war? There is no doubt that they would be thoroughly marshalled; and it is to the discredit of this Chamber that' we here should have reached an absolute deadend. I am not satisfied, and I cannot pretend to be satisfied, with the present situation.

' I told the boys that compulsion, if adopted, would set up a line 'of demarcation, the worse thing that could happen, and they indicated by their votes that they took m a t view. I have sat here day after day and listened to statements which are not correct. Recruiting, I repeat, will not be a failure because we do not get 16,500 men a month. Every honourable member ought to do his best to help recruiting as far as possible.

It cannot be passed on to any one else. From my own observations I know that nativeborn Australians of foreign descent were subjected to a humiliation which I did not believe was possible in a British State. I am as satisfied, sir, as I am that you are sitting in the chair, or that I am standing here, that these natives are as loyal to Australia as, I was almost going to say, their persecutor, the Prime Minister. Another thing is that they have a greater, affection for their native land than he seems to have had for his native land. leave Australia unless they are driven out the Prime Minister, so far as we know the record of his career, took an early opportunity of leaving his native land when he was able to strike out for himself. natives are loyal to Australia by and large, and by Australia. I mean the Commonwealth as an integral part of the British Empire. spect for a man who has one kind of other kind of loyalty for ""the Empire. Australia and the Empire stand or fall together in this great conflict. I said that on the platform when I spoke in favour of conscription. "" Quoting the words of a great English writer and preacher, I saidA man who realizes he is a member of a State, be he Socialist or not, is a debtor to it , and is bound by principles of the strictest justice to render it service. . . .

That seems to me a very fair and comprehensive statement of the duty that every man who considers himself an Australian ought to render to Australia and the Empire. My original intention was to vote against the motion of the Treasurer. But, since I have heard the pledge of the Prime Ministera pledge in which, I understand, he binds himself to call Parliament together not later than the 28th February my opinion has changed I will vote for the proposal of the Treasurer. I think that we are bound, in honour, to re-assemble at the earliest pos sible moment. We have heard a great deal, and we hear a great deal every day, in condemnation of striking and the going-slow movement. W h y , sir, we are the greatest offenders of the lot. How many sittings of Parliament have we held during the last twelve months ? From the 12th November, 1915, u n t i l 29th November, 1916, we had twenty sittings. Out of 320 working days, we have been on strike 300 days.

An early dissolution of Parliament is something which perhaps we cannot avoid, and honourable members are entitled to some information as to the intentions of the Government.

I am not prepared to accept that statement. I believe that the question has received the most serious consideration by the Government. to tell a man that you will not take his word ? lection of the honourable member for Parramatta making a speech recently, not on what I said, but on the construction he placed upon what I had said. If the Prime Minister has not given' any consideration to the possibility of the dissolution of this House and the Senate, he is the only man in either Chamber who has not done so. We have heard a great deal from the Prime Minister about a secret junta, and the operations of the Industrial Workers of the World. asked a question the other day as to a secret junta that has met within this building, and which seems to be working out a course of events for the near future. I mentioned the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Balaclava as the four members of that secret junta, and I believe those gentlemen have given most serious consideration to the possibility of an appeal to the people in the very near future. In my opinion, the leaders of the Liberal party would be sitting on the Treasury benches to-day as Ministers of a Fusion party if it were not for the fact that a Fusion before the appeal to the' people would mean their certain death as a political'party. But, whilst no Fusion has been formed yet, there is an understanding between the Leader of the Government and the leading members of the Liberal party that when the appeal is made to the people, supporters of the Go-' resolution vernmcnt shall not oppose candidates of the Liberal party in certain electorates, and the Liberal party shall not oppose Government candidates, and that if the two parties are successful at the polls, a Fusion Government will come into existence. tion the honourable member has. and the Liberal party secure a majority ai the polls a Fusion Government will be formed immediately after the elections. leak out ? their political old age, would not allow themselves to be kept out of office when they have the power to get into office, unless they had an object in view. The object which I believe they have in view I have a fair recolis to insure the success of their party when the appeal is made to the people. They know from the experience of the previous Fusion party that to go before the electors as a Fusion would be to court certain defeat. That is my prediction of forthcoming events, and it is built upon very sound foundations. But I notice that the annport given to 'the Government by Liberal members is not quite so unanimous as it was prior to the meeting of the Liberal party in this building a few evenI ings ago. Of course, I know that any admission by the Prime Minister to the rank and file of his supporters that this arrangement was to be carried into operation after the elections would create a great deal of discord, and I am ready to admit ' that Ministers, and the private members who support the Government, haye not been-given that information by",29,Cabty Salmon Wit H Qualificaof The Liberal Party Possesses Power With

314,Mr Finlayson,"I rise to a point, ofi should like to urge, sir, that there is no necessity for the Leader of the Liberal party to address himself to the question. He is well within his rights in addressing, himself to any question, however impertinent it may be. to the subject before the Committee. able member was not in order. that I was a little out of order. It is lucky for the Great Australian Labour party that the point was raised, for I was just on the doorstep of their Caucus. I had my eyes, metaphorically speaking, on the key-hole. ber is wasting time. waste a little more time by supplying a few figures to the Committee. I find that these financial and constitutional purists of the Australian Labour party put through a number of Supply Bills last year. On 2Sth June, 1915, they put through one for £S,611,000; on 2nd Octo ber, 1915, they put through one for £16,195,000; on the 15th November, 1915, they passed one for £7,250,000; and next day they put one through for £16,250,000. In the last six months of 1915 these honourable members-wh o now say with great pomp and ceremony, "" You can have two months' Supply at any time you like""-put through Supply Bills representing a total of £4S,250,000. These are the men who now object to give the Government, in order that the Public Service salaries may be paid when they are due, Supply to the extent of two or three millions. These are the men who, when on the other side, governed hy Supply Bills all the year round, and made it impossible for us to review the Estimates. They made it impossible for this Parliament to secure the slightest control over the finances. These are the men who, now that they sit in the Opposition corner, tell the Government that they can have two months' Supply at any time they like-bu t no more. I should like to say, further, that only a couple of years ago Mr Fisher, another Leader of their party, when in office, asked this House for five months' Supply, and got it. On 14th December, 1914, he asked for five months' supply, amounting to £10,316,000, for the ordinary civil administration of the country, and he got it without any protest from these honourable members. member protest ? majority behind him. friend did not protest, except, perhaps, hy firing off a few of those empty squibs of his, with which every one has become familiar. I wish, further, to place on record the fact that only last financial year the honourable member for Capricornia, who says to-day that he will consent to a grant of two months' Supply, put through a Supply Bill for five months. That was one of his last acts. It was the rule with these honourable members, when on the other side of the House, to obtain five months' Supply at a time. Now that they are sitting in the Opposition corner a demand for three months' Supply is an offence ranking as high as the heavens in their eyes. Oh for a little more consist7 ency in financial matters! right honourable member for Parramatta said that he rose only to place a few facts on record, and I should like to make a slight addition to them. The right honourable member professes to be very anxious for the well-being of public servants. So am I . Poor civil servants! They are going to be deprived of their pay. Let us object to that-if only for political purposes. I declare that I am anxious that they all shall get their pay. Who is preventing them from getting it? No one. But I recognise that there may be an election shortly, and how convenient it will be for me to be able to say, "" I supported the granting of Supply to give public servants their salaries "" ! I am not going to be left in the lurch in this matter. I say, "" Pay the civil servants."" Give the Government three months', six months', or whatever amount of Supply may be needed to pay the public servants. I remember that last year passages were taken from Hansard to prove that, on certain questions, my attitude was so-and-so.

We have to take the State taxation and the proposed Commonwealth taxation together in order to arrive at what is a safe impost to levy.

347,Mr Josephcook,"I am a f r a idso nimble in this respect as it customarily is. Why Mr Holman has not mopped up this little bit of revenue I do not know. He has been slower off the mark than usual; but I am quite certain that his predatory eye is on this form of taxation, and if this Parliament does not impose it he will. Therefore, as we need the money for the war, the Treasurer is quite right in imposing this tax at the present time. I hope that our action will not be followed by the States with a doublebanking tax. . It is time that doublebanking ceased, and cease it must before long., The rates to be charged will he a matter for consideration in Committee, but it is clear that there is a consensus of opinion on the part of the people who conduct amusements throughout the Commonwealth that a tax on 6d. tickets will be to them ruinous. It seems that picture shows particularly cater, to a large extent for families, and, I am told, that the effect of the tax will be that people, instead of attending picture shows twice weekly, as they do now, will attend only once a week, and the consequences will be disastrous to those who conduct these shows. The proprietors tell me that they do not object to taxation, hut only to its being imposed in such a way as to cut into the family rates, as a tax commencing on the 6d. tickets has a tendency to do. Is. tickets and stiffen the rates. the rate on tickets above Is. is stiff enough. I do not anticipate much objection to the Bill. Honourable members are fully seized of the necessity for gathering revenue in any legitimate way for the purpose of financing the war. Taxation is not welcomed by anybody. It is a burden to be borne, and sometimes a grievous one indeed. But these are the days of sacrifice and deprivation, and all those things that minister to war finance and efficiency. The Treasurer stated that he has gone as far as he possibly can in cutting down the rates. bedrock. estimated return from this tax as compared with the estimate from the tax proposed by the honourable gentleman's predecessor ? pected to reap £1,400,000, and I estimate a revenue of £400,000 at the outside. that the Treasurer has sliced down the tax already by about 200 per cent. That is indeed a very severe cut. All I wish to say is that if the Treasurer can see his way to make a slight modification in regard to the tax on 6d. tickets such a concession would be very welcome. on 3d. tickets altogether. press the honourable member unduly, but I commend this suggestion to his notice and consideration. be thought by some honourable members that I was a member of the Government which first proposed this tax on amusements, but the fact is that I resigned from the Government before this tax on amusements was considered. I deliberately re-frained from attending a Cabinet meeting at which the financial position was to be discussed, oh the day on which I resigned. If the Government impose a tax of i d . on 6d. tickets, the people who manage these shows will probably raise the price by selling a 6d. ticket for 7d., or, possibly, two tickets for Is. Id. In some way they will recoup themselves. Mr Mc WILLIAMS -The managers who are petitioning against the tax say that they cannot do that. doing fairly well; hut others are experiencing difficulties. The honourable member for Parramatta was quite right in saying that if this Parliament does not impose this tax, the States will. They have already, taken that step in Western Australia, South Australia,, and Tasmania. That is the only reason that induces me to support the proposal. Even the tax on the higher-priced tickets will have a harsh effect. In Melbourne, and, I believe, in other cities of Australia, there are, in normal times, football clubs which have a great many members, who pay 5s. for a season ticket admitting to matches on the club ground, and to certain other matches on other grounds.

They will be hard enough hit by the taxation on gate receipts, without the Government interfering with the revenue from their membership tickets. when we are dealing with the Assessment Bill. what exemptions are to be allowed. The money made by the clubs is spent in beautifying their grounds, which, in most cases, are utilized in the best possible way. I appeal i to the Treasurer not to tax tickets of a less value than Is., and I am 1 not in favour of increasing the rate on the higher-priced tickets, because, unless certain exemptions are allowed, the tax will work great hardship. original Bill was discussed in the press, I understood that for every person who entered a place of amusement, even on a complimentary ticket, the management would be required to pay taxation. . It is well known that many picture shows, and other places of amusement, give compli-! men tary tickets for the privilege of advertising in.shop windows; and it would be unfair to tax such tickets, when the proprietor of the show is not gaining any advantage. the advantage of free advertising in the shop windows. are given for a number of other reasons. Recently honourable members received complimentary tickets for a performance of a certain play in Melbourne, and I understand that the proprietors would have had to pay a tax on every one of those tickets. I repeat that the only thing which actuates me in voting for this taxation, oven on Is. tickets, is that the States will invade this field if we do not occupy it. greater than that of the States. State Premiers in conference claimed that they had been forced to meet extra expenditure on account of the war. They have had to incur not Id. of extra expenditure on that account, and they have had increased revenue from the Railway Departments, and from other sources on account of the Defence Department's operations. I should like the Treasurer to strike out the tax on 6d. tickets, because that would be an impost on the amusements of the poor. I do not intend to argue the question as to whether picture shows are good or bad, or whether it would not be better for the people to adopt some other form of amusement. tickets, we exempt the picture shows entirely. 6d. tickets we exempt the football clubs. empted. too? the payment. not be required to pay any taxation. tax on 6d. tickets, and I trust that the Treasurer will reconsider the other rates. We have been told that we should pass the Tariff practically in one line I should object to that being done. In normal times this little measure for the taxation of amusements would not get get through the House under a week; and I fail to see why we should he asked to pass in one line a Tariff with which the whole industry of the Commonwealth is bound up, and under which the Government collect revenue to the amount of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000. Honourable members realize that, on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves, we must devise means of getting extra money, and as the States may invade this field of taxation, the Government intend to forestall them. The Commonwealth expenditure is I have already expressed my opinion The upon the question of taxing 6d. tickets, so that my remarks upon the Bill will be very few.

In the Arbitration Court the justice, in his awards, has always allowed a small proportion per week in the ordinary expenditure of the home for entertainments and amusements.

The Treasurer's main purpose in introducing this measure is to get revenue from these sources If , however, the effect of his tax will be to close up a number of these places of amusement, which are paying only a very small percentage over working expenses, it will largely defeat its object. When the B ill goes into Committee I hope the Treasurer will be prepared to receive reasonable suggestions for its improvement; I have every sympathy with his desire t d obtain as much revenue as he can, but I think he w ill 'be equally as anxious as I am that the revenue to be obtained in this way shall not entail undue hardship on those who will be called upon to pay it . hope that when we go into Committee the Treasurer will be prepared to accept an amendment exempting 6d. tickets from this tax. amendment.. tickets ? amusement, charging 6d. for admission, are r u n on a bare percentage over expenses. of families who pay Is. for admission to these places of amusement? afford to pay a little more by way of this tax. 3d. tickets from taxation, so that the places of amusement to which the honourable member has referred will reap that advantage. amusement now charge 6d., and they are attended only by the poorest sections of the community. derives a large revenue from the duties on spirits and narcotics, and it seems to me that this tax on the lowerpriced tickets is something in the nature of double banking the taxation of these people.

They engage the cheapest artists, bringing them out here under It will fall on the public. contract and refuse to employ Australian artists. an import duty on those artists. orable member. Quite a number of the ordinary theatres are making a handsome profit, and people who can afford to pay 3s., 4s., and 5s. for a seat in those places of amusement should be able to bear this taxation. I hope, however, that I shall have an opportunity to record my vote against the imposition of a tax upon 6d. tickets. In my district there are a large number of 6d. picture theatres, which are attended for the most part by children, who are taken there by their parents. I am speaking in no spirit of hostility to the Treasurer. I urge, as a matter of justice, that we should exempt from this tax those who are compelled to go to the cheapest shows in the country. The Treasurer has, I think, been wise in granting the concessions he has already I cannot do so. made. The tax as originally proposed by I shall support such an his predecessor, the honourable member for Capricornia, was one under which, standstop at 6d. ing by itself, the public might still have continued to enter Australian amusement enterprises at the additional charges. But superimposed upon the taxation which the States have already brought in , the original B ill would have been more than a fair thing. TheB ill now before us practically brings the scheme into line with the English provision in this regard. I should like to give my view as to why some such tax as this is fair in time of war. In time of war a country necessarily lives very largely upon its credit. That credit is sometimes, as in the case of Australia, drawn upon in the form of a very much enlarged paper circulation. Employment in non-productive enterprises is largely fostered upon the pledge The cheapest places of of the country's resources and future activities, with the result that, in time of war, there is generally among a whole The Commonwealth host of people a large overplus of what appears to be, and what is for the moment, cash. These people have very often more to spend-in England this is extremely marked, and here in some cases it is also noticeable-and , as all people of a non-saving disposition, having money in their pockets will do, they will naturally go out and t r y to get the best they can out of life.

412,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [4.50],"one form of recreation. In this community, as in nearly all British communities, owing to laxity on the part of the municipal authorities, a number of men in poorer districts have, unfortunately, come to regard the public-house as their club. It is a lamentable fact. The municipalities should have avoided it by creating places of healthy amusement and recreation. Those places, however, have not been provided for in either Australia or Great Britain, and in the great majority of cases men have looked to hotels as affording a sort of meeting ground. Those places are now closed, with the result that theatres and amusement houses generally may be expected to do far better than they have done before, proportionately to the existing resources that remain in the Commonwealth. I do not wish to say one word that will add to the difficulties"" of the smaller picture-theatre proprietors. The Treasurer has done his best to meet their position by cutting off what would have been a most serious impost for them-the tax on 3d. tickets, which was proposed by his predecessor. picture shows in country districts. now. of amusement in the suburbs. price to 6d. have they been called upon to bear that they should have found it necessary to increase the price from 3d. to 6d. ? not carry on under the old rate. not matter to a man whether he pays 3d. or 6d. for a seat as long as he gets a good one.

On the one side, under assets, they have the items of cash in hand, rents, deposits in advance, and sundry debtors' deposits; account balances, vance, investments, incomplete tours, &c. The assets of this company, as given by themselves, are as f o l l o w : In 1911 they were £329,229; in 1912 they were£362,893, showing an increase of about £33,664; in 1913 they had increased to £397,039-a n increase of £34,146. 1914-w e are now coming to the war period-the y increased from £397,039 to £464,155. £67,116 in the first war year. that was a war year throughout-thi s company's assets, as given by itself, in creased'from £464,155 to £514,136! Australian artists. on the firm, either in regard to the employment of artists or in any other respect. I am giving the bald figures as supplied by them under the law, and contrasting them with the statement in the circulars with which all honourable members have been inundated during the last few days. It is true that the liabilities of this firm, as shown in its ""balance-sheet, have increased from £29,000 in 1911 to £214,000 in 1915, although the subscribed capital remains constant. But we do not know what is included in these liabilities, and, therefore, we must not be too much impressed by this increase. The fact remains that the assets have increased,, since the war started, from about £400,000 to £514,000. I venture to say that the reason for that increase is the very large circulation of paper money that took place during the first, year or eighteen months of the war, and it is only fair to remember that that w ill not be felt so much in the future. But any one who keeps his eyes open must be well aware that, so far, the war has been of advantage to the big places of entertainment and amusement. Under these circumstances, I cannot see why the persons connected with these places should not be asked to bear some share of this taxation. I suggest that the Treasurer might consider the exemption of children's tickets, but if he concedes a general exemption of 6d. tickets, the next proposal w ill be to exempt Is. tickets, and so on, right up to 7s. 6d. tickets. The agitation was, first of all, for the exemption of the 3d. tickets sold in the suburban picture houses, and it seemed to me rather hard that those tickets should be payments in adtaxed. But I have found on inquiry that in most cases the charge in the suburban theatres has been raised from 3d. to 6d. without regard to the proposed tax. The simplest thing for the House to do is to trust the Treasurer in this matter, and support any proposition that the honourable In gentleman may think absolutely necessary in the interests of the revenue. In 1915multitude of counsellors there may be talk, but I question whether there is wisdom. I am glad that the'Treasurer's proposals in this matter are more reasonable than those of his predecessor, but I hope that he will see fit to exempt from taxado not employ tion the 6d. tickets of admission sold at picture theatres. The abandonment of I am making no attack the proposal to tax 3d. tickets was a concession to the residents in the cities, for I have yet to learn that any number of country picture shows issue 3d. tickets. Therefore, if the 6d. ticket is not exempted from taxation, the country resident will be treated invidiously, because, while a town dweller can get the benefits of a picture show, whatever they may be, for -3d., without paying taxation, the countryman w ill have to pay 6d. and a tax as well.. On the ground of consistency, city and"" country dwellers should be treated alike in this matter. According to the figures that have been sent to me, six million 6d. tickets are sold annually in Australia, and a tax of ^d. would produce only £12,500. I am willing to support the taxing of 6d. tickets of admission to football matches, because, although I am an. enthusiastic advocate of football, having been an old Rugger player, I have yet to learn that the game is of any athletic value to those who sit in .safety and comf o r t watching the players. The country picture show, however, is a quasi-educational institution. It has been pointed out that the proposed tax on 6d. pictureshow tickets will strain the resources of men with large families. But why should those in the country who have large families have to pay not only twice as much for admission as the townsmen pay, but this tax as well ? If an amendment is moved to abolish the taxation of 6d. picture-show tickets, I shall vote for it .",43,Elliot Johnson Wha T Re Go Any Further The B I L L Would Not Be

It is only a few of the primary producers who cannot pass on taxation. most part, the taxes on city properties mean increased rentals.

Whether the entertainment proprietors and For the picture-show promoters are wealthy or not,_ it is absolutely certain that this tax w ill be passed on to the public; at any rate, I know that the picture-show proprietors have a union, or association, the membership conditions of which are quite as ex-' acting as those of the Employers Federation or any other similar organization.

The estimated revenue placed before us by the ex-Treasurer has been reduced by nearly one-half; and, as I said before, if the Treasurer accepts the suggestions that have been made this afternoon, it w ill not be worth going on w it h the B ill . nents of the measure desire. MrM c WILLIAMS the Treasurer requires the money, and I will support the tax in the form in which he has proposed it , not because I believe that it is a tax which in normal conditions should be levied by the Federal Parliament, but because in this time of national emergency every penny is required by the Government. [5.31] -The Treasurer struck' the nail on the head when he said that if further exemptions were to be made we might as well throw aside the tax altogether. In my opinion, that is what should be done. I never dreamt that any Federal Treasurer would get a dragnet out to catch tadpoles. Every person interested in supplying amusements to the public pays the same taxation as everybody else, but now the Government propose to place upon those people a special tax. What is the reason for doing that?

In regard to the taxation of sporting clubs, if the Government expect to get any revenue from cricket and football clubs, they will be disappointed, because the clubs have no income that can be taxed. s Since the outbreak of war, I have received . more letters from such bodies asking for I believe that assistance than ever before. We have heard it said that there'is no sport in thousands of people sitting on hard seats to watch a few others at play. My answer tp that statement is that the men who .sat on those hard seats were the same men as made history at Gallipoli. Before the war Victoria was the home of football, and bigger crowds were attracted to matches in Melbourne than in any other portion of Australia, but during the last season so little was heard of the game that notone person in a hundred could answer an inquiry as to what club won the premiership. verse was the case. school teachers, brewers, members of Parliament, in fact everybody, could say who were the football premiers of Victoria. To-day practically no football is played. The Treasurer has said that if the clubs have no revenue they wil l not be taxed. The fact is that the clubs are keeping the game alive to the best of their ability, but every one of them has an overdraft, Do honourable and yet the Government ask them to surrender per cent, of any money they do receive. A lot has been said about the money made by those connected w it h these clubs. I guarantee that any honourable I am proposing a tax members who have occupied the position of secretary or president to football clubs have found their pockets constantly depleted. I have not known any football statement is official who has not had to pay money out of his own pocket on account of his association with the sport.

Sundayning' picture shows now. to every method imaginable to obtain money to keep them in existence. every suburb in my electorate the ladies have been asked to form themselves into committees and conduct bazaars in order to raise money to pay off the overdrafts incurredj by the football and cricket club committees during the first year of the war. Yet the Government sets upon them as bodies which have money galore. charge ? But the Government are proposing to tax a section of people who are not able to pay their way. If the Government must tax somebody, let them select these who have funds to be taxed. If the clubs are to lose there will be no football next year. If honourable members desire to stop football and cricket, let them say so. I have heard f ootball clubs attacked at times, and with some justification; but, whilst there may be some frequenters of football matches who are not desirable, a great proportion of them follow that form of amusement because they like it . I have not attended a boxing match for the last twenty-five years, but it is quite possible tliat the Government may get a fair amount of revenue from the stadia. In this case, however, the tax will not be upon6d. tickets, but will be collected from people who pay big prices for their entertainment. Reverting to the picture shows, it will be found tliat many of them do not make 8 | per cent, profit. Plenty of the picture-theatre proprietors make only a bare living. West's picture theatre, one of the oldest established and best conducted in Melbourne, and at which there is an orchestra the music of which alone is worth the price of admission, is open only once a week now. A t Hoyt's picture show the public are well catered for, but anybody seeing the sparse audience on an ordinary week night will realize that the receipts could not pay for the evening's entertainment. The proprietors depend upon, the Saturday night and holiday receipts for their profits, and no business carried on under those conditions can afford to pay a tax of 8^ per cent, over and above all the other taxes. I doubt if any of them have made 8 | per cent, on the money they have invested. If this is another subterfuge to compel the closing down of these places of entertainments and forcing the employees to enlist, let the Government say so, but if the tax is only for the purpose of raising reIn venue, it is preposterous. The result w ill be that the weaker concerns must go to the wall. I admit that thepicture-show business has been overbuilt in Melbiurne, and I think that the Treasurer should have prevented the erection of some of the picture theatres which have come into existence here and elsewhere during the last two years. It may be said that these' people will lose their money when the slump comes, but what is the sense Of course they do. of allowing them to do that? In every suburb of every city, there are churches, lodges, associations, and suchlike institutions, which appoint committees to run social functions, and the "" n i m b le b o b "" is usually the charge for per cent, of their small receipts,' all the entertainments they promote. The Government say that they will take I d . for every Is. paid on these little social functions. Is the proposal worthy of a Commonwealth Parliament? Does the Treasurer really think that this is a statesmanlike attempt to get taxation ? It is said that the tax works very well in Great Britain. I do not know whether that is the case We often get information that is not correct. There are other media of enjoyment in the district that I represent, and if the picture shows are closed, it will simply mean giving a greater opportunity to those who have the custom to raise their prices. It is useless to k ill one form of occupation in order to enhance the profits of another. Teetotallers thought that they were going to stop the selling of drink when they closed some of the public-houses, but the only effect of their action was to give an additional value to certain other licences, some of which ought not to be in existence. They consider tliat drinking is a vicej but surely there is no vice in picture shows and amusements? We have heard about the four small boys who bought a revolver, and bailed up an old woman in her shop. This case has been, cited as a dreadful example of the effect of pictures on. the young mind, but we heard the same thing in regard to the dreadful effect of Deadwood Dick yarns.. If this sort of thing could not be attributed to picture shows it would be attributed to something else.

These pictures do not generally please the young people, hut, at the same time, something of value is instilled into their minds. pictures are often shown of different forms of industries. I admit that some pictures may not be educational, but, at any rate, they are very interesting and very enjoyable. Some of the dramas may be very suggestive, but they are not more .so tfian those produced on the stage, or those we see in every-day life. The innocent mind cannot understand them, and they do no harm to those children who are old enough to have the depth of feeling to understand them. If the Government, will hot withdraw the B ill , I hope tliat they will see their way clear to change the incidence of the tax. I give notice now that I shall move aji amendment in Committee to delete lines 13 and 16, and substitute the words "" one shilling . . . one penny."" told"" that the price of the Is. ticket may be reduced to l i d . in order to escape the tax, but provision can be made to prevent that being done. I think that the Is. ticket is really the lowest that should be taxed, and that a I d . tax on it will be ample. Some people hold that there should be no enjoyment when the war is on, and that we should be in sackcloth and ashes; but the boys at the f r o n t are not in sackcloth and ashes; they enjoy themselves. I listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Hume. party to wnich I belong believe that, m the interests of the community, the Government should pay for the amusements tliat go through the country in order to give people ""in isolated portions of our continent an opportunity of seeing some life instead of having their lives restricted. It is the duty of the Government or the municipal bodies to do this. When I first stood for the municipal council in Port Melbourne, and talked upon that subject, they said to me, "" J i m, old chap, come down off that platform. That talk is no good7' For fifteen years we talked of playgrounds for the children, and we have them to-day. Amusements are like telephones. The more amusements and telephones that are provided for the people in the country districts, the better' w ill their conditions this year although we do not pass th© be, and I say that instead of restricting their enjoyment, the Government should drop the B ill , or not impose a tax on less than Is. tickets. I am sorry that the Treasurer has seen fit to alter the B ill , and cut down theInstructive tax by one-half. It was part of a scheme it may be a rough-and-ready one-for raising money for the purposes of paying the war expenses. It seems to me that the Treasurer has forgotten that fact. We are so f a r away from the sound of the guns that we are apt to forget that there is a war in progress. We forget that our expenditure has increased since the pre-war period from £25,000,000 to £40,000,000,and from £40,000,000 to £70,000,000, while it is expected that this financial year there w ill be an expenditure of over £100,000,000, which means that a very large interest bill will have to be paid on the money that is borrowed. W© must get revenue from somewhere. I venture to say that there has been no agitation on the part of th© general public I may be against this entertainments tax. The agitation has come mainly from the showmen who fearI think wrongly-that they will have to bear the tax. In the United Kingdom, where they have i m posed an amusements tax, the public generally have paid it cheerfully. Many people who go to a theatre during the war feel a little uncomfortable. While they are sitting there enjoying themselves the vision of the battle-fields of Europe will obtrude itself from time to time. I suggest that they would feel more comfortThe able if they were paying an amusement tax which they knew was imposed for war purposes. The point is: What is to be the scheme of taxation to raise the necessary revenue to meet th© war expenditure ? Are we to continue borrowing money without making any attempt to pay our way as we go along ? I am sorry that the Treasurer has seen fit to come down, first, with a proposal that w ill mean that the general public will pay the tax. The entertainments tax was part of a scheme.

It seems to be playing it a little low down to tax the amusements of those whom we know as tlie poor. I have seen most of the countries of the world, and must confess that I have seen on a film better views of a country than I was able to obtain whilst visiting it . That may be readily accounted for, having regard to the large sums of money that film makers are prepared to expend in obtaining the very finest pictures of the scenery, as well as the manufactures, of many lands. I have seen the carnivals at Nice and have known them to be splendidly depicted on the picture screens Mountain and river scenery of various countries is also shown to perfection. Holding as I do the view that educational establishments should be wholly free, I should have been glad if the Government had come down with a proposal to exempt 6d. tickets for picture theatres, provided that the proprietors would undertake to show every day a film depicting the scenery or the manufactures of a country. Such pictures must have an educational effect on the community.

The Director-General for Recruiting has already approved of a suggestion I have made that free moving pictures should be utilized in connection w it h the recruiting campaign. My desire is tliat those who attend recruiting meetings should see some of the terrible things that only pictures can show-that they should be given an opportunity to see how countries have been devastated; and how in jury has been done to life and, in a lesser degree, to property during this war. Our party does not value property as it values life. Our ideals are based upon the view of Ruskin, that "" life is the only wealth.""

I hope that the cinematograph will be taken more into the schools, and that history will be taught by the impressions conveyed from the eye to the brain. When an amusing picture is shown on the screen, the theatre is filled with t h a t sweetest sound on earth--the rippling laughter of the children. I never hear it without feeling myself a better man; and those who think that the human heart cannot be touched by pictures have only to look round when a sad play is being shown to see the handkerchiefs raised surreptitiously in the darkened hall. W it h very few exceptions, the pictures that are shown are uplifting , educating the world, and making it better. As to the theatre, some people ask why not tax the higher-priced seats. There might be more reason for that; but I would point out that many If the honourable theatre tickets are given away as passes to admit to the stalls and dress circle, and it would not be fair to tax the management on tickets from which they get no monetary return. It might be possible, however, to provide tliat only tickets that were paid for should be taxed. 'Asf or football and cricket, they are games which keep up the physique of the race. When we become a wise nation, we shall do more for physical culture. Men like Sandow have helped more in the physical regeneration of the race than all the doctors. Under the proposal of the Treasurer, however, tickets to admit to exhibitions of jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and boxing would be taxed.

In Committee I shall be only too glad to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. For a considerable time past I have felt that one of the fairest taxes is a tax on entertainments, and I think that I was one of the first in this House to suggest the imposition of such taxation for the period of the war.

To my mind, the whole question is, what is the fairest way in which to frame this tax? Where shall we begin, and where shall we end? I think that those who patronize places of amusement realize tliat money'must be found to meet the -extra demands of the war, and will not ' seriously oppose this taxation. In my -opinion, those who are controlling the public amusements through the film agencies have engineered much of the opposition to the Bill. other honourable member, like myself, has received large numbers of letters, telegrams, and other comunications, all -couched in the same language, and springing from the same source. it. My trouble is that it.is proposed to increase the taxation of those, who are already overtaxed. heavy, hut it will probably be worse before the war is over. What we must endeavour to do is to avoid, as far as possible, increasing the ordinary expenses -of living. The money spent on amusements is something possessed over and above what is needed to purchase necessaries; it is surplus cash. Whether the tax should be imposed on 6d. tickets is a question that can be, discussed in Committee. There is something to be said for not taxing such tickets. Seeing that the 3d. ticket, which is the minimum city -charge, is not taxed, and that the minimum country charge is 6d., it might be reasonable to exempt the minimum -country charge in the same way as the minimum city charge is exempted. have not definitely made up my mind as to the point at which taxation should start, but I think the Treasurer has done right in proposing this form of taxation, and I hope that the Bill will pass within a reasonable time, and that those who have to pay this tax, the amusement patrons, will cheerfully acquiesce in it. Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7.|5 p.m. I have listened to the debate, and to the appeal put forward on behalf of those in the community who will pay only 6d. for any form, of amusement, and I ask Very few in our comthe Treasurer not to depart from his original proposals. We in Australia are faced with the fact that money has to he raised in. order to carry on the war satisfactorily. We know that the expenditure is not likely to decrease, but rather to increase; and we have also the example of the British Government, who have raised part of their revenue by the means now proposed. In England a tax is levied on every form of entertainment; there is practically no exception, and certainly no exemption on a sixpenny admission fee. any price of admission below 6d.? from 6d. upwards, there is a graduated scale. I brought information on this point with me from England; hut I re-' gret I have not it with me at the present moment. I know, however, that at every music hall, cinema show, or other entertainment, a tax is levied, and it is the individual who goes into the show that pays it. tax of I d . on all prices of admission, from 2d. up to 6d. number of people I know went to one of the principal music halls in London, and they had to pay as much as Is. 6d. on the iOs. charged for admission. This is purely a tax on the amusements of the people; and I think it is only fair that those who are prepared to go to any form of entertainment at such a time as this should subscribe specially to the cost of the war. I may mention incidentally, that in England and in Canada people at entertainments have to pay for their programmes, though we know that this I does not obtain in Australia. We are asked to consider the man of small means. I have as great a desire as any one to look after the person who is not in receipt of a big salary; but I think the taxes proposed by this Bill are perfectly legitimate and fair. If honourable members were to visit some of the other Dominions, they would find that there is not only a tax on the prices of admission to entertainments,",52,Elliot Johnson Wha T Re Go Any Further The B I L L Would Not Be

It is in these small ways that the Dominions have had to raise money as their share of the war expenditure. It is time that we, as members of this Parliament, realized that, in carrying such legislation into effect, we are not alone; but that throughout the Empire this and other forms of small taxation are in operation. lieve that when the whole of the taxation proposals of the Government are before us, it w ill be seen that there is a f a i r and true adjustment; that, although this is the first individual measure introduced by the Treasurer, it w ill be found, before he has finished w it h his other legislation which is now before the Chamber, that every class in the community w ill be called upon to bear their proper share. that, in my opinion, the Treasurer will be wise if he is steadfast in regard to the measure before us, and does not give way in the manner that has been suggested. Along w it h other honourable members, I have been inundated w i th letters from representatives of cinema shows; and, having read them, I am convinced that no cogent argument is advanced why this taxation should not be imposed. very refreshing to hear the honourable member for Fremantle advocating extra taxation, and giving as his principal reason the fact that similar taxation is i m posed in England, Canada, and elsewhere. Is there any reason why Australia should follow the example of the older countries? The Treasurer could find other means of raising money without taxing the amusements of the children of those men, who, in a few weeks' time, w ill be asked to go to the front-wh o will be asked to sacrifice their homes, wives, families, and even their lives. There are gentlemen in the Chamber, however, who desire to tax the L e t us kiddies' amusements; for, if this B ill w ill interfere w it h any, it will interfere with the wives and children of the poorer classes. Now, I was sent here to represent those particular classes; it was they I am speaking who sent me toprotect their interests, and I shall do that to the best of my ability. ThereI f the Treasurer cannot find a readier and healthier means of raising money than by taxing the 6d. shows of the poorer classes, who are very anxious he is in a very bad way. posals of the Treasurer only amount to a third of the taxation that the ex-Treasurer proposed to whip through. that measure. leagues going to oppose it ? answering for myself.

There may be exceptions, h u t there is something peculiar even about brother Hampson since he came hack. We are shortly going out on a recruiting campaign ; and I ask honourable members what answer they will give to the question why they taxed the kiddies' amusements? I can tell the Treasurer how he may raise £400,000 extra taxation with the machinery he already has at his command. Why not put a little extra tax on the unimproved land values throughout Australia? I am sure that the honourable gentleman would be surprised at the revenue he would receive. The owners of these lands can afford to pay; and why not tax those able to bear the burden, instead of the wives and kiddies whose -breadwinners do not earn more than £ 3 a week, at most.

People who -can afford to pay only a small sum for their pleasure will have to pay more for it . The cost of their furniture, their food, and their rent has increased-that is why they seek the-cheapest form of pleasurehut now the cost of their amusement is to be increased. The tax will mean either that the people will pay more for that cheap amusement, for which alone they can afford to pay, or the men who have put their money into the amusement line of business will be ruined. The only effect w ill be the cutting down of those shows which are struggling, and the throwing out of employment of a very large number of people.

We cannot get away from the fact that the lads who have gone to the f r o n t , were those who patronized these shows; therefore, the owners of these buildings have suffered by the absence of these youths, just the same as other traders in the poorer districts have suffered through the loss of custom. night to a picture theatre and wonder [358]2 why so much light is burnt for the very poor attendance.

The tax on 6d. tickets will not bring in the anticipated revenue. PeopleI f an additional 8£ per cent, attend the picture shows because they have facilities for doing so. If the theatres close to their homes are closed, and they have to go farther afield to see the pictures, they will stay at home or devote their attention to some other object. I leave the question of country districts to other honourable members. The attendance at the picture shows will certainly be reduoed.

There are families who go regularly once or twice a week. Formerly there used to be a lot of dancing, but dancing has been replaced by attendance at picture shows.

Since the war, interest in these matches has declined; but I hope to see a revival of it when the war is over and our boys come back. If the Government desire it, let them impose a tax on Is. tickets for admission to cricket and football matches; but they ought not to attempt to deprive the clubs of the little revenue they are at present earning.

I hope that the war will soon come to an end, and that we;> shall have peace, not on the terms talked of just now, but on such a basis that the Power which has been a menace to the nations of the earth will be smashed. That may necessitate a further increase of taxation. No sensible man would approve of this method of raising revenue in normal times, but it is necessary to meet a special emergency. A good deal of clap-trap has been indulged in with regard to the effect of this tax upon the friends and relatives of soldiers at the front. I do not believe that there is an Australian soldier who will object to this tax when he knows that it is part of a scheme for building up the Consolidated Revenue Pund, out of which we have to provide for war pensions and the needs of relatives of his fallen comrades. There has also been much talk as to the poverty of the people. Had my honourable friends been in Melbourne thirty or thirty-five years ago, when there was a lower standard of living, they might have seen evidences of a certain amount of poverty, Some honourable members more especially had they watched the girls going to the factories in the early morning and returning home at night.

552,Mr Archibald,"Whethe r we likepoverty-stricken. One has only to look at our working classes, and especially at our women folk, and to note the way that they dress, to satisfy oneself that this talk of poverty amongst the workers is a l l claptrap, and is resorted to only in the hope of winning votes. The great mass of the working people have too much common sense to be misled in this way. whole load of taxation. they are. into the Savings Banks than ever they did before. of the boasts of the Labour party has been that we shifted a large amount of taxation from the backs of the poorer classes to a section of the community that was able to bear it . It is monstrous to say that our taxation is borne only by the workers. There are other sections of the community who have to bear the major portion of our war taxation. The cost of the war comes largely out of the revenue obtained from the income tax and the land tax. the working classes ? them. ' the community who is engaged in useful and necessary work is a worker, whether he be employed as the manager of a big station, the superintendent of a factory, or as a mechanic. In that sense the workers do bear the taxation of the country. to refer only to mechanics and labourers as bearing the taxation of the Commonwealth, I do not agree with him. It is popular, I know, to talk like that, and such an attitude has many attractions for honourable members of the Corner party. Coming back to the proposal to tax entertainment tickets, I should have liked to see a tax of £d. p u t on many of the 3d. tickets issued in connection with picture shows. Adelaide, and probably in Perth and in Brisbane, picture shows are open from 11 in the-morning u n t i l 11 at night, the prices'of admission being 3d. and 6d. I s it the children of working men, or poor people, that you find in those places of entertainment all through the day? Certainly not. Those who can afford to ' patronize such entertainments in the daytime might well pay a tax of I d . on the 3d. tickets. I know something of the world in which I live; I do not look at things over the fence. If I wish to learn the condition of the workers, I do not study blue books; I go to where their wives shop, and study their shopping, and thus get a better idea of their conditions than I could by any amount of reading, I do not think or by listening to liars who had some political purpose to serve. I know, ol course, that there are many other picture shows which are patronized largely by children. It was because of them that T h a t is so. One the Government determined not to tax 3d. tickets. have to pay 6d. Why should those shows be taxed ? children are admitted for half-price. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports complained that cricket and football have been knocked on the head, and that the world is a very dismal place nowa-days, but, apparently, he would like ut to spend our time wandering through churchyard's crying. We have been told A r e they paid by that the picture-show proprietors are losing money.

I am very much afraid that we cannot close the other in cident in quite the same way, though I wish we could. I see in this action in another place grounds for very grave and serious trouble in the future, if it is allowed to go without protest of some kind -withou t something being said or something being recorded to show that we are not the puppets of another Chamber, are not here to do their bidding in every way they, see fit to impose on us, but that, in this time of war, when other grave issues are at stake, we decided to take ""this course for reasons affecting the Empire as H a v e they not a a whole.

They evidently deem themselves to have achieved It is not without prea great triumph. L et it be understood , that those honourable gentlemen, when the Empire is at war, would precipitate a crisis, and endanger the whole Government of the country, on a question ,of whether Supply shall be granted for two or for three months. , It is another in stance of the way in which they set their own party advantage above all the great issues that are being decided in this war. I wish to enter my protest against the way in which it has been done; and at the same time. I say that in other circumH a d the circumstances stances I would not consent to the course now being taken in the way in which it is being taken. sure, Mr Speaker, you will agree that the very mild question which I put to the I believe the Leader' of the Liberal party, as to whether he had not been consulted regarding the action of the Prime Minister in moving the acceptance of the Senate's request, should not have been made a ground for a vindictive attack on me.",59,Supplybill No 3 1916 17 No 2

I am charged with having favoured the previous B ill , because I have always advocated that there should be one tax only, namely, a tax on incomes. If the Treasurer's proposal is adopted, picture shows in the capital cities and other large centres of the Commonwealth will escape this taxation entirely, because the people who attend those shows and pay 3d. will not be affected by the B ill . But in the country the minimum charge for probably an inferior show is 6d. The people who have to pay that 6d. are of the same class as those who pay 3d. in the city, but because of the advantages which the latter enjoy, they are to be-immune from paying any contribution towards tlie prosecution of the war so far as this tax is concerned, whilst the country people, who are called upon to bear the lion's share of I trust that every burden, must pay a tax of Ad. on every 6d. ticket. It is useless to say that the tax will be paid by the picture show proprietors. We know that those shows will require to increase their charges. with minimum staffs, which cannot possibly be reduced. In effect, the people in the country are to be, asked to pay 7d. to see an inferior picture show, whilst those living in the city may see a show of the very best class for 3d. As a matB u t a fourth-form ter of equity, is a tax of this kind right? If revenue is to be raised for war purposes by the taxation of the poorer classes the taxation should be at least equitably distributed. Country people are at work on their farms from Mondayt ill Saturday night, and their only pleasure is a picture show on Saturday night. They are to be taxed, whilst people with daily access to entertainments at a cheaper iprice are to escape taxation. Again, if three State Parliaments are levying taxes on entertainments, is it fair that the people who live in those States should have to bear duplicate taxation. This means that people in certain States of Australia will be required to pay double the tax that is imposed on the people of other States. of the B ill . a fault in the B ill when it proposes to",61,Thied Reading

Most of the shows that are charging 6d. in country districts are barely able to pay their way, but they struggle along in the hope that times will improve. It has been urged that this tax will be unfair in regard to sporting clubs. Cricket is a national game, which I am sorry to say is gradually dying out. It should be fostered, but to-day attendances at cricket matches are so small that if 6d. is charged at the gates the clubs are not able to get sufficient revenue to pay a caretaker.' Yet the clubs are to he asked to pay an additional penny. The effect will be, not to encourage the national game, but to help to extinguish it . Recreation should not be taxed on the 6d. charge for .admission. There may be some justification for a tax on the higher charges. People who can afford to pay from 3s. to 10s. 6d. for an evening's entertainment can probably bear a little more taxation than the Treasurer has proposed. a guinea for a season's ticket, and they will be required to pay taxation on that revenue. source should not be taxed at all, because most of the persons who buy season tickets do so as a form of donation to a particular sport. In view of ""the fact that only about £100,000 is involved, the Treasurer would do well to consider whether he cannot remove the tax from the cheaper tickets, and perhaps by increasing the rates on the higher-priced tickets he will get more money from people who are well able to pay it , and not inflict any injustice on the country population. cannot support the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to the f u l l extent of his amendment, but I am anxious to place the country citizen on the same basis as the city citizen. As the Treasurer has already decided that the 3d. ticket shall be exempt from taxation,"" and in view of the fact that there are no 3d. picture shows in the country, I desire that some consideration shall be extended to those who do not enjoy nearly such great conveniences and opportunities as do the townhonorable folk. Picture shows are practically the only amusements available to country people, and the lowest charge for them is 6d. the city are the continuous pictures. For the evening entertainments the charges are higher. the country there is no hope of seeing a picture show for 3d. The consequence is that we find in the cities persons who take advantage of 3d. shows. TheB ill creates an invidious distinction between city people and country people. It is a further discouragement to settlement in the country districts, and greater encouragement to flocking to the cities which we so much deplore. Sof a r as football and cricket matches are concerned, I give way to no man in saying that this sort of sport should be encouraged; but I do not think that the taxation of those who pay to look on at these games is going to have a very bad effect bn them as sports. I urge the Treasurer to consider the position from the point of view of the man in the country. He expects to derive £100,000 from the tax on the 6d. tickets. I beg leave to differ from h i m, if he is looking to the picture shows for the whole of this £100,000. is not taking into consideration the fact that, if the tax on the 6d. ticket is removed, the whole of the revenue to be derived from the half rates on the Is. shows w ill be lost. me to the conclusion that the 6d. rate is paid by 6,000,000 people in Australia once in each year.

For my ' own part, as an owner of property, I am prepared to pay my share. We have before us a legitimate proposal for taxation, and I am inclined to think that the great mass of the people who purchase 6d. tickets will be filled with pride and glory that they can in this way contribute their little mite towards the maintenance of that grand Army which has distinguished itself, won the plaudits of . b o t h French and British generals, and stands so high in the estimation of the people of Europe to-day.

I wish to remove the impression that the Victorian Prices Commissioner told me within the past week that he was looking into, this matter. I have no desire to be accused of stating what is untrue. It was the Prime Minister who promised to look into the matter, and apparently he has not done so. I hope, however, that he will do so, and that he will see that no restrictions are placed on the surplus produce which we are allowed to ship abroad, and that we are able to get the world's parity for such surplus. wish to emphasize the situation put by the honourable member for Richmond, and to ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the necessity for some revision of the recruiting scheme. In the wheat-growing areas of Victoriai t will be impossible to start that scheme u n t i l early in February. It is a late season in nearly all the wheat areas of Australia, and it would be useless to attempt to organize within those districts with a view to getting recruits earlier than the first or second week in February. As this Parliament is to be called togetherearly in February, it w ill be impossible for. honourable members to take that part in the recruiting campaign which they had contemplated owing to the action of those who desire to k ill recruiting in Victoria. view of the complaints which have just been made, it is well that the country should clearly understand that what has happened in this Parliament w ill not prevent honourable members from participating in the recruiting campaign. The Prime Minister stated that that campaign would start on the 2nd January, and Supply has been granted to 1st c February. We have heard a lot of talk about men who are prepared to make great sacrifices, about a crisis in the history of the nation, and yet, as soon as these men have an opportunity of devoting five weeks to recruiting they immediately endeavour to throw the onus for their , neglect upon the party to which I belong.

Having to come down to Melbourne in the first week in February, it will be much more difficult for many members of this Parliament to carry out this work of recruiting. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bendigo to speak as he has done, or for any honourable member . representing what might be called a pocket-handkerchief State SO' far as area is concerned. It is possible to cover Victoriai n a few days because of the concentration of the population. It is quite a different matter to deal with such States as Western Australia and Queensland. It takes as much time to cover one electorate as it would take to cover the whole of the State of Victoria. What chance has Mr Speakeri n the four weeks at his disposal to go, as I am sure he desires to do, throughout his constituency in connection with the recruiting movement ? It should 'be borne in mind also that in Queensland we have a wet season during January and February, and after an itinerary has been prepared three weeks ahead, an honourable member may be blocked in that State by the .wet season. I believe that honourable members on both sides during the short period that will now be at their disposal, will do the best they can to make the recruiting scheme a success.

715,Mr Groom,"Yes. There are somedirect the attention of the Prime Minister to one important matter. I asked h i m this morning if he would bring under the notice of the State Premiers the necessity for something being done in view of the decision of the High Court with respect to Inter-State trade. I have here several letters from pastoralists, agents, and others, pointing out the severe hardship imposed upon them in Queensland owing to the action of the State Government in putting an embargo upon the removal of stocks from that State. There is not the .slightest doubt thab the effect of the embargo has been to increase the cost of living in other States, whilsb ab the same time doing a rank injustice to growers and producers in Queensland. One gentleman writes in this way on the subjectIn common with other agents on the Queensland and New South Wales borders, our trade is absolutely at a standstill, and it will ultimately mean that a great number will be out of employment unless the Federal Government takes steps to remove the injustice. It is not only unjust to traders, buti t is alsounjust to. the public in other States, who are being compelled to pay high prices for their meat through the Queensland Government prohibiting the export of stock from' Queensland into other States. We are quite aware that whilst the war' is ou a great amount of legislation must remain in abeyance, but surely the living of the people in the States must be attended to, and if business people are to pay heavy income tax, and war tax, &c, tbey must be given an opportunity to do business, otherwise not only will the traders themselves suffer, but ultimately the various Governments. ' As the Prime Minister pointed out very properly this morning, the decision of the High Court has practically enabled the State Governments to set aside the provisions of the Constitution. The prohibition against individuals remains still as strong as ever,. and the decision of bhe High Court thab State Governments have the power of acquisition for public purposes is a proper distinction, because the Stabe Governments are sovereign bodies, and they must have the power bo acquire goods for Governmenb purposes. not bhe use, bub abuse, of bhe power thab people are complaining of. embargo has doubled the price of meab 1 in Soubh Australia. is really operating as a sorb of exporb tax. As regards cabbie, bhe Government are charging 10s. per head for every beasb bhab is baken across bheQueensland Border inbo Soubh Australia. In bhab way bhey are levying, in . effect, InterState Customs duties. Ib is bhe same wibh sheep passing from Queensland into New South Wales. The fact is that the Government, exercising governmental capacity, are doing something which p r i vate citizens would not be allowed to do. gest something to the Prime Minister. I have been asked whether the .Commonwealth Government are taking any steps to take over the control of meat for I m perial purposes. A t the present time, the Queensland Government are securing meat for Imperial purposes under an I m perial Act. When asked whether the -.Federal Government contemplate doing the same thing, I have replied to telegrams I have received that, so -far, I know of no such intention on the part of the Federal Government. I am a f r a i d that the Premiers' Conference has concluded ; but I would ask the Prime Minister to make some representations to the Queensland Government on the subject. Sof a r as they are honestly and legitimately acquiring meat for Imperial purposes, no one in Australia can take exception to their action. But where these powers are being exercised, not for that purpose, hut for local purposes of one kind and another, that is neither f a i r nor legitimate in the interests of Australia as a whole. That is the aspect of the matter that needs inquiry. I do not expect the Prime Miniater to be able to give me an answer bo my question at once; but I ask him to take the matter into careful consideration, and see whether some communication cannot be made to the Queensland Government, w it h a view to securing justice for all persons engaged in legitimate trade between Queensland and New South Wales, without doing anything that would be detrimental to the Ib is supply of meat for Imperial purposes. wish to ask. the Prime Minister a question.
