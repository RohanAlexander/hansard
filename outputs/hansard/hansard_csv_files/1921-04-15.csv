Will the right honourable the Prime Minister please resume his seat. The Prime Minister has already informed the House that he is suffering from a vocal disability. It is impossible for me to follow what he is saying while these numerous and concerted interjections are occurring. I ask honourable members, therefore, to restrain themselves, and permit the Prime Minister ro make his remarks without undue interruption. bearance of the House. I am not well, and am trying to do my best. I am? sorry that I cannot speak louder. I am endeavouring to put in some sort of chronological order tlie events which transpired in'relation to the matter underreview. I repeat that some of the members of thc Country party assured me that they did not know what they were voting on, or, at all events, that they had no clear idea of the effects of their vote. I accept all these assurauoes, namely, that the motion was a friendly one, and was not intended as a reflection upon the Government, that the Country party did. not call for a division, that members of the Opposition did so, and that honourable members of the Country party thereupon felt bound to support the motion which had been moved by a member of their party, the honourable member for Grampians. Of course, had some of those honourable members been a little more experienced they would have known that nothing is more common Interruption. bers persist in interjecting and in making concerted interruptions I shall have to take a different course of action. will not give me a chance to speak, let them say so, and I will sit down. repeat that if some members of the Country party had had a little more experience they would have known that it is almost the invariable practice to negative a motion of the character in question, and not to support it. Such motions are not moved for the actual purpose of adjourning the House. They are an interI think you should name ruption of the ordinary programme of work set down on the business-paper for the day, in order to discuss some matter of urgent public business. I have myself often voted against motions which I have ' moved for the adjournment oii the House when a vote has been called for, having obtained by the discussion thereon all that I had sought. And this frequently happens. No one knows better than the honourable member for Grampians that no vote of this House could reduce freights. If the Government were able, by some act of theirs, to reduce freights, and he had said, in effect, by his motion, "" You must reduce freights,"" then a vote to ascertain the feeling of the House in regard to such a demand would havo been quite proper. But such was not the case. The motion was moved in order to call attention-as I have said, and the honourable member for Grampians also has saidto a matter of grave importance, not only to the primary producer, but to the Commonwealth generally. These, then, are the facts: The motion was a friendly one. We are assured by several members of the Country party that they had no intention of embarrassing the Government; that they did not call for a division, but that, a division having been called for, those who were in the chamber felt bound to support the motion, while those who had been outside and came in to take part in the division sat alongside their colleagues.. I think that fairly sets out the situation. Having said so much, I want to ask honourable members, How do these facts affect the situation ? It still remains true that the business had been taken out of the hands of the Government who have had any experience of parliamentary government know that that is the one thing which a Government cannot submit to.

That has been the practice in every case so far as I know, and I can, of course, speak fro m a fairly lengthy experience. .

I look around this chamber, and this Parliament, as I have a right to do, and consider the position of parties. It is perfectly clear that when a party which consists of 38 members is challenged by two sections, which allegedly have nothing in common and who do not collectively, I was saying that I and certainly not separately, possess the numbers to carry on, the Government must, in the very nature of the thing, if it is to hold office with dignity and with due regard to its position in this House and in the country, take but one course in view of the vote which was recorded yesterday. I want to make my position quite clear. Not only do I not seek a crisis, but I am prepared to go as far as I ask any any man possibly can, with due regard to the dignity of the Government and of this party and the people it represents in the country^ to avoid a crisis.

Apart then from other considerations, while there remains any doubt as to whether this Government has control of the business of this House, any attempt it may make to represent Australia at the Conference in London must invite, not merely the criticism, but the censure of every other section in this House, and of the great majority of the people of Australia.

The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) declared this in so. many words, and I entirely agree with him. Because of that,, the Government, though unable to ignore what took place yesterday, will seek an opportunity-and whether that opportunity is to be given depends entirely on the House'-of ascertaining what the vote of yesterday meant. If , as honourable members assure us, it is not to be regarded as a vote of censure on the Government, or an. attempt to take the business out of the hands of the Government, well, either by words or by action, that can be demonstrated.

There are others who indignantly deny that they had been brought up to the ""bull ring,"" and say that they intend to give their whole-hearted support to the Government, and promise the Government immunity from any adverse vote whilst the Prime Minister is away.

I can only say that if there are honourable members in that position, they should confess the fact to their constituents, and ask them to send others to represent them in Parliament. Earlier in my remarks I noted how few there are left of the members of the House of ten years ago, showing what an uncertain game politics is; and it is highly probable that ten years hence many more of us will be missing.

Sir the Opposition, after looking through the report, again persist in the statement he has made. opinion, what I said is an accurate interpretation of the Treasurer's interjection. that there was a division? i I hope the House will give very serious consideration io the matter that is now before it. By vote yesterday the House declared that it had lost confidence in the Government. The Prime Minister has now proposed the adjournment of the House; no doubt the Government will carry the motion, and will -then be quite safe. The Prime Minister has stated that no self-respecting Government could hold office after a vote had been recorded against them, but he and his Ministers must have a short memory. I remember that when they went to the country on the conscription question, the Prime Minister said that unless the referendum was carried, the Government would not continue to hold ofiice. Some Ministers stated that if the people rejected their proposal they would not retain office for twenty-five minutes. But when conscription was defeated what did this self-respecting Government do ? They resigned, but said: ""Please, Governor General, send for us again."" The Governor General asked the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) whom he should send for to form a Ministry, and the Prime Minister replied: ""Send for W. M . Hughes."" And the same self-respecting Government retained possession of the Treasury bench. Last night, when some newspaper reporters asked me what would happen as a result of yesterday's vote, I replied, ""There is not a traction 'engine in the country that could drag the Government off the Treasury bench."" What are the Government proposing now? The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) yesterday moved a motion in all sincerity; he pointed out What the the shipping freight anomalies as a result of which the producers were being bled. He stated that the Shipping Combine were The report states that I would earning big profits and fleecing the pro-, ducers, and that that was one of the reasons for high prices. What promise producers? They made no promise that they would try to bring about any reduction, and, accordingly, when the question was taken to a division honourable members of the Country party supported it. But I suppose the acid has been put on them this morning. Honourable members know that when a man purchases a piece of jewellery which is supposed to be 18 carat, and he doubts its genuineness, he tests it with acid. The Government are putting the acid on the Country party to-day, and if they do not stand the test Several honourable members interjecting, orderly conduct cannot be permitted to continue. There is a perfect babel of sound, and it is impossible for any honourable member to address the House without being subjected to unseemly interruption by loud conversation or continuous interjections. I ask honourable members to support the Chair in trying to keep some semblance of order in the conduct of debate; otherwise, our proceedings will be reduced to a farce. I hope the honourable member for South Sydney will be allowed to continue in reasonable silence, and that he will address his remarks to the Chair instead of to other honourable members. upon the 'Country party in order to ascertain whether they were sincere in the actiort they took yesterday.

When a vote has been recorded against the Government, and they have been defeated, the most manly course for the Prime Minister to adopt is to tender his resignation to the Governor General, and let the Governor General exhaust the possibilities of the House. This the Government did not do. Instead, there was conference after conference, and interview after interview, and buttonholing, and getting members of the Country party into a corner. It has been said before that the Government had the Country party "" in the bag."" They may have some of the Country party "" in the bag,"" but I know members of that party who resent that sort of thing. It will go out to-day that the Country party are not sincere on the question"" of economy, and that they want an opportunity to keep the Government in power. It has been said that the Government have been handfeeding them, but I believe there are men in the Country party who are above that sort of thing.

The first is the fact that the Government are still in office, and the second is that no explanation whatever is forthcoming from the Leader of the Corner party as to their action. It has been a well known practice of Parliament, ever since we have had responsible government, that the moment a vote is taken, which in any way takes the conduct of the business of the country out of the hands of the Government, the Government immediately resign. There is only one course dictated by honour, and that is the immediate resignation p f this Government; but what do we find? course, if members in the Corner^think so little of the honour of Parliament as to carry on loud conversations when a member is speaking, they should be told that before very long the people w ill wake up to the farce of the present parliamentary system, and give us some other system. sible for that incident.

You may get that quicker than you want. election far more than the honourable member for Illawarra does. There is no doubt about whether I shall come back. My majority is quite sufficient to insure that, but there is a big doubt whether the honourable member for Illawarra will come back. I can therefore quite understand his fear about a general election. I can imagine him holding up his hands in horror and saying to the Prime Minister, "" Eor God's sake, do not send us to the country, because if we go to the country Illawarra will be lost to our party and go back to the Australian Labour party."" There is no doubt that is the trouble, and undoubtedly there are a few other members behind the Prime Ministeri n a similar position. I wonder what the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr direction and next day they vote in an Higgs) feels like to-day. I wonder what he had to say yesterday to the Prime Minister in the party room. I will wager that he said something pretty straight and pretty appealing to the Prime Minister about the condition of affairs in Capricornia. I can imagine that he drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the gentleman who is to be the next member for Capricornia was sitting in the public gallery yesterday. I refer to Mr Ford. I suppose that the honourable member for Capricornia said, "" Mr failure in public life. The only means Prime Minister, do any mortal thing you can, but for the Lord's sake do not send us to the country."" Such intrigues for the purpose of holding office are a disgrace to public life; and if the people were given an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon them they would show 'their resentment at such conduct. This Parliament should be above all such intrigues. I am prepared to allow any Government representing a majority of the people, and holding office in an honourable way, to continue without being hampered by anything of a paltry nature. But when we have a Government who throw honour overboard in order to hold on to office, the people should be given the earliest opportunity of displacing them.

He insinuated that he had been assured by the Leader of the Country party and many members of the party that they did not.know what they were doing, and, if given the opportunity, would reverse their action of yesterday. Honourable members must recollect that they are public men with great responsibilities. They are sent here by a number, of the people of Australia to stand firmly by the views to which they have givon expression. If honourable members of the Country party have any hope of making anything of their party, I warn them to consider the position they will occupy in relation to the great masses of the people if one day they vote in one opposite direction. If they go 'back on their vote of yesterday, and, as a result, they go to the country, I give them this word of warning, that they will be shattered as a party, because there is nothing the people resent more than they do inconsistency on the part of public men. Honourable members may laugh, but wo often laugh to stop ourselves from crying, and probably that is the position of the members of the Corner party. If they go back on their vote, they are doomed to any party has of making itself successful lies in integrity of purpose; it must stand solidly by its platform and the principles it has. enunciated to the people.

He knows his own business best, and I would not suggest that any one should dictate to him as to what he should do; but surely it is open to us, as a party, and as members of this House, to expect, when such definite and damaging statements are made-becaus e the statements made by the Prime Minister were both definite and' damaging-that those who are accused should tell us what their exact position is. If yesterday's incident, which we are now discussing, has not contributed to the progress of the country, it has at least added to the gaiety of the population. Having heard the Prime Minister. ( Mr Hughes) in the course of his explanation, smoothing the, Toad for the Country party more advice. but caustic comment. After noting the way in which the PrimÂ© Minister has carefully smoothed the path for the Country party to gracefully slide down, while at the same time paying them the doubtful compliment that they, .like the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler), were absent in mind, but present in body, and did not know what was likely to be the consequences of their vote, I am anxiously waiting to hear the reply of that party: The Prime Min-. ister says that some of its members did not know for what they were voting. He makes that statement despite the fact that the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), who submitted the motion whichresulted in such disastrous consequences to the Government, was until recently the Deputy Leader of that party. The honourable member presumably was elected to that position because he was considered competent to judge what his party desired. We may, therefore, reasonably assume that he ond those associated with him knew perfectly well what they Were doing. I do not believe that they did not know. I think they knew what they were doing. well Country party know what they intend to I should like to have it do. I am waiting to hear honourable members of that party make the announcement that as the result of a decision arrived"" at by them, the position created by yesterday's vote will be maintained to-day In reviewing the circumstances associated with the incident ono is struck by the number of coincidences. One cannot help remarking, for instance, the phenomenal inactivity of the Governmout Whips, and also the phenomenal inactivity of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Oook) who was leading the House at the time, and who is always soalert and anxious to see that adequate precautions are taken to properly safeguard the position of the Government. These facts almost lead one to helieve that the Government were not averse to the creation of tlie situation which actually arose. The statement made by the Prime Minister does not lead to any conclusion that would destroy the hypothesis that the Government welcomed the opportunity to place the Country party in a position in which they would have to give the Ministry an assurance of continued support. The Ministerial party we know full well have been decidedly restive in view of the fact that if they are not to be supported by the Country party their majority has Toached the vanishing stage. We are therefore driven to one of two conclusions-eithe r that the Government were not unwilling that this situation should be created in _ order that they might profit thereby or x that some of the'se who sit behind the Government, and who would not he averse to accepting a portfolio in a reconstructed Government in preference to going before their constituencies, had something to do with the little crisis. I do not know which of these assumptions is correct, but if we give the Country party credit, as I do, for being perfectly well aware of what they were doing, then that party must adhere to the position which they took up yesterday.

It was aimed at the displacementof tlie Government, but unfortunately it was not proceeded with. it might be done in a more subtle way. able member dc3S suspect. one. orable inember for confirming my suspicious that there are honourable members on the other side willing to proceed in subtle ways to displace Ministers whom they are supposed to be supporting.

When I consider these things I am led to the .conclusion that the.event of yesterday was not an unhappy accident, as some Leader of the Fourth party may be called think, but was premeditated, of malice upon. aforethought. I believe that the continuous session yesterday evening of members Nationalist party was not without a purpose.

I paid a visit to His Excellency, and, while I am not anticipating an early Invitation, I can assure honourable members opposite that if they will consent to give me their support, I shall be prepared to give them eleven out of the twelve portfolios. The present situation, if not edifying, should be highly amusing to the country. The workers of Australia will take note of the intrigues that are resorted to by so-called statesmen in the effort to hang on. to office and to avoid, as on one occasion the late Mr ing to impress the electors that it is their Alfred Deakin described it , ""being dragged screaming from tlie tart shop."" It appears to me that when the nossibilities of the situation have been exhausted we shall find ourselves in much the same position as before, with the possible exception that we may have a new Leader of the Nationalist party in the place of the present occupant of that position. There is a powerful section, the members of which wish to displace the present Prime Minister. Quarrels occur in the best regulated families, and we have had evidence from the honourable member for Perth that honourable members opposite are not a united, family. ber would not call the Nationalist party a well regulated family. would so describe the party to which the honourable member 'belongs. evidence that certain interests desire to displace the present Prime Minister in his leadership cf the Nationalist party. It may be that some dark horse is in the background, . and that we shall have a new Prime Minister as a result of this intriguing and political manoeuvring, but in. the meantime the country is treated to the very unedifying spectacle of intriguing, counter intriguing, and pit digging by honourable members opposite in order that the Government may still cling to office, and that a pretence to unity may be put up in order that the people may beguiled, and last, but not least,* that the exploiters may be represented at the Imperial Conference. The working classes in the present order of things will not be represented, no matter who goes. My vote will be given against the Government, and against, any who may succeed the present Ministers, if they follow the same lines of policy and voice the same interests. If the Country party listens to the blandishments of the Prime Minister, and allows w itself to be tricked ishments of the Opposition? cerned with that. 1 have no desire and no reason to exercise any blandishments, and am rather amused at the spectacle with which we are now confronted.

189,Mr Hector Lamond,"I havepurely personal reasons that he was prevented from attending the 1917 Conference. tending any Conference as our .representative. spite rather than political reasons kept him from attending the 191.7 Conference: but, notwithstanding the difficulties in the way of a f u l l and effective presentation of the White Australia policy at the Peace Conference, due to the Labour party's want of recognition of the im portance of having Australia represented at the Imperial Conference in 1917, the Prime Minister, against odds that would have deterred a man of lesser calibre, wrested victory from those who were determined that he should not succeed, and from a majority who would have nothing to do w i th the White Australia policy. Whatever may be the verdict of posterity on his work at the great Peace Conference, those who consider that the White Australia policy is essential to the maintenance of the Commonwealth as a white man's country must acknowledge that he succeeded there, even beyond the expectation of his most ardent friends. the White Australia policy over to the League of Nations. ment is a singularly inaccurate one for a member of the legal profession to make. Tlie mandate which the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D . Millen) was able, as the Australian representative, to bring back from the Geneva Conference, in spite of the assistance given to Japan by some of the members of this House, ancl the almost insuperable difficulties of his position there, permits this Parliament to apply to the new territories of the Pacific which we now control the same legislation as we have enacted,for the government of our own country. It is not necessary, as the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) suggested, that we should pretend to a knowledge of what has taken placespn the secret conclaves of the Labour party, to know its attitude on this question. That party published officially throughout the Commonwealth the direction to those who heeded it on the other side of the world, that its policy regarding the Pacific possessions was that Australia should have no more voice in regard to them than belonged to any one of the representatives"" of the nations. To-day, the party wishes Australia to forget this official notification of policy. It cafi be easily understood that its members should wish the electors to forget their treachery to the White Australia principle at the time when that principle most needed the help of those who now profess to be its chief champions. For a member of a party, tainted as it is w it h treachery to the White Australia principle, to upbraid the Prime Minister for failure to defend that principle at the Peace Conference, is for him to make too great a demand on the intelligence of the Australian Democracy. Instead of the honourable member for West Sydney seeking to take from the Prime Minister the laurels that he won at the Peace Conference, in his fight for a White Australia policy, the honourable and learned member would have better served the interests of those who sent him here had he given the right honourable gentleman the fullest support, so that the victory already secured might not be jeopardized by the want of similar representation at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. It is humiliating that, at a time when the future of this Country is in the balance, and it is essential that Australia should present a united fron t in defence of her ideals, the selfish interests T h a t state of political parties should be permitted to override the interests of the Commonwealth. I deplore the position brought about by yesterday's vote. It must, however, be viewed from the constitutional stand-point. My object in rising was fo denounce attacks on the Prime Minister based on the assertion that, at the Peace Conference, he failed in his duty to Australia in his attitude towards the White Australia policy. We did not secure all that we wanted, but we should have secured perhaps more than we did. had' the right honourable gentleman had behind him the national support that was given to the delegates of every other country. It is to be admitted with shame that, in this country alone, there was a section which reviled its representatives at the Peace Conference, and took every opportunity to weaken their influence with-those with whom they were dealing.

193,Mr Hector Lamond,"ever m a j be the merits of the vote.of the Country party yesterday, the Labpur party, at any rate, cannot escape the obloquy of having for the second time done its utmost to prevent the presentation of the case for a White Australia at an Imperial Conference. I was asked last night by various pressmen . whether the present situation was to be regarded as a major or a minor crisis. And, this morning, practically all over Australia, we find that every journal of any significance is suggesting that a mountain is being made out of a moleh ill , What has taken place is that the Government have made a definite blunder in tactics, and are now trying to force the whole of the blame for their palpable error on the shoulders of this party. I take exception to the attitude and to the statements of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). I have heard statements made by him to the effect that yesterday's was a snatch division, and that the voting was not very well considered by any honourable"" member because of its suddenness. I deny that any member of the Country party has said that he did not know what he was voting for. that some members of your party, who were not in the chamber, voted when they did come in , not knowing at the time what the motion was. that the Prime Minister is using this vote, for which the Government must be held responsible, as a means of bludgeoning a further assurance from this party, which it cannot give with any retention of its self-respect. not the wet-nurse of the Government. . We are not responsible for the present position. We have no intention of giving the Government-no r could we give this or any other Government-absolut e immunity. To do so would be inconsistent with our pledges to our constituents. But, as we have said, we will not take any undue advantage of the absence cf the Prime Minister. We cannot be expected, however, to do the Prime Minister's whipping for h i m , and everything else in connection with the running of Whatthis House. We think, and have expressed the view, that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference. I have spoken in no uncertain terms regarding that; and the ideas of the Prime Minister, as he has expounded them here, have received the almost unanimous support of all parties in this Chamber. If the Government are not prepared to take the f u l l responsibility of being represented at the Conwho thronged these precincts ference, it is time that a Government same into existence which would be prepared to accept complete responsibility, and would represent Australia there. The Prime Minister has quoted my views with respect to patching up party quarrels; but what is the right honourable gentleman now doing? He is flogging his Imperial mission for purely party advantage. The Prime Minister has taken the proper course to-day in asking for time in which to reconsider his position. He has been given a definite statement concerning our views, and I will vote for the adjournment for which the Prime Minister has asked, in order to enable him to give the required consideration to his position. It is extremely interesting, in view of what the Leader of ' the Country party did say was (Dr. Earle Page), has just said, to examine the position in which the Government now 'find themselves. They haves been defeated*; but, notwithstanding that, and the fact that we have had from the Leader of the Country party an assurance that every member of his party understood the significance ofayesterday's vote, and knew the seriousness of their step, and exactly what they were doing, we still see the Government clinging, limpet-like, to the Treasury bench. It should not take them twenty-four hours, or twenty-four minutes, to decide what course they should adopt. Personally, I think that the only honourable procedure is for the Government to immediately hand their resignations to the Governor General, and so let His ^Excellency send for the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), who would form a M nistry, and : endeavour to carry on. In ordinary circumstances, with ordinary people, such a course, no doubt, would have been pursued last night. But this is no ordinary Government.

The Leader of this party can afford to be insulting to the Prime Minister of this country. What does the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister says to this Leader, "" You deny responsibility, and say that you did not mean anything."" Does the Leader of the Country party stand up to reply? Does he answer the accusations of the Prime Minister? Not. at all; he accepts the imputation that he did not mean anything; he accepts this slander on his character, and, like a poor helpless creature, does not attempt t any answer. All he does is to say, ""As if a motion for the adjournment of the House is moved by one of us, I will support it."" The party reserve the right to turn round and vote against or for the Government as they please. What has the Prime Minister said, about other members of the party? The right honourable gentleman says to them, "" You come to me privately, and whisper to me that you did not know what you were voting for."" However, there is nothing in that. They are not the only men who vote and do not know what they are voting for. In the history of this Chamber members have walked in and voted for something-the y knew not what. I honestly admit, without mentioning names,, that there was, at least, one member, apart from the Country party, who did the same thing. one. I asked eleven honourable members opposite what they were voting for and not one man knew. the honourable member; it has occurred many a time. But the public does not know what goes on, and the press will not expose the game. The public will swallow the "" dope,"" and will really believe that we assemble here, and know what we are voting for, though very often we do not. The Prime Minister seeks to score on that point, and says of those men in the Corner that some of them whispered to him that they did not know what they were voting for-that they never meant any harm, but that, of course, they wanted to appear well before the public and their constituents. The last thing they wished to do was to embarrass the Government or themselves. One would, at least, think that private conversations should be sacred. ber says, "" Hear, hear! "" but he and the others with him do not resent this repetition of a private conversation. They go to the Prime Minister as a kind of father confessor, saying, "" Oh, father, forgive w , for we know not what we do."" They do not resent this, violation of a private conversation. No; they are deadly silent, and dare not answer. What sort we are the Country party, of animals are they who dare not resent an imputation of the kind? Why do they not stand up one by one and answer the Prime Minister? It is neither the Government nor the Opposition that is on its trial in the Government's estimation; it is that section in the Corner which claims to be free from the responsibilities of the Government, and also free from the extremism of the Opposition. What does the Government, do? I do not object to the attitude of the Prime Minister, inconvenient as it may be to myself and others. It is the ortly attitude that the right honourable gentleman could adopt towards a faction like this. It would be better for the future of the country if the Country party were to link up witli either one side or the other rather than maintain a position where nobody can trust them. Why, they cannot even trust each other! What honour is there in the only being the leader of such a party or faction? They sit here and, with tame submission, listen to the abuse of the Prime Minister-to his imputations, his insults aud innuendoes, -and to the stigmas cast on them from this side. sin ? first time that he has done it in this Chamber.

Honourable members on this side of the Chamber were not the wasters of public time. It was the members of the Country party who occupied the time of Parliament in ' debating a motion which meant nothing, and in respect of which they have harmed themselves considerably in the eyes of the electors. Eveni f we had been as hypocritical as they themselves, the members of the Labour party were bound to vote against the Government. We had to do so, or to disappear from public l if e as its supporters. the position that is occupied by members of the Country party have neither the respect of any Government supporter nor of any member of the Opposition, nor of the daily press of this country, whether it be Labour or Liberal.

As a party, they can never have a political future if they continue to remain as indefinite in their attitude as they have been since rheir advent in this Chamber. Coming to the threat of a dissolution, I have always endeavoured to postpone, as far as possible, a general election. I would postpone it for all eternity. But, apart from personal inconvenience, it stands to reason that we, as a party, are hostile to this Governmeut; that we are hostile to its Prime Minister, and that we are naturally hostile to his going to EneJand, upon the ground that the policy which he has enunciated upon the floor of this Chamber is inimical to the best interests of Australia. The inference founded upon the -arguments of' the Treasurer himself ( Sir Joseph Cook) is' that this country cannot bear a heavy burden in respect of naval expenditure. If the Old Country is loaded up with an enormous debt, if she is torn by internal dissension, and by international dissatisfaction with her previous allies; if it is in evitable that the revenues of this country must decline enormously within the next twelve months whilst our interest burden must increase, it is not the willingness either o t the Prime Minister ov the Treasurer which will dictate the future policy of this country in regard to our navai defence. What will dictate it is the state of its finances and the ability of the Commonwealth to bear the expenditure. The Prime Minister has asked why the Old Country should defend Australia. son) I must ask the honourable member not-to discuss, upon this motion, the M in But gentlemen who occupy isterial statement. the mood I could not speak at all, and now that I can speak I am prevented from doing so.

I repeat that it is inevitable that the party with which I am associated w ill vote against the Government upon every conceivable occasion. I do not believe that there is going to be any dissolution of this Parliament. I believe that the anxiety of the Prime Minister to appear in England during the coming summer season is a paramount reason why there w i ll be no dissolution Of course, if a dissolution should come, I shall have to face it with the others, irrespective of its results.

We are here, and, take it from me, we shall stay. With reference to the crisis that has arisen, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) stated that certain members of the Country party went to him and said that they did not mean to vote as they did, or that they did not mean that vote to be interpreted as it has been. I do not know what they said, but I , at any rate, did not go to him. Furthermore, if I were Prime Minister, and any honourable members told me what members of our party aTe alleged to have said to the Leader of the Government, I would not have come here and'disclosed their statement on the floor of the House. I would not have put in a false position somebody who was probably sympathetically inclined towards me. If I spoke privately to the Leader of the Opposition or to almost any other member in the House, I would feel quite certain that my statement would not be repeated here, as the Prime Minister repeated statements made to him, not only to members of this House, but to the press and people. The action of the Prime Minister was deliberately unfair to the very people who, he claims, are sympathetic towards the Government. ber does not know what the other honourable members said to him, or what use they told him to make of their statements. a great deal more or a great deal less; I do not know what they said. I have 0 only to say, speaking, not so much for the Country party, but rather for the neople who sent us here, particularly the organized farmers of Victoria, that the reason why we were returned to Parliament was the failure of both existing parties. AndI make bold to say that for that same reason we shall stay here. We were returned upon a definite platform, which is stated in black and white. Candidates from both the old parties were pitted against us on the hustings, and the only results were a diminution of the numbers of both of them and an increase in the strength of the Country party. Yet honourable members have the .effrontery to sneer at a party which has won its position in this House in spite of the efforts of both of the other parties. I repeat that we are here to stay. It seems to me that we are going through a stage when responsible government and parliamentary institutions are being placed on trial. We hear a lot from our opponents about honourable members on this side of the House desiring to destroy parliamentary government. If there is anything calculated to destroy parliamentary'institutions it is disgraceful procedure such as we witnessed yesterday and to-day. Nothing could tend more to bring parliamentary institutions and constitutional government into contempt with, the people than the-action of the Government in hanging on to office after this House has clearly told -them that it has lost confidence in them and their administration. I shall not say much in regard to the controversy or trial of wits between the Prime Minister and the Country party, or the insults and innuendoes that he has directed at them. If the honour of the Country party is concerned, that is their look out; the affairs of my own party are sufficient concern for me. I shall not worry whether the Country party loses or gains, or whether they support or oppose the Government. Whatever action they take must be their own responsibility, to which they, and not we, will have to stand up. I desire to refer briefly to the laboured reason which the Prime Minister gave for the undignified attitude of his Government in hanging on to office. ' He said that it was essential that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference'inferentially, by him. Australia could still be represented at that Conference even if the Government were to resign today, but not by the present Prime Minister.

243,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [3.2],"Australia cannot be adequately represented except by himself. The opinion of m}'self and the other members of the Labour party is that anybody could represent Australia at the Imperial Conference better than the Prime Minister. I believe that if the people outside could exthe Government carrying on the business press their opinion they would support that view. The country is not looking with any great amount of anxiety to its representation by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference. I believe a great deal was said here to-day about his representation of Australia at other Conferences. The statement that he consented at a previous gathering to the White Austi'alia policy being handed over to the League of JTations has been contested, but I think that it is clear and beyond dispute that he did do so. If such a policy as that, a policy so vital to the interests of Australia, could be handed over by him to the League of Nations, we have no guarantee whatever, irrespective of the statements that the Prime Minister has made to the House, that other interests as vital, or nearly as vital to Australia, will be conserved by him. son) -I ask thc honourable member not to discuss that matter, which is involved in the Ministerial statement. it in connection with the Prime Minister's statement this morning that it was necessary for the Government to remain in office in order that he might go to Loudon to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference. The members of the Labour party, and our supporters outside, and I believe the majority of thc people of Australia, would rather that Australia were represented in London by ahnost anybody else than by the Prime Minister. The honourable meiuber for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), who said that the members of the Country party were refused pairs by members sitting on this side of the chamber, must realize, as an old. politician, how difficult it is to pair with a party when you do not know, from day to day, what attitude that party are going to take up on any question that is before the Chamber. No one knows which way the Country party are going to cast a vote. We do not know whether they will be for or against the Government, and consequently it is impossible for us to pair with them, even if we so desire. The honourable member stated clearly and candidly that he was against of the country. If lie said anything at all, he said that the Government do nofc command his confidence. WhatI want 1 particularly to bring under the notice of the House is the statement of the honourable member's leader (Dr. Earle Page). I was waiting this morning for the Leader of the Country party to rise iu his place, and make some statement regarding the transactions of yesterday. In view of the lecture delivered to him by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) this morning, I think it was the honourable member's place to rise immediately, even .before the Leader of our party, with a view to clearing his party from the aspersions cast on them. Now that he has made a statement, I , for one, welcome it, because, if he has told the Prime Minister anything to-day, he has told him that, so far as the Countryparty are concerned, he will have no immunity from attack during his absence if he should go abroad. The Prime Minister made it clear here, on Friday, that he would not be justified in going abroad to the Imperial Conference unless he had some guarantee that, in his absence, the Government would be protected. The honourable member who leads the Country party said that he resented the statements bhat had been made concerning them hy the Prime Minister, bufc that they were not going to wet nurse the Government; that the Government had their own Whips, and their own. methods of conducting their business, and that his party were not going to be dragged behind the heels of the Government. that far, why not give all that tour Leader said? the honourable member like me to give? the .promise he made the other day. would repeat the promise he made the other night, that, so far as he reasonably could, he would support the Government.",44,Joseph Cook Doe S The Leader Of Did The Government Give To Relieve The

250,Mr Charlton,"Yes; he said he Â°The Prime Ministei*, however, says that unless he gets a definite promise from the House that nothing untoward will befall the Government during his absence, he does not think he should undertake the journey abroad. The Leader of the Country party said very clearly, and the House must not lose sight of the fact, that he was supporting the motion HOAV before the House because it was a motion for the adjournment of tlie House for the purpose of permitting the Government to further consider thc position in * which they are placed. He did not say he was supporting the motion on the ground that, its object was to vindicate the Government. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), who is the Deputy Leader of the Country party, knows that that statement emanated from his Leader. The result is that the Government standv to-day where they stood last night when the motion for the adjournment of the House was carried-, irrespective of what may be the fate of the motion for ad journment which is now before the House. Eveni f this motion is carried, that will not clear the Government, in view of the statement deliberately made by the Leader cf the Country party. it would. honourable member wishes that it would. that the Government have to consider their position, and the Prime Minister has already made it clear to the House that he will not go abroad unless he has a definite understanding that his Government will be immune from defeat while he is away. In words which cannot in any way be misunderstood, the Leader of -the Country party now says, "" I am not going to give immunity to any Government."" In fact, he went so far as to say that he would not be in a position to do so. I take it that the Country party have their owu platform, and are tied down by certain rules and decisions of their own conference, and therefore their Leader cannot promise the Government immunity. If that is so, it brings us to a position which the House has to face. It is said that it is absolutely necessary for the Prime Minister to go abroad so that Australia may be represented at the Imperial Conference, and not remain unrepresented, as happened in 1917. Thc Prime Minister says that he cannot go unless he is assured of the stability of his Government in his absence. When the Leader of the Country party says he cannot give the Prime Minister the guarantee ithat he asks for, it puts the Prime Minister in this position: If he goes now, in face of that statement, without having an absolute majority on the floor of the House to carry on the affairs of the country, he is responsible for whatever happens in his absence. If he has not an absolute majority on the floor of the House, then he has not an absolute majority of the people of Australia behind him. The Leader of the Country party also pointed out very clearly to the Prime .MinisterI am trying to follow his statement, and he will correct me if : J am wrong-that , if the Prime Minister was not satisfied with his position, it did not follow that there should be' a dissolution and an appeal to the people, because, he said, the possibilities of the House were not exhausted. He added that there was nothing to prevent a Government being formed in this House that would carry on the affairs of the country. If that is the position at which we have arrived, then the Government should act, and act promptly. They are in no better position than they were in last night. If they have not a majority, and if we want to be represented at the Imperial Conference, and the time is so shorr, the Government must allow the Governor General to exhaust the possibilities of the House for the formation of a Ministry to carry on the affairs of Australia. If a change of Government takes place, what is to prevent the incoming Government, if it is sufficiently strong, from appointing a man to go abroad to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference? There is the position as I see it, and we cannot escape it. According to the statement made by the Leader of thc Country party, if the Government, on reconsidering their position, decide to continue in office, and if anything happens in the future, such as happened yesterday-whic h is quite likely,",45,Joseph Cook Doe S The Leader Of Did The Government Give To Relieve The

Nine times out of tenin fact, every time the fate of the Government was at stake-som e number, great or small, of the Corner party was to be found coming to the rescue of Ministers; and no matter whether the honourable member for Wimmera speaks from now until this time, next year, he cannot wipe out the past record of his . party. says that the people of the country have become distrustful of the Labour party and of the 'National party, and have sent representatives of the Country party into Parliament., there, and even show a disposition to though it may be unpleasant the honourable member, I would draw his attention to the fact that the latest appeal to the country has had quite a contrary result. elections last week, the Country party was practically wiped out; and I venture to Bay that the reason for its obliteration was'the record in this House of the party that stands under the same banner. The honourable member claims that that, is a State,, and not a Pederal concern; but, as a matter of.fact, on the last occasion on which there was an appeal in a .Pederal way to the people of this country, namely, at Ballarat, the candidate of the Country party lost his deposit, and the candidate of the Labour party was returned by a substantial majority. The facts are all against the honourable member for Wimmera. The point I am endeavouring to make is that the decision of the Country party, apparently arrived at during the luncheon adjournment, to grant the Government this adjournment, is absolutely inconsistent with the vote they cast yesterday. they are willing to meet the Government in every possible way. The only way in which they can be consistent with their vote of yesterday is to vote .against the -Governments request for this adjourn[304] ment. In fact, the words of the Leader of the Country party bear me. out. He said that the only decent thing the Government could do was to resign; and, in view of his words, the only logical action hie party can take is to put the Government into the position of having to resign at the earliest opportunity. down. honourable member for West Sydney has said, the Country party are again coming to the rescue of the Government by showing them a way out of their difficulty, and announcing that they are prepared Se to vote with them again.

277,Mr Parker Moloney,"I do consider the position, and the Leader offor the whole of his party, has told the Prime Minister that there is only one decent thing for the Government to do, and that is to resign. Therefore, to be consistent, members of the Country party should vote against the motion. would have been surprised, after the vote yesterday, if the Prime Minister( Mr countries. If this crisis does no more Hughes) had tendered his resignation to the Governor General. Knowing the Prime Minister's career, and remembering the ex-Senator Ready scandal, as well as his declaration on the hustings that if conscription were not carried he would resign, I am not at all surprised that he submitted to defeat yesterday and still retains his position as Prime Minister. But this he ought to know from to-day's debate: that although he may have a majority to-day, he has no guarantee from the Country party .of immunity from attack during his absence. The Leader of the party (Dr. Earle Page) made that declaration. declaration standing, the Prime Minister ought not to go to England as the representative of Australia. He was defeated on the floor of the House yesterday by a combination of two parties. That vote proved conclusively that he represents a minority of the' people. I would be delighted if , as a result of what happened yesterday, this Parliament had to face a dissolution, though personally I do not want another election. I have had quite enough recently, but I would rather have another election, if by that means we could prevent the Prime Minister from misrepresenting Australia at the Imperial Conference. We know the way in which he played with the White Australia policy at the last Imperial Conference; we do not forget the extent to which it was jeopardized by his action in allowing the control of the question to be taken 1 from Australia and handed over to the League of Nations. In view of these facts, we object to' the Prime Minister going abroad as representative of Australia. We particularly object to his representing Australia at the forthcoming Conference, at which Australia will probably be asked to join with Great Britain in spending Â£15,000,000 or Â£20,000,000 a year on battleships, and also to agree to some form of conscription proposed by people who do not live in Australia. Our desire is that we shall be represented by some one who rightly understands Australian sentiment-by some one who appreciates our freedom, rather than some one who has been used to bowing and scraping to others in older than demonstrate to the world that the Prime Minister no longer possesses the confidence of the people, and thereby frustrates his efforts to go abroad as the representative of the Commonwealth, it will have achieved some useful purpose. As to what the Country party may or may not say, I am not concerned. They are fairly intelligent men, and quite able to look after their own business. thing that has been said of us to-day. the Country party may at times be inconsistent, just as the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) was a little while ago. Gesticulating wildly, the honourable member said that the Labour party was always opposed to the Government, whereas in a speech made by him only last week he said, pointing to the Ministerial party, "" There is organized capital,"" and, pointing to the Labour party, "" There is organized labour. Both will be found voting side by side.'' To-. day he says that the Labour party is always opposed to the Government, irrespective of what its proposals may be; but the other day he said that the Labour party, in so far as the Tariff was concerned, would' be found voting with the Government, because it considered that the Tariff was for the benefit of the people. Tariff is a non-party question. question, hot of party, but of' principle. We fight for principle alone; we have our platform, and we stand for it and fight for it. We have been what Mr Deakin once described as "" the third eleven "" in this House. While in the past we have voted to put out a Government, and a week or two later have voted to put out another, we were actuated throughout by the one guiding principle.

It is entirely their own business. But my view is that such an attitude would do them no good. I am, therefore, exceedingly pleased that the Country party have taken up their present stand. There is room for only two parties in this House-the party which represents the workers, and the other party which represents the loafers. ask for a withdrawal of that offensive remark in which the honourable member suggests that our party represents the loafers of the country. son) -The honourable member for Balterms as to there being room in the House for only two parties, and made no reference to any particular party in the House at present as representing the "" loafers.""

Unfortunately, owing to the introduction of side issues at a general election, many people vote against their best interests. I recognise that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) before Wednesday next will have arrived at a satisfactory solution of this problem. capabilities as an underground engineer, I feel satisfied that before we meet on Wednesday next he will have obtained some form of assurance, on the strength of which he can proceed to England as the representative of Australia. member quite sure that we shall meet on Wednesday? I should like this crisis to be brought to a head at once. I should like the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to be defeated and another party given an opportunity to govern the country. I realize that it is essential to have a representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference in June next; and with the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) I take exception to the manner in which the Prime Minister has used that Conference for party political purpose's-purel y to strengthen his party and to keep his Government in power. I would remind the House that if a crisis occurs on Wednesday next, and results in the resignation of the present Prime Minister, there will be nothing to prevent either the Country party or the Labour party taking office and the new Prime Minister sailing in the near future for England. The new Prime Minister, whoever he might be, would be a better representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference than the present Leader of the Government. rather remarkable that the time of the House should be taken up in discussing a motion of this kind. In view of the vote which was given against the Government yesterday, it is a mere waste of time for the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to ask the House to agree to a. motion for adjournment in order that the Cabinet may have an opportunity to consider their position. should have telegraphed his resignation to the Governor General last night. course open to the Government was to resign at once. There is no occasion for the House to adjourn to enable the GoKnowing his vernment to consider what action they shall take. Their chief anxiety it seems to me is to arrive at ways and means of avoiding their removal from office.

The. attitude taken up by the Country party towards the Government is clearly set out in a leading article published in this'morning's issue of the Age, in which it is saidTPho action which led to the contemptible anti-climax came from Mr Jowett,. a member of the Country party who votes with the Government, and often candidly speaks in its favour. In this respect he differs from moat of the other members of his party, who roundly attack the Government, and even vote against it when it is safe, but are extraordinarily carecity to say that the members of that party ful when there is a suggestion of danger. That is the attitude of the Country party. If there is any possibility of the Government being defeated, they take fine care to see that some members of the party will voto with the Government. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) was quite sincere when to-day he nodded assent to the suggestion of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that, in submitting his motion yesterday, he had no intention of harming the' Government. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) admitted that it was not the intention of the members of the Country party to take a vote on the motion for adjournment yesterday, and that it was taken only because, the Government did not have a sufficient nnmber of their supporters put up to talk the motion out. To-day, he told lis that the members of the Country party were desirous of taking a vote on the question. If they were, how could the Leader, of that party, after a meeting of the party, whieb lasted for several hours,, make a statement to the representatives of the press that the fact that a vote on the motion' was taken was due to the fault of the Government in not having put up speakers to prevent it? I listened attentively to the speeeh of the political battle cry, the necessity that he [305] honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) to-day. He made one of his usual vicious attacks upon his opponents. Those who know the honourable member as I do know that he has If the Country party always been particularly vicious in attacking an opponent. member use the word "" betray ? "" If they do, they will should be a better judge of a betrayer. I can remember a time when the honourable member was an opponent of the Labour party, and when no one was more bitter than he against that party. He aftorwards became a member of the Labour party, and when he was managing director of the Australian Worker there was no more bitter and vindictive critic of the capitalistic class than the honourable member was. He has changed liis political coat on many occasions, and to-day he has made a bitteT attack upon the Labour party, and has had the^audaare not very much concerned about the ""White Australia policy. He has said that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) did not accurately put the position when he insisted that the Prime Minister had handed over the question of a White Australia to the League of Nations. But the statement made by the honourable member for West Sydney is absolutely true in every particular, as every member of this House must know. The honourable member for Illawarra stated that he secured for us the right to make the same laws for the territory over which we have been given a Mandate as we have to make laws for* Australia itself. If the Prime Minister handed over to the League of Nations, as ""he did, the right to interfere with Australian domestic legislation in respect to the law dealing with immigration, that was certainly handing over to the League the right to deal with the White Australia policy. The League of Nations bas now the right to interfere with our immigration laws, and it has the same right to interfere with immigration legislation in respect of the mandated territories.
