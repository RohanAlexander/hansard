I am major headaches for the industry and the reminded of the shadow Treasurer's response Australian public at the time, the Howard to the government's Mid-Year Economic and government hammered away at the tax Fiscal Outlook last year, in which he made a treatment of superannuation until the number of ridiculous statements suggesting industry simply gave up.

No, this was a government desperate about $8 billion in increased taxes targeting to sweep up any cash out of the economy people saving for their retirement. that it could to fund its flagrant expenditure.

This is something that is Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:24): hard to understand. Superannuation is a Labor Party policy This is a very partisan motion, lauding through and through. The Labor Party is the Labor for establishing the superannuation party that introduced universal guarantee in the first place. However, the superannuation and it is the party that will premises of most of the arguments of the protect superannuation. It was a Labor member for Greenway really do not stack up government that introduced the compulsory when you look at them-the increase in superannuation guarantee and it is a Labor compulsory superannuation is not supported government that is now reforming super to by her own government's Henry taxation ensure the retirement savings of Australian review, the things that this government has workers are better protected. Labor's done in raising $8 billion in extra taxes off commitment has always been to make sure people saving for our own retirement and the that all Australians have a fair, regulated removal of the system of incentives. The superannuation industry. Labor has always only system of government policy that has been a champion of compulsory any chance of working is incentivising superannuation because it provides a people to make their own voluntary significant source of savings that is contributions for their retirement.

It is in our money for people to retire on. That is really national interest to encourage more Australians to save more for their retirement income of just over $40,000. As women live and to understand how their superannuation longer than men, they actually need more works. That is particularly important: super, but the statistical evidence is clear: Australians need to understand how there is a discrepancy between what men can superannuation works. access compared to what women can access. This motion highlights the importance of I have seen this all too often in my own Labor's increase to the superannuation electorate. I have seen the reality of what this guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, means for women and super. I gave a speech an increase that will benefit 8.4 million last week on International Women's Day, in Australians. Overall, Labor's historic super which I focused on housing for older reforms will lift retirement savings by $85 women.

So there is an absolute explosion in with spectrum for analogue broadcasting. the quantity of data being sent back and forth Accordingly, you can pack the services in over mobile phone networks and that is together more efficiently across the expected to continue at rates which are spectrum. almost incomprehensible. Accordingly the In 2015 the analog broadcasting services allocation of new spectrum to support these around the nation are due to be switched off. services is absolutely critical for both Of course, in some areas the switch-off has economic and social reasons. Both Telstra already occurred, but by 2015 it will have and Optus have already launched initial 4G occurred around Australia, including in the services on their existing spectrum but the major metropolitan areas. Once we get to mobile carriers need more spectrum for the that point, then we can have what is known, enormous volumes which are expected as attractively, as 'the restack'. This is where all services continue to grow. This means that it of the spectrum which is presently used for is critical to get the policy settings right for television broadcasting is crunched down to the auction of spectrum which is one end of the existing spectrum block, forthcoming, and anything which blocks this taking advantage of the fact, as I previously application were not modified, apply to the mentioned, that when you are broadcasting new activities of the mobile phone only in digital you can be much more companies and their customers should data efficient in your use of spectrum.

We have seen a outcomes in the mobile data market will be series of very grave errors made in the public very, very adversely affected. This is a policy process which has been carried out by terrible piece of policy for a government that this government to give effect to the says it wants to encourage broadband reallocation of the digital dividend spectrum. services. It is a piece of policy which tends For example, the process of setting an to ignore the real reason that spectrum unprecedentedly high reserve price for the auctions are now widely used in most spectrum auction of $1.36 per megahertz per advanced economies as the means of head of population is likely to have very allocating the scarce public resource of radio adverse effects as to the development of a frequency spectrum. The principal purpose competitive market in these 4G services. We of using an auction is to allocate this scarce can see that the approach that the spectrum to the purpose which has the government is taking is well out of line with highest value to the community. Raising the approach being taken by governments in money is a secondary purpose, not a primary other countries. According to research by purpose. Unfortunately, this government Goldman Sachs, the average price being seems to have got that the wrong way charged across eight countries was 80c per around. The consequences look likely to be megahertz per head. That is a lot less than quite severe. Already, one potential bidder, $1.36 per megahertz per head of population. Vodafone, has said that it will not bid, and I might add that that 80c was arrived at another, Optus, says it regards the prices as through an auction process rather than being unreasonably high and is considering its set as the reserve price, rather than being set position. Bear in mind that the government as the floor price. So the government is itself has noted, in the regulatory impact going into this process setting an extremely statement it released in February 2012, that high price which may very well discourage 'the three incumbents'-namely Telstra, significant players from bidding. Optus and Vodafone-'are the entities most When you look at some other reference likely to participate in the auction'. points, it appears to be an unjustifiably high If one public policy error which has been number. It implies total proceeds from the made in relation to the proposed allocation of auction of nearly $2.8 billion. The highest this digital dividend spectrum is to set a very amount previously raised in an auction in high reserve price, another public policy Australia was a bit over $1.3 billion when error is the approach that the minister has the 1.8 gigahertz spectrum was auctioned in taken to the so-called competition limits. the year 2000, albeit for about two-thirds as These are the rules which limit the amount of much spectrum.

Petition: Tibet in support of those who seek a peaceful resolution in the crisis in Tibet. It is very distressing to hear that the human rights situation is driving a number of Tibetans to self-immolate. On 25 February, Tsesung Kyab, a farmer, and Sangdag, a monk, became the 106th and 107th Tibetans to set themselves on fire in protest against China's occupation of Tibet. A large majority of the self-immolations have taken place over the past six months, during the time of the leadership transition in China. Tibetans are desperate to send a strong message to China's new leaders. Unfortunately, China has failed to show willingness to constructively address Tibetan grievances or to hold themselves accountable for Tibetan rejection of their policies. China considers these protests as a threat and it has therefore increased its military and police presence and has closed Tibet to foreign tourists, media and diplomats. I seek leave today in this place to table a petition from the Australia Tibet Council, which has 2518 signatures and has been approved by the Petitions Standing Committee. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned Australian residents draws to the attention of the House of Representatives the deteriorating human rights conditions in Tibet. As of January 2013, 99 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in acts of protest against the Chinese government's policies which are undermining their cultural, religious and political rights. 82 of these self-immolations took place in 2012. The Chinese government has refused to address Tibetans' grievances. Instead it has intensified the use of force, spread misinformation about the situation on the ground and blocked telecommunications into and out of the affected areas. Tibet remains closed to international media and China remains unwilling to allow visits by Australian diplomatic representatives. We ask the House of Representatives to urge the Australian Government to:  Make a strong public statement of concern over the situation facing Tibetan people  Renew efforts to send the Ambassador In Beijing and a parliamentary delegation to areas affected by the protests and urge China to allow foreign journalists unfettered access to all Tibetan areas  Join other concerned countries In an intergovernmental forum dedicated to building stronger International pressure on China to address the crisis in Tibet from 2,518 citizens Advocacy Project, which is designed to connect Australia's Tibetans with their elected representatives.

Tibet Page Electorate: dirtgirlworld Ms SAFFIN (Page-Government Whip) (10:33): I would like to associate myself with the remarks and comments from the honourable member for Leichhardt and add that there is huge support in this place across the parties for the contribution that the honourable member gave. A week ago, Sunday, in my electorate of Page in Yamba, Jill Bradshaw and a group of committed people who are friends of volunteering for Tibet held an event at their place with an art show and a whole range of works to bring attention to the plight of the human rights suffering that is ongoing and seems to be systemic in Tibet. It is something that is intolerable in 2013, and we are right to speak up and speak out on that particular issue. I would also like to talk about something else that has happened in my electorate. Some people here, I am sure, would know about the ABC TV series for children, dirtgirlworldvery popular, particularly with the young ones, but I think parents like to watch it too. I can see a few parents smiling, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh. The creators of dirtgirlworld, Cate McQuillen and Hewey Eustace, live in my electorate at Whiporie. They beavered away for years and made this program hugely successful. Just recently, on 25 February, they were nominated for the International Digital Emmy Award for an Aussie company. That is pretty good. It is pretty up there. They live-and I have the Google map here of where they live-on the Summerland Way, halfway between Casino and Grafton. Whiporie is my pit stop as I drive around my electorate. With dirtgirlworld they make a connection with kids. It is an Australian-created international kids TV show, and it comes from my electorate. So, dirtgirlworld-and these are words that come from Cate and Hewey-'Dig it all.' The digital bits come from mememe productions. With the support of Screen Australia, they have been nominated in the kids and youth Digital Emmy category, to be announced in April, and it will be showcased on the MIPCube.

He has gone as far as to make quotes and then to say clearly that that is what Mr Abbott was referring to. The made-up quotes are an absolute misrepresentation and totally inaccurate. These fabrications show the extent that Mr Cheeseman and the Labor Party will go to to peddle their dishonesty about the coalition's position. We remember that they have form on this. At the last election the Labor Party said that the coalition's announced policy to cut the Green Car Innovation Fund by just under $300 million would hurt Geelong. But what happened? After the election the Labor Party itself-as soon as the election was out of the way-cut around $850 million remaining in the fund and axed the fund altogether. What is worse, adding to this, their broken promises to the car industryafter the election-were $1.4 billion, and of course the mother of all broken promises, the carbon tax, is going to cut $460 million out of the auto sector. Under Labor we have lost one manufacturing job every 23 minutes. It is no wonder that even Ian Jones, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union Vehicle Division national secretary, said in the past that Julia Gillard 'does not understand manufacturing's importance to the economy'. The Prime Minister's former senior adviser Nick Reece belled the cat in an opinion piece recently, saying that Ford would close 'its local manufacturing operations in 2016'. The Labor Party is ignoring the plight of manufacturing, of the auto sector, and what does Mr Cheeseman say when confronted with job losses at Ford after the government gave a behindthe-door closed deal of $34 million to Ford? The Prime Minister said it would create 300 new jobs. A month after the last instalment was given to Ford, 330 Ford workers were sacked, and all Mr Cheeseman could say is, 'Ford needed to make adjustments to its workforce depending on sales, and that is entirely appropriate.' Come clean, Mr Cheeseman, about Labor's damage to the auto sector and apologise to Mr Abbott. (Time expired) World's Greatest Shave Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (10:39): I rise to mention some of the outstanding fundraising efforts of the Greenway community in recent days, specifically the World's Greatest Shave, and also to mention this government's commitment to health care in west and north-west Sydney. On Friday night I joined a huge crowd at the Riverstone Bowling Club in my electorate to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. The large turnout highlighted the generosity of the Riverstone community. I would particularly like to praise the efforts of Ryan Schneider, a year 6 student at St John's Primary, Riverstone, whom I was pleased to sponsor and support along with his family and friends, on Friday night. Ryan raised $850 for cancer research and received a brand-new buzz cut. Thanks to Ryan's fundraising efforts, the laboratory costs of a PhD student researching blood cancer can be covered for three weeks. This is an outstanding contribution and is extremely important when you consider 31 Australians will be given the devastating news that they have leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma or a related blood disorder every day. That's more than 11,500 people this year. I also want to acknowledge the scores of other locals who have or will be participating in some Great Shaves, including the Lalor Park community, who organised a similar event on Saturday. Although survival rates are improving, blood cancers like these are the second biggest cause of cancer death in Australia. The World's Greatest Shave raises about half the money the Leukaemia Foundation needs to fund its important work providing practical and emotional support to people with blood cancer as well as investing millions in research. With the population of the north-west growth centre expected to grow from 300,000 to half a million in the next five to 10 years, the healthcare sector must respond accordingly, and this government is committed to doing this. The unprecedented investment in health care and health services from this government will allow people in my electorate greater access to primary care and take the strain off our public hospitals. Since 2010 this government has invested heavily in my electorate, including more hospital beds and investments in elective surgery at Blacktown Hospital, $17.6 million for the Blacktown Clinical School, $15 million for the Blacktown GP superclinic, more GP registrations, massive investment in primary care infrastructure grants and the Healthy Communities Initiative. But these are, of course, in response to the huge regional challenges that we face and will continue to face in west and north-west Sydney. Through the inspirational efforts of people like Ryan and the rest of the Riverstone community who took part in the World's Greatest Shave last Friday night, thousands of dollars are going to the Leukaemia Foundation to continue to fund blood cancer research, and provide free services to support Australian families, and for that they should all be recognised. Central Queensland University and Central Queensland Institute of TAFE Merger Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (10:42): I rise today to speak in support of the proposed merger between the Central Queensland University and the Central Queensland Institute of TAFE. This proposal has been on the negotiating table for approximately three years now. It is a plan that would see Central Queensland provided with a depth and quality of educational services not yet seen in the region. It will be the first dual-sector tertiary institution in Queensland. The merger agreement would guarantee funding for vocational education and training and include the handover of 12 TAFE campuses. We know that, under the previous minister for tertiary education, negotiations had slowed down a bit. However, I welcome reports that the new Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, the Hon. Chris Bowen, is far more supportive of the merger, and I applaud him for that stance. This merger is a plan that enjoys support from many different stakeholders in Central Queensland and across Queensland as a whole. The CQ University has been incredibly persistent in keeping this proposal alive and should be congratulated for their efforts and continuing insistence that we bring this to a head as soon as possible. Some $74 million in federal government funding has been pledged to ensure the merger can take place. I urge Minister Bowen to finalise this agreement with the university as soon as possible to prevent any further delay in beginning the process. The process will take some time to achieve, and the sooner we get approval the sooner we can get on with bringing this all to an end. We know that Central Queensland has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years and that our education networks need to adapt to meet the changing needs of the region. The region is undergoing huge developments with gas exploration and exportation and has a thriving coal industry and aluminium industry, and of course we have agricultural needs in the area also. AgainI encourage all parties, including the Queensland state government, to pull out all the stops and get this deal done. Palestine in my electorate of Moreton and their connection, especially, to the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network-APAN. I am proud to say that a few Saturday nights ago Moreton hosted a sell-out APAN fundraising dinner at Michael's Oriental Restaurant, where the joint chairs of the Federal Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, Maria Vamvakinou, the member for Calwell, and Susan Ley, the member for Farrer, both spoke very well about recent efforts and challenges facing Palestine. WhilstI was the first person to pay for this fundraising dinner, unfortunately at the last minute circumstances conspired such that I could not be there on the night, but I am reliably informed by the many friends and supporters who did attend that the master of ceremonies, Mr Anas Abdalla, introduced Dr Halim Rane, who spoke about his latest book on Australian-Israeli-Palestine foreign policy. I know Dr Rane well, for nearly 10 years, back before he obtained his PhD at Griffith University under Mohammed Abdullah. One of the other members of the APAN executive, Mr David Forde, also spoke on the role of APAN and the need for greater political advocacy on behalf of Palestinians. I have also known Mr Forde for over a decade-and I say happy St Patrick's Day to him because he is Irish; in fact he was with the Irish Army as a peacekeeper in the Middle East. He is also a very active member of the Sunnybank RSL and APAN. APAN was formed in May 2011 to provide a national voice for Australians who are concerned about ongoing human rights abuses and occupation issues endured by Palestinians, along with the continuing effects of dispossession and displacement suffered by Palestinian refugees. It is a broad range of people and I particularly mention Wendy Turner, who I have known for over a decade as well. She used to work for my campaign manager Karen Struthers. APAN is a diverse alliance of religious leaders, unions, academics, lawyers, former politicians, Palestinians, Jewish people, peace groups and diplomats and many others. APAN seeks a more balanced and principled approach from the Australian government in its policies towards the Israel-Palestinian conflict. It seeks a more active role for Australia in encouraging all interested parties to bring about a just and lasting negotiated settlement based on UN resolutions and international norms. In April last year, under the leadership of the President of the Senate John Hogg, I was lucky enough to visit some of the Palestinian territories. Sadly, we did not go to Gaza, and it would have been good to have gone to Beersheba because we were around there on ANZAC Day, but I did see the dividing wall and saw how it affects communities. APAN offers a voice for all Australians of goodwill who wish to express their opposition to the continuation of the current situation. I recently tabled a petition in parliament signed by over 1,500 people from the south side, noting their concerns about the Palestinian people and asking for the UN to grant their observer status, which thankfully has happened. (Time expired) Bonner Electorate: Mackenzie State Campus of the House one of the groundbreaking schools within my electorate of Bonner, the Mackenzie State Campus, which celebrated its official opening on 14 March this year.

183,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (10:48,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to bring to the attentiondisabilities. The adoption of the new campus model provides the opportunity for student leadership through supporting students with disabilities, whilst breaking down stereotypes and prejudices around these disabilities. During a recent visit to the Mackenzie State Campus, I was very impressed with the campus's ability to retain two separate schools, ensuring the preservation of specialised staff skills, whilst enjoying the economy of scale savings from resource and facility sharing, bulk purchasing, combined professional training and labour cost savings. The classrooms and leisure areas have also been designed to accommodate outside school hours care to assist families in supporting their children with special needs. I found that the full disability access on the campus ensures whole of life utilisation of the facility by a diverse range of students with a disability. Areas such as the tuckshop, library, oval, multipurpose courts and performing arts complex have full access to facilitate the involvement of people with a disability into all areas of education, just one of the many strengths of this dual-purpose campus. All in this chamber know that the system of support for Australians with a disability is broken. If you are born with a disability or acquire a disability later in life, you can generally be expected to wait for any form of assistance, resulting in many who are left without the support that they need. I believe that individuals should have the right to pick their support, aids and equipment and have the service providers of their choice. This, as we know, is the vision of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I am proud to say that the Mackenzie State Campus has been designed and built with this in mind. One of its core objectives is to integrate special-needs children into the community through empowerment with education. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the driving forces behind this fantastic development, Terry Forster and Shirley Rimon, without whom this level of success would never have been achieved. I am truly delighted to have such a wonderful school community in my electorate of Bonner, and I wish to congratulate all involved on this wonderful achievement of their official school opening. I hope that many other schools follow Mackenzie State Campus's lead in integrating students from all walks of life. Victorian Technical and Further Education Sector Corio Electorate: Gordon Institute of Technical and Further Education Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (10:51): As one of his first acts as the new Victorian Premier, Denis Napthine last week announced that he would provide the state's TAFE sector with $200 million over four years. Some media reporting described this announcement as the partial reversal of what the Victorian Liberals cut from the TAFE sector last year. This announcement is not a reversal. Fifty million dollars a year does not come close to covering almost $300 million a year. And, if the Premier thinks it will fix the mess created when his government slashed $290 million a year from the TAFE sector, he is mistaken. At the Gordon Institute of TAFE, in Geelong, the jobs of 90 staff have already been lost, nearly 30 courses discontinued and students left in limbo part way through their studies or with the courses they had hoped to start no longer available. The Victorian Liberals have",213,Constituency Statements
184,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs andmade a hash of this issue, but the funding they are proposing for innovation and structural reform will not make up for the cutbacks to operational funding. As Victorian Labor leader Daniel Andrews said last week, this is nothing more than an incentive scheme to force TAFEs into financially independent models while allowing the government to close and sell off campuses. The public should be very concerned about the Victorian Liberal government's management of the TAFE sector. Last year, the Minister for Higher Education and Skills, Peter Hall, was reportedly deeply disappointed by the cuts his government was making. But last week there was no sign of those misgivings from Mr Hall, who jointly announced the Victorian Liberals' TAFE plan alongside his Premier. Australia's TAFE sector operates at the coalface of industry training, identifying areas where there are skills shortages and building skills across a range of industries. The TAFE sector also provides education and training opportunities for students from a range of backgrounds and with a range of educational needs. As a result of last year's funding cuts, many of the courses lost are in industry areas like hospitality and retail where women are highly represented. I have spoken before in this House about the value of the Gordon to Geelong and its region. The Gordon's history is very much embedded in the history of our city. It has been training and skilling our workforce for more than a century. It has responded to changing times and changing industry needs. Despite extremely difficult circumstances, it has continued to do that. It is to its great credit that the Gordon has worked extremely hard this year to offer new courses in the health and business sectors. That is an outcome that should be applauded. Through its policies, the Victorian government should not be attacking the Gordon but rather should be supporting the Gordon to do what it clearly does best: serving the needs of the Geelong community. Australian Macedonian Medical Society Macedonian Medical Society. The society was founded in August 2009 by Dr Zoran Becvarovski, Dr Nick Cvetkovski and Dr Goran Josifoski Stevans and was officially registered as an incorporated association in March 2010. The Australian Macedonian Medical Society is a growing organisation composed of enthusiastic medical and allied health professionals who are dedicated to the promotion and improvement of the health and well-being of the local community and, specifically, the particular needs of the Macedonian Australian community. The Australian Macedonian Medical Society actively seeks to promote and conduct continuing medical education and, amongst other things, to advocate on behalf of members and to contribute to community causes by fundraising. One example is the establishment of the Macedonian Cancer Research Award via the St George and Sutherland Medical Research Foundation to research prevalent cancer in Macedonian Australians. The St George and Sutherland Medical Research Foundation is an independent not-for-profit organisation which supports the work of the medical research community at St George and Sutherland hospitals, two of Australia's leading teaching hospitals. The society has clear objectives, which are to promote professional standards of its members; provide a forum for professional and social exchange amongst its members;",214,Constituency Statements

The society also contributes to deserving charitable causes and organisations and performs acts of good corporate citizenship. Furthermore, the society must be congratulated for the promotion of mutual understanding and liaising with other medical organisations. In order to help achieve these objectives, the society holds events and functions with the aim of raising proceeds for medical items, equipment, resources et cetera. It is a very active society and its members have great networking skills, which allow them to achieve the society's objectives. ClearlyI am not the only one who has discovered the work being conducted by the society. I note that, on Wednesday, 6 March 2012, the New South Wales parliament agreed to a motion recognising the work of the Australian Macedonian Medical Society, and I believe it would be worthy of this government to advance a similar motion. In conclusion, I congratulate the Australian Macedonian Medical Society on its support for medical research and the Gasnier Foundation and raising community funds towards such worthy causes. It is a reflection of the great things that those of Macedonian descent do in Australia. Burgess, Mrs Mavis Margaret Forestry) (10:56): Unfortunately and sadly, yesterday I learnt of the passing of a friend, a confidante, a supporter and a lady whom I called the Florence Nightingale of King Island, Mrs Mavis Margaret Burgess. Mavis was one of those unheralded, dedicated and inspiring people who devote themselves to family, friends and community without ever seeking recognition or reward. She was a wonderful friend and supporter to all who sought her help, love and expertise. There would be few people living in a remote regional community who have done more with and for their community than Mavis did for her beloved King Island. There are few aspects of life on King Island that Mavis did not positively contribute to. She was one of the most significant health professionals on the island from 1962, and her contribution to promoting the health and well-being of the community was enormous and very long term. Mavis literally nursed the island in all aspects of health from birth to death, and I know she had the gratitude and affection of her community for this untiring, professional and devoted service both in public and private health practices. She was also instrumental in developing and increasing the capacity of others to enhance and increase health service levels on the island in a whole range of services across the health spectrum. Mavis also worked as a child welfare officer with the department of community services as well as for the department of social security. She was a justice of the peace and acted as an honorary probation officer. As if that were not enough, she also contributed widely to community activities. Mavis was a 'doer'. She was a founding member of St John Ambulance, a volunteer of the island ambulance service, a foundation member of the famous King Island Imperial 20 footrace, secretary of the King Island Gun Club, member of her local fire brigade, member of Birds Australia and Tasmania, member of her local tennis association, associate member of the RSL and a community crisis support team volunteer-to list just some of the organisations Mavis contributed to. More recently, Mavis was one of the driving forces behind the creation, expansion and funding of Phoenix Community House, an umbrella organisation dedicated to community",215,Constituency Statements

In 1986 Mavis was honoured by her community by being appointed as the King Island Australia Day Citizen of the Year. Since that time she never tired in her endeavours on behalf of the community. I personally will miss Mavis very, very much, and I thank her on behalf of her region and her island for giving so much lovingly and being so loved in return. time for constituency statements has concluded. Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. define in legislation the common understanding in our community of marriage-that is, the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. The coalition continues to believe that the majority of the Australian community agree with that definition. This definition does not in any way seek to prevent or discourage people from entering into same-sex relationships but, rather, simply recognises marriage as one of the bedrock institutions of society, which is the basis for forming families and which is underpinned by tradition. The coalition will not support legislation that would alter the status of traditional marriage between a man and a woman. The coalition in the past supported the passage of the government's same-sex reform legislation on the condition that nothing in its terms affected the status and centrality of traditional marriage between a man and a woman. We believe it is important to send this strong signal about the special status of marriage. The coalition continues to remain committed to these principles and will not support future legislation that would allow samesex couples to marry in Australia. This is indeed a contentious issue but it is a contentious issue that is driven by a minority of the Australian population. The reality of the situation is simply this: that we are not all born the same. We are by our very nature possessing of personalities and physical traits. We are different, and it is up to good governance in our society to provide a framework for behaviour-a framework that broadly embraces what is acceptable on a day-to-day basis as being our culture. One of the things, as I have just said, is that we accept that marriage has a sanctity. It is different to other relationships. It is covered by law, and that law defines that marriage condition as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. If one wants to engage in a relationship that is not a relationship between a man and a woman, is not entered into voluntarily or is not for life then that relationship is not marriage. I for one, and the coalition at large, agrees that that is the situation and, no matter how hard we may wish it, those who are not a man and a woman-those who may be of the same sex in a relationship-cannot therefore at law refer to themselves as married. And why not? Because they are simply not a man and a woman.",216,Constituency Statements

188,Mr Haase (Durack) (11:00,"In 2004, the coalition amended the Marriage Act 1961 toThe sanctity of marriage that I speak of is such that when a couple court and marry, create a home and a loving environment, we hope that that will be rewarded with the production of children and those children will be brought up as members of our society. That is what we speak of when we speak of the sanctity of marriage, and that relationship, that union, ought to be respected at law by Australians. It is our culture. It is our law. It is a productive situation that is rational, that nurtures and provides the environment to nurture children and those children then become members of our society, responsible, law-abiding members of our society who will largely follow in the footsteps of their parents, we trust, and follow the laws of this country. I state again that the law of this country is that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life, and that law ought remain for time into the future. Equality Amendment Bill 2012, because I believe that all Australians, irrespective of their sexuality, are entitled to be treated equally. Marriage is one of those institutions that has evolved over time. Despite the protestations of some people suggesting that it has been frozen in time and handed down from Mount Sinai, the reality is that previous speakers are quoting from legislation that has only been around less than a decade. I approach this from a pretty basic point of view-that is, if people are committed to each other, if people are in love with each other, and wish to have society recognise that committed relationship, why should society not permit them to express that commitment via the institution of marriage? Obviously when it comes to religious institutions that is a different process, and the process of changing the views of religious institutions is something different. But we are a secular institution. We in parliament might start each day with a prayer, but we are a secular institution. Our Constitution provides for that. We also protect religions. Our Constitution provides for that. But we as a parliament must do what is best for all Australians, and how we can say to two people who are in love with each other that they cannot have a committed relationship recognised by an institution like parliament is beyond me. I should stress that this is not the No. 1 issue in the electorate of Moreton. There are costof-living issues, there are people concerned about employment, there are people concerned about making sure that their job is secure and there are people concerned about education, health and the like. I understand that, but I think we as a parliament have time to revisit this. I thank the member for Melbourne for reintroducing this legislation. He served on the committee that I chair which looked at this bill-a committee that had the greatest number of submissions in the history of Federation; a committee whose members had a broad range of views. I see in the chamber the member for Latrobe, who was also a part of that committee. The reality is that, if the member for Warringah agrees tomorrow to let the members of his 'free-thinking Liberal Party' have a vote and this legislation was passed, it would not change anything in terms of how I see my wife tomorrow. It would not change anything in terms of how I approach my family, school et cetera. But it would let people who love each other and who are committed to each other have the protections of an institutional arrangement that society has recognised for hundreds and hundreds of years as being a good thing. The reality is that society has changed. Once upon a time, and not that long ago, homosexuality was in the DSM-the book used by psychologists in terms of approaching it as a treatable disease. Things have changed. It used to be in the Criminal Code in Queensland.",217,Bills
189,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (11:05,"I am pleased to speak in support of the MarriageThings have changed, though there is still some discrimination in Queensland in terms of the age of consent for homosexuals compared to heterosexuals. The reality is that most of society has moved on and recognised that same-sex attracted people deserve all the same rights, the same treatment and the same respect as every other person. This piece of legislation is an important step to ensuring that. I would urge those opposite not to just stand up and say, 'I care' or 'I would if I could'. You can. If those opposite believe this then, unlike the people in the Labor Party, who are bound by our rules that say we cannot go against the directions of the Labor Party unless we wish to become an independent, they can stand up and protest and say, 'I would support it.' But caring is doing; caring with words is hollow. You need to show how you care by how you vote. SoI will be interested to see if we are allowed to see the member for Wentworth and some of those other more liberal-thinking members of the coalition support this piece of sensible legislation. I urge them to so do. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (11:10): Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak for 10 minutes in this debate on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012. Leave granted. Ms O'DWYER: Social attitudes are constantly and rapidly evolving-perhaps nowhere faster than in the area of marriage and relationships. But I am not sure that they are moving at such a pace as to justify the reintroduction of this bill, coming as it does only six months after this place last considered the issue. That said, debate on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill was guillotined with unseemly haste. So it is opportune for me to make some small remarks on the issue now. In a volatile and rapidly changing world, committed, long-term monogamous relationships play a critical role in providing stability to couples and, in turn, their families and communities. Once this was provided almost exclusively through the institution of marriage but, over time, de facto or common-law relationships have become commonplace. The law views these in the same way as marriage, with the same rights, responsibilities and protections. However, only the institution of marriage provides for public declaration and promises sanctioned by the state. This, and society's long standing appreciation of it and its solemnness, gives marriage its special place and power in our society. As with many areas of social change, this special place means we should tread warily. Change should be incremental rather than disruptive. Change should be well flagged, and sanctioned by the people, and it should be the subject of broad community consensus. Fifty per cent plus one is not enough. Amongst other things, that means that, in this area, even more than in all other areas, we should abide by our commitments to the electorate. In that regard, the coalition made a commitment before the last election that it would not support a change to the Marriage Act, and we continue to honour that commitment. In due course, I expect our policy on this area to evolve in step with society's views, and those views are complex. I have been moved by many of the discussions I have had with people from both sides of this debate. I reject absolutely the notion that those who favour the status quo are homophobic or ignorant. With limited exceptions, those whom I have met have presented cogent and considered arguments-sometimes, but not always, predicated on strong religious views. Equally, I reject absolutely the notion that those who favour change are radicals. I have met many people and the families of people in same-sex relationships who thoughtfully and powerfully presented their views and experience. For completeness, I should record that I have met some and received letters from some on both sides of the debate whose intolerance of views different from their own I found wholly unpersuasive and, frankly, ugly. To those people I would say: you do significant damage to the cause you seek to support. Personally, I am comfortable with the idea of same-sex marriage. I am comfortable with it, for so many of the excellent reasons outlined by my colleague the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull MP in his Kirby oration last year. I do not propose to go through each one in turn, given the limited time available, but I do wish to make this point: families are the bedrock of our society. I stated this in my first speech three years ago, just as I also stated that families come in all shapes and sizes. I believe that changing the Marriage Act by extending the definition to include same-sex couples will not lessen the status of families. On the contrary, I think that it will strengthen it by building stronger bonds of commitment between two people regardless of gender and sexual orientation. There will be some people in my own family who will be disappointed with my personal position on the subject, because they have a sincere view that marriage is an institution between a man and woman. There will be others in my family, though, whose own ability to marry is predicated on such a change. In the end public life demands that we be true to ourselves and that we express our views in an honest and open manner no matter what the cost. The coalition party room has not yet debated what our commitment will be on this issue in the upcoming election. There is one thing though on which there would be universal agreement: it is that with any change religious institutions such as churches, synagogues or mosques should not be forced by law to conduct same-sex marriages just as they are not forced to marry anyone today. Certainly this is my view. Naturally, this also highlights the distinction between the civil and religious institution of marriage and leads to the question of civil unions. Civil unions represent gradual and incremental change in a highly charged area. They facilitate statutory recognition of enduring relationships which do not currently exist at a federal level. There is clear broad based support for them. They would allow the community to take stock, build further community consensus and then consider whether to move to samesex marriage just as it has taken place recently in the United Kingdom and almost all other countries that have legislated for same-sex marriage. Unfortunately, this issue has been hijacked by one political party that prefers to use the issue as a political weapon to divide the community rather than achieve any real progress or outcomes. Hence we stand here today debating a bill that the parliament has already addressed rather than taking some steps forward. I think that is a shame. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (11:16): I am pleased to be able to make a contribution once again on the topic of marriage equality. It is a source of regret for me and I know for many people in my community of La Trobe who were unable to see success in the vote on the question of marriage equality which occurred earlier in this term; however, needless to say, it does not change the expectations I had when I last spoke on this issue, and those are that, ultimately, we will see change in this area just as we have seen substantial change in relation to marriage and the status of people within the institution of marriage over the previous decades. It is important to recall that fact, because some in this debate will articulate the case that marriage has been unchanging and remained cast in stone for centuries. We only have to look at the last 100 years to see that marriage has changed considerably for women and Indigenous Australians. Australia agreed to be bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980 and, in doing so, it recognised the importance of equality before the law and principles of nondiscrimination-and those are principles which those on this side of the chamber hold very dear. Many members of the Labor Party have advocated for reform to reflect principles of nondiscrimination in a range of legislative means. After winning the 2007 federal election, Labor moved very swiftly to amend some 85 or so Commonwealth laws to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, and it was entirely appropriate that we did so. Accordingly, it has been a source of great pride to me to see many members of the Labor Party campaigning around the issue of marriage equality. In that context, I would like to put on record my commendation for all those in Rainbow Labor who have endeavoured to progress this debate as far as they could during this term. I do not think that they will end their efforts. I said at the outset that this is simply one next stage in a long line of very important changes which have related to marriage and the status of married people in Australian society. I reflected on the role of women in marriage and their circumstances, and the role of Indigenous people and their capacity to seek to be married. Members may not be aware that, although women gained the right to vote in 1902, they could still lose their Australian nationality when they married a non-Australian national even as late as the 1940s. Before 1966, members will recall that many women had to resign from Public Service positions upon getting married. Though those things remained part of our system of law, at that time Australian society and Australian parliaments changed their views on those issues. Accordingly, I think there is the case and the capacity for change now in relation to the question of marriage equality for same-sex couples. As I also reflected at the beginning of my remarks, Indigenous Australians did not necessarily have the right to marry a person of their own choosing as late as 1959. But that kind of discriminatory treatment in marriage changed after considerable struggle and considerable social change, including the 1967 referendum campaign. These are some of the changes that have occurred in relation to marriage. Indeed, we only have to reflect on the period around 1975 when we still had a fault-based system of divorce in this country. I know that some in this place may still want that to be the case, and I certainly disagree with that. And, fortunately, I know that many others also disagreed, with the effect that in 1975 we saw a much more humane approach to the already difficult decision to end a marriage. So it is not the case, despite the suggestions of others in this place to the contrary, that marriage and all of the regulatory arrangements around it have remained fixed in stone. Accordingly, I think-as I thought in the earlier debate on marriage equality in this termthat there is a case for change, that change is inevitable, and I hope to see it in the next few years. Debate adjourned. Costed Policies Debate resumed on the motion by Dr Leigh: That this House: (1) Notes that: (a) a bipartisan parliamentary report recommended the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is now operational having passed Parliament with bipartisan support; (b) the Australian people deserve a proper policy debate in 2013, with all parties presenting properly costed policies; and (c) the updated information contained in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook will not affect the cost of most policies, and therefore release of fully costed policies should not be delayed until then; and (2) calls on all parties to have their policies costed consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty, and release them to the Australian people in enough time to have a well-informed debate. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (11:21): Transparent, costed policies are fundamental to trust, to honesty and to having a good public debate. The Parliamentary Budget Office was created in this spirit. It was created following a bipartisan parliamentary report agreed to by members from both sides of the House, including the member for Higgins, who is here in the chamber, and Senator Joyce. The coalition support for the Parliamentary Budget Office, however, did not extend beyond that bipartisan report. By the time that the Parliamentary Budget Office came to be considered by parliament it had become apparent that the coalition's costings hole was far bigger than had been thought at the time the report was written. The coalition then stepped back from their support for the Parliamentary Budget Office. This is a pity for Australian politics in general. Australian politics has always depended on a robust opposition which presents alternative ideas for the governance of Australia. That is critical to the operation of our great democracy. The coalition's tepid attitude to the Parliamentary Budget Office and the increasing suggestions that they will not place their costings before it, is deeply concerning to me and I think to many Australians regardless of their political views. I often meet people in my electorate who are Liberal Party voters-who have voted for the Liberal Party all their life and intend to do so at the next election-but they still say to me, 'I wish they would be a bit clearer about what they want to do; I wish they would be a bit clearer about their policies.' The Labor Party in government have put in place significant savings. Since the global financial crisis, all of our new spending has been offset by savings. We will now spend less than 24 per cent of GDP over the forward estimates-something not achieved since the 1980s. This $154 billion of savings over five budgets has not been easy to achieve. To take one example: when we said that the baby bonus would be reduced from $5,000 to $3,000 for second and subsequent children, the member for North Sydney compared it to the one-child policy. When we have made targeted saves, such as getting rid of the outdated dependent spouse tax offset-a measure that deterred secondary earners from working-we have been attacked by those opposite. The opposition have, as a result of saying yes to every special interest but saying no to sensible revenue measures, got themselves into a substantial revenue crater. As a result, for example, of saying that they will repeal the price on carbon and repeal the minerals resource rent tax, they have a costings gap of around $70 billion. That is not my figure. Anyone who thinks that this figure is a Labor figure simply needs to go to the transcript of Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, on Sunrise on 12 August 2011. That is where the $70 billion figure comes from. Seventy billion dollars is equivalent to stopping Medicare for four years or stopping the pension for two years. It is a huge amount of money. Where will the opposition get that from? We know a few things about what they will do. They have said they will get rid of the schoolkids bonus, a measure which is designed to help families with children at the times of the year when they have those education expenses. We know that they are going to scrap income tax cuts for around seven million Australians. Recently the member for North Sydney has tried to hide that. He carried out a doorstep with the Liberal candidate for Parramatta, who said that the benefit of the tax cuts would be $3 a week. But that is a figure that applies to a tiny fraction of those eligible. For the vast majority of Australian taxpayers, their benefit from these tax cuts-and the pain that they will endure if the coalition is to increase income taxes on seven million hard working Australians-will be much bigger. Most receive at least $300 a year. Many part-time workers receive up to $600. The member for North Sydney was so embarrassed by that that he edited his own transcript to remove the reference to a $3 a week tax cut. We know too that the Liberal Party would, if it were to attain office, establish a commission of audit. That is a well-worn Liberal tactic, used on attaining office by Premier Newman, Premier Baillieu, as he then was, and Premier O'Farrell. It is simply a way of failing to come clean with the Australian people about what you will do. The opposition frequently say that they have had their policies costed. The member for Goldstein, Andrew Robb, will frequently say that he has policies in his desk drawer which have covers on them-it's great that they've designed those covers; I'm very happy about that!-and that they have been costed. But it is not clear by whom those policies have been costed. Have they been costed, as they were at the last federal election, by a team of dodgy accountants who were subsequently fined for saying that they had carried out an audit when in fact they had not? Have they been costed by a catering company such as the catering company that did costings for Scott Morrison on immigration? We know that the coalition have costed policies, but we also know that those policies are sitting in a desk drawer. You have to ask yourself: if these policies were so good for the Australian people, would they be sitting in the member for Goldstein's top drawer or would they be in the full glare of public scrutiny? I think Australian families know the answer. We have some hints as to what the opposition would do from their statements on the goods and services tax. The opposition have said they are going to provide a larger share of GST to some states, which inevitably means they will have to provide a smaller share to others. So my colleagues in Tasmania and South Australia have raised concerns about the impact on their share of GST revenues if the opposition were to attain government. We know also something about what the opposition might do as a result of two recent reports by Australia's two leading right-wing think tanks. The Institute of Public Affairs has put out a list, and Alan Moran of the IPA was quoted in the Australian on 16 March 2013 as saying: Some items have been discussed with Coalition politicians, many of whom are in the agreement with the principles against which list has been developed. Those cuts include cancelling the first stage of the NDIS and abolishing the FaHCSIA division implementing the NDIS; abolishing Fair Work Australia and Safe Work Australia; cutting the general research budget by 40 per cent; cutting all Commonwealth housing programs; cutting all foreign aid, excluding emergency aid; abolishing the agriculture, forestry and fisheries programs; and privatising the ABC. They sound like savage cuts to me, but according to Senator Wong they amount to only $23.5 billion, so they are less than half of what the opposition would have to make in order to fill its costings gap. Similarly savage cuts have been put forward by the Centre for Independent Studies. The Centre for Independent Studies have a TARGET30 report, suggesting that Commonwealth, state and local government spending should not amount to more than 30 per cent of GDP. That means significant decreases in the tax share for the Commonwealth government. The report is honest enough to note that Australia is now the third-lowest spending country in the OECD. Thirty per cent would make us the lowest spending government in the OECD. How would the Centre for Independent Studies reduce our expenditure? They would do so by cutting back on health, education and welfare. The Centre for Independent Studies want insurance vouchers in our healthcare system rather than the world-beating Medicare system. They want cutbacks to compulsory superannuation. They want to abolish family tax benefit part B and they want to stop the Gonski reforms. These are significant cuts. Meanwhile, you have the Leader of the Opposition, with his DLP tendencies, going about the place talking about what he will spend. He said at a Brookvale Oval function, for example, that he wants to redevelop Brookvale Oval at a cost of $70 million. No-one knows where this money will come from. I hope that the Parliamentary Budget Office can contribute to a more transparent and open costings debate in Australia. Australians deserve no less. parliament regularly about evidence-based policy and having academic debate, and who is often fond of quoting Leon Lee on television programs-to the extent where some of his colleagues have Leon Lee bingo going on in their offices-would launch a savage attack on think tanks in Australia for having ideas and for discussing policy. Can you imagine people having different ideas to those of the Labor Party? I know we have a bill before the parliament this week which will talk about cutting down any debate in newspapers-exactly what the Labor Party like; the thought police-we now have the academic thought police over there. Here he is: the first person ever in Australian political history to be appointed to an opposition position from government. Can you imagine? They have made him an opposition waste-watch spokesman. Can you believe it? How embarrassing for the poor member for Fraser. He cannot get on the government front bench, so he is already on the opposition front bench from government. Now work that out. It is a bit the same as trying to work out this motion. This motion is a bit of a joke being played by the Labor Party because if you look at the first point:",218,Bills
190,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11:32,"I find it fascinating that a man who seeks to lecture the(1) notes that: (a) a bipartisan parliamentary report recommended the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is now operational having passed Parliament … That is true. Of course, it was policy announced by the member for Wentworth when he was the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply speech in 2009. We did not hear that from the member for Fraser. We missed that on the way through his speech. It was actually the member for Wentworth's idea in the first place that we have a Parliamentary Budget Office, and so we do support a Parliamentary Budget Office. We support a Parliamentary Budget Office particularly because when each year you have a budget which says you are going to have a deficit-that is a word you guys in government are familiar with-which is a certain amount, but the final budget figures come out the deficit is far more than what was expected, we are looking for some independent costing numbers and analysis of the budget, because what we are seeing from the Labor government is nowhere near the true state of the Australian budget on a rolling basis Therefore, we are suspicious of and sceptical about the Labor projections in their budget. We know they are politicised. We know that there is influence put on the Treasury to change figures, to ensure that the budget looks more rosy than it actually is, and we know that the best way to ensure we get updated figures is to wait for the PEFO statement prior to the election. That takes me to point (2) of the member for Fraser's motion, which: … calls on all parties to have their policies costed consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty, and release them to the Australian people in enough time to have a well-informed debate. That is an interesting point. So let us have a look at the Labor Party record on releasing of costings before the election campaigns. In 2004, when Mr Latham was the leader of the Labor Party-do you remember Mr Latham? I remember Mr Latham. I loved watching Mr Latham. In fact, he wrote a very good essay about the Labor Party last week. I really enjoyed it and I think he was spot-on. It was an interesting analysis by Mr Latham. He does have some very interesting insights into those on the other side. When he was the leader of the Labor Party in 2004 the ALP released their costings on Thursday, 7 October 2004. When was the election in 2004? It was on 9 Octoberwithin 48 hours. That was what we needed! So much for calls on the parties to have their policies costed consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty and release them to the Australian people in enough time for a well-informed debate! Okay, fair enough-that was 10 years ago, and it was Mr Latham who was the leader at that point. We can forgive them for that. They would have learnt their lesson. The member for Fraser says we need a proper debate about costings. So, in 2007 when they were likely to win the election-they were in front in the opinion polls all year in 2007; we remember it well-when do you think they released their policy costings for that election? It is one you would be familiar with. An honourable member: Months in advance, surely? election was 24 November-within 24 hours! They even bettered Mr Latham's record! The member for Griffith, who of course they knifed in the back not long after he became the",224,Private Members Business
191,Mr Briggs,"Well, they released them on 23 November 2007. The election date for thatPrime Minister, released them within 24 hours, to give the Australian public the proper time to have a well-informed debate! If you think you are getting the smell of hypocrisy here, you would be right, because, in 2010, when they were actually even in government, when they had all the resources of government to prepare for the election campaign, when do you think they released their policy costings in that election campaign? On Friday, 20 August 2010. The election was 21 August 2010. So that was within 24 hours of the election, of people actually voting. The Labor Party and the member for Fraser think that is enough time to have a well-informed debate about policy costings. This is absolute hypocrisy. This is from a government who put a mining tax in, and booked up $12 billion of expenditure based on a tax which has received $120 million in revenue. They booked up $12 billion of expenditure, based on $120 million of revenue. And we want to have a debate about policy costings! What an embarrassing thing for the Labor Party to do. It is the greatest own goal in the history of Australian politics. Those on that side of parliament, who inherited a budget position of a $20 billion surplus in 2007, have turned that around to a $265 billion debt, with more to come, because we know that last week in parliament the Prime Minister and the Treasurer refused to rule out increasing the debt limit, and they want to have a debate about policy costings-with their record of releasing their policy costings within 24 hours of the election campaign! We also heard the member for Fraser talk about the latest scare campaign which has been run in South Australia and Tasmania relating to the GST distribution. Let us step through what has happened here. The Treasurer and the minister for finance announced two years ago a review of the arrangements relating to GST distribution. That review has not been released yet. Mr Greiner, Mr Bracks and Mr Bruce Carter from South Australia-a well-connected Labor appointee-were on that review panel. We have not seen the final results of the Labor review. Yet somehow it is the opposition who have plans to change the GST distribution across the country-even though it has been ruled out that any state would be worse off. Even though it has been ruled out, they just keep saying it. Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, desperate because his government is facing an absolute electoral annihilation next month, is out there today desperately trying to create another scare campaign. It has been ruled out, time in and time out-but it has not been ruled out by Penny Wong. We have not seen the Labor Party rule it out yet, yet on the other side they are making all sorts of accusations. Again, it is hypocrisy. You just cannot trust Labor. They are as trustworthy as a government which would tell you, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' or, 'There's more chance of me playing full forward for the Western Bulldogs than rolling the member for Griffith.' Well, we saw how that worked out for the member for Griffith. Finally, in the time left, I will make another point. This motion 'calls on all parties to have their policies costed consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty', and we will do so. We will release them to the Australian people in enough time to have a well-informed debate. We have put well over 50 policies in to the Parliamentary Budget Office for analysis and costing. We are doing the detailed work. We have had an expenditure review committee, which I am part of, operating now for a couple of years, working through the budget and working through the Labor waste, the mismanagement, to find where we can improve the delivery of efficient services. But a very important point which calls the lie on this motion has actually been made by the Parliamentary Budget Office itself at the recent estimates hearings. I refer to a media release from my good friend-now a new father-Senator Mathias Cormann, who says, 'PBO confirms election costings can't be finalised until after PEFO released.' So let us go past all this spin, all this attempt to create a false scare campaign like the GST distribution debate, which the member for Fraser referred to, and like the costings debate that they are trying to create. We know from independent analysis that they have $120 billion that they have not been able to fund. We know that the carbon tax is not going to collect what they thought it would. We know that the mining tax is not collecting what they thought it would. They should not be talking about costings. They are the most fiscally irresponsible government in Australian political history, and the master of European economics over there knows it. whether the September 2013 election should be contested around policy rather than personality, whether it is a contest around facts or fantasy and whether it is a contest around ideas or cant. We have heard a lot of cant in the debate this morning. In fact, you know it is Monday morning when the member for Mayo is going off like a Catherine wheel. There is more ecstasy over there than in an inner-city dance party. But the fact is that there is an important issue at stake here-that is, should the people of Australia, when they cast their ballots in September 2013, have all the facts before them about the contesting ideas, the contesting policies, of the two main parties that go into this election? We know that oppositions are sometimes at a disadvantage when it comes to having their election policies costed. They do not have the same opportunities available as a government would to ensure that, from budget to budget, their policies are costed and scrutinised in the normal way that any government would. Oppositions are at a disadvantage. So, to ensure that we have a fair contest at the election, this government has put in place the Parliamentary Budget Office. The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Office is to ensure that opposition parties, Independents, crossbenchers and minor parties have available to them expert, independent assistance in costing their policies so that, when there is an election, there is the capacity for the Australian people to look at and judge the competing policy prescriptions of both parties, based on independent costings. Of course, there is some history in this country about election contests being fought out on great claims about the costings and savings that are available to opposition parties which are contesting the election, only to find, in the course of the campaign or after the campaign, that those costings are nothing more than a house of cards. In the 2010 election, for example, the opposition was making great claims about the savings that they had been able to find and that their policies had been fully costed and were able to be delivered, only for it to be discovered days after the election that there was an $11 billion hole in their costings. The so-called independent auditors that they had go over their costs have subsequently been significantly discredited. There is a history in this country of oppositions not being forthcoming and fully frank with the electorate when it comes to having their policies fully costed. That is why we have set up the Parliamentary Budget Office to ensure that we do not do that.",225,Private Members Business
192,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11:42,"The question before the House this morning isThe opposition has made great noise over the last couple of months about the importance of transparency in costings. We have had the member for North Sydney tell the Australian people that if the coalition are elected to office then he will be mandating a report on structural deficits-something that I actually welcome. I think that would be a welcome addition to the annual reporting of our national finances. They want to ensure that we have structural deficit reports but are not willing to use the facilities of the Parliamentary Budget Office and come clean with the costings that lie behind their policies. We know there is good reason for that. We know that there is a $70 billion black hole within their election costings, on their own admission. And we see over the last 24 hours that one of the think tanks which is advising the Liberal Party has come up with a range of proposed savings, including cancelling the NDIS; abolishing Fair Work Australia and Safe Work Australia; cutting the general research budget by 40 per cent; cutting the Commonwealth housing program; cutting foreign aid; excluding emergency aid; and abolishing all agricultural, forestry and fishery programs. These are just a range of the savings. If these are the propositions that are being put by the opposition in the lead-up to the budget, they should come clean. They have told us that all of their policies are fully costed and ready to go; well, come clean with the costings. properly costed policies and talks about the Australian people having a well-informed debate. Talk about utter bald-faced hypocrisy-how can the member for Fraser come in here with a motion that talks about properly costed policies when he is part of a government that simply cannot get any costings right? Just last financial year, this Labor government predicted a deficit of $22.6 billion, but they were not even within a bull's roar of it. The end result was $43.7 billion-almost double what was forecast. Take their costings on the mining tax: it simply made this government a complete and utter laughing stock. Let's not forget the promise after promise after promise about returning the budget to surplus-another complete costings farce. On policies, all Australians remember the government's policy before the last election, and that was: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' But instead the good member that proposes this motion voted with the rest of this government to inflict the world's largest carbon tax upon our nation. So how can the Australian public have a well-informed debate about policies, when the track record of this government simply shows they cannot be trusted? It shows the public cannot believe a single word that they say. Nine months into Labor's carbon tax, just look at the damage this toxic tax is wreaking through the economy. Only a few days ago, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission reported that there were 10,632 company collapses in the last 12 months. That is an average of 886 a month. In fact, under Labor's carbon tax the number of firms being placed into administration under distress is actually 12 per cent higher than what was experienced during the global financial crisis-12 per cent higher. Look at some of the comments from some industry specialists. Tod Gammel, a partner with HLB Mann Judd, likened the carbon tax to pulling a leg from underneath a chair. He said: The companies which have exposure to energy and other factors which are affected by the carbon tax in a significant way, the carbon tax and the costs related to it are having a significant impact on the ability of these companies to continue.",227,Private Members Business
193,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (11:47,"This motion makes reference to parties presentingACCI chief economist Greg Evans said: Rapidly escalating energy prices caused by the carbon tax and other green programs are taking their toll on many Australian businesses. In energy reliant industries it is already showing up in job losses, investment and in the worse cases business closures. AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said: It defies logic to adopt a policy which even the Treasury acknowledges will lower our standard of living and be harmful to national productivity. The carbon tax is clearly having its toll. The evidence is in. Labor's carbon tax has resulted in a record number of firms going to the wall with thousands of employees being laid off and companies forced to close factories that have stood for generations. And the damage goes on. The Treasurer has been crying about a massive hit to revenue, but what do you expect when you smash Australian businesses with the world's highest carbon tax? This government simply does not get it. We have seen the Treasury figures released that show that the national budget fell a further $4.6 billion into deficit in the first four weeks of 2013. That is over $1 billion a week. It is $164 million a day or $6,845,000 an hour. We all want an informed debate, the one that Labor deceptively denied the public at the last election. There are two crystal clear alternatives at this next election. If the coalition is elected we will abolish the carbon tax. It will be our first order of business. The alternative, a vote for Labor, is a continuation of the damage that the carbon tax is doing. But not only that, under Labor the carbon tax continues(Time expired) important notice of motion to the attention of the House. I am a little disappointed that those opposite, particularly after my good friend Craig Kelly's speech, are not standing up and supporting this. If you think that all cards should be put on the table, if that is what the submission is to this House, I actually agree. We do want to see all cards put on the table. We want to see what the spending requirements are, how people are going to make their pledges as we go forward to the next election and how they are going to be costed and delivered into reality in this place. Therefore I think the member for Fraser has done well in bringing this motion to us for our attention. The Parliamentary Budget Office is a relatively new organisation which is providing independent and non-partisan analysis throughout the budget cycle of fiscal policy and also the financial implications of all proposals. As we move to the election, those opposite should take note that this is something that all parties, government and opposition, should be required to use in order to have their policies properly costed as well as assessed for the impact they will have on fiscal management. So far the Parliamentary Budget Office has performed exceptionally well in terms of its post-budget reports on election commitments of the parties, drawing attention to their impact on the budget's bottom line. So people cannot come in here and trash the Parliamentary Budget Office and talk about the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent tax as a justification for why they should not have some independent assessment of policies that parties are putting forward for government in the next term. It is just an inconsistency. The idea of having an independent assessor looking at spending and tax policies and providing a post-budget audit is something that ensures transparency and fiscal responsibility of political parties as election time comes around.",228,Private Members Business
194,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (11:52,"I congratulate the member for Fraser in bringing thisThis should be something which is seen to be good for our democracy. Gone are the days when people could pork-barrel and make promises which were unsustainable and which they could not keep. Clearly, things will arise from time to time as to why things ought to be taken off the table, but people and parties should be held to account. You cannot do what the Liberals and the Nationals did last election and come out and say, 'We're not going to use the Parliamentary Budget Office because we do not trust them. We think they're compromised public servants.' The ones who were dealing with the Treasury in those days had a bloke called Godwin Grech, their trusted insider in Treasury who was giving them advice, and look where it got them. Look what they did instead: they opted for appointing their own auditor. That is certainly different from having a parliamentary budget office. Normally auditors have to confine themselves to operating under professional standards, but the auditor they secured was found to breach the professional standards of accounting in preparing the audit. That is what they relied on and then we discovered they had an $11 billion black hole, which was pretty unsettling. And had they been successful in winning government, they would have been struggling to find a cure for that black hole. If you look at what has occurred recently-and I know there is some difference between the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer on this-you see that the Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'We're going to maintain all those compensations which flowed out of a carbon tax; we're going to maintain tripling the tax-free threshold'-but that is not the position of the opposition Treasurer. If that is correct, even the shadow Treasurer says that there is now a $70 billion black hole that is going to have to be filled. With due respect to Joe on this, he says, 'We're going to have to slash and burn to find savings to fix the $70 billion black hole.' We are indebted to him for being honest about that, but you cannot front up and do what they did last time, and simply thumb their noses at the democratic processes in this place, and say, simply, 'Trust us because we'll get it right.' Last time they did not; they were $11 billion short. very important debate about the Parliamentary Budget Office, I would like to acknowledge, while she is in the room, the member for Gellibrand's great work in providing funding for Ungarie when, last year, that little village had a devastating flood go through it. People in that particular place waited and waited for the state to give it the necessary tick-off-and they are still waiting. Out of the goodness of her heart, the member for Gellibrand saw that there was a need, and she provided absolutely vital funding for it. I very much appreciated it and I very much appreciated her efforts in helping the Riverina flood victims after that particular devastation. Labor has been very good when we have had natural disasters. SoI acknowledge that. But I also acknowledge the fact that, with this particular debate, Labor has not been very goodbeen very good for the business community. I know the member for Hughes has pointed out the fact that the dreaded carbon tax is contributing to a record number of firms going to the wall, going broke, with thousands of employees being laid off. Labor always says it is there for the workers, but unfortunately, with the carbon tax and the clean energy legislation,",229,Private Members Business

197,Mr Mccormack,"You cannot get all the goodness out of me, because Labor has notfactories which have stood for generations are closing, soaring energy bills are hurting households and company executives and corporate rescue doctors are trying to save ailing firms. But this is about the Parliamentary Budget Office and accountability. If ever there was a sign that a government is not accountable, it is this particular Labor government. We have seen this government borrow more money in its five years than every other previous government from federation through to 2007 borrowed, which is a disgrace. It is important that the Australian public has access to all parties' positions on different matters at election time and that the parties have had adequate resources made available to ensure they receive independent advice while formulating these, and the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office has allowed for this. The establishment of the office in Australia has been a key element of coalition policy for a number of years, and when we introduced the legislation in 2011 the government followed suit a couple of days later. The coalition has called for the establishment of a PBO from as early as 2009, and in June 2010 the Leader of the Opposition renewed this call. When the opposition called for a PBO in 2009 it was envisaged it would be modelled on the United States Congressional Budget Office, an office which does not provide policy recommendations-rather, it provides independent analysis of the revenue and spending implication of policy proposals. We have seen Labor in recent weeks-even though we are not in an election campaignspending or promising money like drunken sailors. With all due respect to drunken sailors, I do not think even they would be as frivolous with their money as this government have been with their promises to the Australian people-promises they know they will never have to keep. All we get from that side is leadership speculation and a dysfunctional, shambolic government. Mr Perrett interjectinghere earlier when I was praising the member for Gellibrand, who did a good job in her former portfolio. But Labor have not done a good job in any portfolio area-and certainly not in defence, where they have cut $5½ billion out of this vitally important portfolio area, and certainly not for small businesses. Somebody asked me the other day what the definition of a small business is. I replied, 'It was a medium business when Labor came to office in 2007 and now it is a small business because of the cutbacks they have made and the harshness of the carbon tax'-helped by the member for Lyne to be brought in. Mr Perrett: Hear, hear! which has had such deleterious effect on Australians all over the country. This is an extremely important debate, because the call for updated information in the Preelection Economic and Fiscal Outlook will not affect the cost of most policies and therefore the release of this document should not delay the release on policy, and that is where we differ. The Parliamentary Budget Office at the Senate estimates hearing on 11 February this year confirmed that they are unable to accurately finalise the costing of election policies until after the release of the PEFO, published by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance. It will be the PEFO, which is the final set of budget numbers, by which the coalition will measure and cost our policies ahead of this year's federal election.",230,Private Members Business
198,Mr Mccormack,I hear the member for Moreton calling out. He should have been,231,Private Members Business
199,Mr Mccormack,"Yes; 'Hear, hear'. He sided with you to bring in the carbon tax,But let me tell you that after 14 September, if we are lucky enough to be elected by the Australian people, we will be accountable, our policies will be costed and we will get a budget surplus. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (12:02): I also want to add my voice to this debate on this very important issue. Making sure that there can be provided to the public, covered in the media and part of any election debate that we have, a sensible discussion about the costs of various alternative policies is really important. The establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office, enabling, particularly, the opposition and minor parties to be able to get their policies costed and to able to give the public confidence that the costings that are attached to those announcements are sound, could not be more important for the future of the country. But, unfortunately, the debate-as we have seen from some of the contributions already-has got to such a level that people no longer think that obtaining proper information and being able to have that reported to the public is something that we should even care about for the elections. I do not think there could be anything further from the truth. We need to make sure that proper information is available. The reason I feel particularly passionate about this-and I know that members on our side have talked about the last election-is that I remember extremely clearly as the Minister for Health that just a number of days before the election the then opposition, seeking to be the government, had not released the costings of any of their policies. We were in the situation where we were close to media and advertising blackouts. We were literally days from the election. I think I was at a community chef facility in my electorate in Altona-a facility that makes meals on wheels for people; something funded as a regional project which has been very successful-and suddenly rather more people than you would expect to be at the Altona community chef facility turned up because the costings had just been announced by the opposition. They were audited but, as we now know, it was done by a very small firm which was professionally reprimanded for the work that it did having really accepted all of the assumptions-although many of them were flawed-that the Liberal Party had included in the work that they asked to be audited. I particularly remember it because these proposals included a quite breathtaking submission about what the PBS could cost in the view of the Liberal Party. There was no basis, however, for those figures being included. There was no detailed work done and no legitimate academic discussion, which of course, with a complex policy like the PBS, you might have. There was just an assertion that a billion dollars could be saved, where the only possible way of finding that saving would have been to increase copayments for ordinary consumers. If in the election a party wants to come and say that is what they will do, the public should be able to then say, 'I actually don't want to pay more for my medicines,' or 'Yes, I agree that is worth it if it means we will do something else,' and have a proper debate. In fact, the media did not particularly run this issue. They said, 'The coalition says this and the government says that.' There was no assessment given of whether these were credible financial assessments or assumptions to make. The Parliamentary Budget Office will now enable those sorts of last-minute sweeping and dramatic changes to be assessed and will provide to the public an independent view of whether those figures actually add up or not. You could not think of a more important thing that the public should be able to know. If we see the Liberal Party running away from having their policies costed-as it sounds as if they are going to, from the contributions that have been made-we will know that the same shonky approach that they took last time is going to be taken again. I particularly want to use the example of health, because it has a budget of more than $60 billion. It is an area where there are always going to be financial issues that people want to talk about. These issues very much affect the community and people should be entitled to know. I make this point because, five years ago when our government was first elected, I would have thought-I have not counted; it is a guess-that there would have been about 10 dedicated health journalists in the press gallery, and now, as we speak today, there is one, and that person is not dedicated to health; they do health amongst other things. So how can we rely on the media to be able to properly pick apart assessments that are made by competing parties? We need budget experts. This office will have them. They have all the protection that means that the information will not be released early. The policies of the opposition should be costed by this new office. (Time expired) Speaker Cheeseman. I rise to speak on the motion moved by Dr Andrew Leigh-the Young Economist of the year in 2011-about bipartisan support for the Parliamentary Budget Office. I note that the member for Lyons is in the chamber as well, and I thank him for his contribution on this important checkpoint for democracy. Like the previous speaker, the former Attorney-General, I well remember the last election and that incredible $11 billion black hole. We had the incredible situation where the accounting firm faced the legal equivalent of being struck off, basically: they were professionally reprimanded for the work that they did at the last minute, signing off on the dodgy figures delivered by the coalition before the last election. Obviously we need to have an independent office that all sides of parliament can trust and that the Australian people can trust. As the current costing process shows, the opposition is out there crazily offering everything. It is not just the leaders; out in the electorates, the promises that are being made are incredible. We need to have them properly costed. I commend the member for Warringah for committing resolutely to $70 billion in cuts to services if elected. To put that in context: as the member for Gellibrand said, the health budget is $60 billion. So you are basically saying to health: 'We will have no health delivered for a year, and then there will be another $10 billion.' That is the sort of black hole that has to be cut. That $70 billion black hole is an incredible black hole. Coming from Queensland, I have seen what happens when a government turns up and says, supposedly with a mandate, 'We are going to cut.' I come from Queensland, where nearly 15,000 jobs have been cut from the Public Service, and we have seen all of the accompanying damage caused to people when such front-line services are attacked. Let's put that $70 billion in context: it is the equivalent of cutting the age pension for three years. Mr Abbott has not backed away from it in any way, shape or form. That is why we need to have his costings put through the Parliamentary Budget Office: so that there can be a proper debate amongst all of the parties about properly costed policies, so that we can look at the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook and use that prism to determine whether their figures are dodgy or not, because we do not need a repeat of what happened in 2010.",231,Private Members Business
200,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12:08,"It is great to be here with you in the chair, Mr DeputyWe need Mr Abbott to say what he will do. He is committed to cutting the schoolkids bonus. He is committed to cutting anything associated with the mining tax, a mining tax that we know, and all Australia knows, is the appropriate price on our minerals. They can only be dug up once. It is a tax-collecting mechanism which will give benefits to the Australian community for the next 30, 40, 50 years. The member for Goldstein said, on 18 August 2011: The $70 billion is an indicative figure of the challenge we've got … if we start to impose some discipline we should be able to stop spending in the order of $70 billion … Well, heaven help the people out there involved in delivering Commonwealth services. Heaven help the 20,000 public servants who are lined up by the opposition to sack, the 20,000 public servants who are out there doing the right thing by the Australian people, delivering services that are going to be in the crosshairs under the coalition if, heaven forbid, they get over the line on September 14. Coming from Queensland, I have seen what happens. I have been looking for the press releases from federal Liberal and National party members of parliament from Queensland saying anything positive about or even criticising Premier Newman for the cuts that he has made. I know the member for Forde is reluctant to let things go through or slip past him. I have seen him on many occasions. But I cannot find on his web page any criticism of Premier Newman and what he has done to our electorates. The reality is that, if Mr Abbott comes in, trying to fill this $70 billion black hole, the people of Queensland and the people of Australia will suffer. Moreton, and to speak on the member for Fraser's motion on policy costings. The member for Moreton has spent a good deal of his contribution to this debate touching on the apparent $11 billion black hole in the coalition's costings for the last federal budget. If it were there, I would say it pales into insignificance compared to what we have seen this government achieve over the past three years, let alone compared to the past five years. We have seen over the past five years this government rack up some $147 billion plus in deficits, and I think it is a tad hypocritical for the government to be lecturing us on policy costings when they have access to the full resources of Treasury yet they still cannot get their figures right year in, year out. Just for a bit of edification: the total government call on present and future taxpayers for the year finished was nearly 26 per cent of GDP. This was higher than in any year of the previous coalition government. The average over the term of the coalition government, over the 10 or 11 years, was some 23.4 per cent. SoI think we need to reflect on the facts of this debate. The facts are that the coalition, for 10 years of government, demonstrated good fiscal rectitude in ensuring that the Commonwealth's finances were managed in a consistent and well-considered manner for the benefit of all Australians. We have seen in the past five years of this government's effort that it has just gone on a spending spree with no consideration for the fact that, at some point in the future, this debt-now, in gross terms, some $263 billion-will need to be repaid. In looking at this motion by the member for Fraser, I think the government first needs to take a leaf out of its own book and get its own budget and policy costings in order. It is only the coalition which has a demonstrated track record of being able to actually achieve that.",233,Private Members Business
201,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (12:13,"It is a pleasure to follow my esteemed colleague fromDebate adjourned. Taxation Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Oakeshott: That this House: (1) recognises the need for comprehensive tax reform to maximise the standard of living for Australians for the next 50 years; and (2) encourages the Treasurer to: (a) release a 10 year road-map for comprehensive tax reform as a standalone Budget Paper as part of the 2013-14 Budget, and (b) include reform for consideration beyond the 4 year forward estimates period. pass a motion that, in the upcoming budget, a separate document be attached to the budget papers that provides a 10-year road map on comprehensive tax reform and on how the budget is talking to those mid-term structural issues that the economy faces-not just the four-year forward estimates, as is the tradition, but more focused on the 10-year agenda, where so much of Australia's story lies. I hope that the House once again supports this motion. Because the House supported it last year, a document was attached to the budget papers. It was a very skinny document. It highlighted the need for more of that 10-year story to be told and for executive government to be encouraged to do more focused work on sharing the 10-year story. Really, the only item of any significance in last year's 10-year road map was the timetable on the transition from nine per cent superannuation to 12 per cent superannuation and the staggering of that transition over time. Whether you like that policy or not, it is a good example of what Australia and this place need to do on a number of fronts. I continue to emphasise the need for comprehensive tax reform and for a 10-year story to be told as to how we are going to transition from 125 local, state and federal taxes in our country, where only four of them do 90 per cent of the lifting, to a more efficient tax base and away from the many, many inefficiencies in-built in our tax system, which will, if unaddressed, have a material impact on our standard of living as Australians. Up till now the comment has been, 'Oh, we can't afford this,' or, 'We can't afford that.' It really is getting to the urgent point where it is less about what we can afford and more about the point that we cannot afford not to do it. It will start to cause material damage to our standard of living. This parliament has done many good things and much good work. Despite the comments of the member for Riverina, when I entered the room, about climate policy, I think that that is one of the important steps that has been taken in this parliament. It is a market based scheme that is a direct lift from the Henry tax reform work. It is a step in the right direction on tax reform as it is on responding to climate policy. Not only is it a market based mechanism responding to many of the science questions, but directly attached to that is a significant lift in the tax-free threshold from the middle of this year from $16,000 to $18,200. Again, it is a significant step along the journey of the Henry tax review recommendations, whilst he did recommend lifting the tax-free threshold through to $25,000 and removing even more people from the tax system altogether and all the inefficiencies that go with that both for individuals and government. We have taken in this parliament-to this parliament's credit-a significant",234,Private Members Business
202,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (12:16,"As I did last year, I seek the support of the House tostep in moving along that journey of lifting the tax-free threshold and removing many people from the burden on participating in the tax system on an annual basis at all. I would hope that, as this place starts to move into election mode, both major parties start to put their cards on the table with regard to the lift to the $25,000 tax-free threshold. At the moment the position of government is not clear on that and the position of the opposition is not clear either, nor in public commentary is it clear on whether the $18,200 will be maintained or whether we return to the non-Henry recommendation, which is going backwards in the tax-free threshold and bringing nearly a million more Australians back into the tax system. I hope that can be corrected. Some of the other good things this parliament has done are in the information communication technology and regional equity coming through on that. I am personally of the view that, so far from what I have seen, the differences in policy from either sides, whilst on the surface look like a fight between cat and dog over the NBN, when it gets down to the differences in detailed policy, they are not great. I would also say, likewise, that I hope on the big push on education policy with regard to secondary education funding and the delivery of regional equity on that front that we can make room for that to happen in the next six months. I hope that has bipartisan support when it happens. All of those pressures make the point that there are big demands coming down the pipe in a policy sense and we have to make our tax system talk more to some of these challenges and talk more between local, state and federal considerations. It will, as I emphasised before, have a material impact on our standard of living if we leave this issue unresolved. I think it has been a great disappointment that this parliament has not been able to get executive government to negotiate either through COAG or other means to put some meat on the bones of comprehensive tax reform and get some agreements happening on a whole range of inefficient tax issues whether in superannuation, housing or any of the 130 recommendations made by the very good work of the Henry tax review. Some of it has happened-the loss carry-back work with small business is excellent. The tax free-threshold lift coming in the middle of this year is excellent. The establishment of the Tax Institute for furthering the research base in some of these tax problems is excellent. The removal of lowincome superannuation tax payments and the regressive nature of them is excellent, but they are cherry picking the nature of what is meant by comprehensive tax reform. It is sitting down with those state governments and working through in a negotiated environment the many issues of overlap, double-up and inefficiency that are frustratingly accepted by governments and to the direct detriment of the standards of living of all Australians. I mention the ACT as a bit of a shining light in what they have done with stamp duty and housing, and the transitioning that happened there. What a great example for other states to consider, and for us as a parliament and hopefully for a government to consider as to how to facilitate that work for other states. They have a road map in place for the removal of stamp duty on property as a really good example and a challenge to other states to do likewise. The mining royalties issue remains outstanding and could be a flagship for negotiation between the Commonwealth and states; we have GST payments now proving to be a point of conflict between the Commonwealth and the states; we have horizontal fiscal equalisation as a point of conflict between states like Tasmania and Western Australia and causing confusion to many and we have vertical fiscal imbalance that is putting pressure on both the policy and political points between the Commonwealth and states. We cannot just leave these as unresolved. They are great opportunities to bring everyone in the room and nut it out. Unfortunately, for some reason we cannot get governments to get there. Once again, I put the call on the table for the road map in the budget papers and that all of us pressure whomever it is we need to pressure to get comprehensive tax reform dealt with between the Commonwealth and the states; that we get a reduction in these 125 taxes that are currently in play; that we work the efficient taxes harder-four of them are doing 90 per cent of the lifting, so let us focus on those. Let us build an efficient tax system and let us lift the standard of living for all Australians. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (12:26): I rise today to speak on this motion by Mr Oakeshott and I thank him for drawing this matter to the parliament's attention. The fact is, in the words of the member, it is clear that the Labor Party has presided over a tax shambles. During its time in government, we have seen more than 27 new or increased taxes brought into effect, and this is despite the fact that this government is already receiving more in revenue than was received during the last year of the coalition government. Why has it done this? It has done this because its view is very simple on the Australian economy. Unlike the Liberals and the coalition, who understand that you need to grow the economy in order to increase the living standards of all Australians, this government believes that you need to increase taxes. Not to grow the pie but simply to increase taxes. The government needs to increase taxes because it has significantly and dramatically increased spending. This government is spending more than $90 billion more than previously spent by the coalition government each and every year. That is money that has been borrowed in order to fund the government's spending. It has not just been borrowed, but Australians are paying increased taxes in order to fund it. And to fund what? We know the list is long, and includes such things as the pink batts scheme and the $6 billion which has been the cost of the government's failure when it comes to border protection. These are just two examples. But it is true to say that there needs to be a different way on tax. Let me hark back to the coalition's record when it comes to tax. The coalition was able to pay back Labor's $96 billion of debt and was able to provide for the future with a $70 billion Future Fund and a $6 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund, and it was able to deliver in the last year of government a $20 million surplus. In doing all of this, it was able at the same time to deliver significant company tax cuts in order to help and encourage business to grow and to employ. We saw during that time wages increase in real terms of over 20 per cent. At the same time the coalition also delivered individual tax cuts in almost every budget year. This meant that Australians were free to choose to spend their money in the way that they saw fit. The government takes a different view. It wants to tell Australians how it is that they should spend their money, and we fundamentally disagree. Who can forget that before last election the Prime Minister and this government made a firm and solid commitment that it would not introduce the very regressive carbon tax? It promised this most faithfully, and within days of coming into government it reneged on that promise. We are seeing the implications already for Australian manufacturing and Australian industry. It goes to our ultimate competitiveness, and we are competing not only in our region but also throughout the world and we need to ensure that we can be competitive. A carbon tax does not assist us in this. The chief economist of AMP recently said that a carbon tax is clearly taking a toll. This comes off the back of business leaders who have warned that it is having a direct impact on business. Figures that were recently released show that 900 Australian firms are currently being placed in administration each month. This is indeed a record high and it is 12 per cent higher than during the GFC. There is no doubt that the carbon tax is making a bad situation even worse, even more difficult. In addition to the carbon tax, this government has also introduced a mining tax that it linked to increased spending, $15 billion worth of increased spending. We were told that the mining tax in this financial year was going to deliver $2 billion. Yet this government is so ineffective when it comes to introducing legislation, including taxes, that the revenue raised is only $126 million. We said it was a flawed tax. It clearly is a flawed tax and it should be gone. Coming back to the motion before us today, it is clear that there is much more to do on tax reform. The Henry tax review, a multimillion-dollar review instituted by the government, made 138 recommendations but less than a handful of those recommendations have been implemented. In fact, some recommendations-for instance, not to make any changes to the superannuation guarantee-were ignored, which is rather surprising. We live in a global world and we need to be globally competitive. Being globally competitive with our tax system is critical. The tax review recommended a reduction in the company tax rate to 25 per cent over time, and a commitment to minimise the rate of company tax is one that in broad terms we accept. But from this government we have seen no progress, with the government scrapping its own long-promised company tax cut in last year's budget. We have seen the government's latest efforts in the previous budget to increase the effective tax rate for many companies by moving to monthly tax collection, which again was not one of the 138 recommendations. This increases companies' effective tax rates through funding costs to cover working capital requirements and compliance costs. Far from making Australia's tax system more competitive, we have moved backwards. PwC recently provided a report on this subject, Paying Taxes 2012. It analyses the significant ground that we need to make up in Australia. Australia is ranked 52nd of mediumsized companies paying taxes and government-mandated contributions. Competitor economies in the region rank far higher, with Hong Kong third and Singapore fourth. But company tax is not the only area where the government's response to the Henry tax review has been found wanting. We have seen no progress on removing inefficient state taxes, with the government refusing to consider a proposal prepared by the states to reduce stamp duty, nor will it consider one on removing distortions in the taxing of savings. With the Asian Century white paper, we have clearly not learnt some of these lessons, and these are lessons which are very salutary and ones which we need to institute as a matter of urgency. We need tax reform that is efficient and fair. We need to ensure that we can, through our tax system, have people take home as much of their pay that they have earned as is humanly possible. The government can do this by managing the economy well and by refusing to implement new taxes. We have already heard in the Prime Minister's Press Club address that she plans on introducing potentially new tax imposts on superannuation in the upcoming budget. This would be a significantly regressive step and one that we would argue very strongly against. Tax reform should be a priority. Tax reform has not been a priority of this government. If the coalition is given the opportunity to govern again in September this year we will ensure that tax is placed at the top of the agenda. (Time expired) pleasure in speaking on this motion moved by the Independent member for Lyne, which recognises the need for comprehensive tax reform to maximise the standard of living of all Australians over the next 50 years. That is something that this government has been very committed to for a very long time, not only in government since 2007 but also when we were in opposition. He also encourages the Treasurer to release a 10-year road map for comprehensive tax reform as a stand-alone budget paper including reform considerations beyond the four-year forward estimates. This is something we support. This is something we are currently doing. This is something that this government is committed to. It is a good idea and an idea that comes forward on a similar motion that was supported prior to last year's budget where a road map was produced-I have that here with me today and, hopefully, I will have enough time to say to a couple of things specifically contained in that road map. I am happy to speak on these matters because it gives government members an opportunity to highlight all the good things that have been done. If you listen to the opposition you would think that nothing had been done and that it was all negative. That is very far from the truth; it is just not the case. In fact, there are many things that this government has done in terms of a proven track record on tax and transfer reform. We understand the importance of a stronger, simpler and fairer system, without question, and that is why we commissioned a root-and-branch review of the tax system so that we would have a document that we could all go to, done by an eminent Australian, that would give us some guidance, as well as come forward with our own road map of where, as a government, we believe we need to move forward. Since that time we have progressed nearly 40 measures advancing the recommendations of the tax review-not just a handful, but 40-40 significant measures that make an enormous difference to ordinary people. Many of those important reforms were detailed in the 10-year road map that we published after the last budget. Last year's reform road map provided a vision-a vision to the country-and it was a vision that promoted investment and productivity growth, where we simplified tax arrangements for small business and introduced loss carry-back to spur adaptation and innovation. We are encouraging investment in infrastructure over time and we are lifting the nation's savings by boosting the superannuation guarantee. These are not small matters. These are monumental reforms-reforms that have come after a generation of, perhaps, change and languish. It is a great thing that this Labor government was able to bring that forward. We have also tripled the tax-free threshold which means there are a million more Australians now that do not even need to fill in a tax return. I remember for a very long time ordinary Australians at the lower end of the income scale saying, 'Why shouldn't it be that there should be a higher tax-free threshold?' Well, guess what? This Labor government agreed. We shifted the tax-free threshold from just over $6,000 a year to just over $18,000, and we will progress that through to $19,500 in following budgets. That is significant. If you did just one thing out of the 100-plus recommendations and it was just that one, you would be doing pretty well as a government, and we did it.",235,Private Members Business
203,Mr Ripoll (Oxley,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12:36): I take greatWe have also phased out a whole range of outdated barriers to participation, particularly workforce ones. So our vision for a fairer, more sustainable tax system is not just rhetoric. It is not just talk and reports. It is delivered. It is already there-including $47 billion worth of income tax cuts in the first three budgets of this government, at a time when we, like the rest of the world, were facing one of the most difficult global financial situations that anyone has ever faced, at least since the Great Depression. But this is a government that stumped up and did the right thing. We did the reviews and we followed through with significant reforms, because that will set up Australia to be a stronger and fairer place for all Australians. We are going to do it again in this budget. As all budgets are, this is going to be tough. But we are going to do the right thing. We have also managed to pass the clean energy future package and a compensation package-something that the opposition when in government never did. When they increased a tax, they never compensated people or adjusted, particularly for people on lower incomes. For Australia's 2.7 million small businesses, we introduced an instant asset write-off for each and every asset worth less than $6,500. This was a significant reform and makes a huge difference to small business. We also did the loss carry-back, which is extremely good for companies, and we have simplified small business cash-flow tax arrangements to make it easier for them. Also, the release of the tax review in 2010 was the start of a national discussion on tax reform that we have continued with the tax forum and ongoing consultations. Labor has always been committed to tax reform and helping business, ordinary people and companies alike. (Time expired) tax reform and the opportunity to talk on this important issue. WhilstI understand the member's motive, there is a fundamental flaw in this motion and, as a result, I will not be giving it my support. Reading between the lines, this motion recognises that the government's tax policy is a mess. This position I agree with. There has been the failed carbon tax. There has been the failed mining resource rent tax that has raised virtually no money at all after administration, implementation and advertising costs are taken into account. There was the failed tax reform in October 2011. There was the government's extensive and expensive Henry tax review, but only 3½ of the review's 138 recommendations have been implemented-so much for following through. There was the failed business tax working group, with rumours that the government will still seek to use the discredited measures resulting from the working group. There are 27 new or increased taxes this government has implemented since coming into power. There is the $8 billion in company tax receipts the government brought forward in the 2012-13 MYEFO, and there is the $8 billion that this government has ripped out of superannuation since coming to power in November 2007. All of these points lead to one undeniable fact: that this government's tax policy is a mess. I agree with the member for Lyne that our government needs and deserves a much stronger quality of planning to form the foundations of reform in our taxation system and that this reform will help to maximise our constituents' standard of living over the long term. However-and this is where I diverge from the member for Lyne-the solution will not be achieved with the request to this Treasurer to release yet another aspirational addendum to the budget papers. History has shown us that the words and numbers printed on these documents",239,Private Members Business
204,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (12:41,"I thank the member for Lyne for this motion onare often not worth the paper they are written on. My constituents in Bennelong will remember the government's promise in the 2010-11 MYEFO to commit $2.1 billion to the construction of the Epping to Parramatta rail link. Two and a half years later, not a penny has been spent, not a sod of soil has been turned. It should be noted that our Prime Minister had the gall to return to this very location recently and make more promises to win these seats in Western Sydney, including a promise to fund roads in the region to $1 billion. Sound familiar? Well, if you con me once, shame on you; if you con me again, shame on me. People of Western Sydney, do not be shamed. This government has shown time and again that it is simply not up to the task and that it simply cannot be trusted. The solution to this problem is not to tinker with this government's reporting obligations. The solution is to change the government. Regional communities like those represented by the member for Lyne can benefit greatly from tax reform; but, as we saw with the Henry tax review, this government is simply not fit for the job. The constituents of Lyne must question whether their member's decision to support this government was the right one. One hundred and fifty years ago, the United States government, under President Lincoln, used 30-year government bonds to build the Transcontinental Railroad. Fifty years ago, the Japanese government built their first bullet train through a combination of low-interest loans and government bonds. There are many ways that tax policy and good governance can be used to build Australia and to increase the standard of living for our constituents. However, all this government can do is to make promises that get broken and then they fight each other over who is going to sit in the leader's chair. The government of a young country with great potential must have vision and the capacity to make long-term plans and then commit to the course to fulfil this potential. This course must not be changed on a daily basis to gain a favourable headline. Direction must remain steadfast. This government has lost direction by their own admission. They are constantly distracted on the bridge, and that puts us all in peril now and in the future. Strong policy requires leadership and long-term planning, and this will only be achieved through a change in government. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (12:46): I see this motion as an opportunity to debunk some of the myths put by the other side to our being a significant reforming government when it comes to tax. Our government has been working very hard to reform the tax system. In fact, many of the reforms that we have made have directly benefited people in my electorate, and they have particularly benefited low-income earners-and I will go through some of them later. In terms of the myth that we are somehow a high-taxing government, I think the 'facts' are wrong there. It is actually the previous coalition government, the Howard government, that is the greatest taxing government on record. In fact, the tax-to-GDP ratio will be lower than 22 per cent in 2012-13-that is significantly lower. If we had kept the tax regime of the Howard government, we would have collected $30 billion in extra tax. But we believed when we came to government that tax reform was a must and that tax should be given back to the people who deserved it. Our first action was to give $47 billion worth of tax cuts. This was a significant reform and it came soon after we were elected to government. We delivered those cuts to lowand middle-income earners-to those people who needed tax relief the most. But we did not stop there. Indeed, we took one million people out of the tax system by increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,200 on 1 July 2012, and then from 1 July 2015 it will be increased to $19,400. No-one can underestimate the impact that this will have for many low-income earners. It is not only that those in the workforce are able to pocket more money but that people are encouraged to get into the workforce because they are not being penalised. That is only the case under this government, because we know through slips of the tongue by the shadow Treasurer that the Liberal Party, if they were to ever get elected, will put those million people back into the tax system. They will make them pay tax. They will discourage them from entering the workforce and from participating in the workforce. This is very short sighted by those opposite. We are proud of this particular reforming aspect-and not only that, we have also made a significant change to the effective tax paid on superannuation by low-income earners. Indeed, at the moment there is a flat tax rate for superannuation concession contributions. As a result, that flat tax rate has led to low-income earners receiving little or no concession. It is this government that is addressing that and that will provide a superannuation contribution of up to $500 annually for individuals on adjusted taxable incomes of up to $37,000 to improve the equity of the superannuation taxation arrangements. These two measures together say clearly to low-income earners, 'We are going to help you now, provide you with tax relief now, so that you can participate in the workforce; but we will also provide you with tax relief and tax help when it comes to superannuation, when it come to saving for the future.' Those two incredibly important measures were opposed by those opposite. The shadow Treasurer has also said that he will put the tax back onto low-income earners when it comes to superannuation. It was very interesting to hear the previous speaker talk about tax on superannuation. It is those on the other side that have a plan to put tax back onto superannuation-indeed, onto those who have the most difficulty in earning. These are two very significant tax reforms. Time does not allow me to get to the many, many others. We have certainly enabled people to have better cash flow in their small businesses through the loss carry-back and the instant asset write-off. These two measures help with the cash flow that is so important for small business. It is something that the previous government ignored but that we have allowed. Indeed, it encourages investment. There is a plan for the future. (Time expired) trying to sing the praises of this government's tax policy. Let me enlighten her on a couple of facts. Firstly, in relation to the tax-free threshold, the low-income tax offset that we had prior to this meant that there was an effective tax-free threshold of $16,000. So there has only really been a small increase to $18,000, and the government also increased the base tax rate from 30 per cent to 34 per cent for those earning more than $18,000. So it is the usual pea and thimble trick of this government; it just highlights where this government really is in terms of tax policy. I would like to thank the member for Lyne for his motion, the intention of which is well made. However, given that he has been in a position for the past 2½ years of holding the reins of power, so to speak, I find it quietly strange that he has not used the opportunity in the past 2½ years to advance the points that he sets out in his motion. I think it is quite hypocritical that, not having used that opportunity, he now puts this motion before the House. That is",240,Private Members Business
205,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (12:51,"I thank the member for Kingston for her contribution,especially the case if we have a look at his voting record on some of the key taxes we have seen over the past 2½ years. He supported both the mining tax and the carbon tax. I wonder why is he putting this motion before the House when his track record in voting for new or increased taxes is pretty much unblemished. At the end of the day, Australians need real action to get things done. In the past five years we have seen a great deal of focus on ways to achieve tax reform. One of the first acts of the Rudd government following its election in 2007 was the so-called root and branch review of the Australian taxation system, the Henry review. The review cost in excess of $10 million, received over 1,500 submissions, consisted of a panel of five experts and produced more than 1,300 pages. In the end, it contained 138 recommendations, of which the government claims to have progressed less than a handful. In the fallout from the 2010 election, the government made a major tax reform promise to the Independents. It promised to hold a summit. Imagine that-this government holding a summit! Of course, at this stage we had previously ruled out a carbon tax and the fourth iteration of the mining tax. The million-dollar tax forum subsequently held in October last year led to a major new tax initiative, the Business Tax Working Group. This new group was charged with doing the government's work to find savings to pay for a company tax cut. Reviews, forums, summits, working groups: it is all talk and no action-other than introducing new or increased taxes. In the past five years, we have seen 27 of those coming from the Labor government, the most notable being the carbon tax and the mining tax, with one, the mining tax, mentioned in the Henry tax review. The motion goes on to talk about having the government release 'a 10-year road map for comprehensive tax reform as a stand-alone budget paper'. We cannot go six months without this government's budget blowing up. In the past nine months, we have seen countless examples of a government without a stable and consistent approach to tax, and we have seen poor judgement time and again on the implementation of tax legislation. At the end of the day, there is no doubt that Australia needs a much higher standard of planning to underpin reform in our tax system. We as the coalition can confirm that we will not support this motion. As we have seen more than enough, this government is not up to the task. So the solution is not to call on the government to lift its game; the solution is a change in government. Debate interrupted. Migration Amendment (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013 Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Van Manen: I second the motion. bill to restore temporary protection visas to the suite of measures that are necessary to bring to a halt the historic level of failure on our borders that has characterised, and been experienced",242,Private Members Business
206,Mr Morrison (Cook) (12:57,I move:,243,Bills
207,The Deputy Speaker (Ms O'neill,Is the motion seconded?,243,Bills
208,Mr Morrison,"I am pleased to be part of the second reading of this private member'sunder, the governance of the current government. Prior to the 2007 election, the member for Kingsford Smith said to Steve Price, then with 2UE: … we'll change it all … He later sought to distance himself from those comments. But, when it comes to border protection, there was no truer statement issued by any member of the now government than that. This government has changed it all when it comes to border protection in this country. It has changed all of it, every last little bit of it. Those changes started with the abolition of the Pacific solution back on 8 February 2008, described by the then minister for immigration, Senator Evans, as his proudest moment: the abolition of the Pacific solution. They broke their promise to turn back boats, a promise made just days before the election in 2007. Prime Minister Rudd walked away from that commitment. They abolished temporary protection visas, putting permanent residency back on the table for people smugglers to sell. They did that, interestingly, on my birthday, on 13 May 2008. They abolished temporary protection visas. They abolished turning back the boats. They abolished the Pacific solution. They abolished at all. They changed at all. But they did not stop there. They abolished the single officer review process for decisions made in the process of determining whether someone is a refugee. Now, that is the process adopted by the UNHCR all around the world. Abolishing that process and putting in place a series of subsequent appeals mechanisms have revealed again today, as have previous figures, that if at first they do not succeed, an asylum seeker coming by boat will certainly try and try again, because they have a 75 per cent chance of that 'no' decision being overturned. So noes are routinely turned into yeses if you come by boat. They restored full access to the courts when they took their decision to effectively abolish any of the legal protections for Australia that existed in having excised offshore places. The notion that this government have moved on excising the entire Australian mainland when it comes to whether people have access to the courts is a complete nonsense, because the government had already moved to give them full access to the courts. So they abolished that as well. This government also, in effect, abolished mandatory detention. But they did not do it because they thought it was wrong; they did it because the detention centres were full. The detention centres had become so overwhelmed due to the scale of arrivals that has occurred under this government's failed border policies that they just had to let people out. They had run out of options. They had blown the budget. People who were in centres burnt them down and those involved in riots and all sorts of outrageous behaviour got away scot-free-except for maybe one, possibly two, who were actually convicted for their roles in those offensive and outrageous acts that took place, as Australians looked on and watched detention centres burn to the ground. They abolished mandatory detention and in late 2011 they released people into the community with work rights. I remember warning at the time that this was basically giving those who were seeking to come by boat everything they were looking for-straight off the boat, straight into the community and straight into the opportunity to have work rights, they were getting and continue to get what they paid for. This was the complete removal of every last brick in the wall that John Howard built up as former Prime Minister of this country to ensure we had strong borders. They have knocked that wall down in its entirety. It is all gone. Lately, they have made attempts to try to rebuild what they destroyed but in the rebuilding, having been dragged kicking and screaming, they have shown neither the conviction nor the competence to put those measures back in place, at least in terms of the Pacific solution. I briefly mention again this government abolishing mandatory detention. They have now embarked on a system of release into the community that has no safeguards, no guidelines and no protocols to not only protect those who are released into the community but also provide appropriate protections for the community itself. A few weeks ago, I made the point that the government's lack of guidelines and processes around their community release program needed to be addressed-it does need to be addressed and it still needs to be addressed. This government will not address it. Their policy now on community release is 'out of sight, out of mind'. Their policy on community release is 'no care, no responsibility'. So we have seen every last brick in John Howard's wall of border protection knocked down by this government. What has been the result of all this? We know that former Prime Minister Rudd started the boats and we know that Prime Minister Gillard has been unable to stop them, and she will never be able to, because this Prime Minister and her government lack both the policy and the resolve to address this issue, as has been demonstrated. The result has been chaos, cost and tragedy. The result has been that more than 30,000 people have arrived illegally by boat, on over 580 boats, ever since this government was elected; over 1,000 people are dead in the water; over $5 billion in budget blow-outs since the last election alone and over $6 billion since they were elected; and 8,100 people who would have otherwise got a permanent protection visa under our refugee and humanitarian program, our offshore program, did not get those visas. They were left out-out of sight, out of mind. No visas for those who are waiting in places around the world in desperate situations that, frankly, none of us could really imagine unless you have physically been to some of those places-and I have seen some of those places first hand. In the latest statistics which have been released by the department for the year 2011-12, 10,384 Afghans made applications under our offshore refugee humanitarian program. Of those, 712 received a visa-just seven per cent. Of the 2,058 people from Afghanistan who arrived illegally by boat and had their claims assessed in that same year, 96 per cent of them received permanent visas. So under Labor's policies if you are an Afghan seeking asylum you are 13.7 times more likely to get a permanent visa if you get on a boat rather than apply offshore. Why wouldn't you get on a boat under this government, frankly? If they are the odds-13.7 times more likely-then that is called a people smugglers' product. It is in high demand and will continue to be if it is 13.7 times more likely. The number of permanent visas given to Afghans who arrived illegally by boat was three times higher than the number given to offshore applicants from Afghanistan. Three times more visas, in absolute numbers, were given to those who came here illegally by boat than to those who had applied offshore. That is despite the fact that there were five times the number of applicants offshore. But they are out of sight, out of mind. This government is favouring those who have come by boat, through their process, their decisions and their abolition of the measures that worked under the Howard government. According to the most recent stats from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for the 2011-12 year, 40,000 offshore applicants were rejected and did not get visas last year. That is 85 per cent. That is compared to nine per cent of rejections for those who turned up on boats. Under Labor's policy, people coming on boats are getting what they paid for. There is nothing that will underpin a business model better than that. They are guaranteeing the result through the evidence I have put before you. For those who seek to come on a boat, under this government it makes eminent sense, even at the risk to their own lives. The odds of getting that permanent visa are significant. They are significantly greater than if you apply offshore through the more regular process, as tens of thousands do. It is often put to me: 'But they can't apply offshore.' Over 10,000 Afghans applied offshore in 2011-12. Seven per cent of those got a visa. This bill is designed to take permanent residence off the table for those who come to Australia illegally by boat. This bill is about putting back in place this key measure-while I hope the government would adopt all the measures, I know that is a forlorn hope-and ensuring that permanent residence is not something that will go on the table. The measures are twofold. The first of those measures enables those who have come directly and have entered Australia illegally by boat or otherwise to be eligible for only a temporary protection visa, and that temporary protection visa would have attached to it certain rights. Those rights would include things like the ability to work. The difference between a temporary protection visa and a bridging visa is that a temporary protection visa is exactly that-temporary. It is given at the end of the process where someone has been found by the process to be a refugee. A bridging visa is given to someone who has not been found to be a refugee as yet. In fact, no-one who has arrived since 13 August last year and is out there in the community today has had their claim even assessed, let alone determined. A temporary protection visa would go to those who had completed the process. A temporary protection visa would be given to someone not at the expense of someone who has come through the proper method through an offshore application. The coalition's policy delinks the two programs. Not one permanent protection visa offered under our system will be given to someone who has directly arrived by boat. The government system takes those visas out of the same pool, so everyone who continues to come by boat will continue to take a visa from someone who has applied offshore. That is the government's policy. Our policy of temporary protection visas does not do that. Our policy separates the two. The other thing our policy does, which is encapsulated in this bill, is that it puts a statutory bar on permanent residence for anyone who has come through a country where they could have made application to have their refugee status assessed-a secondary mover as it is known. So someone who had that opportunity, in Indonesia or Malaysia, for example, if they were found to be a refugee if they arrived in Australia and were in the position of gaining a temporary protection visa, there would be a statutory bar against that person going onto permanent residence and, therefore, obviously citizenship as well. These are the sorts of measures you need that we had in place last time that were part of the overall package of measures that ensured that the boats stopped coming as they did-it is a fact; they did. It was the result. It was the purpose of those measures, and those measures achieved that purpose. I contrast that to the measures that the government has put in placemeasures that abolished it all, changed it all, removed it all-and the consequences have been chaos, cost and tragedy. The government should today, I think, be as boisterous in talking up their abolition of all these measures as they were in 2007, if they really believe it, if they thought that was the right idea. But if they do that then they need to take responsibility for the results: 33,962 people turning up on 582 boats; more than a thousand people dead in the water; more than 8,000 people denied permanent visas who are waiting offshore and languishing in camps around the world and other places; and more than $5 billion in budget blow-outs as a result of their failures. The government should be accountable for those failures. (Time expired) is going to be totally ineffective. This is a guise from an opposition who is not prepared to support the government in defending Australian jobs with regard to a long overdue attempt to bring in further stipulations on 457 visas, an opposition whose total dereliction of duty led to the worse abuse in the Australian immigration system: the blow-out of the international student intake led to racist attacks in this country and more extreme elements of the Indian media because a person stabbed his wife to death; because a friend of a family in Melbourne was responsible for the death of a child; and because Indian nationals in the Riverina were seemingly murdered by their employers in a dispute over wages. This country was ostracised, attacked and hailed as racist in India because of the mess created by the previous government. They will not take responsibility for the that dereliction of duties but what they are trying to do is increase wariness in the Australian population, to increase a sense of worry and terror: that we cannot trust people coming into this country by boat. We saw this more recently with regard to the rather flamboyant suggestions that whenever an asylum claimant is released into society the local police should be told. The local community should be advised, despite the fact that the statistics, the real world, says that the level of criminality committed by asylum seekers in this country is far lower than the general population. What we are seeing today is a rather perverse attempt to give some cover to a policy they know will fail. The previous speaker spoke about the numbers of people in recent years who have entered by boat. He said 'It's a fact that the boats stopped' because of their policies. In the year of the introduction of the temporary protection visa measure and the two years after that, 12,000 people came by boat. Yes, the number of boats eventually declined; but, if it is to be connected with this policy, it would seem to have had a very long term impact, as it was not traceable in any measure for about two years afterwards. One would have thought, from his account, that these people sitting around the coffee shops in Jakarta would have picked up the message earlier. This is again an indication that the level of boats coming to this country is very much to do with what is happening in countries overseas in regards to human rights abuses, racism, discrimination, torture and murder, than it does to do with the policies within this country itself. I attended a function on the weekend related to the 20,000 Pakistani Shia that have been murdered by bombings and direct assassinations over the last few years. This is the kind of reality that drives the boat arrivals. It has very little to do with these so-called cure-all policies that the opposition come forward with. Yes, they have a problem with the large numbers of boats coming to this country, but they do not have the solution. Temporary protection visas are another example of when they did not have a policy.",243,Bills
209,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (13:12,"The previous speaker well knows that thisOne of the brilliant outcomes of their policy-and the member for Cook did refer to those boats, and I talked about the boats that kept coming after the introduction of this policy-was to stop family reunions. What did we see as a result of that? In 1999, 12 per cent of claimants coming here by boat from Iraq and Afghanistan were women and children. It was a magnificent accomplishment on their part because, two years later, the number of children and women coming by boats increased from 12 to 42 per cent. It was augmented. Because people were not allowed to bring their families here, they started to come by boat, endangering themselves and leading to tragic events such as SIEVX in October 2001, where three-quarters of the 353 people who drowned-dead because of those policies-were women and children. This is just a guise, a pretence: they are so brilliant and know so much about this policy area that they alone in the world can stop the movement of people. Europe faces it, North America faces it, but they alone in international leadership are going to accomplish the end of this. They know it is not true and they know that, in reality, the arrival of people by boats and in planes is related to what is happening in their homeland. It is not traceable to the level of poverty and socioeconomic problems in the country, although that is a factor. Clearly, people coming here in these boats, as I said the other day, originate from countries where there are very real and continuing human rights abuses. We have seen in the last week a degree of truthfulness from the opposition. They are confident that they will win the next election, so they have to soften up the electorate for the reality of their election. Up to now it has been unquestionable: 'We will stop the boats coming. No problems; we will do it within weeks.' While the Leader of the Opposition previously said that he would stop the boats within months, last week we saw the him suddenly retreat from that comment, saying that he would only be able to 'make a difference'. He said: We can make a difference from the first few weeks. He was going to stop them despite the advice from the Navy, despite the dangers to Australian service personnel and reservists in those boats. He was above that. He knew everything. They were wrong-just like Angus Houston, former Chief of the Defence Force, was wrong in regards to his expert advice! The naval personnel who commented on this issue were wrong, and he was going to stop the boats! However, the shadow minister commented on Andrew Bolt's program-a friendly interview, as usual-on 2GB on 13 March that he could not confirm the length of time a coalition government would take to stop the boats. So it is 'we're going to have some impact within a period of time' from the opposition leader, and 'we basically won't confirm the length of time' from the shadow spokesperson. He said that, rather, they would be aiming to stop the boats; they would be aiming to move them back to the levels of Howard government, and we know the levels under the Howard government varied at different times. When he was pressed a bit more-because Andrew Bolt is very enthusiastic about stopping the boats-the member for Cook said that the coalition government would reduce the number of boats to Howard levels in its first term, and he commented, 'I am not making any forecasts.' He is making such forecasts. He is 'not putting time frames on it'. These people supposedly, allegedly, have solutions to a major problem in this country that people are concerned about. In electorates like my own, people are quite concerned about the number of boats, the number of claimants. The opposition are trying to intimate to the electorate that they can solve this problem. Now, as an election gets closer, all of a sudden they are saying, 'We're going to try, we're going to make an effort; we're going to do something about it,' but with no definite position, as I said earlier. If we look at the history of TPVs, this supposed solution to everything actually led to very few people who were given temporary protection visas getting on planes back to their homeland. Of the recipients of TPVs issued between their introduction in 1999 and 2008, when the incoming government-widely advised by experts in the field-abolished this harsh policy, 88 per cent had already been granted permanent status. Eighty-eight per cent of the people on TPVs-the supposed solution to the problem, the so-called dissuasive policy which was going to stop people paying smugglers and stop people coming on boats-had already been granted permanent status. So one wonders what kind of disincentive that really was. Of the remaining 1,000, 815 were to be granted permanent status after that. The truth about TPVs-which the opposition have not really been too keen on putting in neon lights for the Australian public-is that only 3.4 per cent, or 379, of the people on them actually departed the country. After all the boats, all the people coming and all the claimants in this system-this process of leaving people in a limbo land of uncertainty for years-only 379 people departed the country. The TPVs did not stop the boats. The boats kept coming at a fairly high level for another two years. They were a spectacular failure in terms of achieving the stated deterrent objective, with a successive rise in the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals after TPVs. Then, at the end of the day, a very miserly proportion of the people on TPVs actually departed the country. As I say, this legislation is just a guise, a pretence that the opposition have got a policy to be effective against these boats. Whilst the Prime Minister of the country today will take it up to the visiting President of Burma in regard to human rights issues, particularly in relation to the Rohingya people in the Rakhine state of Burma, we cannot have any faith in the Leader of the Opposition taking up this issue with Indonesian authorities, the people that we have to get cooperation with. He has had two visits there. As I indicated last week, he might have discussed lumpia, gado gado and satay peanut sauce with the Indonesian President, but there was one issue that the Leader of the Opposition did not discuss. It is the central issue, the biggest problem in the country, according to the opposition, but he did not manage, in those discussions, to at any stage talk about the fact that Australia, under him, would send the boats back. One would have thought that the Indonesians might not be impressed with that idea, that they might have been somewhat hostile and might have given a message back to the opposition leader. One would have thought that he actually should get the cooperation of Indonesia and other countries in this region for a regional solution to the question of boat movements. But no. He went up there and he discussed everything under the roof except the central policy the opposition have, of sending the boats back. One has to doubt their sincerity about this policy, as one has to doubt their sincerity today about TPVs. Quite frankly, I do not think we can have much faith in the shadow minister for foreign affairs taking it up. We saw the rather depressing, to put it mildly, performance that she put up in Sri Lanka recently, where she alone of international visitors, including world leaders, who have been there and commented found that basically all things are great there: 'There are no problems in Sri Lanka at the moment. It's all cool. Basically there are no reasons that these boats would be coming.' This is in contrast to the British government, which has actually been able to make some analysis of problems there. This is a policy which is not going to succeed. It is not meant to succeed. It is not serious. But it is a policy which would bring great suffering to individuals. It is unparalleled in the Western world, a group of nations we associate with aspirations of human rights and dignity. They are saying that a person that they themselves determine to be a genuine claimant, to have grounds for protection, will only be temporarily protected and that that would be reviewed in another three years. They will have no rights to bring their family. As I say, they have been determined to have grounds, and in most cases their families are either marooned in a foreign land, unprotected from livelihood issues, or they might still be back in their homeland enduring the kinds of human rights abuses that have been found to be correct grounds by Australia. Those people will not be given permanent protection-unlike in the rest of the Western world. We can only surmise where that is going to lead: regardless of whether the family themselves will endure the same temporary visa in this country, they will seek reunion; they will seek to get together again, no matter what the laws of this country are. This is a policy from an opposition that has been particularly derelict in protection of this country's national interest with regard to a variety of measures, including to do with international students, where their closest associates when they administered this policy were shonky migration agents in the Punjab and shonky conductors of colleges in this country. This undermined our technical education and then led to our current problem of having to do something about 457 visas because the previous government did nothing about technical education, nothing about skills shortages, nothing about spending money on infrastructure to develop industry in this country. Instead, they relied totally on short-term visa entrants. This policy for TPVs should be rejected. It is meant to basically give some kind of wink to the Australian public that they have some solutions-solutions which failed previously. They are solutions which essentially led to only three per cent of the people-the big signal was, 'We're going to send them back'-leaving the country; the other 97 per cent of people who received TPVs under their previous regime stayed here permanently. That is no disincentive; it is just show. Debate adjourned Sitting suspended from 13:27 to 16:00 His Holiness Pope FrancisI Debate resumed. relation to Pope Francis. On behalf of all the people of North Queensland, including the very large Catholic fraternity, I wish him all the best. Pope FrancisI was born in Buenos Aires and raised in Buenos Aires. It is a tremendous thing for the church and it is a tremendous thing for Catholics everywhere that you can have a Pope from there. I was talking to a number of Catholic friends of mine over the weekend. As the Pope was standing up there, I was thinking of him as a young man going to the seminary or as a school",247,Bills
210,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (16:00,"I rise to speak on the Prime Minister's motion inboy, and I think that a teacher might have told him that he would never amount to anything or something like that. As he stepped forward to receive the accolades of the church and all the Christians that have followed him, I was wondering what his internal voice had to say to that grade 3 teacher? What did that internal voice actually stand up there and say? Was he wearing inside his heart a little 'I heart me' T-shirt? The Catholic priests in Townsville are a great bunch. We have Father Rod at Wulguru, Father Mick at St Joseph's the Strand and Father Dave Lancini at Ryan Catholic College are the three I know the best. We also have Bishop Michael Putney. Bishop Michael Putney has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is a tremendous bloke. To see these men carry on with their normal duties fills your heart with joy with what it is to be a Christian. I have spoken to Bishop Michael Putney in relation to the good Samaritan and about the reference to that story in the 'I have been to the mountain top' speech by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, where he says, 'I am fearing no man', 'I fear no evil' and 'I have been to the mountain top and I have seen the Promised Land'. The way the bishop Michael Putney has been confronted with this terrible disease, the way that he handles his pain, the way he handles his illness; he knows the end is there and he has absolutely no fear; he is completely and utterly calm and at peace. It is a true lesson to all of us as to what a Christian should be. He is a great big man, six foot five, and long and skinny. He still walks every day. He is a tremendous human being. He has been incredibly involved with the diocese of North Queensland and all of North Queensland, out as far as Mount Isa and Camooweal and up to the tip of the gulf. He has been to Papua New Guinea. He is a true representative of the church. Pope Francis is lucky to have someone like that doing his missionary work for him in North Queensland and setting the standard for the Catholic Church in North Queensland. To use an analogy, he has thrown open the windows of the Catholic Church. I am not catholic, but my wife and all my children are. We go to mass as often as we can. But to be in the presence of someone who is facing such mortal fear at such a terrible dark time in his life-to be at that time and still have such fantastic faith. Pope Francis has stood up there and said, 'Please, pray for me'. You have to sit there and think to yourself just how fantastic these men are-the work they do in our community; the work they do for us. If the Pope can do half of what these guys are doing, then by jingo he must be a great bloke. I wish him all the best. congratulate the new pontiff, Pope Francis I. It is a particularly special day when any pontiff is elected. It is a special day for many in our community. On behalf of the parishioners of Our Lady Queen of Peace, Greystanes; Holy Spirit, St Clair; Our Lady of the Rosary, Fairfield; Mary Immaculate, Mosely Park; and Our Lady of Victories, Horsley Park, and as their representative in this House, I want to congratulate Pope Francis on his election and commemorate this very significant day in the life of the Catholic Church. I also make this statement as a representative of many Australians of South American heritage-Argentinians and those from other nations of South America, many of whom have made their home in my electorate. It is an extraordinarily proud day for them. Pope Francis is also the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere. As a Southern Hemisphere nation, that is something that we can take some pride in. Australia and Argentina may be a long way from each other, but nevertheless, we share much in common, including being significant nations of the Southern Cross. I am sure that other members would join with",250,Statements On Indulgence
211,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (16:03): I also rise to pay my respects andme in saying that it is a significant moment that we have a pope from the Southern Hemisphere. Pope Francis is also the first Jesuit pope. The Jesuits have of course played such a vital role in the life of the church in Australia when it comes to education and spreading the word of the church. The Jesuits have been a very significant part of the Australian church, and I am sure there are many Australian Catholics and followers of the Jesuit tradition who are very excited by the fact that we now have the first Jesuit pontiff. Pope Francis is, as has been much noted, a man of the people, taking the name of St Francis of Assisi-the saint who was born of nobility yet renounced his inheritance to minister to the poor and the sick and founded the Franciscan order of the Poor Clare nuns. Franciscans take a vow of poverty, seeking to live life as Christ did. Pope Francis has made that very, very clear by his words and his actions in his first days as pontiff. In those first days he has spread the message of the approach that he intends to take as Pope, never forgetting the poor-as was said to him by the Cardinal of Brazil, who, in the moments after he was elected to the position of pope, said not to forget the poor. That was reflected in the taking of the name of St Francis and in the words and actions of His Holiness since his election as Pope. I am sure that, at the appropriate time, we will welcome the new Pope to Australia. We will welcome him as a man of great faith, as a leader of one of the world's great faiths, as a man much loved and respected throughout the world-a pope of firsts and a pope of the people. On behalf of my community, I congratulate His Holiness on his elevation to the papacy. asked the people of the world to pray for him, and the Bishop of Wagga Wagga, Gerard Hanna, agreed that it was very important to do this. He said: 'We need to pray for the Pope and for the church. This is a critical time in his life and that of the church.' Bishop Hanna said the election brings with it a 'fresh vision' to the position and to the faith globally and noted: He is obviously someone, from what I've read and seen, who can relate to people and nations. He is notable in his own city for the humble way he conducts himself and reaches out to all, the everyday, ordinary person and especially to the poor. He is well suited to the role. He has a strong social conscience. The Riverina has a significant Catholic presence. In the 2011 census the Wagga Wagga Catholic diocese, which covers 62,160 square kilometres-incorporating much of the Riverina electorate-had 63,367 Catholics of the 196,055 total population in that area. The diocese includes 27 primary schools and five high schools. The bishop has a lot of territory to cover and a large flock to tend. It is a microcosm of sorts of the church as a whole, with Pope Francis, the Lord's Shepherd, looking after 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. From what we have seen and heard, the new Pope will reach out to many more people besides, given his commitment to the poor and the down-trodden. The name he selected for his papacy is popular amongst many Catholics in the Wagga Wagga diocese. I attended the St Patrick's Catholic debutante ball at Ganmain on Friday night, where the Pope's election was the subject of considerable discussion. All agreed the name 'Francis' was a good choice. That is understandable in the Riverina and especially at Ganmain, given that one of the town's most famous sons is the Most Reverend Francis Carroll, a now retired Australian metropolitan archbishop, who was the fifth Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canberra-Goulburn, serving between 1983 until his retirement in 2006. He was",251,Statements On Indulgence
212,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (16:07,"In his address from the balcony, Pope Francisordained a priest in Saint Brendan's Catholic Church, Ganmain, in 1954 and became a bishop at the age of just 37, serving the Wagga Wagga diocese from 1968 to 1983. He was and still is greatly loved and respected across the Riverina, and many Riverina baby boys of the era when he was the local priest and bishop, me included, were given Francis as a first or second Christian name in honour of Father Frank, as many still affectionately refer to him in Ganmain and district. Perhaps the same naming trend will be done on a much wider scale now that the Argentinian Jesuit cardinal priest Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been installed as the 266th pope, head of the church, and sovereign of the Vatican city state, and taken the name Francis. In doing so the new pope took the name of the Middle Ages saint, Saint Francis of Assisi, because he was especially concerned with the well-being of the poor, and that is to be commended. We all wish the new pope all the very best. May God bless him in his work, not just amongst the Catholics of the world but indeed in his global mission throughout his entire papacy. community, welcomed the appointment of Pope Francis. Recently, I took the opportunity in parliament to speak on the achievements of Pope Benedict XVI but also to speak about the decision that he took to retire in order to leave the church in good and cogent hands. Like most Catholics, I have certainly followed the speculation associated with the papal conclave as cardinals from all around the world got together to determine a new pope. As to the election of the pope, it is truly a historic and monumental event, particularly when the person who is selected as pope will and does lead 1.2 billion Catholics around the world. The conclave decision was truly impressive. The election of the archbishop of Argentina, Jorge Bergoglio, was truly inspiring, not only for Catholics but for the global community. He was born in Buenos Aires, the son of a railway worker. He is truly someone who grew up in a working-class family. From all accounts, he is a very humble man. He is known for his personal humility and his social conservatism. But he is certainly staunchly committed to human rights. Pope Francis is a man who has known a simple life. I have had the opportunity, as most members have, over the last week since his appointment on 13 March to read a little about the man who, regrettably, I have to say I knew little of. As cardinal of Buenos Aires, he lived in a small apartment rather than what we have all become used to seeing-a cardinal or an archbishop in a palatial bishop's residence. He gave up a chauffeured vehicle in favour of travelling on public transport. And apparently, as I read, he cooks his own meals. I gather that, as becoming a pope, some things may have to change in that respect, but I think it does show a man of absolute personal humility. In my community, I know the appointment of Pope Francis was very much welcomed. He was seen to be a people's choice, a person from an ordinary background-a background which was not that unfamiliar to many of the people I represent. As I say, he grew up as the son of a railway worker in very much a working-class family. And he has over that period of time championed issues associated with the poor. To that extent, the parishes in my community truly welcomed his elevation and election to pope. I have certainly read a lot about the views of others around the world, and the views of other faiths, but from people who actually knew the man. I read recently from the Protestant community in Argentina one authority saying that the Pope's approach was one of building",252,Statements On Indulgence
213,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (16:10,"I, like many Catholics and non-Catholics in ourrelationships and showing respect, knowing the differences but focusing on what can be agreed on: the divinity of Jesus, his virgin birth, his resurrection and the second coming. Another said that Pope Francis could set the tone for more compassionate dialogue between Catholics and Protestants. The Anglican bishop of Argentina, Gregory Venables, described the Pope as a devout Christian and a good friend to Anglicans. The statement from the Lutheran Church also praised Cardinal Bergoglio's work in Argentina and particularly work that he did in association with the Lutheran Church. The Orthodox Church, which I know you are very familiar with, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Georganas, praised him for his efforts to further close the nearly 1000-year-old estrangement between the Orthodox churches. Father Antoni Cevruk, rector of the Russian Orthodox Church of St Catherine the Great Martyr in Rome, said that Cardinal Bergoglio often visited the Orthodox services in the Russian Orthodox Annunciation Cathedral in Buenos Aires and he is known as an advocate of the Orthodox Church in Argentina's government. Similarly I have seen things written on close ties he has enjoyed in Argentina with the Jewish community. The same also applies with respect to the leaders of the Islamic faith. The leaders of the Islamic community in Buenos Aires indicated that they welcomed the news of the cardinal's elevation as Pope, noting that he has always shown himself a friend of the Islamic community and a person whose position is pro-dialogue. In a world of great change and great challenge it is refreshing to know that we still have people of true humility who are truly committed to their faith and also are committed to delivering on positive outcomes for people, particularly the poor. One of the things I have seen written constantly about Pope Francis is that he is really down to earth. As I said, he was known in Buenos Aires as a cardinal who took the bus and public transport and on the night of his election as Pope on 13 March he also elected to take the bus with his fellow cardinals back to the hotel rather than taking up the trappings of the new papal vehicle. I think that probably says as much about the man as anything else. The fact that he chose to take the name Francis after Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscans and patron saint of the poor, I think shows the direction that this Pope intends to take our church. To my Catholic community in the parishes of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Mount Pritchard, St John the Baptist in Bonnyrigg, St Theresa's in Cartwright, Sacred Heart in Cabramatta, the Good Shepherd in Hoxton Park and St Nikola Pavelic of St Johns Park, and to all Catholics in our community, I think the wait for seeing change in a church in a challenged society is now over. I look forward to Pope Francis making ground and healing many of the difficulties and differences we have around the globe, renewing the focus on addressing the issues confronting our poor. opportunity to say a few words about the elevation of the archbishop of Buenos Aires to the role of pope. I think we all remember where we were on significant dates in history-where we were on the morning, as it was in Australia, that President John Kennedy was shot; when the planes flew into the World Trade Centre on 9/11; and when Princess Diana was killed in the tunnel in Paris. Those sorts of things resonate with us, as indeed did this with me. It was early in the morning and I was listening to Geraldine Doogue on the radio from Rome and she said, 'There is white smoke.' SoI jumped out of bed and turned on the television to soak up",253,Statements On Indulgence
214,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:19): I welcome thisthe moment. Indeed, for people who had been standing in the rain in Rome, it must have been quite a momentous occasion. This was a bit different from the election of previous popes. The methodology was still the same, but two great forces of humility came into play: the first one was that the retiring Pope, Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger, felt that he could no longer carry out the role in the form it needed to be carried out-that he could not give it the rigour that it required. That was an incredibly courageous act, to stand down. I think there is almost a belief amongst Catholics that the Pope has to die in harness. I do not mean that disrespectfully, but there is a great sense that he is such a person apart from others that the idea of resignation is unthinkable. But when you take a step back and put yourself in Benedict XVI's shoes, you can see that it was a very courageous move that he made, and he gave his cardinals about a month to start thinking about it. So they did not go into this conclave, as with many other ones, with a sense of grief at the loss of the last Pope and a sense of bewilderment. But the last Pope, by the very nature of his resignation, presented them with another challenge: the challenge of where to take the church. When you saw the media shortlists, the current Pope was mentioned in one or two and he was-so we are told; it is all supposed to be terribly confidential-the runner-up last time. But for most Catholics, it was quite a surprise. Again we had seen the humility of Benedict XVI, on the one hand, and now this man's first approach to the people was one of great humility in asking people to pray for him. You can see that that strain of humility comes through in many ways: that he felt more comfortable being on the bus going to work in Buenos Aires, or cooking a meal at home-I would not be up to that; I am hopeless at that sort of thing, and, for a guy to put in a full day's work in the church and then to come home and have to cook dinner, he must be a man of many parts. And, as the member for Fowler said, for him to go in the minibus with the cardinals, and go to pay his bill-while some might say, 'They are just symbolic gestures,' they are a series of symbolic gestures that characterise where he is coming from. He is not wearing a radiant gold cross; he wears the iron cross that he brought with him from South America. As well as being a Pope of humility he is a Pope of many firsts. He is the first Jesuit Pope. There has been a bit of tension-not always but in many periods of the church's historybetween the Jesuits and the papacy. In fact, at times the head of the Jesuits was often referred to as the 'Black Pope'. It was almost unthinkable in some ages that a Jesuit could be a Pope, so this is not just a first but a real first. It signifies intellect, it signifies healing and it signifies rigour. He comes from Italian parentage, so that creates a link with many Italians to whom the papacy is terribly important. He comes, as the member for Werriwa said, from a railwayworking family, so he has known what it is like to grow up in a working household. He is the first Pope from outside Europe for nearly 1,000 years. He is the first Pope ever from the Southern Hemisphere, which is something that countries like ours, New Zealand, the other South American countries and South Africa can take some pride in. Perhaps, if he comes from Argentina, he knows a bit about Rugby Union, so that might be something we can indulge him with if he comes to Australia. The important thing is that he takes the church in hand. As a man of great piety and great humility, it is important that he exercises that intellectual capacity and that rigour for which the Jesuits are known and brings them into the church at a time when its administration has been called into question and its determination to bring paedophilia to heel has been very much in the news. I am sure he will be up to that. I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President of the Catholic Bishops Conference in Melbourne, Archbishop Hart, and the Cardinal in Sydney will make sure that this Pope gets an early invitation to visit Australia. He is a person who obviously does not stand on trappings and ceremony, and I am sure a person of that background will resonate very strongly with Australians. I wish him God's blessing. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (16:28): I commence my remarks on Pope Francis with his words that will, I think, be a signature to the time that he leads this great church which I am happy to have been a part of since my birth, through my family, and from baptism right through to my own children and their baptisms and their upbringing in the faith. Those words with which he commenced his welcomes were, 'Brothers and sisters, hello.' I really believe that such a view of the world that is based on the relationship, acknowledging one another as brothers and sisters who share this planet and who share our lives in community, is a great signifier of the way in which this Pope is going to lead us. As a student who attended Catholic education throughout my entire primary and secondary schooling I was very fortunate to grow in my faith not only in terms of the example of the people with whom I lived in community at school but also through the education that I received about a church that is always changing and reflecting its own times. I lived through the time when the Vatican II occurred and the significant changes that this wrought for the church. There was much grief, loss and change but there was also renewal of the church at that time. We can read from the community reactions already to this new pope a sense that this is indeed a time of renewal for us. He is the first pope from outside Europe and also the first pope to take the name Francis. One of the most exciting things I remember we all used to talk about, when confirmation came around, was the time of selecting the name for our confirmation in the faith. There were a couple of books-one for the boys with all the boy saints, and one for the girls with all the girl saints-that were sold at the back of the church. In fact, they often got passed around in the classes when we were doing our preparation for confirmation. Who would you choose to inspire you, whose model of life? This is one of the things all religions around the world provide-examples of lives, lived very well, on which we can model our own aspirations to live a good life. I know that Saint Francis was incredibly popular, as a name, because he had such an affinity with animals. As young children, if you are lucky enough to have a pet, you have the sense of care that a pet can engender. Saint Francis is somebody we in the broad community know. I dare say there is many an Australian who has never have heard of the name Clement and has no idea of its meaning, but they would know about Saint Francis of Assisi and the life he lived. He rejected the high life and the wealth into which he was born and chose to live a contemplative life and to put himself outside the popular. He chose to live a life of simplicity and service. His life was in a time when there was a lack of awareness of the environment. Perhaps that is exactly the reason the Pope was inspired to choose the name Francis. In media reports we heard that, as it looked like he was about to be elected, one of his confreres turned to him and said, 'Do not forget the poor.' At that moment, by report, our new pope said he became aware that Francis would be his choice. Francis was indeed one of the great heroes of the church and a great man who established his own order that continues to this day. The Pope's words 'Thank you for your welcome and for your prayers' at the conclusion of his first communication with the masses, with a request of 'Pray for me', are an expression of his simplicity. He requested it simply, the need for spiritual awareness and support from the broader community. We all need that in the journeys that we go on. Thankfully in Australia, these days, we acknowledge the spirituality of our Indigenous people. Every time we speak, every time we gather, we are beginning to acknowledge our elders and their connection with the land and that spiritual dimension that is part of the life of each person. As a Jesuit in Buenos Aires, in Argentina, the Pope has a long history of having looked for ways to connect with the poor, reaching just outside the church. I heard a report on the radio, a couple of days ago, of a young priest who was looking to work with the people on the delta. These were profoundly poor communities. He was unable to get support from his own parish and diocese in the region. He reached out to our new pope who, even though he was outside that region, provided the funds to enable social agencies within those communities to do their work. This is another model of church that excites me as a Catholic in this country. It is not the church in place of community but the church in partnership with community, which the Pope has already modelled in his own life and practice. I want to take this opportunity to put on the record some reactions from two very fine institutions, two schools in my electorate. One is St Joseph's college, at East Gosford, which is a wonderful institution supporting the development of many young women, on the Central Coast, in the Catholic tradition. This is a reflection from their principal, Stephen Walsh. He has put it in these terms: The announcement of Pope Francis brings great joy and hope to all Catholics around the world and especially to young Australian Catholics. As the Cardinal of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis demonstrated through his humble actions a real commitment to social justice and the poor. In many ways, Pope Francis demonstrated similar qualities to Mary MacKillop, Australia's first saint, by living his faith and commitment to Jesus through service to the poor. Students at St Joseph's Catholic College East Gosford reflected on the Pope's humble approach to and concern for all people which provides inspiration to the girls in their continuing social justice work on the NSW central coast. College captain Bethany Friar said ""Pope Francis's actions so far have demonstrated the genuine humility that he brings to his papacy and that he appears to be a man of the people in asking the people to pray for him"". Happily not too far away-just across the playground-is St Edward's, a Christian Brothers college on the Central Coast, which provides a fine education for young Catholic men and for those boys from our area whose parents want them educated in the Catholic tradition. Indeed, my own son attends St Edward's. I asked the social justice leader in the school, Mr Patrick Dell, for his reactions. He put in this way: Our new pope brings the prospect of great hope for our Catholic Church. As Cardinal in Argentina he proved himself a great advocate for Social Justice, challenging his Catholic people there to give their money to the poor rather than doing a pilgrimage to Rome. The Catholic Option for the Poor is a key direction for him. He has been portrayed in the media as 'living the simple life' and this resonates well with many Catholics as it makes him seem more connected to us. Our new pope asked the people to pray for him -this act of humility and service will always be popular as it positions him as a 'leader of the people'. Pope Francis appointment as our new Catholic leader has been well received by all the people I have spoken to. Why? I sense many people feel a new breath of fresh air has entered our Church. Catholic Church Option for the Poor and a clear vision to help people living on the edge may become reality. In closing, I want simply to put my mother's observation. I spent St Patrick's Day in celebration with her on Friday. We didn't get to see each other on Saturday but on Sunday we continued in the family tradition of really enjoying St Patrick's Day, with all the Irish culture and tradition that wraps around that. My mother was very pleased to have come into her parish of St John the Evangelist at Campbelltown a wonderful priest by the name of Father Healy. Father Healy is a very simple, loving man who really cares for his parishioners-he has a great smile. My mother's summation of the Pope is: 'Just like Father Healy, this new pope has a wonderful warm smile. I feel that we have a simple and loving man as our new pope.' I think that that sums up the sense of our hopes for the future as Catholics and for what this pope will offer. I am very pleased to have been able to put those thoughts on the record today. Debate adjourned. Migration Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (16:38): It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to the report of the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration into multiculturalism in Australia. The committee accepted its terms of reference on 9 February 2011 from the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon. Chris Bowen. It was asked to inquire into the economic, social and cultural impacts of migration and make recommendations to maximise the positive benefits of migration. I was very pleased to take part not in all of the hearings but a large percentage of them. There were a huge number of submissions. Some 513 submissions were received, there were 22 supplementary submissions and 58 exhibits. The committee went all around Australia, in regional areas as well as in metropolitan areas, and conducted some 27 public hearings from 29 March 2011 to 8 June 2012. The committee had very wide-ranging terms of reference. It was asked to look into the economic, social and cultural impacts of migration in Australia and: to make recommendations in three areas-multiculturalism, social inclusion and globalisation; to look at the federal government's social inclusion agenda; and to look at the wonderful diaspora we have been the recipients of in this country, particularly from Australia's relationship with Europe, the UK, the Middle East and our Asia-Pacific neighbours. Other areas that it looked at were settlement participation, particularly settlement programs and how they relate to new migrants, looking into participation and integration into broader Australian society, and also what the incentives are to promote long-term settlement and the greater economic benefits it provides to Australia as a whole. We are a country of great migration, so we looked at the national productive capacity and how that wonderful sense of migration over a long period has helped to build and shape Australia as it is, the role of skilled migration and the role of government initiatives to also help migrant communities and establish business enterprises. I place on record my appreciation to the chair, Ms Maria Vamvakinou, and the deputy chair, Louise Markus. I also want to thank the secretariat for their outstanding work and their diligence. It was a very long inquiry. The member for Hindmarsh is across from me, and he also contributed enormously, as did many other members of the committee of which I was very privileged to be a part. Australia has a rich Indigenous culture that spans many thousands of years and, since Federation, Australia has relied on migration to enhance its international trade and investment flows and to diversify domestic industries and contribute to the overall national productive capacity of the state. Our migration policy has consistently been designed to address both long-term and short-term needs, particularly of the economy, by attracting prospective migrants who possess the skills relevant to Australia's economic demands. Australia has always had an extensive family reunion, humanitarian and refugee migration program. For the last five years alone, Australia has received approximately 13,400 refugees annually. Since its introduction in the 1970s, Australia's policy of multiculturalism has shaped Australia's identity and supported our development as a multiracial, harmonious and very cohesive society. While the concept of multiculturalism has often been subject to debate and review over time, Australia's non-discriminatory migration system supports cultural diversity. We are a multicultural nation with a strong record of peaceful settlement of migrants from all parts of the world. I would not be standing here today if it were not for my Italian forebears who came here in the early 1940s. Ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity has been a feature of Australian society from the beginning of British colonisation in the 18th century. Post-settlement migrants included Malays, Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos and Afghans, as well as the Irish, English, Scots and Germans. Prior to this, the Malaccans and Melanesians had traded and periodically co-located over centuries with Indigenous Australians in the Far North. The end of World War II triggered huge migration to this country. At that time, my grandfather, my grandmother, my father and my mother migrated here. It is quite fitting that today we have the Migration Council of Australia having a wonderful dinner. I know that they will be featuring my family's story in one of their exhibits, along with the stories of many of the members here who come from a culturally and linguistically different background. Since 1945 we have had seven million people from over 180 countries migrate to Australia. That is around one million migrants each decade since 1950. The Australian economy has increased sixfold over that time. Over the last decade, migrants from India, China, the Middle East and the African continent have featured and contributed their linguistic and religious diversity to Australia's culture. In 2010, Australia was one of the world's top three culturally diverse nations: nearly 45 per cent of the population has a close overseas connection when Australians who have one or both parents born overseas are included. Today, over 260 languages are spoken in Australia by people of 270 different ancestries. Census data shows us that more than half of the recent arrivals since 2006 speak both another language and English either very well or well. This language diversity gives Australia a competitive edge in an increasingly transnational world. Despite this great cultural diversity, Australia remains a predominantly Christian and secular society with the largest minority religion being practised by roughly two per cent of the population. I enjoyed the many submissions that were presented to the committee, particularly the ones that were presented in terms of what multicultural policy was. What has changed over the decades has not been the fact of Australia's population diversity, but the different policy frameworks that were developed by government to develop and interpret that diversity. DIAC's statement is that multiculturalism is: … a coordinated long range response to migration patterns that have resulted in diverse people and cultures occupying the same locality, who share the aim of making a home for themselves and their families in a community within a safe, stable and cohesive nation. Over time the term has come to refer to: the demographic fact of cultural diversity; a set of policies, programs and services; as well as a concept that articulates normative ideals about society. Australia's first national policy of multiculturalism followed the recommendations of the Galbally report in 1978. That report was a milestone in the Fraser government, a government that founded the SBS network that we know today and introduced many of the multicultural policies. That Fraser government initiative and that report about migrant services and programs had 14 key principles enunciated, that: … all members of society are to have equal opportunity to realise their potential and have equal access to programs and services; every person to be able to retain his or her culture without prejudice or disadvantage and be encouraged to embrace and understand other cultures; migrants' needs are to be met by mainstream services, but special services and programs are to be in place at first; and there be full consultation with clients in design and operation of services with a focus on migrants becoming self-reliant quickly. That policy represented a distinct shift away from the assimilation approach that dominated in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a new era and a new cultural policy, recognising that migrants could retain their cultural identity and successfully integrate with support over time. In 2011-12, the total number of people that have had citizenship conferred on them in Australia was 95,776, which was up from 85,916 in 2010-11. Australia has one of the highest uptakes of citizenship anywhere in the OECD, with nearly 80 per cent of Australia's population becoming citizens. With all of this work that was done in the past, there is always room for improvements and it is always good to be able to contribute to this particular inquiry. There are areas that the committee recommended needed more work. I fully support the fact that migrants should have access to English classes at every opportunity, and that our AMEP program should be flexible to allow for as many people as possible to learn English. It should be relevant, particularly in enabling many of our migrants to get jobs and have greater linkages to our Job Network providers. There were many submissions provided on skills recognition and the fact we need to do much, much better in that particular area to recognise the incredible skills that people bring-particularly people who have migrated to Australia-and how we need to recognise those skills so that people can work in the area that they have been trained for. There are many areas of federal policy that overlap state policy and it was important to ensure that we work with our state and local government authority to make sure that CALD communities are provided with assistance in every possible way, particularly in housing and in health and aged care. We made a number of recommendations that more work needed to be done in CALD communities, that it needed to be a whole-of-government approach and that the department should advise and integrate with its social inclusion agenda and interact closely with the Multicultural Council in its roles of providing research and advice on multicultural affairs and policy and strengthening that access and equity. It is really important that we have a research unit. There was no doubt that much of our immigration policy has been difficult to formulate because we have not had that independent statutory body that collects information about regional migration and other aspects of the immigration program. All of the committee was in unanimous support that that should be set up to provide accurate and up-to-date data in order to identify trends in migration and multiculturalism and to measure and address CALD-related disadvantage. We need to know how our program is doing. We need to know whether our refugee and humanitarian settlement, particularly in regional areas, is working well. We need to know if employment opportunities have been realised and if people have had good and positive settlement outcomes. It is very important that we establish such an institute and have that up-to-date information. I enjoyed listening to a range of submissions and from a range of multicultural groups providing input particularly on the job network and how the JSA can be made much more outcome-focused in this area. A lot of work needs to done in the area of refugee and humanitarian settlement. It is still a sad fact that after five years there are many original humanitarian program settlers who are still without a job, and I think we need to make sure that we have greater integration of those programs. All in all, the report was very intensive. It took many submissions, and I want to commend again the secretariat for their fine work. I want to thank everyone who took part. I have taken part in a number of reports in this place and I have to say that this report is based on great cooperation between members of all parties. I commend the report and I look forward to the government taking up many of the recommendations. can I thank you, Deputy Speaker, for assisting me in taking the chair so I can have the opportunity to speak on this report from the inquiry into migration and multiculturalism in Australia. Australian multiculturalism is a success story. There is no doubt about that and it was a common theme throughout the inquiry. I have to say it is here to stay with great benefit to our nation. That is the resounding conclusion of this report. I am very glad that we have completed the report and that the report has been tabled. It was a mammoth effort with 32 recommendations, 513 submissions, and 27 public hearings all over the country-regional areas and major cities. It included my own city of Adelaide and a visit in my electorate to the Thebarton Senior College, which assists many migrants to settle into the country. The college assists them through education, training, certificate courses, et cetera. The inquiry was chaired by my colleague, the member for Calwell and the deputy chair was the member for Brisbane, whom we have just heard. I would like to congratulate both of them and the committee for their hard work-and my South Australian colleagues. This committee had a bit of a South Australian edge to it because we formed the majority on the committee. I would like to recognise the member for Grey, who contributed greatly to the report. He is here in the Federation Chamber with us. I also recognise Senator Gallacher, and the member for Makin.",254,Statements On Indulgence
215,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh,"Second Deputy Speaker) (16:53): At the outset of this,It is important to make that point because in South Australia many years ago under Premier Don Dunstan multiculturalism was an area that was recognised well before it was recognised in other parts of Australia. It was good to see so many South Australians on this committee, working on this report. The report is unique in that it has bipartisan support, as we have heard today from the member for Brisbane and from other members on the government side. That is something worth celebrating. Today this report highlights the great degree to which we, as Australians, share the values and the same vision for the future. We agree that multiculturalism in Australia is a very good thing. We agree that migrants and refugees and new arrivals need support in and from our community and we agree that migration enriches our society. We agree that diversity is not something just to be accepted but to be celebrated. We agree that not only is there a role for every Australian in helping to create a welcoming country but that every Australian stands to benefit greatly from doing so. We have seen that throughout the history of Australia with its waves of migrants. It is very encouraging to be here today knowing that whilst there are often heated debates in this Federation Chamber and in the main chamber downstairs, there are also times when we unite to support a common set of principles. Getting to this point has been no easy path. When the inquiry was announced we had hundreds of submissions pouring in from all over Australia, with many, many different views with different solutions and different plans. We all saw that. It was good and that is what diversity is all about-getting all those different views in and listening to all those people have their say. It was the task of this committee to carefully consider every submission in order to craft this report. Having been a committee chair myself, as have many others, I know how important it is to ensure that no stone is left unturned. That is what is so powerful about this report. It is bigger and more comprehensive that any report taken in this area. It will provide a way forward for all of us to consider and to refer to when we are discussing issues of multiculturalism. There are key recommendations, and I was pleased to see that many of them took special care to recognise the uniqueness of multiculturalism as a long-term cultural orientation. The chair of the committee said earlier today, and she said it quite well, 'Settlement is a long-term and intergenerational process. Successful multiculturalism can't and won't happen overnight and Rome wasn't built in a day.' That is so important. Multiculturalism does not happen by accident. It is only through deliberate and constant effort that we have done so well in this country in this area. Successful multiculturalism requires the support of millions of people across our nation: neighbours, for example, extending the hand of friendship over the backyard fence, as has been the case here in Australia for many years; NGOs getting new arrivals set up and settled into their new homes; schoolchildren who welcome people from other lands into their classrooms; government services providing orientation sessions to new migrants; and community groups helping people to navigate confusing landscapes, transport, services, housing, social security and a range of other things. Multilingual media sources keep people informed of important developments in a language that they can understand so they can fit into the community and be able to access services and be part of the community. We see the many sides of multiculturalism-the restaurant owners bringing the taste of their homelands to our kitchen tables, introducing us to new tastes and textures; and musicians playing their songs at festivals and concerts and sharing exotic new sounds with us. As the member of a seat in which well over 100 different languages are spoken and which has many ethnicities, I regularly attend different functions on weekends, and I know that you do as well, Deputy Speaker Symon. There are many different ethnic groups in my electorate. All of this is to be celebrated. So many people are contributing to the fabric, the tapestry, that makes Australia a successful nation. I would like to make a very quick mention of an organisation in my electorate which exemplifies this commitment, and that is Thebarton Senior College. The committee visited the college to speak to people there and to see the things that they do. Thebarton Senior College is like a little global village, with students from all over the world attending it. They are well supported while they learn English and do other courses, including certificate courses, so that they can fit into the community, gain employment and live productive, successful lives and contribute to our nation. It is a magnificent college which does a lot of work in the community. I congratulate Kim Hebenstreit, who is a magnificent principal and so committed to assisting new arrivals to get the services that they require, the training that they require and the certificates that they require in English et cetera so that they can become productive within our society and live, as I said, good lives and contribute to this wonderful nation. Many organisations gave evidence to the committee, and we visited many of them as well. All of them try their hardest to do all that they can to support new arrivals-people with language difficulties and certainly people who, perhaps without these organisations, without these services, would find it very difficult to cope and fit in-and to ensure that they do get employment and access to the services which we spoke about. SoI congratulate all of those people who gave evidence to our inquiry. In looking forward together on these issues, it is quite nice to reflect on how far we have come on the issue of multiculturalism. The difference between where we have come from and where we are today was quite stark during the inquiry. Just as a quick example: in my case, my parents came over in the early fifties. They left Greece to seek a better life in Australia. They had very few English skills. They worked in the lowest-paid jobs that were on offer. In those days, Australia was a very different place from what it is now. I remember quite clearly, as a young child, when they took out their citizenships at the Thebarton council-I still live in the immediate area-and how important that day was. I still have that memory. Certainly, it is something that will stay with me forever and a day. Australia was a very different place in those days, when I think of the period when my parents received their citizenship. Australia still had the white Australia policy. The majority of people who were there that night receiving their citizenship would have been predominantly from Europe, Greece and Italynot the UK, because they did not need to obtain citizenship in those days. So it was a very different place. We have moved on from those days for the better. We know that one in four Australians were born overseas. As I said, there are people from more than 150 countries, and there are more than 200 languages spoken in my electorate alone. It was so important that this report looked at all the issues that affect our migrants, because at the end of the day what affects them affects us as well. We have to do all we can to ensure that we provide the services that are required for those people to lead those productive lives. I know that Australia's strength lies, as I said earlier, in its diversity. In other parts of the world, people are fighting over ancient differences. Our nation grows stronger and stronger every day through its people working harmoniously together. For these reasons, Australia's multiculturalism is an absolute role model for others around the world, and we can all be rightly proud of it. I hope all migrants and refugees feel welcome when they are here and welcome to add their own stories, experiences, energies and talents to our nation and to make the very best contribution that they can. The report that was tabled today in this parliament will do that, and I congratulate all the committee on its tabling today. Australia has been exhaustive. We have been working on this for a very long period-I think close to two years, so pretty much the length of this parliament. Others before me have spoken about the number of hearings we have had around Australia. I will perhaps start where others have finished by thanking the secretariat for their diligent work during this process and the other members of the committee for their high level of cooperation. It was one of those inquiries that had stories within it that touched all of us. There were programs out there that we were all pleased to see and there were failures and the consequences of failures that we collectively deplored. There were 32 recommendations in total, and we have managed after quite some time to come to a unanimous decision to endorse all of the recommendations. I think that is a good thing and a good message to the people of Australia. There are some additional comments by the coalition members who are concerned that some of the recommendations, if they were adopted, may lead to an immediate lift in government expenditure. It is not the time or place in this debate to talk about Australia's economic state and why we are in that position and how we might get out of it. Suffice to say, we were not prepared to support recommendations in the short term that may lead to an increase in government expenditure. Migration and the movement of people around the world is a fact. People can say they are not in favour of migration or they do not want people coming to our country but, in fact, the kind of world we live in, and the connectivity, the movement of people around the planet, including Australians-at any given time, there is anywhere up to a million Australians overseas-means we are integrated in a world where people move at the drop of a hat. We are part of that, and countries that deny that kind of movement to their people are by far the poorer for it. If you look around the world, it is not hard before you find countries that put up barriers at their borders and, generally speaking, they have very poor democratic outcomes. These countries are nearly always poor and far the poorer for the experience. We stand to gain from those that open up to the rest of world at every level, and those countries that do that are the same. Call it what you like. You can call that multiculturalism, which is what we do here in Australia, but there are any other number of names for being welcoming to our friends and neighbours around the world. Some would just call it plain good manners. Some would call it actions within your own interests, but in Australia we call it multiculturalism. It was pointed out to us in the inquiry that the type of multiculturalism that we have adopted in Australia is quite different to many other countries, and some of the difficulties perhaps in Europe at the moment were highlighted. There have been some high-level rejections of multiculturalism within Australia. We recently met with a German member of",261,Committees
216,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (17:05,"The inquiry into migration and multiculturalism inparliament and were talking about the arrangements in Germany. They have had large groups come to Germany on working visas and there they are there generations later and they are still a people apart rather than being a people of Germany. That is not the method we used in Australia. We have said to the people of the world: 'If you come to Australia and meet our migration arrangements, we'll welcome you but we want you to be Australians.' Consequently, people have come here from other countries, including ancestrally-I would say everyone of us in this room has come to call Australia home, not other places. We see this as our first point of allegiance. That is a distinct difference in the way we do things in Australia. By far the highest profile subject within this inquiry is the fact that we got 513 submissions. And in my estimation-and I read through them-roughly 400, or a little less, you would have to say were anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic in tone. Some were thoughtfully so, let me say; some were constructive arguments and put forward in moderation. Others were not, it must be said. That is a cause for concern within itself. Throughout the inquiry I said continually to the other members and senators that we just could not make out that these submissions were not happening, and that we had to address it in the report. I believe we have done so. It is a concern that that number of Australians are worried about Australia's current direction and future direction. But, as I said in my opening remarks, to think that you can just hold back the tide, that you can disassociate yourself from something that you do not particularly like, is foolish. We actually have to concentrate on what we do to make sure that we achieve a good outcome for those people who are feeling unsettled by the immigration patterns, for those who have emigrated here and for the population as a whole, to make sure that we have one community-one community that works together. I believe that we have addressed that within the recommendations. It was also significant that the committee focused on improving English language services and felt that perhaps what we are doing at the moment is not totally adequate, because English language is the tool that unlocks the best of Australia for those who choose to come here. English language proficiency is also an expression, to those in our community who feel uneasy about those people who might be living in our midst, of the newcomers wanting to be part of Australia. So English proficiency is a very important thing for our newcomers to achieve. We should, as a nation, make sure the services are available so they can get those skills and, with those skills, come to better understand the responsibilities of being an Australian-that it is not all one way, and it is not just Australia looking after you; it is about you, the person coming to Australia, adopting Australia as your home and saying, 'This is where I want to be, and I want to be part of your cultural structure.' So English language is an important tool, and I hope that we can do better in that area in the future. We also recommended that an independent institute be established to provide better information, to governments in particular but to all people in the community, about how best to structure those services and address those hot spots. We should make sure that the people who have come here are welcome, feel welcome, want to be culturally part of Australia and, as I said, accept the responsibilities that come with being a citizen of Australia-to endorse our institutions and the way that we wish to operate in Australia, and not to oppose what we consider to be Australian. By and large the report is good. It is certainly large! AndI have to endorse the comments of those people who said that it was a good committee to work on, and I thank the chair for her diligence. I hope that the report will provide some kind of guidance for future governments in Australia to deal with these issues. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 17:14 to 18:30 Superannuation Debate resumed on motion by Mr Stephen Jones: That this House: (1) notes: (a) the growth of self-managed superannuation schemes investment structures by Australians seeking to grow their retirement savings; (b) that there is $1.4 trillion in Australian superannuation assets; (c) self-managed superannuation funds are the largest single sector in superannuation; and (d) the severe hardship caused to investors in Trio Capital, which collapsed as a result of fraudulent activity and which was the largest superannuation fraud in Australian history, with around $176 million lost or missing; (2) acknowledges that while investors in the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) regulated superannuation funds were eligible for compensation through a member-funded levy under Part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, no such member-funded compensation scheme exists for investors in self-managed superannuation schemes; (3) notes the legal and resource limitations regarding supervision and detection of fraud by government regulators and prosecutors such as the APRA, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Federal Police in respect of failed offshore financial investment vehicles; and (4) calls on the: (a) self-managed superannuation sector and policy makers to work together to achieve consensus on the establishment of a member-funded compensation scheme for self-managed superannuation scheme investors who have been subject to fraud; and (b) Government to work with regulators to enhance fraud detection and prevention in the superannuation system. superannuation fraud in Australian history. Around $176 million of superannuation funds were lost and are unlikely to be recovered. Nearly 6,090 Australians invested in Trio and, through Trio, in a number of managed investment schemes. Two hundred and eighty-five of those investors put their money in Trio through self-managed superannuation funds. Self-managed superannuation funds are the largest single sector of Australia's $1.4 trillion superannuation assets and are the fastest-growing sector. Many of the 285 SMSF investors in Trio are located in the Illawarra and, over the course of the last two years-almost the entire time. I have been in this place-the member for Cunningham and I have been meeting with and corresponding with the many men and women who have lost some or all of their life savings as a result of this corporate fraud. That is 285 personal stories of severe financial shock and the ensuing personal devastation that flows from this.",264,Committees
217,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (18:30,"The collapse of Trio Capital was the largestThe facts are stark: by investing in SMSFs they were not eligible for compensation under part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. Most of the SMSF investors I have met have told me they were unaware of the difference between an SMSF arranged investment and APRA regulated superannuation. Indeed, that was the nature of the evidence that was given to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that inquired into this fraud and collapse. It is clear that the SMSF investors in Trio relied heavily on the advice of their financial advisers. They also had confidence in Australia's system of financial regulation. However strong a regulatory system we have, the challenges of dealing with deliberate and complicated, indeed sophisticated, fraud are substantial. This case demonstrates that we need greater fraud detection and prevention measures and I urge the government to work with regulators to take action in this area. Since 2007 Labor has tightened the regulation of the financial services sector by putting in place better protections for consumers. The Future of Financial Advice reforms, the FOFA reforms, have implemented a number of important measures which, if they had been in place in 2007, might have prevented some of the Trio losses that we are talking about tonight. This is because they require a financial adviser to put their clients' interests first. They also ban kickbacks and commissions. For example, in the Illawarra it has been said that a local financial adviser, Mr Tarrant, received in excess of $840,000 in payments and commissions from Trio staff for putting his local investors into Trio through an SMSF. While the Future of Financial Advice reforms are measures that greatly strengthen our financial system, I believe that more can be done. I believe that we should develop a last resort compensation scheme for cases of corporate fraud in order to provide better protections for SMSF and managed investment scheme investors. The question of a last resort compensation scheme is considered in a report commissioned by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, conducted by Mr Richard St John and released in April last year. The recommendations by Mr St John were also discussed in the aforementioned PJC report. One scenario where a last resort compensation scheme might apply is when there is a financial loss due to misconduct or insolvency by a financial services licensee. Such a proposal was supported by some industry bodies, including the SMSF Professionals Association of Australia and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, amongst others. In the case of Trio, a fraud occurred offshore where the investment funds were allocated to hedge funds with overinflated assets that may or may not have even existed. The Trio scenario was a failure of the investment strategy of a managed investment scheme. This failure can be the result of a number of causes-in the case of Trio, it was fraud. The investment itself was risky; the investment strategy was flawed; or, as in the case of Trio, a fraud was committed. Whatever the scenario, the outcome was the same from the investors' perspective: they have lost their money, in many cases their entire life savings. I believe there is a flaw in our financial service sector when it comes to SMSF investors. In the case of failed investments SMSF investors are left to fend for themselves and to bear the cost themselves for any misconduct or insolvency by a financial services licensee for any corporate failure. The assumption here is that the SMSF investors are themselves the trustees and therefore they have both the power and the knowledge about their investments-the vehicles and the assets in which they invest their money-and therefore bear the risks associated with those investments, having both the power and the knowledge that separates them from those investors who invest through an APRA regulated fund in which they are not themselves the trustee. For that reason other insurance-like arrangements exist for those APRA regulated funds. Under our existing system, some investors in Trio-those in APRA regulated fundscould get compensation while those in SMSFs got nothing. It is a pretty tough message for these investors to accept. Given the importance of Australia's system of workplace superannuation and occupational superannuation, and the personal devastation that results from these significant financial losses, I believe that SMSF investors need a last resort compensation scheme. There are many issues raised by such a proposition. Managed investment schemes in particular are under increasing scrutiny now due to a number of highprofile examples of investment failure. Many questions have been rightly raised about the lack of regulation and lack of accountability by trustees around these schemes. In his report, Mr St John considers that the regulation of managed investment schemes such as those invested in by Trio are not yet on a sufficiently solid framework on which to transfer to other licensees the requirement to pay compensation. Improved regulation and accountability in this area should be a priority for ASIC and for government. There is one important issue to consider, which was acknowledged in the PJC report: that providing full compensation for the failure of risky investments creates a moral hazard. That is, who should bear the cost of a failed investment? Some who have lost their money in Trio believe that taxpayers should now chip in to compensate them for the failure of their investment. This is a difficult proposition unless it can be proved that the loss was the direct result of government fraud or negligence, and I have as yet seen no evidence of this. Any determination of a claim such as this should be made by an independent body with access to all the relevant evidence. Indeed, that is why we have courts of law. It is proper that a courtan independent body-makes such an adjudication, not the government itself, particularly when an allegation may be raised against the government or government instrumentality. Another question is: should investors in a scheme that is well managed and financially prudent bear the cost of compensation for failed investment schemes that were not. I believe one approach to this is to consider the approach adopted in the United Kingdom where a lastresort compensation scheme already operates, known as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This UK scheme applies where claims for compensation through professional indemnity insurance, or minimal capital requirements for financial services licences, are inadequate. Under the UK scheme, payments of compensation are capped and calculated in accordance with a formula, such as 70 per cent of the first $50,000 lost, plus 70 per cent of the next $80,000 and 50 per cent for the next $80,000, or something along similar lines. Therefore, in a similar vein to the conclusions of the PJC report, tonight I am calling for the federal government to take active steps towards developing a compensation scheme of last resort by placing a levy on managed investment schemes. This would operate in a similar way to the existing scheme for APRA supervised superannuation, where a levy also applies in the event of fraud and the activation of that part of the act. For Australian investors to maintain their confidence in our financial system and for investors to be better protected against fraud and maladministration, it is time to look in more detail at these matters. Those on the other side have an inbuilt antipathy towards any sort of government regulation. Indeed many within the industry have a similar antipathy, but what is at stake is too great; it warrants a bipartisan approach. On this side of the House, we believe that it is the role of government to get the regulatory system right so that investors can invest with confidence. this important motion and to pick up one of his closing comments, which is that this is an area which is so important that a bipartisan approach is called for. I note that the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the Trio collapse did produce a bipartisan set of recommendations. I do want to comment on his thoughtful motion. I do not agree with this policy recommendation but I want to make three points in the time available to me. First, we can all agree that Trio is a tragedy. Second, I think we should be careful of mis-characterising the role of self-managed superannuation funds. And third, I would like to come briefly to the measure which is contemplated in this motion. Firstly, I think it is uncontentious that what happened in Trio was a tragedy, $176 million lost. A significant number of my constituents lost money investing through their self-managed superannuation schemes, particularly into the ARP Growth Fund. Because they are selfmanaged superannuation funds, they are not eligible for compensation, as the member for Throsby said. Quite large balances were lost, on average $700,000 per self-managed super fund investor. It is clear that there was outright fraud and criminality involved in this scandal. I want to particularly mention Mr Paul Gresham, who subsequently changed his name to Mr Tony Maher, the financial adviser serving the northern suburbs of Sydney, who ripped off a number of my constituents. Some of them trusted him for nearly 20 years. At some point it seems that he went bad. He moved their money from professional pensions PST where it was invested in reputable funds managers like Maple-Brown Abbott, and put it into the ARP Growth Fund. It was then, as the member for Throsby describes, sent offshore and the money subsequently disappeared. It appears Mr Gresham was also involved in the original transaction under which, in 2004, a reputable funds manager in Albury was taken over by what we now know to be a criminal syndicate. This was unambiguously a tragedy. The policy issue we are wrestling with is: what is the right response? The second thing I would like to come to in the brief time available is we ought to be careful of mis-characterising self-managed superannuation funds. For people who understand the nature of the vehicle, they are, in my view, a very good and flexible vehicle for people to accumulate retirement savings. I think the market evidence suggests that with now over $450 billion of the $1.5 trillion in superannuation in self-managed funds. They offer great flexibility and autonomy, and that I would suggest is why they are growing so rapidly. But people do need to understand the risks that are involved and the fact that, if you take on the responsibility for managing your retirement savings, you are taking on that responsibility. Quite a lot goes with that, including, as the member for Throsby has highlighted, the fact that you do not have the benefit of the provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act which apply to APRA regulated funds in the case of fraud and theft.",266,Private Members Business
218,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (18:40,"I am pleased to follow the member for Throsby onI do caution that there are a number of powerful players in the superannuation sector who are not too happy about the quantum of funds which is now moving into self-managed superannuation funds. It suits them to suggest that there is some flaw with the self-managed superannuation fund vehicle. As policymakers, we ought to be very conscious that there is a degree of self-interest involved on the part of some of those who make arguments which might lead to quite onerous regulation applying to self-managed superannuation funds and compromising their effectiveness as a retirement savings vehicle. WhatI also think is very important, that we should draw as a conclusion from the Trio collapse, is that our $1.5 trillion superannuation savings pool is a honey pot for international criminals. We must make sure that there is adequate regulatory scrutiny and proactive action to protect against that threat. One conclusion of the committee's investigation in the Trio collapse is that our regulators have perhaps not been as proactive as they ought to be. Recommendation 14 of the report was that the Australian Federal Police should consider the options to create an organisational focus on matters pertaining to superannuation fraud, working in cooperation with the Australian Crime Commission. Thirdly, let me now turn to the specific measure that the member for Throsby has proposed in his motion this evening. I am going to speak specifically about the wording of the motion, which talks about a member funded compensation scheme for self-managed superannuation scheme investors. I note that in his remarks the member for Thorsby talked about a levy on managed investment schemes. That would actually be a different type of policy measure that would apply to managed investment schemes into which self-managed superannuation funds and other kinds of investors invested. Let me restrict myself to what is described on the face of the motion-that is, the idea that if a particular self-managed superannuation fund loses money due to fraud or theft, then other self-managed superannuation funds should be in some way levied to compensate for that or potentially that there ought to be a levy across the entire sector. I think both of those are potentially contemplated by the kind of language that is in the motion. I certainly acknowledge the genuine policy intent to deal with this serious problem, but I do not think this is the right solution. Firstly, the whole notion of self-managed superfunds, as I have referred to, is that you choose to take on, as an individual, the responsibility for managing your retirement savingsthe pool of funds built up to fund your retirement income-together with the savings of up to four other people, usually members of your close family. That does bring with it greater risks. The policy basis that has applied for the last 20 years or so is that one of the risks is that you do not have the benefit of the last-resort compensation scheme that applies in the case of APRA regulated funds. Secondly, for people who have consciously chosen to-as it were-go it alone rather than relying upon a professional investment manager, a corollary is that if it goes well you capture the benefits. If it does not go well, you bear the losses. Those are losses from making poor investment choices, as well as losses from fraud and theft. That is not a very palatable message if you do badly-it is quite an attractive message if you do well-but it is inherent in the nature of self-managed superannuation funds. If you do not want to take that risk, and I would argue that the majority of people are probably not well advised to take that risk and are probably not in a good position to do so, then do not choose a self-managed superannuation fund. The third point I would make is that any such scheme must only be available in extremis, where there has been fraud or theft proven. As the member for Thorsby indicated, one of the real policy challenges in this area is moral hazard. In other words, if there is a last-resort scheme available then people who lose money will have a very strong incentive to take advantage of that scheme and they might also have an incentive to take risks or be less careful than you would be if such a scheme did not exist. In the case of APRA regulated funds, where such a scheme does exist, the first resort is the professional skills and capacity of the management team which is running the fund into which individual investors have put their money. Therefore, a policy decision that says, 'We will have a last-resort scheme in the case of fraud or theft,' has that initial safeguard that you have a team of professionals managing the money in the first place. In the case of self-managed superfunds, it is by definition a collection of people who do not do this as their main job. This is, in essence, something they are choosing to do for themselves, but they are not generally professional investors. Therefore, it becomes quite a challenging public policy notion to say, 'You can manage your own affairs, but a corollary of doing that is that you are liable-at least to some extentif any one of the other several hundred thousand people who are also doing this ends up being defrauded or having money stolen from then. Then, you will have some of your own money taken to fund the compensation to that person.' That is a difficult policy approach. I do not doubt the good intentions behind the member for Throsby's attempt to grapple with this serious policy problem. It is a problem we should have a continued focus on, but I do not think that the proposed policy solution of a scheme that applies across all SMSFs is a good one. In essence it really undercuts what is the core idea of a self-managed super fund-that you take responsibility with the ups and downs. If that is not something that suits you, you are probably better advised to be in a different investment vehicle. Ms BIRD (Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (18:50): I take the opportunity this evening to express my support for the intent of the private member's motion which has been moved by my colleague the member for Throsby about selfmanaged superannuation. I want to start by acknowledging the point that was made by a member in point (1)(d) of his motion, which is that this House notes: … the severe hardship caused to investors in Trio Capital, which collapsed as a result of fraudulent activity and which was the largest superannuation fraud in Australian history, with around $176 million lost or missing. A significant number of the victims of this fraud, as the member for Throsby indicated, live in my electorate. Some of them have personally come to see me or have written to me about the devastating financial and very often emotional toll that this has had on them and their families. Without exception these people had dedicated significant effort and resources over their working life to saving for a secure and quality retirement. Their concerns were only to provide for themselves in their retirement age, to not be a burden to their families or communities but to continue the independence that had been a feature of their working life and which they aspired to continue in their retirement. The member for Throsby's motion seeks to address one aspect of this terrible circumstance: the lack of coverage for those individuals whose funds were in self-managed superannuation rather than the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority regulated superannuation funds. In supporting this motion, I first want to acknowledge that there are wider matters that have been raised by this fraud, but I believe the specific matter that this motion seeks to address is very important for the future, while acknowledging it does not provide a solution for those who have already been affected. However, I should acknowledge that many of the locals to whom I have spoken have been at pains to make it clear to me that they also are concerned to see reforms put in place to provide stronger protections for other people in the future. The difficulty that this motion addresses is the fact that some of the victims of this fraud were eligible for a compensation scheme whilst others were not. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, under section 23, creates a provision that comes into effect where fraudulent conduct or theft has caused a loss for a superannuation fund's member. However, section 1AA(2) specifically exclude self-managed superannuation funds. This section allows an application to the minister arguing that an eligible loss has occurred to activate, on determination by the minister, that the public interest requires a grant of assistance where compensation is paid and recovered through a levy on all APRA regulated superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. This mechanism was triggered in the Trio case, and in April 2011 the federal minister announced that approximately $55 million in financial assistance would be made available to the eligible investors, and the cost would be recovered through the levy. There were, however, direct investors in self-managed superannuation funds who were not covered by this section of the act and the compensation mechanism. Regularly, some of my local constituents have indicated to me that they were not aware that the scheme they were involved in did not have this protection in the case of fraud or theft and that they would have been willing to carry an additional cost to provide such protection. The remaining mechanisms under professional indemnity insurance are problematic for many of these investors. The issue of the provision of a compensation scheme for these investors has been canvassed on several occasions over the years since the Wallis inquiry in 1997 and up to the Richard St John review commissioned by the federal government which reported in May last year and the joint parliamentary committee report tabled on 16 May 2012. I acknowledge that all of these inquiries came to the conclusion that the introduction of a compensation scheme by a levy on SMSF investors, generally on the basis of the potential for moral hazard, which my colleague covered, would have the effect of 'decreasing responsibility for appropriate caution and prudence' to quote the words of the report. However, I feel it is appropriate, as this motion suggests, for the self-managed superannuation sector and policymakers to address this issue in order to find an appropriate and effective way for member-funded compensation schemes to be developed for circumstances of fraud or theft affecting members of self-managed superannuation funds. I endorse the final point of the motion, which calls on the government to work for enhanced fraud detection and on regulators to enhance fraud detection and prevention in this evaluation system. motion and also the members for Bradfield and Cunningham for their speeches on it. It is very difficult to represent people who have been ripped off and people who have had their superannuation nest egg taken away in unfair and illegal circumstances. Tonight gives me the opportunity to speak about important superannuation matters and I agree that the government should be working with regulators to enhance fraud detection and prevention in the superannuation schemes.",269,Private Members Business
219,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (18:55,"I commend the member for Throsby on thisThe Trio inquiry has highlighted the considerable financial losses and the physical and dreadful emotional toll suffered by hundreds of Australian investors who were defrauded in the largest superannuation fraud in this nation's history, costing them $176 million in retirement savings. The parliamentary joint committee inquiry has also exposed the failure of key checks and balances in the Australian regulatory system, with regulators missing some important signals or failing to identify the fraud or to act rapidly enough to shut it down and protect investors. The coalition has welcomed the release of the committee's report on the collapse of Trio Capital and has called on the government and regulators to act on its recommendations. We expect the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to act decisively and seek justice on behalf of those investors who have suffered greatly due to the collapse of Trio Capital. The government needs to provide ASIC with appropriate funds to enable the liquidator of Trio to properly investigate the various offshore companies into which the Trio funds were invested. The government must also appropriately resource the AFP to establish a dedicated superannuation fraud squad which will provide valuable protection for Australians in the superannuation system from criminal activity in the future. We heard from the member for Bradfield about the potential for international theft of the $1.5 trillion pool of superannuation funds. I spoke today with Trevor Ion, a financial planner from Wagga Wagga, about his thoughts on this motion and superannuation matters. He advised me he has been in the industry since 1986 and has seen many different types of fraud and collapses with investments within the superannuation environment as well as with investments outside the superannuation environment. The questions Mr Ion asks about any scheme are ultimately about the structure, the cost, whether there choice to opt in and how much will the scheme cost to administer. His company gives choice to clients who are prepared to pay the cost to protect their investments from market volatility. Therefore, should trustees have the choice to pay these costs? Mr Ion advised me that they have clients who are trustees of self-managed super funds with secure investments who would object to paying for a cost they may not benefit in and thus subsidise the trustees who have higher risks. The government also needs to stop playing with people's superannuation. Only last month there was a report in the Australian about the government's plans to ramp-up taxes on selfmanaged super even further. People who have done the right thing by working hard and saving to achieve a self-funded retirement so that they are not a burden on the public purse are being penalised by this government. We should be supporting these people and encouraging them; not raiding their retirement savings. The government should not be placing tax grabs on people's retirement savings to try to get some cash to make up for deficits, the $120 billion in unfunded promises and the collapse of the mining and carbon taxes. As of 30 June 2011 there were 442,528 self-managed super funds with a total of 841,283 members. Indeed, self-managed super funds held 30 per cent of all assets in superannuation at the same time. This is a total of about $407 billion. When in government, the coalition worked hard to protect Australians' superannuation and to ensure they understood the benefits of superannuation and that they had options. We removed the confusing and discriminatory reasonable benefit limits and simplified the superannuation laws. We introduced reforms to allow Australians to choose their own superannuation fund, including the freedom to choose a self-managed fund. We increased contribution caps to allow people to voluntarily save for their retirement at a stage of their lives when they can better afford additional contributions and when they are more focused on their retirement needs. We also encouraged superannuation saving for lowto middle-income earners through the co-contribution scheme. We have unfortunately seen increased taxes, however, on voluntary savings by changing concessional contribution caps from $50,000 to $100,000, down $25,000 across the board. Anyone who wishes to save more than $25,000 per annum, which includes the compulsory contribution, has to pay more tax. This is an important motion. I commend the member for Throsby for introducing it, because people should not have their nest eggs ripped off through fraud. Debate adjourned. Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012 be seconded. Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012 has been moved and seconded and is now for debate here. There is a significant problem in Australia when we have researchers working in scientific and health fields, teachers and staff who work in universities being unable to get a mortgage or plan their lives with sufficient certainty because they do not know from year to year, or in some cases from month to month, whether they are going to have a job. When we have a quarter of employees in this country who do not have any access to paid leave, it is clear that we have a problem. I have spoken to many teachers, who are responsible for educating our children, who have told me that they can find themselves nearing the end of the school year not knowing whether their contract is going to be renewed for the next year, despite the fact that the school needs teachers and always will. Australia is a particularly bad offender when it comes to insecure work. We are second only to Spain in the OECD for the number of people in temporary forms of work. Of course, Spain has a very large rural workforce employed on short-term contracts. We can do something about it and we should do something about it, because the burden of risk that comes with globalisation and the changes in the workforce that we have seen over the last three decades primarily is falling on working Australians and their families. This is having huge consequences not only in terms of people being able to plan their lives but also in terms of their health. This bill proposes a solution to fix one part of the problem. It is a multifaceted problem which will not be solved simply by one piece of legislation, but it does need legislation in order to be fixed. This bill is based on the path-breaking work of the inquiry into the nature and the extent of the problem of insecure work in Australia and some solutions conducted by a former Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe. One of the central elements of this bill is to give the Fair Work Commission the power to lay out pathways for people to transition from insecure work to ongoing employment arrangements. This bill also exempts small businesses from its operation. There are a number of reasons for that to do with the particular needs of",272,Private Members Business

221,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (19:01,"I believe that the second reading of the Fair Worksmall businesses, but one thing that is important to know is that it is in our high-employment sectors in government-in education in particular-that this problem finds itself most graphically expressed. It happens with teachers, as I have referred to, but also amongst university staff. On one recent report, up to one-third of university staff, including lecturers and all the other staff there, find themselves in non-standard employment arrangements. Of course, there will always be universities; they will continue to be funded. There is absolutely no reason there should be such a high level of short-term work. What this bill does is say, 'Well, in certain circumstances we will leave it up to the Fair Work Commission to decide whether it is appropriate that people should be on insecure work arrangements or not; if not, there will be a process for transition. We will also allow the Fair Work Commission to look at some of those other areas of non-standard work-for example, labour hire-and to say what is an appropriate use in this particular sector or in this particular industry. This bill has been to an inquiry; we have received a number of submissions. I am very pleased that the ACTU supports it. I am very pleased that the union that represents staff who work in universities supports it. I guess the real question will be whether Labor supports it as well. We have an opportunity, before this parliament rises, to take some real action to fix the growing problem of insecure work. Brian Howe has laid out the road map and we should follow it. been that, for bills referred to the Federation Chamber, the mover and seconder do not need to be in here when it happens; only in the House. Mr Champion: I am not going to second it, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will speak on it. learning Marxism at university-I went to university as well-I was a trolley collector, many moons ago. It taught me everything I needed to know about the perils of insecure work and the perils of dealing with small businesses. It was that experience that led me to wind up, after a little while, working for the shop assistants' union. We dealt with many employers who had vast numbers of casuals-in retail-and had very similar problems to the ones that the member for Melbourne talks about. I can remember Coles, for instance, had about 80 per cent casual employment; and it would have been the same for Woolies. We spent a lot of time bringing this up with the companies over and over again. We brought up the fact that it was completely unfair on employees, and those employees had all the same problems that the member for Melbourne talked about: they could not get loans; they faced varying hours from week to week; they were insecure even after years of employment. These were very serious matters. But, in the end, the companies worked out that this was an economic cost on themselves, because of course when you have high levels of casual or impermanent work, you get the associated cost of a very high turnover. That is a very big cost to companies, because you lose skills and you spend vast amounts of money on training, on providing uniforms and doing all sorts of things. You have this churn",274,Bills

224,The Deputy Speaker,We will move on. Thank you.,275,Bills
225,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (19:07,"Back when the member for Melbourne waswithin your organisation. None of that is very good in the modern workplace; for skill formation, for productivity and for a settled workforce. So any company that looks carefully at excessive casualisation of their workforce will find that turnover is a cost and they should take that into account. I would be a bit surprised if universities did not have a bit of a think about this and work out that it is a very big cost with a teaching workforce as well. The point is we resolved that issue through workplace negotiations and that is where I think this matter should properly be left. We have in place the Fair Work Act and that act promotes bargaining at the workplace level and it puts in place a number of job protections which help people to bargain, and it has a number of provisions which help people to collectively bargain in areas such as cleaning and other areas where contracts come and go. We know that people can bargain and that issues around employment security have been brought up at least in a number of awards and agreements. A number of those agreements contain the matter of conversion from casual to permanent employment. This is a process that operates under the Fair Work Act, so to come over the top with legislation which, on the member for Melbourne's own admission, only applies to big organisations, which tend to have these clauses in them anyway and completely exempts small business, where we would all acknowledge most of the job creation goes on in any event, seems to be somewhat problematic. He seems to be promoting a solution that would not work and would, I think, potentially complicate industrial relations a great deal in this country, because it is not clear when the orders were made and how that would affect individual employees and whether they would be put on some new set of conditions after this bill is enactedHonourable member interjectingWhat you are talking about is putting legislation over the top of that, so we might make a whole new set of conditions which is not necessarily the thing to do. The experience with Coles is that they got so carried away, they had some stores with 100 per cent permanency options, and of course we found that that did not suit everybody. So some people do opt to remain casuals even after years of employment because they prefer the flexibility, sometimes to the frustration of the employer. While this bill is well meaning, I think it tends to go over the top of the Fair Work Act and over the top of workplace bargaining, which I do not think is welcome. Due to a lack of a seconder, the motion lapsed. Human Rights: Vietnam Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Hayes: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) there are reports of human rights violations in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) including evidence of continued house detention and imprisonment of notable human rights activists including the Nobel Peace Prize nominee the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam Reverend Nguyen Van Ly, from the Vietnamese Catholic Church Dr Nguyen Dan Que, Jurist Dr Cu Huy Ha Vu, and a popular young peace songwriter Vo Minh Tri (known as Viet Khang);",275,Bills
226,Mr Champion,"No. Listen. At the moment there are conversion clauses in the award.(b) the Vietnam Government's treatment of human rights activists, including the recent trial and conviction of 14 human rights activists in January 2013, appears to be inconsistent with Vietnam's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to freedom of expression and due process; (c) trade union organisers Doan Huy Chuong, Do Thi Minh Hanh and Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung have spent more than two and a half years in custody convicted for 'national security' charges which emanated from their involvement in organising workers at a shoe factory; (d) despite the SRV being a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, human rights activists say that they are often denied a fair trial and prevented from defending themselves or calling upon witnesses for their defence; and (e) on 10 December 2012, a petition was handed to the Australian Government as part of the Million Hearts, One Voice Campaign, containing more than 15,000 signatures from local Vietnamese communities in Australia, and more than 135,000 signatures worldwide, drawing attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Vietnam; and (2) calls on the Australian Government to: (a) take all appropriate steps to convey to the Vietnamese Government that Australia expects Vietnam to honour the undertakings it freely entered into when it became a member of the United Nations and a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (b) continue Australia's engagement in bilateral and multilateral contexts with Vietnam on human rights; and (c) ensure that the matters contained in this motion are brought to the attention of the 2013 Australia Vietnamese Human Rights dialogue. the human rights situation in Vietnam. In May last year, I raised a private members' motion that drew attention to a number of human rights abuses that existed then and I asked members on both sides of the House to put aside their political differences when considering human rights. As the Australia-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue will take place around June or July this year, I have chosen to raise another motion in the House recognising the Vietnamese government's continued human rights abuses. My stance on human rights has been clear. I believe in a world where people's fundamental human rights are respected and I have always shown great admiration for those who are brave enough to stand up for human rights. Since becoming the member for Fowler, I have often been approached by the Vietnamese community to voice their concerns about human rights to this parliament. I have seen it as an honour and a privilege to represent them on such an important issue. Over the past three years, I have brought to the attention of this House the increasing reports of gross human rights violations in Vietnam. I have shared the stories of some of the incredible and courageous human rights advocates who have risked their safety and their lives in the fight for a higher cause. I have spoken about the convictions of many of the bloggers and activists, including the legal advocates Dr Cu Huy Ha Vu, Vo Thi Thu Thuy, Nguyen Van Thanh and Ta Phong Tan, and the singer-songwriter Viet Khang. I have questioned several procedural irregularities that seem to be apparent in the Vietnamese justice system. I have also paid tribute to the families of the human rights defenders-the husbands, the wives, the mothers, the fathers, the children of these brave men and women who remain incredibly affected not only because of the denial of their human",276,Private Members Business
227,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (19:12,"As the member for Fowler, I have often raised in this placerights but because they have been let down by a legal system which fails to honour fairness and equity for those who speak out. TodayI would like to bring to the House's attention the plight of a fellow called Paulus Le Son. He is a bright and very inspiring young person who has an ambition to change the world and the courage to make it happen. Paulus is a passionate member of the Vietnamese community, having been an activist organising for issues such as HIV and public education and served as a member of the John Paul II group for pro-life. He is a prominent writer for Vietnam Redemptorist News and is a popular young blogger who covers various issues, in particular social justice, human rights and sovereignty. At the age of 27, Paulus is not much younger than my youngest son Jonathan. Paulus is full of potential, energy and capability, yet his vision and courage is beyond what can be expected from anyone of that age, in my humble opinion. Paulus is one of 14 human rights activists recently tried in Vietnam in the People's Court of Nghe An Province. He has been detained since 2011 and, in January this year, was sentenced to 13 years prison followed by a further five years of house arrest upon his release. The sentences resulting from these trials were among the highest given to any political dissident in Vietnam over recent years. They demonstrate a disturbing trend in Vietnam, particularly in respect of the suppression of human rights. I have recently been advised that a few days ago the families of the 14 activists who were tried along with Paulus Le Son met in the Canadian embassy in Hanoi and had meetings with the ambassadors for Canada, the United States, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway. The families have gathered 28,480 signatures from around the world demanding the release of their relatives. There will be a retrial of this case over the next few days, I understand-I believe it is imminent-and I request the Australian embassy in Vietnam to closely follow these proceedings. At the conclusion, I wish to table a document signed by 3,716 Australians condemning the treatment that was handed out to these 14 activists. I am in a very fortunate position of being kept informed of the human rights abuses in Vietnam by the representatives of the Vietnamese community in Australia, by Colonel Vo Dai Ton, Father Paul Van Chi, Father Francis Van Tuyet and Vietnam Sydney Radio as well as Viet Tan. These people and organisations have shown much passion and commitment to improving the human rights situation in Vietnam. I have much respect for the Vietnamese people. Over the past three years I have had many opportunities to work closely with the Vietnamese community to learn their culture and customs but, more importantly, to represent their voice in the federal parliament. The Vietnamese people are some of the most generous and hard-working people I have ever met, and we have all seen their enormous contribution to this country over the last 38 years that they have called Australia home. When Vietnamese people speak to me about their journey, they have such strong emotions attached to the value of freedom. These strong emotions are indicative of their compassion and hope for millions of Vietnamese people. I, too, have great hope for the 80 million people living in Vietnam and therefore I have raised this notice of motion in the hope of bringing greater national attention to this very important issue. I believe that, as a trading partner and a significant aid donor to Vietnam, Australia has a moral and legal responsibility to require Vietnam to abide by its international obligations imposed by virtue of Vietnam's membership to the United Nations and also its being a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I recognise that 30 April is fast approaching. Significantly, it is a commemoration of the fall of Saigon. The Vietnamese community in Australia will gather at the Vietnam war memorial in Canberra and pay respect to the thousands of Vietnamese and, importantly, the 521 Australian soldiers who gave their lives in the fight for freedom and democracy. I would like to take the opportunity to pay my respects to the human rights defenders, past and present, and to make a commitment to doing whatever I can to advocate for the human rights position in Vietnam. I believe that, on any reasonable analysis, the Vietnamese government's treatment of the individuals that I have named in this notice of motion is absolutely inconsistent with that country's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the provisions under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly relating to the issues of freedom of expression and due process. These are issues that cannot be taken for granted, and we on all sides of this parliament wish Vietnam to have a strong and prosperous future. But, to do that, it must first take steps to recognise the dignity of its own people and institute, through all organs of government, including the judicial system, respect for the value of human life and restoration of human rights. Therefore, I will remain committed to doing whatever I can to advocate for human rights in Vietnam. In the short time. I have left I would like to table a document, which I have referred to earlier. It was given to me this week and it relates to the trial of the 14 young Catholic activists and the retrial that is likely to occur over the next week or so. This document was signed by 3,716 Australian Vietnamese. It shows the depth of concern that Vietnamese people living in Australia have about what is occurring in Vietnam at present. What is consistent is that people want fairness and decency in the treatment of human life. We can certainly expect more from the government of Vietnam, particularly if they want to be taken as a serious player in trade with the West and to open up a greater avenue for expansion and their involvement in terms of world trade. I commend this motion to the House and seek leave to table this document relating to the 14 Catholic activists. Leave granted. concerning human rights and freedoms in Vietnam, and I thank the member for Fowler for bringing this motion forward. This is my 15th speech in the parliament on matters to do with freedom and rights in Vietnam. I do have a history of being critical of the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On principle, I do not believe that a single-party stateCommunist Party or whatever-represents a democracy in any way, and I do not believe that the people of a country such as that can be represented appropriately when the government cannot be held to account and, as a result, completely changed by the will of the people. For many Australians, Vietnam is becoming a popular tourist attraction. It is vibrant, colourful, picturesque and interesting. Yet clearly the standard of living is very low. While all that is clear to anyone who visits the country, what is not clear is that there is political discontent and dissatisfaction amongst increasing numbers of people. That discontent has",277,Private Members Business
228,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (19:23,"I welcome this opportunity to speak on mattersmanifested in ways that it can be, when so much of the print, television and radio is under the control of the government. In many ways, it falls to the internet and to bloggers to hold the government to account, and many have been put in jail for being caught. Given the risks involved from the law, such as even suggesting a multiparty state being an offence, I am surprised by the courage shown by so many Vietnamese people. The protestations of Vietnamese people include the basic, as I deem them, demands for democracy: freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association. Yet beyond that there are many that protest about the giving away of sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. There are those that protest about the mining and business concessions in Vietnam given to Chinese sovereign owned businesses, and there are also protests about the environmental damage caused by Chinese bauxite mining in the highlands of Vietnam. With regard to religious based protest, there has also been government seizure of land from churches and the parishioners protesting about those losses. On 30 January this year I asked DFAT to seek for me a visa to visit Vietnam in April, thinking that around three months would be a good time period to allow the processes to work. In what would be my third visit to Vietnam, I sought to visit in jail the 14 recently jailed young Catholic activists Dang Ngoc Minh, Dang Xuan Dieu, Ho Duc Hoa, Ho Van Oanh, Le Van Son, Nguyen Dang Minh Man, Nguyen Dang Vinh Phuc, Nguyen Dinh Cuong, Nguyen Van Duyet, Nguyen Van Oai, Nguyen Xuan Oanh, Nong Hung Anh, Thai Van Dung and Tran Minh Nhat. They were tried and convicted in Nghe An Province on 9 January 2012. I also asked to be able to visit Cu Huy Ha Vu and Le Quoc Quan. These brave people have my profound respect, as do their families. They have sacrificed their freedom in pursuit of a just cause. I suspect that life inside a Vietnamese prison is unpleasant and the path of least resistance would be to renounce their cause, but it is a testament to their courage that they continue to serve the cause by not recanting. In a visit next month, I hope to at least get a glimpse of what they have to endure, but, given that it has been two months since my request was submitted and there has still been no result, I suspect that there will never be such a result. In October 2012 I spoke in the parliament about a campaign called Million Hearts, One Voice. This is a campaign for democracy in Vietnam and calls for the release of all political dissidents. The campaign was launched about a week before my speech and has been strongly supported by many prodemocracy organisations and groups. At that time around 40,000 people worldwide had signed the petition, with 100,000 targeted by International Amnesty Day on 10 December 2012. In the end, 135,000 people signed the petition, 15,000 of them in Australia, including me. I know that the Vietnamese community in WA joined the campaign and many groups in WA actively supported it. The petition seeks international investigation of the situation of arbitrary detention, inhumane prison conditions and a lack of political processes in Vietnam. It also demands that the government respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and repeal vague national security laws which are often the pretext for arbitrary arrest and detention. Finally, it urges the Vietnamese government to immediately release all political prisoners. I take this opportunity now to speak on the specifics of certain individuals that are not free as a result of the repression in Vietnam. I thank the Viet Tan, or Vietnam Reform Party, for highlighting these causes. On 27 November 2011, social activist Bui Thi Minh Hang was arrested for causing public disorder. She had been a constant presence at the weekly antiChina protests in Hanoi and Saigon during the summer and fall of 2011. She was detained by police while demonstrating in support of other peaceful protesters who had been recently arrested. She was sentenced to two years of re-education without a trial or any due process. Police have also harassed her son and family friends. A resident of Can Tho, Cao Van Tinh, has been involved in land rights campaigns since 2011. He participated in a 27-day peaceful sit-in outside government offices in Saigon in 2007. On 22 February 2011 he was arrested and in May 2011, after being charged with attempting to overthrow the government, was sentenced to five years imprisonment with a further four years of house arrest after that. In 2011 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that the Hanoi government's detention and conviction of Tinh and six other activists is in violation of international law. Despite that, he remains in a detention centre. Cu Huy Ha Vu is a prominent government critic and human rights lawyer. He filed unprecedented lawsuits against the government, including suing Prime Minister Dung for violating laws on environmental protection, national security and cultural heritage by approving a Chinese run bauxite-mining project in the central highlands. His law firm provided legal assistance to democracy activists and, prior to his arrest, to six Catholics from Con Dau parish who protested at government confiscation of properties. He was arrested in November 2011 and, in April 2012, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment followed by three years house arrest, having been charged with propaganda against the socialist state. His current address is Prison Camp 5, Thanh Hoa Province. The next person that I will speak of is even more special for me because of my personal connection through a visit to his church. I speak of Duong Kim Khai, who is a leader of the Cow Shed congregation. A member of Viet Tan, Pastor Khai has been active in helping farmers petition for the return of confiscated lands. He was arrested on 16 August 2010 and, on 30 May 2011, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment, followed by five years house arrest, having been charged with attempting to overthrow the government. On5 September 2011, Ta Phong Tan was arrested and remains detained without trial and for unknown charges. A former police officer and Communist Party member, she is a prolific blogger with more than 700 articles to her name. She began her writing career as a freelance journalist in 2004 and, since then, her articles have appeared widely online. With her knowledge and experience of police work, she provides insightful observations about widespread abuse of power by the security police. She is a recipient of Human Rights Watch's Hellman/Hammett award. She is at Phan Dang Luu Prison in Saigon. These are just some of the examples of very many that highlight the restrictions on freedom of speech and the undemocratic standing of the Communist Party and its governance of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. As stated earlier, I asked at the start of the year for a visa to visit activists who are in jail in Vietnam. The Communist government is not providing an answer in an attempt to delay me or to make me give up. Until such time as they make a decision, I will continue to ask the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to pursue the matter. In the same way, it is right that we continue to raise these matters in the Australian parliament. Continually raising these matters and the cases of individuals such as the ones I have spoken of today, which exist amongst many others, helps to maintain the pressure on the Communist government in Vietnam. As is mentioned in this motion, clearly the point that Vietnam is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights means nothing with their draconian and antidemocratic laws. They can sign what they want but that is all for show when the international community identifies these terrible flaws and harsh application of those laws and processes that see people arrested and detained without even a trial for years. Once again, I thank the member for Fowler for this motion. I welcome the opportunity to speak about the need for a better future for Vietnam. Finally, I would say that any government that is confident in its belief that it governs in the interests of its people should not fear an alternative. It is only when a government knows it is not doing its best for its people that democracy is opposed and alternatives are suppressed. Debate adjourned. Migration Amendment (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013. The bill was moved by my colleague the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship and is in line with the coalition's long-held belief that we need to return to the successful border protection policies of the Howard government if we are to regain some control over our borders and have some control over who comes to our country. There was an announcement by the government about an hour ago that there was another illegal boat arrival today. That means that there have been more illegal boat arrivals this financial year alone-and bear in mind that we are only three-quarters of the way through this financial year-than occurred under the whole 11 years of the Howard government. That is just an indication of the unprecedented wave of illegal boat arrivals that we have been experiencing because of the failed border protection policies that have been pursued by the Labor Party since they have come to office. Given that very serious record of failure, it strikes me as very strange that the Labor Party will not return to the point where they broke the system. That was when they came to office and did things like repealing the issue of temporary protection visas and abolishing the Pacific solution. They refused to implement their stated policy for the 2007 election, which was to turn the boats around. It strikes me as very strange that the Labor Party do not go back to the point of August 2007 when they broke the robust system of border protection they had inherited from the previous government. When they made those policy changes they sent the message loud and clear to criminal gangs of people smugglers that Australia was once again a soft touch, that Australia was once again refusing to have the resolve to stand up to their evil trade.",279,Private Members Business
229,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (19:33,"I rise in support of the Migration AmendmentIn September 2008, literally a month after those changes had been made-the abolition of the Pacific Solution and the abolition of temporary protection visas-the people smugglers went back into business. In September 2008 we had the first wave of illegal boat arrivals come down to Australia again. They came in what was, in hindsight, only a trickle. Subsequently, at the end of 2008 and in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and this year the unprecedented rate of arrival has been continuing to increase to the point where we have had over 14,000 people arrive illegally this financial year alone, and almost 240 illegal boats. That is getting very close to one illegal boat arrival per day. That is not a rate that we can sustain in Australia. As a result, even though the detention network has been massively expanded to cope with this influx, the government has been forced to release people into the community to live on welfare, with no entitlement to work, in a way that I think is detrimental to them and also to the Australian taxpayer. This bill is an attempt to rectify some of the damage that the Labor Party has done, and it makes perfect sense to me and my colleagues in the opposition that we should seek to reinstate the strong border protection policies that the Howard government used to solve this problem when we were faced with it in very similar circumstances in the decade up until the year 2001. Prior to 2001 we had a substantial increase in every given year of illegal boat arrivals. Success breeds success with people smuggling: the more the people smugglers could get people down here illegally the more people would seek out the services of the people smugglers and the more people would arrive in Australia illegally. The Howard government was faced with very similar circumstances. Success bred success and the number of illegal boat arrivals continue to increase in the late 1990s and in the year 2000. In the year 2001 the Howard government said: 'Enough is enough. We are not going to accept people smugglers controlling our immigration system. We are going to do what is necessary to close that trade down.' People smugglers are not some sort of modern-day Oskar Schindlers; they are the most diabolical criminals who cared absolutely nothing for the human cargo they smuggle down here, to the point where you can hear dreadful anecdotal stories about people who have employed the services of the people smuggler only to be left in the high seas where the crew abandoned ship. We will not know the extent of the people who have been lost trying to take this journey because it is impossible to get an accurate understanding about the number of people who have lost their lives taking this journey. Certainly, it would be in the hundreds. There is no doubt that hundreds upon hundreds of people have died trying to make this journey-hundreds of adult women and men and also children and babies. It is not the case, as the government would have people believe, that there is nothing we can do about this, that we have to accept that there is nothing we can do to close down people smuggling, that it is going to be ever-present and that it is going to continue to increase. That is not the case. The reason we know that is not the case is we have solved this problem in the past. The Howard government was faced with very similar circumstances. In 2001 it took tough but necessary decisions that were controversial within the Australian community at the time. What you cannot argue is that they were not successful. Once those measures were taken they essentially completely and utterly closed down people smuggling. In the years after 2001-2002 and up until 2008 when those policies were reversed, we had an average of three illegal boat arrivals per year. Three per year; that is one every four months. If you want to put that into context, last weekend we had six illegal boat arrivals. So, we used to have three a year under the Howard government's successful border protection policies and now we can have double that arrive on one given weekend under the Labor Party's failed border protection policies. The way we are going to reverse this is to go back to those successful policies that have actually worked. A very successful part of those policies was temporary protection visas. Temporary protection visas work incredibly well because they undermine the product that people smugglers are selling. People smugglers are selling permanent residence in Australia. If you undermine the ability of people smugglers to sell permanent residence in Australia you undermine their ability to go out into the international community and to sell their product for a very large sum. You can understand how permanent residence in Australia is a very lucrative product. Temporary protection visas undermine the ability of people smugglers to do that, and that is why they are such a successful part of a successful border protection regime. That is why it is vitally important that this parliament embrace measures to return to temporary protection visas so that we can once again control who comes to Australia. This bill would restore two classes of temporary protection visa: subclasses 785 and 447. Both of these subclasses of visa were available under the former coalition government, and they are of course also in keeping with Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. The temporary protection offshore entry visa would be for a term of up to three years. That term would be set by the minister or his or her delegate. This visa gives the holder the right to work and to special benefit payments, and also access to Medicare. I do think that the right to work is particularly important because at the moment we have the situation which I think is the worse of all worlds both for the people concerned and also for the Australian taxpayer. That is where people are released into the community with only the right to live on welfare. This seems to be the absolute worse of all worlds for all policies. Government members interjectingthat we used to have a successful border protection regime in this country. Astonishingly and stupidly they reversed that when they took office in 2007. As a result, we have the catastrophe that has unfolded on our borders ever since: 14,000 people this financial year alone on almost 240 illegal boats. And yet, foolishly the Labor Party refused to embrace measures that we know will work to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals and will work to stop people smuggling. That is what this bill will give effect to. Temporary protection visas, in conjunction with turning the boats around and a serious effort at offshore processing, will restore the policies of the Howard government. If we restore the successful policies of the Howard government we can again control who comes to Australia and we can again exercise some control over Australia's borders-something that has been completely lacking under the weak regime of the Rudd and Gillard governments.

231,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom,"Order! The Acting Deputy Speaker is that this Migration Amendment (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013 to reinstate TPVs is a bad policy. It was a bad policy when it was introduced in 1999 by the then Howard government. We repealed TPVs in 2008 and they are still a bad idea in 2013. We hear the issue of migration raised continuously in this chamber and in the other chamber, and we hear about refugees constantly. One point I really want to make is that for many, many years in this country, people have been arriving by boat. My parents arrived by boat after World War II. The place they came from was absolutely devastated by a world war, by a civil war and then by an economic crisis. As a child, sometimes I would ask my mother why on earth she came to this country: 'Why would you leave everyone behind? Why would you leave your family, your siblings, your mother, your father and everything you have known your entire life to go to the other end of the world, where you knew nothing?' She said to me, 'The answer is that, as human beings, we need the ability to dream and I did not have that ability in Greece at that point in time.' We made our way to Australia, just to have the ability to be able to dream and perhaps realise those dreams. That is why millions of people have made their way here to Australia. In her case, she had a choice and she took that choice. But many of the people who are coming today-what we call 'unauthorised boat arrivals'-do not have that choice. Their only choice is to stay where they are: to be executed, to be discriminated against, to see their children suffer and to know that there is absolutely no hope in the world for them. What we have done here in this place, over the last 10 years or so, is make this an issue for political gain-without thinking of those human lives and those human beings. When I go overseas I make a point of always asking politicians, mayors and people in authority about the refugee issue in their country. Throughout Europe, wherever I have been, I ask that very same question: 'What is the approximate number of unauthorised people that have crossed your borders?' In one instance, in Athens last year, when I met with the Mayor of Athens, I found that 500,000 people living in the city of Athens had gone there without any papers; they had found their way there. In Italy, there were 6,000 arrivals per day. In Spain, there were similar numbers. Yet, here in this place, we make an issue of a few thousand per year. Why? Because of what I said earlier-for political gain. This is a bad policy. Temporary protection visas were a bad idea in 1999 and they are still a bad idea today in 2013. That is why I do not support the bill. At the time of their introduction, TPVs did not exist anywhere else in the world and were subject to widespread criticism. The worse feature of the TPVs is that asylum seekers found to be owed protection have to undergo the entire assessment process again every three years. This is very unfair and I find it very inhumane. Let me read to you a direct quote from Ebrahim, who lives in Adelaide in South Australia and who was a temporary protection visa holder. These are his exact words: Who could explain the unfairness of TPV better than myself who had to live over 5 years of his life in absolute uncertainty of what future holds. It wasn't the length of time away from my family, but the uncertainty of whether this country would recognise me a refugee before I have lost my whole family. My hope went so down and life got so dark that at one point human beings started seeming so careless about my suffering and my beautiful kids' right to life.",284,Bills
232,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh,"Second Deputy Speaker) (19:43): I say from the outsetAs a result of total mental breakdown I was forced to try ending my own life. I couldn't see no future and no life ahead neither for myself and nor for my kids. Ebrahim That gives you a small insight into what we were doing to people in their mental capacity and their mental suffering. The people on these visas can never have certainty of a new life in Australia. A total of around 11,200 TPVs were granted between 1999 and 2008, when they were abolished, as I said, by the incoming Labor government. A relatively small number of unauthorised air arrivals were granted a TPV-around three per cent. The remainder were granted to irregular maritime arrivals. Temporary protection visas did not lead to people leaving Australia. That is fact. The vast majority of people holding temporary protection visas were ultimately granted permanent protection and are still here today. More than 95 per cent of people ever granted a temporary protection visa were found to be genuine refugees and granted a permanent visa-95 per cent. So we know that they do not work as a way of sending people back, as we heard from the previous speaker. And we also know that they never worked as a way to stop people coming to Australia in the first place. Whilst there is destruction, whilst there is famine, whilst there are wars and catastrophes around the world, refugee and people movements will continue, no matter what you put in place. As I said earlier, those people are leaving because they have no choice. That is why they get on a boat and come here. The fact is that the TPVs were a spectacular failure. In the year they were introduced by the former government, there were 3,722 unauthorised boat arrivals. During the next two years there were 8,459 unauthorised boat arrivals, including 5,520 arrivals in 2001-that is, after TPVs were introduced. In summary, TPVs have been tried and were a failure. They only succeeded in keeping mostly genuine asylum seekers in years of limbo, as we heard from Ebrahim, with the prospect of being returned to the place of persecution hanging over their head. Let me read out another comment, which was provided to me today by the CEO of the Australian Refugee Association in Underdale in my electorate, by Peter Laintoll. He says: From ARA's perspective there were a number of key issues that were raised and voiced on a number of levels regarding TPV's. In the early days of TPV's being issued, asylum seekers were told they may never have access to permanent residency. This had a catastrophic effect on the mental health of many asylum seekers as they were in a continual state of insecurity and felt they did not belong in Australia, knowing they could not return to their home country. So, not only were they still suffering from the stress and anxiety of having to leave behind family and country, they were exposed to many years in detention with few support services (at least this has changed over the years) but they were released into a community where many could not speak the language with very minimal support. They also were unable to access trauma counselling so this compounded their isolation and mental health issues making it even more difficult to successfully settle into Australian society. Another issue of TPV's was the inability to access family reunification, meaning more women and children were risking their lives in the ocean to be reunited with their husbands, fathers, families, etcetera. Often TPVs were also excluded from English classes and job training, making it near impossible to access meaningful employment. Further their trade skills were not recognised in Australia. The positive of the TPV story is that, whilst most were told early on that they would not be able to access permanent residency, most if not all received their protection visa. These words are from the CEO of the Australian Refugee Association. TPVs are not good enough for our nation, and we can do better. That is why, unlike those opposite, we engaged the best in the business to give us expert recommendations on the best and fairest way to process asylum applications made by people coming to Australia. I am not saying it is perfect, because in a perfect world people would not have to flee for their lives. And in a perfect world no-one would have to make the terrible choice to stay in an unsafe place(Time expired) about a very sensitive issue and I acknowledge the strong feelings held by members on the other side of this chamber, one of whom has just spoken. I recognise his strong feelings on this issue, but the debate around temporary protection visas is one for which we do have to peel away the emotive and look at the essence of the debate. Yes, he is correct that there are significant movements between countries and between areas that are at war, engaged in hostile internal disputes, many of which will qualify for, and seek out, protection. But tonight is a chance for us to improve that system and not to stick with the system that we are experiencing under the current government. I do not think that tonight is an opportunity for us to pick through the remnants of what has been a disastrous management of this issue by the Rudd government and subsequently the Gillard government, most clearly exemplified by the fact that, if this were truly a more compassionate approach that had been carefully planned and orchestrated by this government, we would not have seen the economic blow-outs to managing our borders, because this government would have planned for them in advance. It is clear that it did not. From that first budget blow-out of $2.3 million in 2008-09, which became $233 million the following year, which became $1.3 billion for the following two years and this year already is in excess of $2.1 billion, this has not been a compassionate government, carefully unpicking Howard's successful border protection laws. No, this is a government that did it unknowingly and is now reaping what it sowed, which is complete incontinence of its border protection arrangements. That is no better illustrated than by any table available in the public domain of the arrivals, which have blown out since 2008. This proposal to introduce a 785 and a 447 visa that provide temporary protection is a simple one that has already been outlined by our previous speaker. It is quite simply that those who seek the protection that Australia's obligations entitle them to, those who will come through secondary countries, those who have illegally arrived without a visa-by definition illegally-on Christmas Island, Cocos island or Ashmore Reef, those who pass a health and character check, are eligible for a temporary protection visa. I was so interested in the previous speaker's allusions to Ibrahim, who gave a very impassioned plea in favour of permanent protection, because, in that somewhat mangled case, in that very, very emotional quote, came at the start an appeal for the safety of his family, and it finished with an economic case for the future of his family. When we tease that apart, the great irony of this government's argument is that 8,000 people like Ibrahim's family languish in border camps, unable to apply for a humanitarian visa because of the lack of control that this government has demonstrated. That is correct. Let me say it again: Ibrahim's family, for",285,Bills
233,Mr Laming (Bowman) (19:54,"Tonight is an opportunity for dispassionate debatewhom he hopes so much, are trapped in border camps unable to come to Australia because this government lost control of its protection arrangements. That is 8,100 and even more now-the number is counting-potential applicants crowded out by the loss of control over the borders and the arrivals that we have seen. Family reunification is an important part of the current sugar that entices people to travel, as is permanent residency. They are the two major issues that, if you ask arrivals, they will tell you they are seeking more than anything. We do not blame people for seeking that protection, but the point is that there are many people just as worthy who cannot make the trip, and at some point a state has to be able to step back and say, 'We consider these arrivals on the basis of need, not simply who is closest, not simply who engages our protection, not simply someone who turns up on a reef and not simply someone who has the money to pay for the trip.' It has been made very clear before that the great majority of these arrivals travel commercially by air to other Islamic nations where they do not need a visa, so none of these people turned up with no means. None of these people effectively fled their home and put in an appeal for asylum. No, in many cases they have already passed through nations where that protection is already offered and it has not been sought, nor have they necessarily sought protection from the local UNHCR office. These are simple observations and I know that they are, in many cases, generalisations, but every one of us here can only speak from our personal experience. It is simply not enough to say that as a politician you have travelled around to meet other politicians and you have asked them for their views on immigration. It is simply not enough to turn up in Afghanistan and look through a bus window and make observations about what a border camp is like. It is not simply enough to travel in a delegation of colleagues and to be basically led around by the hand and have the suffering explained to you. You have to go and live in that country to understand. I have been lucky enough to work with minorities in northern Afghanistan for a number of months and actually live in the country concerned. Those people, when you ask them, will tell you a very different story. You will not hear of these people coming to Parliament House. Their story will not be told here by minority groups in this country; no, you need to go to the source-to the situation in which they live-and listen. She has not been to that town. She has not toured the parts of Afghanistan directly affected. She may well have had all the conversations over a cup of tea in Western Sydney about this issue, but the other side of this chamber is completely removed from the economic deprivations going on in many of those countries and the fact that the great majority of them can never countenance making a trip such as this. All one can ask of a state is to treat those people equally, to treat those who are stuck within the borders, making their first appeal as they cross-because they cannot make it from within their own boundaries-and those who make a journey equally. But, until you cease offering permanent residency as the end result, you will continually have a problem where those who can assemble the resources are the ones who take priority and necessarily squeeze out the rest. The figures were fairly simple: over six years of the Howard government, there were 16 boats with 272 people. It was not that hard to assess those people in great depth. The problem is that when you start getting 8,000, even 10,000, arrivals per year, suddenly it becomes very challenging to assess them meaningfully under the treaty. It becomes extraordinarily difficult. The previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh, said about 90 per cent of these applications are actually being approved. That says to me two things: firstly, how can they seriously consider these cases, and in depth; and, secondly, that is the system working. I do not have a problem with people being properly assessed; what I do have a problem with is large proportions of people at even greater risk being completely excluded. I have a problem with Ibrahim's family, from the previous speaker's contribution, being stuck in a border camp, not able to apply. No, they cannot. They will sit there and never be able to lodge an appeal. Ms Smyth interjectingyour electorate who would also like to be looked after by this country, preferably those who are in greatest need. You have ignored them, Member for La Trobe. She has ignored them, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. She has ignored them by hanging on to this notion of permanent protection without considering the most important part of the Howard government interventions, which was temporary protection visas. If we peel all of this back and just look at the treaty, we are obliged to provide protectionyou are nodding on the other side. We are not obliged to provide permanent protection. I think every person on the street would realise that in half of the world, at some point, there is some form of internecine, tribal, religious, political or ethnic destabilisation or form of violence going on. You name a part of the world and I will tell you the country where it is happening. It is happening in most nations around the world. By definition, everyone is eligible for asylum? No, they are not; they have to make that case. Ms Smyth interjectinglanguishing without help and your government will only look at those who turn up on Ashmore Reef, and that is not good enough. There are 8,100 people who have been squeezed out and crowded out by a government that cannot run this policy effectively. Mr Neumann interjectingthe amount. We will increase it to 13,750; what does that achieve? It has simply blown out your budget by $2.1 billion. So, no matter how many times you increase that number to make it look like this is orderly migration, the fact is that this is a government that has never been able to budget for these increases. Mr Neumann interjectinggovernment has never been able to budget ahead for the true cost of the arrivals-again, evidence that they have completely lost control of the borders, which is a basic requisite of being in power. It is a basic requisite of being able to run a nation.

237,Mr Laming,"It is patently clear that you have lost control of the borders. ThisHoward formula that worked in the past; they will work again with a newly elected coalition government. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (20:04): What the previous speaker's contribution reveals to me is what I had long anticipated and that is that those opposite would rather resile from convention obligations internationally and ultimately have no concept of them. It gives me a considerable degree of concern about their capacity to have Australia under their watch represented on the international stage. It is extremely troubling. When I came to this place I had hoped for something more than the absolutely scurrilous offerings that pass for public policy from those opposite on the question of asylum seekers. Yet again we are served up this evening the dross that passes for their proposed legislation in this place. Temporary protection visas introduced by the Howard government were a resounding failure on any measure: humanitarian or practical. They failed from the point of view of providing protections to refugees. They failed as an effective means of dissuading people from making the perilous journey to Australia to seek refuge. They failed from the point of view of the mental health impacts on those who were held on temporary protection visas. They failed then; they will fail now. This is simply garbage public policy that is being pushed here this evening by those opposite. WhatI ultimately aspire to-and I should say this at the outset of this debate-is a regional arrangement which affords asylum seekers convention protections, which treats them fairly and consistently and which engages countries in our region that are not currently convention countries to become convention signatories or adopt substantially the protections afforded by the convention. That kind of role is the role that Australia has typically played in advancing its perspective on human rights and humanitarian obligations right around the world. It is the right push for Australia to make. I realise that that will require detailed work. I realise that it will require relationship building in the region and time, and I certainly understand the efforts that have been made by successive ministers for immigration from this side in the Bali process and otherwise to try and achieve that outcome. In the meantime, while I certainly cannot say that I have been comfortable with everything the panel report has recommended-and that would be well known-it has presented recommendations which allow that important work to be carried on. But TPVs have utterly no place in the panel's recommendations and they have utterly no place in Australia's response to the circumstances of asylums seekers. It should be made clear that neither in the recommendations of the Houston panel report or in its commentary does it sanction the use of temporary protection visas, and there is very good reason for that. Indeed its comments on TPVs are confined to referring to them as merely historical measures at page 91 of the report. It is worthwhile noting that the report refers to the rules associated with the Howard government's TPV arrangements being 'difficult to interpret and apply'. It concludes by saying that 95 per cent of asylum seekers arriving by boat who are granted temporary protection visas were ultimately granted a permanent visa in Australia-these are the facts. The opposition has long claimed that TPVs act as a deterrent to asylum seekers travelling by boat to Australia. The facts simply do not bear that out. Around 11,200 temporary protection visas were issued between 1999 and 2008 and, of that number, around 380 people actually left Australia-that is around 3½ per cent. In addition, following the introduction of TPVs, there was a rise in the proportion of women and children on those vessels which arrived in Australia carrying asylum seekers since the new visas did not permit family reunions. On practical grounds, TPVs simply fail, but the crux of this evening's debate is that refuge is not refuge and cannot be refuge if it is permanently qualified, forever able to be taken away. How can people ever be expected to feel safe when their claim for asylum, though accepted at one point in time as a well-founded fear of persecution, is only ever treated as a temporary stay? The cruelty of TPVs is that, even if an asylum seeker is found to be owed protection under the convention and our laws, they would face the entire assessment process again before the expiry of the three-year period for which they are applicable. The bill would then put the onus on refugees to demonstrate that their well-founded fear of persecution prevailed. Under the bill before us a person in genuine need of protection who has travelled through a country that is a refugee convention country will be permanently barred from applying for a permanent protection. There are many reasons why people move between countries, and this provision is simply a penalty. It means that those people could remain without any kind of certainty for an unknown period of time. The Liberals' previous version of this was that a TPV holder would be ineligible for permanent protection if, in their travel to Australia, they resided in a country for a minimum of seven days where they could have sought protection. And as the Houston report said, and as I remarked earlier, this was difficult to interpret and apply because of what was meant by 'could have sought and obtained effective protection'. The bill before us this evening uses precisely the same language as the original-in other words, the Liberals have learnt absolutely nothing from the failure of their original attempt at TPVs. So it fails on practical grounds and it fails in its drafting. But the most important issue for me, and for many others on this side of the chamber, is the question of the hardship faced by those who were placed on TPVs during the Howard government's term. And they ought to be remembered in this place. I refer particularly to the findings of some research done by researchers at UNSW in 2004 which ultimately found that TPVs increased the risk of their holders developing post-traumatic stress and depression. I quote one of the co-authors of the study, Zachary Steel, who has said: Unless somebody has the sense of safety, all of the basic survival mechanisms that tell a person that they need to escape from danger don't get turned off, they stay on, and so the individual stays locked into this perpetual state of alarm that at any time in the future they're facing immediate life threat. So they're living with basically executioner's axe over their head, and it just doesn't provide an environment that allows them to recover and begin to rebuild their lives. So we have TPVs failing as a practical measure to dissuade people from coming to Australia. We have TPVs in fact prompting more women and children to get on boats and come to Australia. We have TPVs failing when those people arrive in Australia. We have 95 per cent plus of the people who have been issued TPVs ultimately arriving here and staying here. And then we have the extraordinary hardship and the mental anguish-the real mental health impacts, verified by researchers-that arise from TPVs. What a wonderful policy move! What a well-thought-through initiative! What a humanitarian approach to take! What an extraordinary approach, and what a feeble response. I really must say that this is a disgraceful debate that has been brought on by those opposite. Ours is a nation that is engaged in conflict for humanitarian reasons. We are engaged in peacekeeping. We have been a participant in international peacekeeping missions. We have been involved in post-conflict state building. So it is surely not too great a leap for us to realise that conflict has implications for the large-scale movement of refugees. To my mind, if we have the will to engage in conflict then we really must have an equivalent will to provide refuge for those who seek it. What the debate this evening has revealed to me about those opposite is that they have no intention of honouring the convention obligations. SoI invite them to reflect on why they think it is important for Australia to sign up to conventions, because you simply cannot pretend to be an internationalist, a responsible international participant, and yet resile entirely from your convention obligations when you are back at home. But this continues to be the approach taken by those opposite. This is an extremely troubling debate from the point of view of the mental health circumstances of asylum seekers. It is an extremely troubling debate because it provides no practical response to the circumstances of asylum seekers arising here. It is at odds with the Houston panel's report, and it is at odds entirely with all of the facts that were borne out during that period of time that the Howard government had TPVs in place. Indeed, this is a callous debate brought on by those opposite, and I think it will be revealed to be so by the very many people who will remark on it, I suspect, in the days which follow. contribution to this debate on the Migration Amendment (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013. I think perhaps the member for La Trobe has spent too long in Canberra. If she went outside to her electorate and asked them, 'What is one of the top concerns you have in relation to federal politics at the moment?' then she would hear from the people that they are most concerned about the complete mismanagement of the borders of our country. It is a fact that in the last six years of the Howard government, just 272 people arrived illegally on 16 boats. Since 2007 we know that under Labor's watch 32,600 people have arrived illegally on more than 555 boats. It is appalling that government members lecture us on humanity. How is it more humane under the Labor Party's system that more people, who arrive illegally, take the positions of people and places in the refugee and humanitarian program reserved for offshore applicants?. That is what has happened under this government. That is why this bill is before us today. The coalition is going to reserve a minimum of 11,000 places in the 13,750 places under the refugee and humanitarian program for offshore applicants. The real story, the story that Labor will not tell you, the story that in their lamenting about humanity they will not get down to is: what about the mental health of people waiting in those refugee camps whose applications have been reversed because they have not got a place? The trend under Labor where the number of places available for offshore refugee and humanitarian entrants fell to 6,718 places in 2011-12. That is the first point I would make.",289,Bills
238,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (20:14,"I rise to follow the member for La Trobe's extraordinaryMismanagement has serious consequences. The member for La Trobe and all of the Labor members who have participated in this debate ought to reflect on this. They abolished the Pacific solution and replaced it with a system that has caused this problem. That is what the government did when they came to office. The then minister, Chris Evans, said it was one of his proudest moments in parliament, yet all we have seen in the five years since is complete mismanagement, the dismantling of the regime that was able to effectively ensure people did not get on those boats, that people smugglers did not have a product to sell to those people looking to get on the boats. All we have seen since is a rush to get back to the Howard government era. The member for La Trobe, who laments at how we should reflect on this hideous evil of TPVs, ought to reflect that she has adopted about 95 per cent of a policy from the Howard government-there is five per cent missing. What is that five per cent? That five per cent is temporary protection visas, a critical component-not the solution by itself as Labor members have disingenuously suggested. We are not saying that this is the entire answer but it is yet another component and a plank of a system that worked. Why do temporary protection visas work? Because under our proposal, the refugee status of a temporary protection visa holder will be reassessed on the expiration of the visa. It is a humane system. You get a three-year temporary protection visa and then, if circumstances allow for your return to a country, that is a reasonable basis for people to make a decision, denying people smugglers the trade in which they so evilly conduct themselves. That is why it is a sensible suggestion. That is why we have put it up two or three times in this place, because we know it is part of a system that can stop these boats from coming, stop these illegal arrivals, stop these people taking the places of legitimate offshore arrival applicants. If you were concerned about the humanity of the situation, that ought to be one of your primary concerns. I do not hear Labor members saying, like the coalition has guaranteed, that a minimum of 11,000 places out of the 13,750 will be reserved for offshore applicants. I have not heard that. Where is the humanity in that? In fact, all we have heard about is their focus on this five per cent of the policy. They are holding out on the very big hope that this is the end of the Howard era. When the Labor Party picked up the Howard government era policies in a rush to fix the problems they had created and put them into a xerox machine, they missed the final page, which was temporary protection visas. You re-adopted 95 per cent of the Howard government era policies-that is the reality-but you missed a page. The page was temporary protection visas, a component of a system that worked, a reasonable and humane system that treated people with rights and allowed for them to be returned if it was acceptable. It denied people smugglers the product that has caused this whole problem. The member for La Trobe should reflect that it is not in her policy now but it probably will be in a few months. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (20:19): A page was left out by the expert panel as well because it is well and truly an abomination. It was in the Howard years and, if it is ever introduced again, it will be again. We are, of course, talking about a very complicated matter here. I know that the member for Berowra has a great deal of experience with this. For a start, we should understand that of any 100 people that the UN assesses as being suitable for resettlement in a third country, only one is actually resettled. For every one we settle, there are 99 that we do not. So the idea that somehow picking this one or that one creates fairness is just nonsense. We have an incredibly difficult situation to deal with. Temporary protection visas did not work in the Howard years and they will not work now. They did not stop the boats-in fact, the boats increased-and they were not temporary. The vast majority of these people stayed permanently. The visas were cruel beyond belief, and they led to an increase in the number of women and children on boats. So at every level they simply did not work. The visas were introduced in 1999 by the Howard government in response to a surge in unauthorised maritime arrivals. In that year, there were 3,722 unauthorised boat arrivals. In the two years following the introduction of temporary protection visas, there were 8,459 unauthorised arrivals. There were 3,700 in 1999, when temporary protection visas were introduced, and more in 2000 and then more in 2001. Again, they did not work. The number of refugees in the world in the years following the introduction of this visa actually decreased. To say that the result in Australia was due to temporary protection visas is as irrational as saying that the number of people fleeing to the US or Canada was because of Australia's temporary protection visas. The numbers around the world dropped, and they dropped here as well. Following the introduction of temporary protection visas, the number of unauthorised boat arrivals actually increased to 8,459 and then there were 5,500 in 2001-and they were also not temporary. Of the TPVs issued between 1999, when they were introduced, and 2008, when they were abolished by Labor, 88 per cent of arrivals had already been granted permanent status, and of the 1,000 left, 815 were granted permanent status. In fact, only 3.4 per cent, or 379 people, actually went home. So they were not temporary. They did not work. The boats increased. They were not temporary: people were given permanent residence. But on the way to permanent residence there was this incredible cruelty-and we are talking here about people like those in my electorate. They are children who, if you asked them to line up at school, crawl under the desk and wet themselves because the last time they did that terrible things happened. They are the parents whose two-year-old child was forcibly taken from their arms as they fled, and they have no idea where they are. I know a young woman who has been raped so many times in her life that she did not even know it was wrong until she came to this country. I have a man whose sister was arrested at the age of 16 for reading a book and whose eyes were gouged out. A month later, after her torture, he was allowed to collect her body if he paid to do so. People who have lived these kinds of lives were asked to live here in uncertainty and reapply every three years. The cruelty of thatparticularly when, at the end of it, you gave them permanent residence, after you damaged these broken people incredibly with this abomination of a policy-is quite astonishing. That we would talk about reintroducing something under which the boats increased anyway, under which people became permanent, not temporary, and under which they were treated so cruelly is astonishing. It is astonishing that we are talking about this. But the worse thing for me was the change in the range of people who sought to get on boats after temporary protection visas were introduced, because they denied family reunion. You could not leave Australia to visit your family and you could not attempt to bring your family over here. People were separated from their children and their partners for eight years under this policy. So what happened? They put their families on boats. In 1999, over 12 per cent of asylum applications from people from Iraq and Afghanistan who had come by boat were for women and children. Just two years later it was 42 per centfrom 12 per cent to 42 per cent in two years. Three-quarters of the passengers on the SIEVX, which sank tragically in October 2001-there were 353 on board and 288 were women and children-had family members who were TPV holders in Australia. This is an abomination. At every level this policy failed and at every level it was cruel beyond belief. briefly on the motion for the second reading of the Migration Amendment (Reinstatement of Temporary Protection Visas) Bill 2013, which I support. I do speak on these issues from the background of somebody who has taken a very considerable interest, over a long period of time, in the plight of refugees. In fact, if you go back and look at my earlier career, I was involved with the Khmer, the Afghans and the Romanians out of Europe. When I became minister, I was involved with the programs that bought Sudanese and others to Australia. I do not come to any debate about these discussions with any hostility to refugees. I do have a commitment to running immigration programs with integrity. I think one of the problems that the government has at the moment is that people around Australia no longer believe that the programs are being conducted with integrity. I could have a long debate about what that means; but when you have lost control of your borders you find that the support for immigration and even the support for resettling refugees diminish. I think that is a great tragedy. I am one who believes that we can target our resources most carefully, for those who are most in need, if we are able to manage our borders effectively. The member for Parramatta ran this argument that there is no queue. I have a mischievous sense of humour and I am sure my colleagues will understand when I say this: if the approach that we are taking now is that those people who have enough money to pay people smugglers get priority of place as refugees, because of the refugee convention, then I would suggest that the government ought to-in relation to the remaining places-go to refugee camps around the world and say, 'Who has got $10,000 to pay?' We could give it to those who have the money. I imagine you would look at me with horror and say, 'No government would do that.' Yet, at the moment, the people who get the priority are those who have the money to pay. They may be driven by what they think are their needs, but it is money that is the determining factor. If you come to a view that it is better to have an orderly process in which you can make an objective assessment about who needs help the most then you have to address the issue of how you manage your borders. It is not easy; I have had to do it. But what I can say is that those who suggest that there is one miracle cure available do not understand the dynamics. I say, with great personal confidence, that we needed all of the measures that we put in place to be able to bring this trafficking to an end. It is argued that the trafficking came to an end because the push factors were not as great. I tell you, the push factors were just as great from Afghanistan and Iraq when we were in government as they are now. The main determinant factors that have changed have been the pull factors. The Indonesians recognise it. You have Indonesian ministers and public officials saying, 'What have you done about the sugar?' Their willingness to cooperate and work with us, which is an important factor that we need, is determined by whether they think we have",292,Bills
239,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (20:24,"Thank you very much for the opportunity to speakdone everything that we can to deal with this issue-and they do not. They saw the unwinding of the policy in relation to TPVs as unwinding our willingness to address these issues. TPVs are very simple: they give people the protection which they are guaranteed under the refugee convention, but the refugee convention says nothing about giving people permanent residency. Opposition members say-and I heard it again tonight-that, when we would take away TPVs and give people permanent residencies, no women and children would be getting on boats. Yet all the evidence is that women and children are still getting on boats even today. In my view, all of the measures that the Howard government pursued need to be implemented. TPVs are one of those and that is why I support the bill that is before the chamber. outlined on numerous occasions: the Chinese, the Irish, the ten-pound Poms, even the Germans like me, the Greeks, the Italians-we came from all over the world. After World War II we saw seven million people come to this country-4.4 million of them have become Australian citizens. We took 35,000 Jewish people after the Holocaust at the end of World War II. Eighty-five per cent of people who come to this country become Australians within 10 years, so we have a long history of being a compassionate country. Our country has been diminished by those opposite in the last 10 years in the way they have dog whistled their way for political advantage in terms of the number of people across the world who are refugees or displaced persons. Back in 1951 when the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established, there were 1.5 million refugees internationally. At the end of 2011, there were 42.5 million forcibly displaced persons, including 15.2 million refugees under what we call the definitions in relation to that. There are 895,000 asylum seekers and 26.4 million internally displaced persons. This is a massive problem and, in global terms, the number of people who have come to this country is relatively small. In America there are approximately more than 500,000 unauthorised arrivals each year. In Italy alone there were 61,000 irregular arrivals by sea from North Africa, Greece and Turkey, and yet those opposite seem bent on exploiting this issue for base political purposes and have done election after election. The member for Berowra and others opposite talk about deterrence. I say to them: if they were interested in proper deterrence, they would agree to the Malaysia solution. The UNHCR was involved in that process-agree to it. But, no, they do not and, as speaker after speaker on the government side has outlined, the TPVs did not work and there was subsequently an increase in the number of people who came. The expert panel did not recommend TPVs be reintroduced. It recommended a number of the policies akin to the Howard government's policies be recommended to be reintroduced but not TPVs. I would have more respect for those opposite if there were fewer sound bites and more substance, and fewer slogans and more solutions. We see the word 'illegal' used again and again and again. They would not use that word unless they focus-grouped it. They use that again and again and again for the very purpose of political advantage: to scare people and make them frightened. That is why they use it. They use a whole host of phrases, like 'turning",295,Bills

They talk about the fact that they would tow the boats back. They talk about the facts that they have all these great policies. They do not have the courage to even mention it to the Indonesians. When the Leader of the Opposition in October last year met with the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, he did not even mention the policy-he forgot about it. The reality is they are courageous here but when they go to meet with the leaders of countries in the region, they seem to forget about their policies. It is one voice here, one voice back in their electorate for base political purposes and another voice when they meet with international leaders. They know their policies will not work and the truth is all about slogans-and the member for Berowra has form on this. The Leader of the Opposition screams and shouts in front of the media, in front of the cameras, but when he comes in front of other countries, he forgets about his own policies because he knows they will not work. He knows they did not work when it came to the TPVs and he knows they will not work again. That is the truth of the matter. Guess what? They are lions here but mice back in Indonesia when they go and meet with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. They know that TPVs did not work and they talk about humanitarian programs.

241,Mr Husic (Chifley,Government Whip) (20:35): At the outset I seek leave to amend,297,Private Members Business
242,Mr Husic,"One of the great privileges I have enjoyed as a member of parliament overChifley electorate, to get to know how people who have come to call Australia home have set up their new lives and to hear their stories. One such community, relatively small in number but undeniably big in spirit, is the Bangladeshi community. Perhaps because of the circumstances they have left behind, the Bangladeshi community, I have found, is particularly community minded and very generous in spirit. The community often gets together to raise funds to send back to Bangladesh to assist those in less fortunate circumstances and help those affected by issues that I want to raise tonight, but they also extend that generosity to their new home, Australia. I mention at this point the energetic contribution of Dr Abdul Haq, who each year hosts the Biggest Morning Tea at Blacktown's Village Green. I have been to a number of these events now and I have seen how the community has rallied to raise much-needed money to fund the Cancer Council's vital research, prevention programs and support services. My colleagues the members for Parramatta and Greenway have also attended and supported these functions, and we have also been delighted to sample the spread of Bangladeshi food and warm hospitality. Dr Haq and the community have also been active in raising funds for those in need back in Bangladesh. I particularly want to commend the community for the money they have helped raise to lift the quality of health care and services in Bangladesh. Their latest project has been focused on harnessing local donations to support the construction of a new hospital-a sizable venture but one they are determined to see become reality. Another person I have been pleased to meet with is Dr Nargis Banu, an environmental scientist who lives in the electorate of Chifley and who, along with her work in this field, hosts a community radio program on SWR FM 99.9, based in Blacktown. The program has run since 2004 and is called the Voice of Bangladesh. Through this program-and I have had the pleasure of participating in the program-Dr Barnu works to raise awareness of various sociocultural issues such as women's rights, domestic violence, multiculturalism and the value of civic participation. Through my connection with the community, I have also come to know of some of the circumstances which resulted in Bangladeshis leaving their homeland to make a new life for themselves in Australia. This nation of over 160 million people only came into being in 1971, but has struggled with division and terrible conflict over the decades. As a country that is often subjected to terrible flooding, it is challenged by the impact of climate change. Despite the economy growing between five and six per cent per year since 1996, political instability, massive problems with income disparity, infrastructure deficiencies and unreliable power supply have all combined to hold back this nation from what it can truly be. Given these circumstances, the best thing that could help ensure Bangladesh to lift itself from its economic and social challenge is widespread political and economic reform. The Bangladeshi Australians I have spoken with express their alarm at human rights violations that have occurred, and in particular war crimes that have been committed in conflicts past. As is often the case, the instance of true reconciliation within nations torn by fierce conflict can only happen in part with a commitment to recognise and acknowledge these events and also to hold to account those who have clearly crossed the line of humanity and engaged in truly horrific acts. The Bangladeshi government that came to power in 2009 set up tribunals to deal with these war crimes, and long standing tensions have re-emerged in the community dating back to the bitter war of independence. While one can appreciate why this might occur, Bangladesh cannot afford to move away from the need to continue the pursuit of justice for the benefit of longer term reconciliation. I remain concerned by the reports I hear, particularly those that have claimed that in the last few weeks over 140 people have been shot dead, with about 25,000 opposition leaders and activists implicated in different cases and arrested. These are matters of great concern, and there can be no winners in the current political climate. I call on all parties to advocate restraint and nonviolence to ensure that reconciliation can occur in a country that has been marred by conflict. Mr Laurie Ferguson: I second the amendment and reserve my right to continue my remarks later. amended. Having undertaken some study of the history of the subcontinent, I can understand that the same dramas and the same conflicts that have afflicted the entire subcontinent have come to exact a terrible toll on Bangladesh. The partition of India and Pakistan, which originally included an East Pakistan, resulted in lots of enmity. In particular, post partition the way in which so much of the political power and resources were centred in the west of Pakistan gave rise to dramas, problems and resentment from the east. That is a short synopsis of how in 1971 there was a war of independence. What resulted from that war and the subsequent instability between 1971 and 1991, when democracy was restored, was great enmity between the sides: the Awami League, which is the current government of Bangladesh, and the Jamaat-e-Islami. The current government has established an international crimes tribunal. It is no great surprise that people are keen to see someone held to account for the excesses and the terrible things that occurred, even though it has been many years since they occurred in the liberation war in 1971. What we have seen are allegations of great violence enacted by the security forces, suggestions that the Awami League has been involved as well, and the counter allegations that Jamaat-e-Islami has reacted or at least egged on its supporters to push back. The reason there has been a lack of confidence in the international crimes tribunal set up by the Awami League is that it has been alleged that when the Awami League has been faced with results that it did not agree with it put forward amendments within the parliament for the ICT law to be changed to allow prosecution to appeal for sentences that have been passed and to decrease the time for an appeal to be completed. So they have changed the rules, after having originally come up with the laws to support the International Crimes Tribunal. But, faced with verdicts they did not agree with, the government party has then decided to change; to appease their supporters and to support their version of events, they decided to bring forward these amendments. That of course has received widespread international criticism. It is important that, when faced with these fairly young democracies, they realise that there is a need for the rule of law to be upheld and that if indeed you do not like the result then you have to live with the fact that the judiciary has been given the opportunity to pass judgement on these matters. Once the judgement has been passed, it is not right that it be revisited in an attempt to get a result that they think is politically desirable.",297,Private Members Business

244,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (20:40,"I welcome this opportunity to speak to the motion asthat of the previous speaker regarding what is going on in Bangladesh at the moment. I adhere to Amnesty International's analysis of 'a wave of violent attacks against Bangladesh's Hindu minority'. I am concerned at the vandalism and destruction of 40 temples and the destruction of shops and houses. To quote Amnesty International, the situation of the Hindu minority 'is at extreme risk'. Amnesty has further commented that the government must ensure that they receive the protection they need. We have a situation where courageous students at Jahangirnagar University have joined with people of all religions to resist this latest onslaught. I am not for a moment saying that the International Crimes Tribunal is perfect. There was the dismissal of a previous judge of the tribunal because of his improper consultations with the prosecuting side of the case. Similarly, there have been other issues. However, after the death sentence was placed on Delwar Hossain Sayedee, Jamaat-i-Islami, an extreme Islamist group that has a very bad track record within the country, went on what was essentially a campaign of attacks upon minorities. Khaleda Zia, the opposition BNP leader, has certainly lifted the heat in this dispute by speaking of 'genocide'. In Bangladeshi politics, the use of this language refers very much to the 1971 struggle for independence. As I said, I do not for a moment say that this crimes tribunal has been a perfect instrument. I totally oppose the death penalty as I do in its instigation in this case. However, we have a situation where things are accelerating. What worries me even further are recent pronouncements by the BJP in India, where they are utilising the events in Bangladesh to say that this has been totally instigated by the Pakistani government and its security apparatus the ISI, saying that they are behind the scenes-and I do not accept that for a moment, but this is typical of the escalation that can occur in these situations. The Economist of 9 March stated that the opposition BNP was 'behaving more like an insurgency than a political party'. Children are being 'as human shields' and the eyes have been gouged out of policeman. I do not for a moment defend excesses by civilian police forces; however, we have a situation where there have been attacks on police stations throughout the country. We have a situation where minorities are being assailed. At the end of the day, I do not care if somebody is a leader of a political party and that he is a religious leader. I do not care what his current position is; the situation is that this country should investigate fully those people guilty of murder, abduction, rape, torture and persecution during the heroic struggle for independence in 1971. Equally of course, we have on the other side of the fence, dissatisfaction by some people aligned with the Awami League that Molla only got a court sentence. We have situations where many of the attacks that have occurred on the Hindu minority are followed immediately after Jamaat-i-Islami demonstrations. So you have a big rally; you all get around protesting about this death sentence; and then coincidentally, strangely, a few moments later, the Hindus are attacked, et cetera. I am proud to be the chair of the Bangladeshi Friendship Group. My electorate has Sydney's greatest concentration of Bangladeshis. I associate with all of them, regardless of their religious beliefs, and I have had significant number of Muslims ringing me, expressing concern at the current situation. We have a situation where the Jamaat-e-Islamists and the extreme measures they are undertaking endanger democracy in the country. They endanger",299,Private Members Business
245,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (20:45,"I am afraid there are different analyses to the secular history of the country, and it is important that I put on the record tonight that this is not simply an attempt by the Awami League to somehow manipulate some upcoming election. It has nothing to do with that whatsoever. The real crisis in the country is that the BNP has unfortunately associated itself with this extreme militancy, this attack on civil institutions and this defence of people who are war criminals. debate on this motion moved by the member for Chifley, and I congratulate him for it. The member's motion notes, in its first paragraph: (1) the tremendous contributions of Australia's Bangladeshi community; The paragraph which is amended, which I also support, is: (2) shows concern at recent violence and reports of human rights violations in Bangladesh, expresses regret at the loss of life and injuries involved, and calls on all parties to exercise restraint and to advocate non-violence; The third paragraph is: (3) encourages the Australian Government to engage with the Bangladeshi Government to progress democratic reform within that country. According to our 2006 census, there are around 20,000 Bangladeshis in Australia, and many Australians of Bangladeshi origin have found their homes in Sydney and Melbourne, where the larger communities are found. Bangladeshi Australians have certainly made a tremendous contribution to our nation, as correctly noted in this motion, and have seamlessly entered into and participated in the broader Australian community. The Australian and Bangladeshi people share a history within the Commonwealth, not to mention a love for cricket. They say that the captain of the Australian cricket team is one of the most important jobs in our nation. No doubt this is also the case of the Bangladeshi cricket captain. Bangladesh is a full member of the International Cricket Council, gaining status as a full test-playing nation in the year 2000, the 10th nation to achieve this status, with Bangladesh playing their first test match against India in 2000 in their capital, Dhaka. The region of Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on the earth, with a population density exceeding 900 people per square kilometre. Most of the Bengal region lies in the Ganges Delta, the world's largest delta. The southern part of the delta lies in UNESCO heritage-listed lands, the largest mangrove forest in the world and the home of the Bengal tiger. Our two nations are fostering a growing economic relationship, but our two economies are only the infancy stage of our growing trade links. Our exports to Bangladesh for the last year were $542 million, consisting mainly of fertilisers, cotton, vegetables and wheat, while the total value of imports in Australian currency increased from $190 million in 2008 to $305 million last year, an increase of 156 per cent in just three years. As a good neighbour in our region, Australia provides duty-free and quota-free access on all imports from Bangladesh. The country does face a number of challenges, including poverty and population pressures, but it has been noted by the international community for its progress on the Human Development Index. The country has greatly increased life expectancy, achieved gender parity in education, reduced population growth and improved maternal child health.

246,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (20:50,"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to theYear Marked By Flawed Trials, Continued Impunity, Pressure on NGOs', discussed its World Report 2013, which was handed down on 1 February this year and paints a worrying and concerning picture of the conditions faced on the ground in Bangladesh. Sadly, it also painted a picture of 2012 as being a year in which the human rights situation went backwards, obviously a concerning trend. However, there is a tale of hope in the story for Bangladesh. We see a growing economy along with the saplings of democracy that need to be nurtured. As a responsible neighbour in our region, we must be forthright in encouraging and demanding the government of Bangladesh to do better. They only need to look to themselves for inspiration. Consider the story of Nobel peace prize laureate Mohammed Younis, the Bangladeshi banker and economist who received the Nobel Prize for efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development. He was the first Bangladeshi to win this prestigious award. In summary, we do note the tremendous contribution of the Bangladeshi community here in Australia. However, we are concerned about the violations of human rights currently in that country and as the Australian parliament we should use our voice to encourage the Bangladeshi government to progress the democratic reform as soon as possible. Debate adjourned. Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Goulburn-Murray Water Authority Dr STONE (Murray) (20:56): I wish to talk about a very significant grievance I have about what is occurring in northern Victoria in my electorate of Murray. One of the most often repeated and strongly stated messages from across the Murray-Darling Basin has been the irrigators' plea to stop the water buybacks. Numerous evaluations of the impact of the buybacks have noted the stranded assets, lost on-farm food manufacturing and transport jobs, less sustainable communities, collapsed land values and environmental degradation where dried-off farms blow dust in summer and sprout weeds the rest of the time. People who have been away for a while walk into my office at Shepparton and talk about their shock at seeing the changes. They cannot believe the sight of all those abandoned dairies that were once a continuous lush landscape of highly productive irrigated agriculture. Ten years ago the Goulburn-Murray water area had 1,900 gigalitres producing billions of dollars worth of beef, cereal, dairy and fruit production annually. This productivity supported more than 20 food factories and a thriving irrigation services sector. Five years ago water sales out of the district had reduced this volume to 1,600 gigalitres. This volume has now been sold down to 900 gigalitres. If 100 megalitres creates one job and there are 1,000 megalitres in a gigalitre, there is little wonder that we have seen a major exodus of workforce directly and indirectly employed in agribusiness, and along with them go their families. The Victorian government has now taken a lead from Senator Penny Wong and Minister Burke in targeting irrigators to sell off more of what is left of their high security GoulburnMurray irrigation water. This is a further blow to the recovery of northern Victoria from seven years of drought. On Friday the minister for water-or is that the minister for selling waterannounced that he wanted the strategic purchase of another 25 to 50 gigalitres of water from irrigators as part of the Goulburn-Murray Water Connections project. What does strategic purchase mean? It is supposed to mean the carefully planned purchase of water from one or more irrigators which is not found to have detrimental third-party impacts, for example on the economy, and which can be justified on the grounds that it improves the efficiency of remaining irrigators or better sustains the environment? According to Victorian minister Peter Walsh and his Department of Sustainability and Environment, drying off farms on spur channels, some half of the system, is 'strategic'. Others argue, however, that this is no way to try to save the skin of the deeply indebted, inefficient and grossly overstaffed Goulburn-Murray Water Authority. This is not about farmers and the strategic use of their water; this is about trying to save a large number of public service jobs. Astonishingly, the current Victorian government has chosen to follow the Bracks and Brumby governments which took water off drought-stricken food producers in northern Victoria to flush down the north-south pipeline to Melbourne. The pipeline was stopped after a massive community backlash which saw the Labor state seat of Seymour change to Liberal to give the one-seat majority to the coalition in that most recent cliffhanger election. Irrigators thought that they and their communities had been saved with the new coalition state government. But the new Minister for Water has chosen instead to try to save the indebted and ailing state run Goulburn-Murray Water. Minister Walsh should have drastically downsized the 700-person workforce-now hopelessly mismanaging the irrigation system. It should be noted that the bigger and more efficient New South Wales irrigator-owned cooperatives only need some 250 staff to do the same job. Instead, on the advice of his department, Minister Walsh has chosen to downsize the irrigation system itself, reducing its footprint to half, destroying the production security and economies of scale which are essential for sustaining the local food manufacturing sector. No amount of reciting the big new food export opportunities in Asia can alter the fact that the capacity of Victorian northern irrigators is being deliberately and rapidly reduced, as their high-security water is being traded to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. This new environmental water is not being used to sustain the environment. Gross mismanagement of this water or failure to use it at all is leaving the community scratching its head and leaving others simply in despair. In the joint press release issued on Sunday on this new so-called strategic purchase program for water, Minister Walsh said: This will be a voluntary strategic purchase program for eligible spur channel irrigators from the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District areas of Central Goulburn, Murray Valley, Loddon Valley, Rochester-Campaspe, Shepparton and Torrumbarry. The program, which opens from Mondaythat is todaywill offer frequent opportunities for sales in the coming months. … … … Federal Minister for Water Tony Burke said the Connections Project was the largest Commonwealth Government investment in irrigation infrastructure, with more than $2 billion of State and Federal funding committed to date. Let me remind everybody that this connections project aims to halve the irrigation system and reduce therefore exponentially the capacity of this area to produce volumes of food, particularly to sustain a food manufacturing sector. The joint press release further states: The Connections Project offers a number of choices, including connecting to an upgraded backbone, developing shared supply infrastructure, relocating closer to the backbone, or transitioning to a nonirrigated farm. Let us talk about what that really means. Connecting to an upgraded backbone usually involves pumping water and it involves the costs of energy, either electric or diesel pumps that were never before required, and so will substantially put up the price of irrigation for farms. Developing shared supply infrastructure means that you are supposed to cluster with your five, 10, 15 or maybe 25 fellow irrigators on a spur and together you are meant to manage the water scheduling, the system maintenance and the delivery of that water. You are supposed to hold your water entitlement together in common. Together, you are liable for any accidents or non-payments for that water. You are supposed to act as if you are a small irrigation system all by yourself, except of course you do not have the economies of scale and you do not have the spare capacity to run the system yourself unless you employ someone to do that. The costs for you are going to go up exponentially. In terms of relocating closer to the backbone, irrigators regularly come to me complaining that they have been forced to consider doing this. This means selling their current property, which might be an 800-cow dairy which your family has developed over several generations. You are meant to have that property dried off-the water taken off-and it would then be worth a fraction of its value. You are meant to consider buying an alternative irrigation property that typically has been dried off some time ago and that, typically, would require a bank loan. The most recent case I have been working with involved a bank loan of at least another half a million dollars to shift from one perfectly viable, highly desirable irrigation farm to another closer to the backbone and involved a substantial new debt that no-one in agriculture anywhere in Australia wants. The final option, transitioning to a non-irrigated farm, means you substantially devalue your property and take the irrigation water and its infrastructure off your farm. Your farm then becomes virtually unsaleable. Also, it means that on your dried-off farm, you are going to depend on local rainfall, which in my area is less than 15 inches a year. If you fail to agree to any of those options-and I have numbers of letters from irrigators given these ultimatums-and you are one of the last on the spur to cave in to the demands of this new so called connecting project then you are told that in one year and one day you can see your water cut off, you can see your situation taken out of your hands and you will lose your irrigation water under the new regulations of the state government. This is the most heinous situation in terms of irrigated agriculture being destroyed in northern Victoria, all in the name of trying to salvage the wreckage of the Goulburn-Murray Water authority. This is unconscionable. It is not about trying to find water for Victoria's invalley targets of 650 gigalitres. What happened to previous notification that that was only 627 gigalitres? The whole thing seems to me to be desperate measures for a desperate situation. And the victims of all of this are food producers in northern Victoria, jobs, communities, families and a whole culture of people working for themselves, developing something from nothing and producing some of the finest and cleanest and greenest food available anywhere in the world. It is about not trusting individuals to modernise their own properties. This is a shocking situation. (Time expired) New South Wales Seniors Week Ms HALL (Shortland) (21:06): This week, New South Wales celebrates Seniors Week. It is an opportunity for all communities in my home state to celebrate the achievements of our senior citizens and to let them know how much we appreciate their achievements and contributions. It is important that members ensure that seniors in their electorates know how much we value them. I am passionate about creating a positive message around senior Australians, one that recognises their achievements and ongoing contributions. Governments and the media in advertising have often opted to create a negative stereotypical image of older Australians, rather than promoting a positive image of these wonderful people. For instance, the Intergenerational report commissioned under the Howard-Costello government looked at the costs of an ageing population. It looked at health and age expenditure, fragility, workplace participation and pension, and how these issues placed costs on the Australian economy, rather than looking at society and the contribution that older people make to our country. Australian 2050: future challenges identifies ageing with spending pressures. It states: Ageing of the Australian population will contribute to substantial pressures on government spending … It goes on to project increases in age related spending to 27.1 per cent of GDP in 2049. The report continues along the same lines throughout its pages. Every approach from the Howard-Costello government, in the report that I referred to, looks at the cost of ageing. At no stage does it look at the benefits from older Australians and the contributions that they make to our society. It uses words like 'frail', dependent', 'slow', 'doddery' instead of looking at 'active', 'caring', 'connected', 'vibrant'-all things that older people are. In this place during Seniors Week in New South Wales, it is important for us to put on the record that we believe that older Australians make an enormous contribution to our society. WhilstI talked about the negative literature that surrounds older Australians, I have looked for some more positive articles. To be quite frank with you, I could find very little that details the contribution of older Australians. There is vague reference to volunteering and child care, but nowhere does it set down very definitely their enormous contribution. Some figures I found in the Productivity Commission report refer to the fact that volunteering does contribute to our economy-and we all know that. I think every member of parliament would recognise the enormous contribution volunteers make to their community. The report mentioned that about $21 billion to $30 billion was contributed to our economy by work done by volunteers. That is $21 billion to $30 billion of free work by volunteers in our community. It goes without saying that the majority of those volunteers are 45 years and older. Whilst we talk about the cost of an ageing population to our society, we also have to look at the benefits to our society-what those older Australians give to our society. With regard to those figures for volunteering, if you factor in informal childcare arrangements, the figure goes up to $42 billion. That is a $42 billion contribution that older Australians make to our society, which is quite a contribution. Many senior Australians would still like to be employed, even after reaching the official retirement age. Unfortunately, there are many negative stereotypes about older Australians in the workplace which act as a barrier to employment for them. If you look at industry advertising, you can see it is based on younger-looking people, whilst more mature members of society are portrayed as tired and worn out. It is a myth that ageing equals sickness, disability and dementia, when two out of three people aged 65 and older rate their health as 'good or excellent'. Eighty per cent of people aged 70 and over live independently, without help from care services. It is also a myth that the ageing of the population is a looming crisis. People are living longer, and many are enjoying an active and healthy old age. We need to harness the skills and expertise of these older Australians and mature-age workers. When we recognise that older Australians have such skills and can still contribute to the economy, and incorporate them into the workforce, then we as a nation will be a richer place. As I said, it would be good for our economy, and they would be able to make a contribution to the long-term viability of our society. Now, while there are older Australians who contribute in every possible way, there are some older Australians who need a little extra help, and I think it is important that as a government we provide that help and provide it in a variety of ways-preferably so that they can maintain their independence even longer than they do at the moment. In saying that, it is really important to know that it is actually only about seven per cent of older Australians who need residential care. So the majority of older Australians live in our community and, as I have already highlighted, many of them continue to contribute to that community. The changes to the pension have given older Australians more freedom than they have had previously. The massive increases to the age pension delivered by Labor-by the Rudd government in 2009 and the Gillard government since-have led to a greater degree of financial security for older Australians than they have had in the past. Coupled with the changes to superannuation that are designed to increase financial independence, these measures have all helped older Australians. The increase in the total pension rate for age pensioners from 20 March will be $35.80 for singles and $54 for couples. It is interesting to note that the pension rate for couples has increased from $898 per fortnight under the Howard government to $1,218.80 under the Labor government. The pension rate for singles has increased from $537 to $808.40. That is an enormous increase in disposable income. Pensioners stimulate our economy through their activities. For instance, they have holidays and they are involved in hospitality through going to cafes. In doing so, they are generating income within the community. By rewarding them and giving them more financial security, we are in effect stimulating our economy. The work bonus being paid to pensioners who earn money increases their ability to participate in the workforce. In this week of New South Wales Seniors Week, it is really important that we in this House acknowledge the fine work of senior Australians. I highlight that the three people in Shortland electorate that were awarded an Order of Australia were Robin Gordon, over 65; Keith Grahame, over 65; and Roger Greenham, over 65. They were all awarded an Order of Australia for their fine volunteer work in the community. (Time expired) Petition: Child Abduction me by a constituent in my electorate of Macquarie, Mr Daniel Wass. This petition represents the culmination of several years of hard work undertaken by a father separated from his child. Daniel presented this petition to me during the last sitting period and undertook a touching and memorable journey to this place. Along with extended family and friends of the Wass family, Daniel set off from Springwood in the Blue Mountains on Saturday, 2 February and cycled all the way to Canberra, collecting signatures for his petition along the way. Daniel and his crew of supporters arrived at Parliament House on the morning of Tuesday, 5 February, and I was delighted to be able to meet them at the steps of this place. The Wass family was warmly received by both me and the shadow minister for foreign affairs, and Daniel presented us both with the petition. I first met Daniel several years ago, shortly after the abduction of Sean, and I was instantly struck and inspired by the determination of this father to find out what had happened to his son. Any parent will instantly be touched by the plight of Mr Wass and can readily sympathise not only with his grief but with his considerable anxiety to know that his child is safe and well. Daniel has not heard anything of his son since his removal in 2010, and one can readily imagine the tremendous toll this separation and uncertainty would have on any parent. I rise therefore not only to table this petition but to congratulate all those involved in the search for Sean. At the beginning of this year and after many delays and countless representations made by me and my office, we were delighted to hear that Sean had been placed on the Interpol yellow watch list, a significant escalation of the fight to find him. Shortly before this, Daniel informed me of his plans for both this petition and his awarenessraising journey to this place, and I readily offered my support. We have therefore opened 2013 with some positivity, and, hopefully, reinvigorated spirits as the search for Sean continues. Today marks the culmination and fruition of a small part of what has been, and will continue to be, an exhaustive and lengthy process. It is to be hoped that the great love, compassion and support that has been offered to the Wass family by the local Springwood and Blue Mountains community will continue to inspire and help to assist them through the next stages of the search Sean. I present the petition. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This Petition signed by concerned Australians and International Citizens draws the attention of the house to; an Australian Citizen abducted without notice and during family court proceedings to Japan by his Mother on the 10 May 2010. He has been missing and unaccounted for since his abduction with neither his father nor the Australian Authorities being able to make contact with his mother to confirm his safety, welfare or location. His abduction to Japan and the concealment of his location, welfare and confirmed safety is a violation of his Human Rights and of serious concern. These rights have been formally recognised by the Australian Government not only through Australia's Family Law and the formation of the Australian Human Rights Commission, but also internationally with Australia's ratification of both the UN's 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child& The 1980 Hague Convention.",301,Private Members Business
247,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (21:16,"I rise today to table a petition that was presented toRequest: Both the Australian and Japanese Governments have a responsibility to ensure and maintain the rights and safety of all children no matter where in the world they may be. We therefore ask the House to refer the matter to the Australian Prime Minster and or the Foreign Minister insisting they take action to intervene and demand that the Japanese Government confirm the safety, welfare and location of my son. from 4,556 citizens. Petition received. Aged Care care was parlous. The coalition government failed to deliver a plan for a sustainable aged-care system during the long 11½ years it was in office. The previous government failed to deliver a substantial pension increase during their time in office. Contrast that with this government's historic pension reforms by increasing the age pension and the introduction of the extra benefit as part of the Household Assistance Package. In my electorate of Banks, over 20,000 pensioners benefited from these increases. We know that these increases would be ripped away should the coalition win government. We have already seen the New South Wales government increase the cost of public housing rents as a result of the increase to the Commonwealth's income supplement. I doubt that the rent rises will be reversed if a future coalition government removes the increases in benefits. Over one million Australians will receive aged-care services by 2050. Over 3.5 million Australians are expected to use aged-care services each year. Over the past 100 years life expectancy has increased by 25 years. The country needs to ensure that the needs of this ageing population are met. The system we inherited in 2007 was simply not sustainable. As our health and medical services improve, older Australians want to stay at home for as long as possible, while being able to access care and support as well as appropriate and convenient health services. Older Australians should be able to contribute to their own care, based on their capacity to pay. Let us not forget that it was the Labor Party under Prime Minister Fisher that introduced the age pension. It was a Labor government that introduced compulsory superannuation to assist Australians to prepare for a dignified post-retirement life. It is Labor that will always support Australians throughout the different stages and transitions of their lives. Specifically in aged care since the government was elected in 2007, there have been an additional 25,849 residential care places, 13,052 home and community care places and 2,000 transition care places allocated nationally. We will provide nearly $13.6 billion for aged care in 2012-13, compared to $7.8 billion in 2006-07. Since 2007 the government has embarked on an extensive reform of aged care. Overall, this government is delivering a $3.7 billion plan to deliver more choice, easier access and better care for older Australians and their families. This is the largest ever investment in aged care. As part of its Living Longer Living Better program the government has pledged $1.9 billion to deliver better access to aged-care services, $1.2 billion over five years to tackle critical shortages in the aged-care workforce, $80.2 million to improve aged-care linkages with the health system, $54.8 million to carers, $268.4 million to tackle dementia and $192 million to support the diverse care of Australia's ageing population.",307,Grievance Debate
248,Mr Melham (Banks) (21:21,"When this government came to office, the state of agedOn4 MarchI was pleased to host the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, the Hon. Mark Butler MP, on his visit to my electorate. The minister made himself available at a seniors forum I conducted at the Peakhurst Bowling and Recreation Club. He was able to outline some of the significant reforms that the government has introduced as well as answer questions on seniors matters generally and more specific aged-care matters. There was a very positive response. As the minister said: ""We're replacing an aged care system designed a quarter of a century ago and which is now ill-equipped to meet the needs of retiring baby boomers and their parents who are living longer and healthier lives."" … … … ""People want services that respond to their individual needs so we are re-orienting the system on a consumer-directed model."" One of the people attending said that she found it difficult to access information on what assistance and services were available for her ageing mother. She really had to rely on seeking information from her neighbours or friends who had experience. It is satisfying that another government initiative, the My Aged Care website, will be established to assist with precisely that issue. The government is providing $198.2 million over five years to progressively established a gateway to aged-care services. The first step will be establishing a website, together with a national call centre service, as the main entry point for the aged-care system. This will be followed by reforms to assessment arrangements and establishing a new linking service to help the vulnerable in our community to access services. Receiving appropriate levels of support at home is increasingly important for seniors. From 2012, the Australian government has directly funded and administered the home support services for older people currently provided under the Home and Community Care Program in most states and territories. Over the next five years, the government will provide $75.3 million to integrate these services with other Commonwealth programs to create and grow a new home support program. The government currently funds more than 58,000 home care packages. Demand for these packages far outstrips supply, leaving many people forced to wait a long time for care. The government will more than double the number of home care packages available across Australia over the next 10 years, with more than 80,000 new packages by 2021-22. The government is committing $880.1 million over the next five years to expand care in the home, reducing the emphasis on residential care. EarlierI mentioned the visit of Minister Butler to my electorate on 4 March. He also visited Penshurst on 5 March to make an important announcement. I have already referred to the government's commitment to the carers of the aged. This of course includes those who work in the aged-care sector. Aged-care workers have been amongst the lowest paid workers in Australia. They perform the vital task of looking after our older citizens, often in the various aged-care facilities. While this group of workers pursue their careers for more than financial reward, pay rises would no doubt be a further incentive to work in a growing industry. On his second visit to Banks, Minister Butler announced a landmark agreement to provide higher wages, better conditions and more rewarding careers for the 350,000 workers in the aged-care industry. The funding will flow from July through a workers supplement, delivering pay rises for aged-care nurses, care workers and others in the aged-care industry. An additional one per cent pay rise will be available above minimum annual wage increases or other wage rises negotiated through the enterprise bargaining agreements for workers employed by aged-care providers that meet the requirements of a workforce compact. This means that a personal care worker currently paid the award rate who is employed by an agedcare provider that meets the requirements would effectively see a pay rise of up to 18.7 per cent over four years. Enrolled nurses would receive 25 per cent higher pay and registered nurses 29.9 per cent higher pay in the same situation. The workforce supplement will be paid to providers that meet the conditions of the workforce compact, which was developed in consultation with providers and unions. Providers will be required to pass the supplement on as higher wages. Workers employed by providers that meet the terms of the compact will receive not only increased wages but also enhanced training and education and improved career pathways and development. One aim of the workforce compact is to improve the capacity of the aged-care sector to attract and retain staff through higher wages, improved career structures, enhanced training and education opportunities, improved career development and workforce planning, and better work practices. The second part of the Addressing Workforce Pressures initiative is the aged-care workforce development plan, which will begin later this year. An expert advisory group will be established to focus on better ways to support the aged-care workforce. This group will seek to ensure that, on top of wage increases, aged-care workers get the other benefits, including improved career structures, better training and education, and better work practices, including lowering the high rate of workforce injuries in aged care. I am proud to be part of a government that continues the Labor tradition of social reform and social justice. The reforms to the long-neglected aged-care sector are extensive and go to the heart of the industry's needs. These measures are in the great Labor traditions of equity, fairness and social justice. This is where the difference between Labor and the Tories is self evident. Our ability to combine idealism with pragmatism has allowed us to make a real difference to Australian society. Throughout its history, the Australian Labor Party has been the only party that has been able to deliver benefits to working Australians and real economic and social reform. We have done this by virtue of our ideas and vision. We should not do it at the expense of one section of the community to benefit the other. What we need is dignity in retirement. We should not take advantage of the goodwill of a lot of people in the sector and pay them slave wages. Those arguments are long gone. People need fair wages. We need to accept, as a government, whatever political party is in government, that we have to provide dignity in retirement for our aged people and dignity to the workers in that sector, because we rely on them enough as it is; they do put in a lot more than they are paid. Small Business on the lack of confidence in the small-business sector as a result of this government's policies. A recent Sensis Business Index survey of small and medium enterprises showed that only six per cent of small business people believe that the Gillard government's policies support the",308,Grievance Debate
249,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (21:31,"I would like tonight to take the opportunity to touchsector. TonightI wish to speak on behalf of the 94 per cent of small businesses who are dissatisfied with the government's policies on small business. It is instructive to just have a look at some of the facts that underpin our small to medium business sector. Some 99.7 per cent of all actively-traded businesses in Australia are SMEsbusinesses that employ between five and 200 employees. They employ some 70 per cent of the Australian workforce and, on the latest figures, from 2008-09, they invested some $5 billion in research and development. Those facts quite clearly point to what an important sector this is in our economy. As a result of Labor's policies, the small business sector's share of the private sector workforce has contracted from 51.3 per cent to 45.7 per cent. Small business confidence, conditions, profitability, cash flows and employment are all in negative territory, according to the latest NAB quarterly SME survey. Furthermore, the number of people employed in small business has declined under Labor from some 5,061,000 to 4,800,000-a loss of some 243,000 jobs. And the number of employing small businesses has also declined under Labor, from 749,000 to 739,000, a loss of some 10,000 employing small businesses. These findings speak directly to the negative effect of the government's policies on the small-business sector-disastrous policies such as the introduction of the carbon tax, leaving small business exposed to the world's greatest carbon tax with no direct compensation and no analysis of how the tax would impact these small businesses. According to an article in the Daily Telegraph, the carbon tax is contributing to a record number of firms going to the wall, with thousands of employees being laid off and companies forced to close factories that have stood for generations. Soaring energy bills caused by the government's climate change schemes have been called the straw that broke the camel's back by company executives and corporate rescue doctors who are trying to save these ailing firms. New data from the corporate regulator reveals that insolvencies have hit a record high in the past 12 months, led by widespread failures in manufacturing and construction, which account for almost one-fifth of all collapses. The article goes on to say: The Australian Securities and Investment Commission is reporting there are some 10,600 company collapses for the 12 months to 1 March, averaging 886 per month, with the number of firms being placed in administration more than 12 per cent higher than during the global financial crisis. There is more. There is the Prime Minister's job plan, the Australian industry participation plan, a plan which, according to the IPA, seeks to suffocate small businesses with more red tape. It is almost like a scene out of War of the Worlds. It is like the tentacles of the red Martian weed creeping through the Australian economy as this government envelops small business and the broader community in an endless array of red tape and bureaucracy. To date, over 20,000 new regulations have been enacted but only 104 have been repealed. This is a far cry from the one-in, one-out policy promised by Labor at the 2007 election. A recent article featured on the IPA website notes that the Australian industry participation plan is a recipe for increased red tape. Rather than making it easier for foreign businesses to operate in Australia, this plan will punish those who do business here. It will create public service jobs in Canberra. The bureaucrats will be allowed to second-guess business choices. This government has never understood that make-work schemes detract from profit-making and so deter business. Small business is the workhorse of the economy but what can the Prime Minister promise? She wants to make it easy for small business to raise finance. However, as with many things we see with this government, she has provided no detail but hinted, merely hinted, at a grant system. This is just picking winners. In my electorate of Forde there are around 11,400 small businesses. I recently invited these businesses along to a forum to address and speak about the challenges businesses are facing in our own backyard. I can tell you now that the lack of consideration and care from policymakers in regard to Australia's small-business sector rated high on the complaint list during the business forum which I hosted with the shadow minister for small business, the honourable member for Dunkley. I would like to digress here for a moment to compare and contrast our dedication to the small-business sector. For starters, our shadow minister for small business has been meeting with small-business people across Australia since 2007 developing considered plans that will take the burden off and support the success of small business. We compare this to the government's efforts and see that they have had the fourth labour minister in 14 months with little interest or background in the sector that employs almost half the private sector workforce. It is interesting to note that when the government's small business minister appeared on ABC Lateline recently during the Prime Minister's visit to Western Sydney he did not even mention once small business despite the fact that there are some 160,000 small businesses located in Western Sydney. It is no surprise that the small-business sector continues to be treated this way under Labor, especially when the Prime Minister's own department has revealed that she rarely concerns itself with small-business issues. This further demonstrates the Gillard government's neglect of the sector. Asked whether the Prime Minister has met with the inaugural Small Business Commissioner, Mark Brennan, a representative from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet retorted that the Prime Minister's focus is on the priority issues of today. 'Smallbusiness issues do not often come up in terms of issues that are before the Prime Minister or before the cabinet. I guess our focus of resource tends to focus on those issues that are before the PM or the cabinet. SoI guess we would have to move our resources in accordance with the priorities.' That was what Marie Taylor, first assistant secretary for the industry, infrastructure and environment division, told the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee. The government cannot even properly report on the effectiveness of its own dealings with small business. The 2012 Australian government payments to small business report remains outstanding nine months after the end of the financial year. This is a report which documents how effective the government is in meeting the 30-day payment threshold for goods and services received from small business. As I was explaining earlier, during the small business forum, we had businesses in the room that have suffered too long under this government. Even long-serving Labor voters who have been trying to keep their business afloat and employing some 80 people under these conditions have said they will never vote Labor again-and rightly so. That particular business has since gone into liquidation with those staff now looking for work. This sadly is not an uncommon turn of events for many small business operators around the country when the small business sector's share of private sector workforce has contracted from 51.3 per cent to 45.7 per cent of the workforce under the five years of this Labor government. The coalition has real solutions and will seek to double the rate of small business growth by scrapping the carbon tax and cutting $1 billion worth of red tape. I can say to the small business community: small business is a central part of the coalition's real solutions plan to create one million new jobs in five years and two million jobs within a decade. Our plan, which includes abolishing the carbon tax, reducing compliance costs and making sure small business is represented on key economic and regulatory bodies, is envisaged to create the framework to increase productivity and double the rate of small business growth for the future wealth of our country. Dairy Industry and Beef Industry legislation and regulation along with a government funded independent body to protect competition and consumers in this country, in particular with regard to milk and beef prices, and the need for more consideration and more work on behalf of the farmers and the suppliers in the retail market we currently have in Australia. I acknowledge the ACCC works hard to balance the competing needs of retailers, consumers, producers and processors. All the stakeholders seem to think there is an imbalance in the system, even despite that work from the ACCC. We have had Senate inquiry after Senate inquiry. We have had good intentions expressed. We have had all the rhetoric from all the various players within politics. The ACCC brings case after case, yet these fundamental concerns are growing, not reducing, under the current legislative regime. Firstly, dairy farmers in my electorate as a group are angry. They start work at 4 am; they finish after dark. They do not get a day off 365 days a year, including Christmas Day. They have to invest heavily in land and infrastructure, and a reasonable return on the value of that land and infrastructure is by and large unachievable on the capital itself. They are totally at the mercy of natural events. Recently no rain for months meant there was no feed on the ground. Rising grain costs cut into their already tight profit margins. When the rain arrived, it resulted in two flood events in a month which meant some who were happy for the rain to come-and then it came too hard-were left having to dump their milk due to isolation and the poor quality of local roads. In the end, you have to get these stories out of the farmers themselves. They do not complain about these events: they are part of life for them. What they complain about is the playing field, and I hope what the majority of MPs in this place consider to be the unfair, the uncompetitive and the unsustainable playing field that they have. When the dairy industry in New South Wales was regulated, it was inflexible to the needs of farmers. Still, I stood at Taree West club with a Queensland MP and member of Katter's Australian Party, Bob Katter, over a decade ago and with many others to express worry about how transition would occur and what it would mean for local dairy farmers and the number of farmers on the ground. Despite the nice theory, on paper, about the value of deregulation, when regulation was removed it increased the flexibility of the industry but it also removed a large number of the smaller, less capital intensive farmers on the ground-many of whom were generational farmers in their 50s and 60s who were thinking about handing the farm",310,Grievance Debate
250,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (21:41,"I grieve tonight about the amount of substantialover to another family member but were jammed in this change from a regulated environment to a deregulated environment. This was all based on a view that deregulation assumes you are launching a player into a level playing field, but a decade later this certainly has been demonstrated to be not the case. I hear the same thing across many sectors, from not only dairy farmers but also beef producers and suppliers up the supply chain: the ACCC's powers are not effective at addressing the real issues; the ACCC ask for evidence when the true evidence is in the hands of the retailers themselves, not the industries being affected; and the ACCC want processors and primary producers to provide information about major retailers when they are just not in a position to do so. When the powers under our fair trading laws to expose abuse of market power are not used, that in many ways demonstrates the problem itself-the abuse of market power is in the silence that comes from the suppliers on the ground. Processors and primary producers tell me they have seen those who complain through this complaints process cut from the only markets available to them despite the existence of market power laws. I hear agreement that a simple look makes it appear a consumer is benefiting, and one might ask how can lower prices not benefit consumers? In the long-term, the end gain becomes important-what is a sustainable position for consumers and for competition? The worry is that the ACCC consider only the short-term rather than the long term impacts of consumer and competition issues. I also hear the view that milk is an international product, and therefore the appearance of competition exists. But the story of suppliers is that they cannot access the international market at all. I do query our marketing of beef and milk to the emerging middle classes throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Newspapers in the south of the Philippines and newspapers read by many Asia-Pacific families-families that are now coming out of poverty and seeking protein-run as and stories about how parents can fatten their children; how they can improve their children's access to protein. That is culturally completely different from what happens in Australia. Why are we not, from an economic and a moral position, tapping those markets? Why are we not building cold store solutions and building a supply chain to these emerging markets? Why are we not considering how refrigeration can play a role in economic development not only for these emerging economies but for Australia's economic benefit as well? It has me stumped-with all the intelligence we have in the farming community and in government, why have we not been able to develop those links better than we have so far? At the moment we rely on AusAID, we rely on good organisations like ACIAR, the international agricultural research arm of government, but we are still exposed to some very immature trade links with emerging economies that are up for grabs. There are people who want beef and milk. We are a country of beef and milk yet we cannot develop the link between us and them, for some unknown reason. So where is the work to develop these new markets as well as to expand existing markets? This is where I raise the question: where are the levies paid going? What about the R&D? There is plenty of focus on the 'R'; I worry that there is less focus on the 'D' and the development of these new and emerging markets. I also raise the question of revisiting the issue of the supermarket duopoly. There are many problems facing our producers. The current system either needs reworking or amending to achieve the results our community needs. Instead, we enable the major retailers to continue to increase their market share: from supermarket to petrol to hardware to brewing to videos to liquor-the list is endless. We allow it because in the short term it benefits the consumer. So, while this market share grows and while big boxes are dropped into many communities around Australia in what is really a battle over market share and title related to market share, in the end, producers and farmers leave their industries in droves. I ask the question whether in the future the retailers sadly will be the farmers and the producers, and the consumer will lose in the long term unless we start to address some of these issues. I know on the table there is the proposal for a grocery ombudsman. I know there are issues of voluntary or mandatory codes of conduct. I hope they are progressed for all the issues of benefiting the long-term interests of Australia and the long-term interests of what I hope is being part of Australia: a beef and dairy industry as part of the Australian story.
