First, if we are to plan for our threat as requiring a major response from the future defence needs-I use that term broadly to Australian Government. The third assumption is encompass both our defence forces and defence that this assessment will be accepted by the support-we need to understand very clearly government of the day. The last assumption is what our vital national interests are, those that the government of the day will not only act interests which at all costs must be protected, and on the assessment given to it but also will take to separate in our thinking those vital interests action sufficient in all respects to meet the threat from other interests which, although important, when and if it emerges.
