The Commonwealth Bank Has not yet achieved the success' which its founders hoped for it , and this B ill , I take it , is designed to remedy that state of affairs. It seems to me, however, that the B ill proceeds in an entirely wrong direction, and that, if it becomes law, instead of helping the Bank and improving the financial affairs of Australia, it will tend only to damage them. I propose to put before the House my reasons for this view. During this debate, many comparisons have been made between the ComSix ladies (wives of monwealth Bank and the Bank of England. In my opinion, there is no analogy between the two. They are built on entirely different lines. When the Bank of England was established, in 1694, it was given an absolute monopoly, and that monopoly was maintained for more than a century and a half. Our Bank, on fche other hand, was established in competiI t is a fair thing. We tion with all the Associated Banks, and it is not, in the ordinary sense of the term, a true State Bank. It is my desire this afternoon to point out how, in my opinion, the Commonwealth Bank may be developed in such a way as to make ib strong and virile and of real assistance to the Commonwealth. A t the present time. I regard it as being merely an in strument of torture to the commercial community, whereas it ' could be made a tower of strength to not only the financial institutions and the business world of Australia, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. When the Bank of England was founded it was restricted absolutely in its note issue to the amount of its capital. In view of the This bank is in a different position. The Bank of England was not brought into close touch with the Government u n t i l about 1781-3. It was not u n t i l a good many years later that it became an in strument of the Government, and it is only since 1903 that it has been the centre of all the financial transactions of the Home Government. It w ill be seen, therefore, that the two institutions are on a wholly different footing. The Bank of England, founded carefully, as it was, and with an Act that was meant to buttress it up in every way, has more than once been landed in difficulties because of State interference. In 1797 it suspended payment, and in 1847, 1857, and again in 1866 it was saved only by the Government suspending the limitation of the Bank Act passed in 1844. Thus the Bank of England has not been that buttress to the affairs of the Old Country that we are",11,Prisoners Of Wari N Australia Treatment Of Interned Germans

85,Mr Fleming (Eobertson) [3.45],"generally led to believe it has been. As recently as 1890 the Bank of France had to come to its rescue with 75,000,000 francs in gold. Again, in 1907, in respouse to a mere telegram, the Bank of France came once more to the help of the Bank of England with 80,000,000 francs in gold. There seems to be a strong in clination on the part of honourable members that this Bank-the Commonwealth Bank-shoul d develop along the very lines which the experience of the Bank of England has shown to be dangerous. It seems to me that we should endeavor to extend it along the lines followed by the Bank of France. It must be remembered that, wlien a crisis arises, we shall have no Bank of France, as the Bank of England has had, to f a l l back upon. The only way in which we can make the Commonwealth Bank a safe asset and a real support to the financial transactions of the Commonwealth is to follow the lines on which the Bank of France is moulded. To do that we must have a solid gold reserve. One of the most interesting problems of the financial world to-day is how the Bank of France retains its tremendous gold reserve, and at the same time maintains such a low rate of discount. That is a subject into which the Commonwealth Government would be well advised to make f u l l inquiry. If we could find out the secret whereby the Bank of France can give such low rates of discounts, and at the same time maintain such a solid gold reserve as it does, we should have discovered the innermost secret of banking. The secret is. one that we need to discover in order that we may take this institution of ours away from lines that seem to me to be a menace to the stability of the States. If fostered in ignorance, it may become a menace to the financial integrity of the Commonwealth itself. W it h your permission, Mr Speaker, I propose to read one or two statements by good authorities regarding the Bank of France. Thati n stitution was established in 1800, on lines somewhat like those of the Commonwealth monopoly by the revolutionary Government then in power, the Bank of France was also made a Savings Bank, paying at first 5 per cent, on the savings deposited with it , and afterwards 4 per cent. In 1805 its notes had depreciated from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent., and, in 1808, it abolished its Savings Bank department, and went straight ahead from that time. To my mind, that fact teaches us the first lesson to be learned in connection with the control of the Commonwealth Bank. Let me now read some excerpts from findings of the National Monetary Commission of the United States of America when dealing with the Bank of France:The Bank of France continued its role as a bank of issue in a prudent enough manner; it fortunately continued to be much more a bankers' bank than a State bank, although it had frequentrelations with the State, and rendered it real service But in this function, which it ought not to fulfil, which it does not fulfil, of entering as a silent partner into industries or of favouring their creation, other institutions are going to take its place. The Commonwealth Bank has entered into business of the kind which the Bank of France set itself sedulously to avoid. In another volume dealing with the Bank of Francei t is statedThus thc banks of deposit have contributed to progress by gathering and giving life to sums until then lying scattered and idle. Tliey are valuable auxiliaries in the distribution of credit. For this reason they deserve help and protection. The bank, thc mission of which is of wider and loftier scope, has shown on many occasions that its helpfulness is not a pretence; daily, in fact, it asserts them by rediscounting their bills. VVe have also seen that the prosperity of the financial institutions has continually increased. It is associated with the confidences and growing security of our times. But should a war or other calamity occur, quiet and security would disappear, and deposits would correspondingly decrease. At such a time tliese banks might give way. Or, again, should a lively competition develop, should the direction of opinion of affairs be changed, that alone might suffice, to cause fear of dejection among the auxiliaries of credit. Such a possibility is enough to impose upon the Bank of France the duty of foreseeing and providing for it. Thc bank must be ready to meet even improbable contingencies, in order to be in a position to recapture the market with a sure hand as soon, as danger threatens it. , v As in 1907, the Bank of France saved the financial situation of Great Britain, it seems evident that we, at a distance Bank. Although given a from the Old Country, with nothing but our own resources and strength to rely on, should follow conservative lines in banking. Probably our most republican and democratic friends opposite do not object to conservatism in banking. A bank is a factory of credit.

The Commonwealth behind the private financial institutions of tlie country, and thus extend credit' throughout the community. Surely this Government has no f a u l t to find with the private banks. When the Commonwealth Bank was started, tlie last Labour Government took a forced loan from the private banks amounting to £6,500,000, by compelling them to accept Commonwealth notes. Tliose who supported what was done then are perhaps unaware that the method was first adopted by CharlesI . , the tyrant of England, and at the present time it is being slightly extended by the Germans in the raising of what is termed their war loan. Furthermore, according to reports, the private banks have lent the Government £10,000,000, for a } >ar, free of interest. It would be well tc know whether this generosity, which is so remarkable in view of the treatment that the banks have received from the Government, was due to their own initiative or the result of some alight pressure. A t any rate, the Labour party has little cause to jeer at the private banks. The only way in which the Commonwealth Bank can be made a real bulwark to the community, a real refuge in time of trouble, is to take from it and the rivalry of the Savings Banks of the States. Bank should be the bankers' bank, and the Government Bank in the true sense of the term, doing the big business of the Commonwealth and of the States. It would then make for a better spirit and influence with the financial institutions, which, after all, are the basis of true credit, and would cease to be a menace to the stability and the solvency of the States; and, with a solid gold reserve for building up the credit of the financial community, it would do much to sustain and invigorate the fabric of our whole commerce. developed on the broad lines which have made the Bank of France such a wonderf u l success, would be of enormous value; but, if it is reduced to small pettifogging business, it will become an absolute menace to the solvency and stability of the States, and a direct danger to the financial integrity of the Commonwealth. pected to see all kinds of alterations made in the Commonwealth Bank Act, such as I think the country has been looking Bank should stand forward to for some time. For instance, I think there should have been an alteration in the management, in consonance with the wishes of the majority of the people, and also, I believe, in consonance with the w ill and wish of the members of the Government, if we could really learn the state of their mind on the subject. The Commonwealth Bank is unique, ' in the fact that, of all the financial institutions in the world, it is the only one of its magnitude controlled and managed by one individual. the Bank not doing very well? would do a great deal better if outside experience were introduced to assist him. A fte r all, a banker is only a banker; he understands the technicalities of banking, but he has not rubbed shoulders outside, and does not understand the roughand-tumble of business l if e ; and the more assistance he can get from the outside the better for the success of the institution. A t all events, the fact remains that this is the only institution of such gigantic proportions that is practically controlled by one person; and I certainly thought we should have some amendment pettifogging business, to remove this anomaly. I have looked rather closely into the question, and I The Commonwealth find that there is a great similarity between the Bank of England at its foundation and the Commonwealth Bank when it was instituted. In the first place, the population of Great Britain, when the Bank of England was inaugurated by the Scotchman, Patterson, was rather more than 5,000,000, or just about the population of Australia when the Commonwealth BankA c t was passed. The Bank of England, for one reason, was established in the year 1694, in order to replenish a depleted war chest. England at that time had the responsibility of This Bank, if it were fighting three or four combined nations, and the Bank was used as a means of finding the necessary funds. It will be observed that both banks were instituted by Scotchmen, the only difference being that Andrew Fisher thinks the whole control should be in the hands of one man, whereas Patterson, who laid down the scheme afterwards adopted by the British Minister, Mr Montague, arranged for the representation of the debentureholders on a directorate.

According to the charter of the Bank, the debenture-holders were permitted to elect their own directors and their general manager; and the result was that they appointed twenty-four directors. My contention is that if the Commonwealtli Bank is to be made a success, it is only right and fair that the holders of the £10,000,000 worth of debentures, together with the depositors and the States, who are also interested, should be represented on a directorate. My suggestion is that the Bank Act should be amended so as to permit of these reforms being carried out, the debenture-holders electing, say, three directors, the deposi£4,600,000; and I contend that it is not tors three directors, and each of the States one, making twelve altogether. Mi-. Denison Miller, the Governor, might make the thirteenth director. As I said before, the general manager of a bank has a mere academic knowledge of business beyond that of banking; and it would be of great advantage if the benefit of outside business experience could be obtained. For instance, there are nine or ten directors to advise Mr French, the general manager of the Bank of New South ""Wales, and those directors are all business men -in New South Wales the limit is ral manager ""runs the show."" of New South Wales is a most successful .institution, due to the fact that the manother serious objection that I have to the agement has the benefit of the matured business experience and advice of outside men. I may mention that some six years ago a public trustee was appointed by the Imperial Government to control and invest moneys of intestate estates. That official broke down with the responsibility that was thus forced upon him; and he, of his own volition, applied for the assistance of five directors. It will be seen at once that the responsibility of such an official is quite small and inconsiderable when compared with that cast on the general manager of the Commonwealth Bank, and it is much more necessary in the case of the Bank that outside assistance and advice should' be made available. The Commonwealth Bank is at present only in its infancy. Ifc controls something like £9,000,000, and. this represents too much responsibility to be placed on one individual. A clause in the Bill authorizes the Governor of theBank and the Treasurer to purchase any other bank when they think fit. I find,, according to the figures given in thefinancial news of the Sydney Morning Herald, that the Bank of Australasia, the Commercial Bank of Sydney, the Bank of New South Wales, the Queensland National Bank, the Union Bank, tlie West Australian Bank, and the Australian! Bank of Commerce represent a total capital of £16,945,000, which, multiplied by 2-J per cent., shows a present value of £36,714,166. This amount, divided amongst the eight banks I have mentioned, gives an average value of wise to permit the expenditure of such an amount to be at the discretion of any one or two men. With all due deference, I say that the Prime Minister's experience in financial matters is very limited; he cannot claim to be a financier in the sense in which we should like him to be one; and yet it is proposed to allow him and the Governor of the Bank to have discretionary power to expend £4,600,000 in the purchase of any bank. Under the recent Public Works Act there can be no expenditure above £25,000 without an inquiry £20,000-and yet it is proposed to permit this discretion to the extent of £4,600,000 on the part of two men. All expenditure of the kind should be sanctioned by this Parliament. There is anBill.

I fScaddan, the Labour Premier of Western AustraUa, voiced the same objection, and I cannot see how members of another place, who are supposed to represent State rights, can support this Bill, instead of protesting in conformity with public opinion in the various States, and insisting that a clause shall be inserted enacting that all Savings Bank business shall be left to the States. At considerable trouble, I have obtained some interesting statistics in regard to what the New South Wales Savings Bank has been doing. I find that that institution has 717,737 depositors, and total deposits amounting to £33,167,523, representing £46 4s. 2d. per depositor, or £17 17s. l d . per head of population. One of the most useful features of the bank's operations in New South Wales is the enormous amount advanced by way of loan to the primary producers. I find that in sums not exceeding £2,000, repayment of which extends over a period of thirty-one years, the bank has advanced to farmers the colossal amount of £3,070,754, and in sums of more than £2,000, £1,766,631. An interesting portion of the bank's work is that which comes under the heading of the Closer Settlement Promotion Act. TJnder the Statute, any two or three or more settlers may approach the owner of a large estate and ask him to put a price on his land. The price having been fixed by the owner, perhaps ten or fifteen would be settlers ask the Government to advance sufficient money to enable them to purchase the estate. Valuations are made, the estate is purchased, and those settlers are allowed to take up the land in areas not exceeding in value £2,000. The bank advances the requisite money to the settlers to the extent of 95 per cent, of the capital value. good business? to the bursting up of big estates. An estate of 100,000 acres, owned by one man, ance may employ perhaps two or three shepherds and a couple of boundary riders, but under this Closer Settlement Promotion Act two or three hundred human beings are settled on the land. the bank has never been "" let in "" ? tmnk been administered that during the five years this Closer Settlement Promotion Act has been in operation, only the small sum of £247 has been lost by the bank. there any more land available on those terms? bered that if a farmer takes up 700 or 800 acres, he puts into the land the whole of his energy, with the result that in two or three years he has probably increased the value of the property hy 25 or 30 per cent. the bank advanced under that Act? den, the Commissioner of the Savings Bank, only last Tuesday, so they are right up to date. Then, in the Irrigation Department the btink has advanced £5,875, and in the Homes Department, for the building of workmen's homes and suburban residences, £44,330. Altogether the New South Wales Savings Bank has advanced on loan, under those various headings, £6,482,048. Of the total advances 20 per cent., or about £6,500,000, has been lent in country districts to encourage the primary producers. No country can prosper unless its primary producers are thriving, and the reason why Melbourne, Sydney, and the other capital cities are stagnant to-day is that the primary producers are stricken with drought. Therefore, I say that any Government which introduces a Banking Act by which the beneficial operations of the State Savings Banks will be destroyed, is not worthy of the name of a Government. Por that reason I protest against the introduction of this Bill, without the inclusion of the amendments I am suggesting.

Transactions between the Motherland and Australia will be accomplished free of exchange. The right honourable gentleman told us that our soldiers who are going to tlie front will be able to pay money into the Commonwealth Bank, and -have it transferred free of exchange from the Mother Country. agree with the Prime Minister that every latitude should be extended by the Commonwealth Bank to those soldiers who are going to the front to battle for us while we remain ab home, but to lead honourable members to believe that this proposal is an innovation especially introduced by the Commonwealth Bank is wrong. The idea has been in existence for many years. If a person pays money into a Post-office Savings Bank in London he can have it transferred to any branch of a State Savings Bank in Australia free of exchange. This reciprocal arrangement has been in existence for years. The Savings Bank Commissioners in New South Wales, referring to this matter in their report, sayThe reciprocity arrangements with the Postrunning a profitable business, and says to Ofiicc Savings 'Bank of the United Kingdom continue to be used by depositors in both institutions for tlic easy and expeditious transthis side of the street that it would be fer of money.

So we see that tlie system has been in vogue for years-lon g before our Treasurer introduced his amendment. I wish to show how economically the affairs of the New South Wales Savings Bank are conducted. The Commissioners' report for 1912 saysTlie Commissioners are pleased to report that the expenses of management of this department were reduced to 8s. 3d. per cent, on the average funds for the year, as compared with 9s. 5.7d. per cent, for 1910. Taking the wholo of the deposits and of the advances, and the cosfc of making the .advances and receiving the deposits, we find that this useful institution is run at a cost of Ss. 3d. per cent, per annum, which all honourable members will agree is a very satisfactory position, though I am informed by the Commissioners that this year they anticipate the expenditure will be something like l is . per cent. .The reason for this, they state, lies in .the fact that the Commonwealth is entering into competition with the States to secure the earnings of the people, and State Savings Banks have been compelled to rent offices in various towns and to maintain an extra staff. The result of this competition between the State and the Commonwealth has put up the cost to something like l is . per cent. When we come to realize the position, we must conclude that the honourable member for I quite Denison is in competition with himself, or that the honourable member for Illawarra is competing against himself. Travelling through the various towns of the Commonwealth I have found a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank on one side of a street, and a branch of the State Savings Bank on the other side, one bank being in competition with the other. fairs does not exist in Tasmania. State are so infinitesimal that they are not worthy of consideration. To bring the facts home to those honourable members who are rather blind in regard to this matter, let me suppose that a business man in the town of Bairnsdale is his partner, "" We are doing so well on a good thing if we opened another storeon the other side of the street and entered into competition with ourselves."" That is exactly the position in regard to the Commonwealth Bank and its competition with the State Savings Banks. The shareholders in each are the same. The Commonwealth should have left the field of Savings Bank business exclusively to the States, especially in view of the veryuseful work that the State institutions have been performing. The New South Wales Savings Bank Commissioners, dealing with the margin of profits, sayThe margin of profit to cover contingencies was (5s. O.od. per cent., as compared with <ls. 2.9d. per cent, in 1910, an increase of 2s. 3.0(1. per cent., the result being arrived at as follows, all percentages being computed on the mean, or average, amount of funds during the year, viz Gross profits, £3 9s. 8.3d. per cent. Interest to depositors, £2 14s. 10.8d.; expenses of management, 8s. 3d., totnl, £3 3s. 1.8d. per cent. Margin, fis. 6.5d. per cent. This, I think, is a very fine profit.

The suggestion was that the -Commonwealth Bank should relinquish the Savings Bank business to the States, and that, in return, the States should give to the Commonwealth Bank their entire banking business. The States agreed to leave on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank the amount then on deposit in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, amounting to about £5,000,000. At any rate, they .agreed to make it up to £5,000,000. The Commonwealth Bank was to have that sum for ten years, or for twenty years if that had been asked for. This would have given the Commonwealth Bank a splendid capital, while the various States -were to carry on their entire banking business with it-fcha t is to say, all the States, municipalities, and the local governing ""bodies of the various States were to throw in their lot with the Commonwealth Bank, and the States were to negotiate -all their loans through it.

I will say this, however, that, as Treasurer of the If the additional capiCommonwealth, I shall be happy indeed, if this scheme is acceptable to you and to us, and is approved by the Parliaments of the States and the Commonwealth, to meet thc Treasurers of thc States to discuss matters of financial importance to both of us, so that we could get a lend as regards any amendment I do not suppose that of the Act from time to time, or receive suggestions for the better management of the Bank in thc interests of thc people generally. in effect, was that he would talk to the State Treasurers once a year or so about things in general; bufc thafc is not offerI am quite prepared ing a share in the control of the Bank. fchat any Commonwealth Treasurer would prove unreasonable, in view of the offer to confer with the State Treasurers.

I have a feeling of disappointment that after the experience the Government must have had during the present crisis, and the representations which have been made to them, they have introduced a B ill which not only continues the present arbitrary power of the Governor, but indicates not the slightest intention of the Government to place the control of the Bank under a board of directors. tlie Governor is doing good work? in which he has not done good work. ber has told us of a case.

Then the honourable member for Oxley told us of a mining show in North Queensland, where the Commonwealth Bank has gone to the assistance of the company, who, in consequence, will be able in f u t u r e to employ 900 men.

In the measure the Government also desire power to take over the State Savings Banks. I cannot understand why the Commonwealth should seek to interfere with the State institutions.

That was in 1913, and, in 1914, they received £181,000, making a total of £296,000 of the people's savings taken by them in Western Australia in a period of eighteen months. Commonwealth Government cannot seek the destruction of an agency which means so much to the people of Western Australia, and which has done so much for the prosperity of that State. Treasurer should only borrow in the London market for the purpose of carrying on ordinary developmental work. Never, in the past, have State Treasurers in Western Australia dreamt of borrowing upon the London market for the purposes of the Agricultura l Bank. The inoney for that bank obtained from the State Savings Bank. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite should have desired to in jure the States as they have done in connection with this institution. They have certainly done a gross, grave, and serious i nj ury to the finances of Western Australia and to tlie f u t u r e prosperity of that State. 1 ask them now to seriously consider whether they ought to continue the wretched, paltry system of interference with the State Savings Bank business. Why not give the States the f u l l strength of their Savings Banks and t r y to induce the various parties in this Parliament to come together with the object of making the Commonwealth Banki n every sense of the term a national institution? I wisli to draw attention now to the wretched little pinpricks to which the States are subjected. The Bank NotesB ill , introduced by the Labour Government, took away from the States a considerable source of revenue in the shape of their bank notes taxation. A little while ago I received from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank a circular advising that [47] its customers need no longer use cheques bearing stamp duty. the late Attorney-General. the issue of such a circular was quite* unnecessary. In my opinion, it was merely an advertisement-a n attempt to attract the customers of other banks. There are certain mean-spirited people who would From regard as a consideration the use of cheques bearing no stamp duty. The Commonwealth with the Constitution. point that I wish to impress upon honourable members is that the stamp duty is collected,not by the banking corporations, but by the States concerned. If we do not think that such a duty is a I am sure that the fair one, let us say so. A stamp duty on cheques is regarded by the States as a"" fair means of revenue, and if we favour such a duty why should we not subject the Commonwealth Bank to the same disA State ability as that suffered in this respect by private banking corporations? I hope that honourable members opposite w ill t r y to treat the States fairly in connection with Savings Bank business. The arguments that I have brought forward with regard to the Agricultural Bank and the was always State Savings Bank of Western Australia may not apply with the same force to other States more closely populated. In Victoria, for instance, where we have a closely concentrated population, it is easier for the State Savings Bank to compete with the Commonwealth Bank than it is in Western Australia, where we have a scattered population. I hope that honourable members will take into consideration the position of the States, and more particularly that of Western Australia, as well as the difficulties in which they are placing the Treasurer of that State. If they do, I am convinced that they will come to the conclusion that it is wise to give the Statesf u l l control of all Savings Bank business and to confine our attention to an effort to make the Commonwealth Bank a truly national institution. When the Prime Minister was introducing this B ill to the House, Mr Speaker, he was subjected to many interjections, and you felt it necessary to ask him to confine his attention solely to the question before the Chair.

Unlike some houorable members who have spoken, I shall not cast any reflection upon the private banking institutions of Australia. To my mind, they have been carried on in a very creditable manner, and they owe very much of their success to the men who have managed them. I am not satisfied with the position that the Commonwealth Bank has so far achieved. It is not yet a national Bank in the sense that I understand the term, but I look forward to the time when, having the credit and resources of Australia behind it , it will transact the whole buildings. I have, in my mind's eye, a of the business of the Commonwealth and the States, and be undoubtedly a national institution. Honourable members opposite have complained of a lack of information regarding the Bank. To some extent I am in accord with them. No one is more anxious than I am that the fullest publicity should be given to the transactions of the Government; but we must not forget that much of the business of a bank must be carried on by one or two men, and, for a time, be known only to them. Thc honourable member for Balaclava, who, no doubt, is the director of an in surance company, knows that. his being a director. years a member of the Victorian Parliament, and we know that there are in the State Parliaments many men of the "" guinea-pig "" variety-me n who consent to be appointed to the directorates of public companies and draw two guineas a sitting. I dare say that the honourable member for Balaclava has had his share of these little emoluments which attach to membership of the State Parliaments. I look forward to the day when we shall have fewer private banks than we have at present. During the discussion of the original Commonwealth BankB ill it was admitted in this House, by those familiar with banking business, that there was at present a good deal of overlapping, and that the numerous banks that we had in Australia were not necessary to the transaction of our commercial business. have travelled largely in Australia. I make it my business to visit other States than that of which I am a representative, and if other honourable members would do the same they would have a better knowledge of Australia than they sometimes display. They would certainly discuss matters appertaining to the welfare of the Commonwealth in a broader spirit than was displayed this evening by the honourable member for Dampier. One of the clauses of this B ill provides for the Commonwealth Bank taking over some banking institutions; that, at all events, is my reading of it , and I am pleased that such a provision is to be made. It would be well if the Associated Banks, following the action proposed by the Government in this respect, reduced their number. In some of our provincial towns I have seen three or four palatial bank district of not more than 12,000 inhabitants where three very fine banking premises are to be seen within a radius of 100 yards. They are of such dimensions that they would adorn Lombard-street, Cornhill, Cheapside, or any of the other great streets of the world's capital, London. Such buildings are absolutely unnecessary, and the people who borrow from the banks have to pay for their upkeep. That clause in this B ill which will reduce by one, at all events, the number of these institutions is a step in the right direction. Honourable members of the Opposition, if they are really in earnest in their professed desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall become a national institution, giving assistance to the primary producers and others, should be prepared to support the Government in passing this B ill . I hope, before very long, to see the Commonwealth Bank a truly national institution. A good deal has been said during this debate regarding the Bank of England; I shall not make more than a passing reference to that in stitution. The Governor of the Bank has been said to be possessed of autocratic powers. I regret some of the criticism to which he has been subjected. I have every respect for Mr Miller. He has no opportunity to reply to criticisms levelled at him in this House, and I think that the lionorable member for Balaclava, in particular, went rather further than he should have gone in his references to him. The only person to conduct the negotiations* between Lloyd George and I the Bank of Englandi n connection with the recent war loan of £250,000,000 would be the Governor of that institution.

313,Mr West,"He has been for manyand the Governor of the Bank of England are the only two persons who can conduct Buch transactions. A t the Conference of State Premiers, held while the original B ill was under consideration, the Prime Minister submitted a certain proposal. ' It was proposed that 75 per cent, of the existing deposits in the State Savings Banks should remain at the service of the State, leaving 25 per cent, for the services of the Commonwealth. That 25 per cent, would not necessarily be taken out of the particular State in whose bank it had been deposited. when the Conference took place. condition proposed hy the PrimeM in ister. behind the Commonwealth Savings Bank Audit Act-Transfers of Amounts approved by are the whole of the resources of Australia, whereas behind a State Savings Bank Lands Acquisition Actthere are only the resources of its State. Members should deal -with questions like this, not in the light of to-day only, but also witli regard to the interests of the future. They should remember the climatic, conditions of Australia, where one portion of the country may be suffering severely from drought, while other portions are enjoying prosperity. It is in Military Forces-Physioa l Training-Report by tended that the Commonwealth Bank, being a national institution, shall give assistance in the hour of need to any part of Australia that may need help; but honourable gentlemen opposite, with their Rifle Clubs-Beport on State Rifle Associapetty, parochial ideas, f a i l to rise to such sonceptions. They know only the little place in which they live, and have no knowledge of the country at large. The Commonwealth Bank w ill know no State division, but will give aid wherever aid is needed, and the peoplo who entrust their savings to it w ill know that the credit of the whole Commonwealth is behind the Bank. Lloyd George, speaking not long since on the present situation, said of the English bank note that the whole resources of the Empire were behind it . Por Savings Bank business, the Commonwealth has command of all the post offices in Australia. Wherever there are ten men and a dog, a post-office is applied for, and wherever there is a post-office there is a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. One other point that I wish to make before asking leave to continue my remarks on another occasion is this: TheB ill empowers trustees to put [ 4 7 ] -, money into the Commonwealth Bank. If it did nothing else, that would be a great thing in its favour. Such a provision goes a long way towards making the Bank a national institution, and to carry out the intention that was in the mind of Parliament when the principal Act was in troduced. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
