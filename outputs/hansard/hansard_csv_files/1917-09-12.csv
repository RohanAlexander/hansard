But for those previous appropriations remaining unexpended we should have asked for an appropriation of£2,849,919, whereas we are asking for the appropriation of only £1,862,000. It has been stated by some critics of the financial proposals of the Government that loan works provided for under this B ill should not have been proceeded with at the present time, seeing that the Government propose to spend, in addition, £1,257,617 out of revenue on ordinary public works. As seated in the Budget speech, however, the Government was of opinion that to stop these works would mean a large withdrawal of employment, which in this time of war would accentuate our difficulties. The view of the Government was 'that to continue these works at a moderate rate of progress, and so provide employment, while at the same time avoiding this year as much additional taxation as possible, would be in fche public interest. These are fche reasons which have influenced the Government in its financial policy. I do not propose to enter into details of the various items. ' Sir item in regard to plant and stores suspense account? plained by the Minister for Works and Railways. I may say, however, that in connection with public works the Commonwealth, like every State, requires a large quantity of valuable machinery and other assets. On fche completion of the works for which they were originally obtained, they are no longer required for them, and it would be unfair to make them a permanent charge against such works. It would be unfair to make the cosfc of plant a permanent charge against the first work on which it waa used. We, therefore, are making provision to allow machinery and other plant used in connection with public works to be valued when ifc has ceased to be employed on a particular work. This valuation is placed to an account, and the work itself credited accordingly. The system obtains in Victoria and in other places, and it would % be impossible to carry out a large public works business properly without it . Sometimes very expensive machinery is saddle such, a work w i l h the whole cost of that machinery, which, when the work was finished, would be used for other public works. be debited against other works when used oh them. works are started, fche cosfc of fche plant is charged against them. why we should borrow money for whafc is apparently a mere matter of bookkeeping? be an appropriation The valuations might lie in the account for a good time, and an appropriation and a f u n d are needed. However, my honourable colleague, the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr. W a t t ) , who has had a long experience of this system, will be able to explain it to fche Committee in greater detail. As I do not propose t'o discuss items which w ill be dealt with by the Ministers under whose control the expenditure will be carried out, I shall content myself with having placed the plain facts of fche case before the Committee. weeks ago, when we were discussing the other members took exception to the as"" terisks, daggers, double daggers, and other signs scattered through them, drawing attention to various explanatory notes. We said that it was not clear whether we were, or were not, voting for the construction oufc of loan money of works which have hitherto, in the great majority of cases, been paid for out of revenue. I pointed out fchat, whereas the works appropriation from revenue last year was £5,519,717, and the expenditure £4,301,530, the proposed expenditure out of revenue this year was only £1,257,617. It wa« objected to our criticism thafc it was holding up public works, and. of course, we had no intention of bringing fchat about). My desire then was to point out whafc I now draw attention to again, that instead of the Government reducing expenditure-personall y I believe that certain public works expenditure must continue-ther e was really no reduction, and that presently additional or supplementary estimates would be introduced to make further provision for their works policy.",25,Loanbill 1917

Ministers have Supply for this month, but they must get Supply for October. soon to have the Estimates dealt with, we might as well be in Russia. members to scrutinize carefully the proposals now before them. However, perhaps it would meet the wish of the Committee if I were to postpone my remarks until we get to the schedule. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE (Flinders) [4.5] I recognise quite as fully as does the Leader of the Opposition the imperative necessity there is, before a long period has elapsed, for dealing with the whole financial position and proposals of the Government. There never was a time when it was more essential that this Parliament should exercise its undoubted privilege and duty in this respect than it is at present. The Leader of the Opposition will recollect that, when we were debating the Estimates of expenditure on public works out of revenue, representations were made to the Government by himself, myself, and others that we should have an opportunity to deal with the whole of the financial proposals at an early date. The Minister for the Navy then intimated to the House that, if we would allow the Estimates to go through an opportunity would arise in connection with the Bill that we are now* debating. I should say that the Leader of the Opposition, like every other honourable member, if he chooses to exercise it, has the Tight, on this Bill, to discuss the whole financial position of the Government, and all the ' financial proposals of the Government, of which this Bill is one.^ However, I think such a course would, on this occasion, be highly inconvenient. In ordinary practice, the general debate on financial proposals is a matter of arrangement between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition; and the usual' arrangement is that, on the first item of the Estimates, the whole of the nnancial proposals will be considered. Under ordinary circumstances, I should join with the Leader of the Opposition in pressing for as early an opportunity as possible to debate these proposals, but the circumstances at present are not ordinary. The Government have recently come into power, and Parliament and the Government are faced with some of the most serious financial problems that ever came before the people of Australia. have been in power for six months. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It would have been quite unreasonable to expect the Treasurer, at the time he made his Budget speech, to come before us with a cut-and-dried scheme for the solution of the very difficult problems in regard to borrowing, and, generally, in regard to public economy. The Treasurer was, I think, very properly anxious to make an early financial statement, so that he might place the House in possession of the actual facts relating to the financial position; but it could not have been expected that he would then come down with a fully-matured system of public economy. heard nothing yet of economy will recognise sooner than the Treasurer that though he has not yet had time to deal with the whole financial position of Australia, we may reasonably expect him, ! at a later stage, before the House adjourns for a lengthy term, to deal explicitly with the future financial position. What the Government desire now is to be clothed with the necessary authority to go on with immediate public works out of revenue, and to pass their taxation proposals. Then we shall have what, after all, is the only opportunity the House has, not to prevent the carrying out of the Government's proposals-becaus e the Estimates are always discussed after the proposals are sanctioned will recollect that the Estimates for the last financial year were discussed as an afterthought one evening. of the unfortunate things that occasionally happen in the practical working of Parliament. , ing over a new leaf! always be turning over new leaves, and, in spite of efforts to the contrary, we always, meet with the same result-the Estimates are always before us towards the end of the session.

93,Sir William Irvine,"We cannotof the Opposition not to press for what would inevitably be a premature discussion, but to wait until the Treasurer has had time to bring more matured financial proposals before the House. I was not present when the Prime Minister answered the Leader of the Opposition to-day, but I understand that the Government propose to go. on with these immediate authorizations for the expenditure of public moneys on public works, and in other necessary directions, and that then there shall be a short adjournment, the House to meet again some time in the beginning of November. mation in the House. A paragraph appeared, I think, in the Argus, and I assumed the information there given to be what the Government intended. I can assure the honourable member that we always get our information first in the newspapers. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE take it. that the Prime Minister conveyed the idea that Parliament was going to adjourn indefinitely. not say anything definite. Minister always does. long time before we can discuss the Estimates. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE the Leader of the Opposition that, whatever his rights and the rights of others may be in this regard, it would be inconvenient, without some arrangement between parties, to have a general Budget discussion at this time. For this and the otlier reason I have stated, that further time ought to be allowed for the Government to bring down a matured general financial policy, it would be well to allow the debate to stand over. Otherwise, I feel as strongly as does the Leader of the Opposition, that, as soon as practicable, the House ought to have an opportunity to fully discuss the financial proposals of Ministers. -We all remember the protests made on this point by the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) when we were dealing with works to be constructed out of revenue to the amount of £1,251,000. I certainly understood then that we should soon be able to discuss the financial position. We are now engaged on a Bill involving the expenditure of about £1,800,000, or a total, under the two proposals, of £3,000,000 odd. assumed on that occasion by the House that this Bill would afford an opportunity to discuss the general nnancial position; still, there may be reasons for our not availing ourselves of the opportunity. with the Estimates we shall be told, if we seek to have a general financial review, that we have already practically assented to the expenditure for the current financial year. ought to be a matter of arrangement between the two sides of the House. sorry that the honourable member did not hear the reply of the Prime Minister toI do not day. I certainly understood that we were not to be allowed to discuss the Estimates, for some time, and that Parliament was to adjourn, not to meet again until some time in 1918, told us that the .consideration of the Estimates was to be indefinitely postponedthat they would not be considered in the immediate future. Chanter) I regret to have to intervene, but if ' I permit this discussion , to continue we shall have a repetition of what happened a few days ago. The matters now being discussed are not matters for the Committee, but for the House; the Committee can consider only what it is instructed by the House to consider. The House has instructed the Committee to consider the passage of this Loan Bill for certain purposes, which are indicated in the Bill itself. I have asked other honourable members to confine themselves to the Bill, because, whether the Government propose to do this, that, or the other, is for the House, and not for the Committee, to consider.

Honourable members should have the fullest opportunity of discussing expenditure. We in this Parliament are supposed to be statesmen, but no one can be ahead, and it is our duty to look ahead at this critical time in the history of the Commonwealth.

We can gain some particulars as to this expenditure from the Loan Estimates.

Therefore, in his reply I presume the M in ister will tell us whether it is his intention to refer these works to the new Public Works Committee.

No doubt when the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) speaks on this schedule, he will inform the Committeeof some of the things that were being done at tlie Flinders Naval Base when the Public Works Committee arrived there, and the honourable member will agree with me that naval and military works, instead of being excluded by Orderi n Council from investigation by the Public Works Commiuee, are the very proposals that ought to be investigated by such a body. If 'that policy had been pursued in the past, hundreds of thousands of pounds would have been saved to the Commonwealth. A good deal of the money spent at Flinders might as well have been thrown into Westernport Bay. The Minister for Works and Railways is asking for £300,000 for naval works and establishments, and I hope he will inform the Committee fully how he proposes to expend the money. .He will have a difficulty in justifying some of the expenditure authorized by his predecessors. to justify it . will again be obliged to tell the Committee t'hat the construction of these works has proceeded so far tliat discontinuance of operations would involve tlie Commonwealth in a ""huge loss. In connection with the Naval Base there has been an expenditure of public money that can serve no good purpose. [4.45] I desire, to take this opportunity of seeking information from the Minister for Works and Railways, or 'the Minister for the Navy, in regard to the proposed expenditure of the item of £400,000setdown in the schedule for fleet construction. In connection wit!h past expenditure of the kind, no accurate detailed in formation has been procurable. Hitherto a certain sum of the money voted for fleet construction was placed to the credit of the High Commissioner in Londonf or the purchase of materials. If the manager of Cockatoo Island dockyard required a certain quantity of material, he sent a requisition to the Naval Board, and I am anxious that all if approved by that Board, the requisition was forwarded to the H i gh Commissioner. The High Commissioner placed the order with the British Admiralty, and if the Admiralty were able to supply ib from their contracts, we received the material from them at contract rates. TheA d miralty then lodged a demand note with the H i g h Commissioner, by whom the account! was paid, and a voucher was forwarded to the Treasury through the M i nister for External Affairsi n order to allow of the adjustment of the amount placed at the disposal of the High Commissioner. There the matter ended. Evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee showed that there are at Cockatoo Island no documents by which it is possible to ascertain the cost of the imported material or the quantity used in connection with any particular work. It is, therefore, impossible for tihe Naval Department or the Treasury, or the Auditor-General, to say what any particular work has cost. Suppose the manager of Cockatoo Island dockyard ordered 10® tons of steel plates. There would be nothing in the order to show whether the whole, or what, portion of that material was intended for, or had been put inte the Brisbane or the Torrens. The manager never sees any invoices of material T am not going to attempt) purchased abroad, and neither he nor anybody else in the dockyard is able to say what was the cost of the material put into any particular vessel. The Public Accounts Committee inquired in vain of the Auditor-General, the Treasury, the Department for External Affairs, and the Naval Department, for information as to how much material was put into the Brisbane, 'and the cost of it. The only particulars we could get of the cost of the (Cowper) vessel were based on an estimate made by the British Admiralty on the prices ob.taining at the time of furnishing plans. Therefore, any subsequent estimate of the cost of the Brisbane is misleading, because it is not based on accurate detailed information. The Manager of the Dockyard never sees the invoices for materials purchased abroad, but he does know the cost of everv article bought by him locally. Honourable members will realize that the sys'tem I have described is most unbusinesslike. We should know what every work has actually cost, and whether the material used has been purchased to the beet advantage. I believe that it has been so purchased, and",32,Chapman Th E Honor Tion Works But We Did Not Propose To

We wish to know the cost of every vessel, but that is impossible unless we know the cost of the material. tihe dockyard estimate the cost of a vessel according to her tonnage? form an estimate, but he could not give the actual cost. ing regard to the varying rates, no one could estimate the cost on the tonnage basis. But the manager of the Dockyard should at least have invoices showing the cost of material. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that when invoices for material were supplied to the H i g h Commissioner by the Admiralty or their .contractors they should be sent out in triplicate, just as is done in connection with many private businesses. One copy should go to the Manager of the Dockyard, one to the Navy Office, and tlie third to the Treasury. Each office could then check the other, and it would also be possible to check the amounts placed on the Estimates and passed by Parliament. sheets at the dockyard? then. fied that Ministers w ill recognise the necessity for, and the fairness of, our proposal. If we go on building vessels, as we hope to do, we ought to be in a position to show the actual cost in each case. I am not raising the question of whether ships built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard cost more than they should do. The whole point is that when we enter upon these commercial undertakings we should conduct them with something like commercial accuracy, and ability. A t the present time that is not being done. I again direct the attention of the Government to this matter, and ask them to remedy the evils as they existed when our Committee inquired into the management of the dockyard. I urge them to make such provision as w ill enable Parliament and the country to know the cost of material used, not only in the dockyard, but in other Departments. We should know whether the estimates made as to prices and quantities have been exceeded or otherwise, and how the final cost compares with the original estimate. If the Government take steps to enable this in formation to be supplied we shall be able to carry on these commercial enterprises in a business-like way, and the country, knowing that it is getting something for its money, w ill be better satisfied. I hope that when next we are asked to make appropriations of this kind tbe Government w ill be able to show that the sins of the past A t the present time, havhave been corrected, and that we are on the way to carrying out our ship-building and other business in a more satisfactory manner. honourable member for Cowper( Mr John Thomson) has referred to a very important phase of the operations at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I desire to discuss the position there generally since it appears to me that the present is a very opportune juncture at which to call the attention of responsible Ministers to the necessity and advantage of certain improvements. We are asked, under this B ill , to agree to an appropriation of £180,000 in respect of Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Of that amount £100,000 is under the control of the Minister for the Navy, and D o they not keep stock£80,000 relates to operations under the control of the Ministerf o r Works and Railways. A few days ago I asked in We need some inquiry, fchis House a question regarding the position at Cockatoo Dockyard, bub received I feel satisa rather indefinite answer. I would urge upon Ministers administering that great enterprise thafc its position at present is perhaps more unsatisfactory, from the stand-point of value for money expended than is that of any other Department of Commonwealth activities. That is a very strong statement to makej but I would remind the Ministerf o r the Navy that two years ago the Committee of Public Accounts made an exhaustive inquiry into fche affairs of the dockyard, and that the evidence then given, although somewhat emphatic in certain respects, really set out the position in a much milder light than actually existed at the time..' The Committee made a unanimous report, and if fche f u l l facts in regard to much of the evidence had been put forward, the public, I believe, would have been even more astounded than they were by the disclosures we made. I have no reason to believe that since that report was made,",33,Chapman Th E Honor Tion Works But We Did Not Propose To

171,Mr Fowler (Perth) [4.53],"Th etwo years ago. the position has improved. On the contrary, it seems to have gone from bad to worse Let me read from the report two scraps of information which we supplied as to the cost of work carried on at the dockyard when we made our investigation. IJhe manager, in the course of his evidence, gave some illustrations of the difference in the cost of certain work at Cockatoo Island under day labour as compared with the Admiralty piece-work system. He saidThe coat of riveting steam drums and water pockets of a boiler is 40s. per 100 at Home, on piece-work, as against 70s. per 100 on day work here. The cost of flanging boiler ends, on piece-work, at Home, is Is. per foot. Here, on day labour, the cost is 6s. per footand so on. In all probability in the greater number of departments ofwork at Cockatoo Dockyard we are receiving only 10s. worth of work for' every £ 1 we pay in wages. MrJ . H . CATTS -Does the honourable member make allowance for the difference in wages here and at Home? Let me tell the honourable member that the wages earned in Government dockyards in the Mother Country compare very favourably with those made' here. they are higher. event the comparison is not to the disadvantage of the employees in the GovernCommittee, as just read by me, is followed ment dockyards at Home. MrJ . H .

I am honest men who are prepared to give a prepared to admit that the bulk of the f a i r day's work for a f a i r day's wage. employees at Cockatoo Dockyard, if they were entirely free agents, would, in all employees at Cockatoo Island Dockyard probability, give a fair day's work for a are on strike.

If Ministers are wise in their day Railways will consider the suggestion I and generation, they w ill accept this ophave to make. We have now a fitting opportunity, which the men themselves have portunity to bring about a different condition of affairs at the dockyards. A section of the Committee of Public Accounts made the following recommendation:The undersigned 'members of the Committee are of opinion that the adoption of the Admiralty systems of piece and premium' work, on a scale in accordance with recognised rates of pay in Australia, would produce the best results in connection with the industrial output at Cockatoo Dockyard, and give increased remuneration to energetic and capable workmen. That recommendation was signed by four of the nine members of the Committee. It is,in short,a recommendation in favour of piece-work,and if the work at the dockyard is to be carried out with anything like economy and efficiency, such a system is absolutely inevitable. Nothing else will do. that. evidence taken by the Committee pointed emphatically in that direction, and I believe that a great many of the men-per haps the majority of them-woul d welcome the change. approximating to the piece-work system. there? mended in the minorit y report of the in the Imperial Dockyards.

When the Estimates for additions, new works, and buildings were under consideration, I drew attention to the item "" General Arsenal, machinery and plant,"" which, it was indicated, was to be provided for out of loan. We have in the schedule to this Bill provision for works and buildings for a general arsenal, including the erection of residential quarters, in Tespect of which there is a proposed vote of £100,000 "" towards cost."" There is nothing to show, however, whether the total estimated cost is £1,000,000 or £500,000'.

It is the feeling that something is being hidden that provokes criticism. As a Minister, I was always ready to supply information. I should like to know why there are two votes for the Acetate of Lime Factory-£34,000 , to be spent on the factory under the administration of the Minister for Works and, Railways, and £20,000, towards cost of' machinery and plant, to be spent under the administration of the Defence Minister. There may be a good reason why one Department should purchase the machinery, and another install it, but we are entitled to an explanation.

Last year the expenditure on this work was £176,000. work. of it is carried on in the big cities. In the long run it will probably mean a saving of money.

I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee which investi' gated matters on. the island, and I am sure that these honourable members have not put the case at all too strongly; and I urge the Ministeri n charge to carefully consider what these gentlemen have said. I notice that in the schedule a number of the works are to be charged to loan account-work s which in the past have been paid for out of revenue-and to the change I have no objection at all, because, in my opinion, many liabilities have been, in the past, met out of revenue that might Ministers will find that more appropriately have been met out of loan account, with proper sinking fund arrangements. However that may be, 1 have just a little doubt whether this is the time for expenditure of the kind proposed. Many of the items are practically new works, and if they were not undertaken we could not have any serious trouble in regard to unemployment. Apart from that, there are certain works in the list ""which, if started to-morrow, could, I very much doubt, be finished off as quickly as if they were postponed for a little time.

Of course, this is a work regarding which the Government may not be able to afford us much information, for military or other reasons; but, in any case, I do not know whether the best site has been selected. In matters of such serious national importance, and involving such large amounts, every care should be taken to find out the best places in Australia for their accomplishment. I know that amongst honourable members there is an idea that, as far as possible, all Pederal works should be within the Federal Territory. While I agree with that as a general principle, there may be special exceptions; and, if there are special exceptions, sister ship, with not the slightest difthey cannot anywhere be found more than in the region of defence. I should like to say a word or two about fleet construction; and in this regard I think the Minister ought to tell us if any of the £400,00.0 has really been spent; and, if so, what we have got for the money. Fleet construction may mean the building of some small craft, or, it may be, a cruiser like the Brisbane; and we certainly should have more information in this connection. We ought to be shown that the proposed expenditure is absolutely necessary, especially in the case of new works. The Commonwealth is getting into a very serious financial position ; and we ought not to go on spending millions without strong reasons. The time is coming when it will not be a matter of deciding on what works we shall spend money, but on what works we can do with.out expenditure, if we aTe to treat the taxpayer fairly and equitably. For all these reasons I submit that we have a right to know, as far as circumstances will permit, tlie reasons for the proposed works. We ought to have some information as to carried on as it should have been at the cost of the Brisbane. ought to know the cost, as a guide to Cockatoo Island as it should be. As a Protectionist I should like to see all this kind of work done in Australia, but there is an obligation on the part of those employed at Cockatoo Island and elsewhere to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. The Sydney cost £385,000, and the Melbourne cost £405,000; but in the case of the Brisbane the estimated cost was £610,000, while, so far as we can gather, the actual cost has been more like £1,000,000. A t any rate, the cost of the Brisbane must be over £800,000, though no one can give the exact figure. From the report of the Public Accounts Committee we learn that two launches were required, that tenders were called for the construction of one, and a contract was made for £5,000 with Robinson Brothers, of Melbourne; and we have the curious fact that the Naval Dockyard at Cockatoo Island could not, and did not, supply a ference in construction, for less than £12,800. That amount did not include proportionate charges for interest, depreciation, or supervision; it is further stated in the report of the Public Works Committee that Messrs. Robinson Brothers lost £1,000 over their, contract. If that be so, it means that the first vessel cost to construct, with all charges included, £6,000, as compared with £12,800. When we see such statements in the report of the Public Accounts Committee, it makes one very dubious as to the total cost of the Brisbane. I sincerely hope that in the case of the Brisbane there is not a repetition of the facts in connection with the launch Gresswell and other vessels, because, if so, there is no encouragement to carry on such works in Australia, by the Government. We are told that in the case of the Brisbane some of the plant had to be imported, probably after the war had started; but the report of the Public Accounts Committee tells us that the work of preparation on the vessel was commenced in 1912, and that she was to be completed in December, 1914. The war broke out only at the"" latter end of 1914; and if the vessel had been laid .down and the work Cockatoo Island, all the material ordered must have been on the way before the outbreak of hostilities.

215,Whether The Work Is Now Carried On At ' Mr Riley,"should have been afloat, and there could be no possible excuse for pleading the higher cost of material in the case of the Brisbane. Then, again, I refer honourable members to a recommendation made by the manager of the dockyard, and practically adopted by four members of the Public Accounts Committee. The report states that when it came to a comparison between the relative merits of the day labour system and piece-work, or the bonus method, of the British dockyards, the Cockatoo Island output by day labour showed to very great disadvantage. !Nb one desires to reduce wages in Australia lower than a good living figure; and I notice that no fewer than four members of the Public Accounts Committee recommended that there should be piece work on a scale in accordance with the recognised scale of wages in Australia. This, of course, safeguards the wage-earner; and no one would begrudge the additional cost if a fair return be given for the money. There are other matters in the report approved of all the proposals contained of the Public Accounts Committee that I in the schedule, and that the works set do not wish to dwell on unduly. It i i out in it should be proceeded with at stated, for instance, that in these dockonce.

The worse feature of the whole matter is the basis of the Government's claim that Parliament was committed to the expenditure. ister for Defence on the 14th March, 1917, relative to the proposed Federal arsenal, these words occurParliament, by its vote on the Estimates 1915-16, endorsed the establishment of an arsenal, and the choice of a site in the Federal Territory. have a say in regard to the matter. passed all right. that Parliament did not stand committed to the site at Canberra. were given that f u l l opportunity for discussing the question would be pi ovide4, but the expenditure was incurred without that opportunity being given. suitable opportunity, although the -matter has been before Parliament on several occasions whether the arsenal ghould be commenced at Canberra was the subject of a special motion in this Chamber, aud there was considerable objection taken to the proposal. nomical stand-point, it is right that this House should have the opportunity of deciding such an issue. sider that the Ministerf o r Defence was right in saying that Parliament was committed to the Canberra site. a determination should be come to at once i i the Government intend to go on with the work, but I hope that they will not do so. There is no reason for haste in regard to the matter. Neither is there any reason for Ministers to give evasive answers in order that the information may not reach the enemy. The report of the Committee appointed to inquire into the establishment of an arsenal had f u l l publication, and I cannot see why honourable members should not be allowed to know at least as much as was published in the report of that Committee. Parliamentary knows more about the matter than this Parliament does. very difficult, seeing that this Parliament knows very little about the matter. Honourable members are kept in the dark as much as possible. A t any rate, we should know something more from the GoI n a statement issued by the M in vernment before we consent to this expenditure. There has been a great deal too much "" dilly-dallying "" in regard to tire establishment of an arsenal. Parliament should come to a determination upon the point as soon as possible, and in order that a decision may be arrived at, it is my intention to move to reduce the item in the schedule. I propose to not go into details when dealing with the items. I have had special opThose Estimates were portunities for gaining information upon the point. Let me deal with the estii mate of cost. Mr Murdoch, the Government Architect, was a witness examined Distinct pledges by the Public Works Committee in regard to the question of the erection of the arsenal at Canberra, and in response to questions put by me, he told the Committee that about 5,000 men would be employed at the establishment. I put There has not been a the question, to him, ""Assuming that there are 2,500 married men, 1,5.00 single men, and 1,000 boys employed, what will it cost to house t h e m ? "" Mr Murdoch went away, and came back with a' rough estimate that tlie cost of providing houses, water supply, sewerage, schools, hospitals, libraries, and all the conveniences of a* township of from 15,000 to 20,000 Apart altogether from the ecopeople, would be £1,750,000. I mention this in order to let honourable members know that they will be dealing with an I do not conexpenditure of over £2,000,000 in connection with the arsenal at Canberra. Certainly raise £1,000,000 with which to build houses that will let at a fair rental. go into f u l l details.

It was argued that this was the most suitable time for the settlement of the question, inasmuch as the removal would be effected before any further expenditure was effected at Lithgow. This report shows that tlie Government. of the day were desirous of removing the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra, vvhich would mean .that the £300,000 capital spent at Lithgow would be lost. I suppose that a similar amount would need to be expended ,afc Canberra in order fco house the machinery. I am nofc satisfied with the work done at L it h gow.

"" They would not fit the cartridges, the rifling was broken at the centre, the rifling was broken at the end."" Those were the comments. I do not suppose that all the bad rifles went to Western Australia. improved since that report was made? has been a great change for the better there for: ten minutes if he had had M i nisterial interference in regard to the employment of his men. Tliat has been the curse of our public enterprises in the ^ [72]2 past. The managers we have had at the factory would have done good work if they had not been interfered with, and had been given control of the establishment. But as soon as a manager dismisses men whom he finds obnoxious an appeal is made to a member of Parliament, who carries the complaint to the Minister, and ultimately the manager is told to reinstate the men. The result of thafc policy is that the manager begins to allow things to drift. A t Flinders Naval Base, I saw a huge excavation for which there was no justification. Piles were being driven, and when I asked the reason for the excavation, I was told that the piles could not be driven through the sand. I made such a noise aboutfchafcexcavation, and the members of fche Public Works Committee can bear me out, that every remaining pile was driven without shifting a yard of sand. The cosfc offchafcexcavation was 9s. 4^d. per yard, and I guarantee that any contractor would have done it for 2s. per yard. That was one my notice. The engineer in charge now is a man in whom I have every confidence) but he will not be able to give good results unless he is given f u l l liberty to choose his own foremen and sub-foremen. If he has to submit to the interference which has been the lot of most engineers and managers in the past, he is bound to be just as big a failure as they have been. Ati a later stage, I shall move to reduce fche vote for the Flinders Naval Base by £1,000 in order to afford the Committee an opportunity of expressing its opinion of the need for economy in public expenditure. I may seem inconsistent in urigng increase in expenditure in one Department, and a decrease in all other Departments, b u t the policy of the Postmaster-General compels me' to do so.

If a telephone service is asked for in the Never Never country, even though the people undertake to pay interest and loss ou working expenses, and to assist the Department by carrying the poles, and doing other work, the Department says, '' We have no money, and cannot do the' work,"" but the Minister can find £27L000 for conduits about the cities. for the Perth Post Office. started long before the war, and I suppose the Government find it necessary to proceed with its construction. The telephone services iu Sydney, Melbourne> and Perth have involved the Department in large losses. In New South Wales the loss for the year before last was £146,000. The knowledge that is heing gained in for the year before last. last year was not a very great improvement. I do urge upon the Government the necessity for an alteration in the policy of the Department in regard to town and country. In the Estimates generally, we require economy, and any work carried out at the present time ought to be of a reproductive character. I should have gloried in seeing in this schedule an item of £500,000 for the purpose of locking the Murray River. I do not know much about that work, but I should have liked to see the Government energetic in regard to it, because, if the claims made in regard to the locking of this river are correct, we ought to be able to settle 30,000 returned soldiers along its banks. will investigate this matter, he will find 1 that £500,000 could not be spent within six years on the Murray River works. ment could push on with the works.

MT. WATT -That expenditure was in connection with the purchase of machinery for the manufacture of shells. The machinery will be an asset. penditure on machinery was wise, more especially as the Government were, to some extent, responsible for the previous expenditure by various companies and individuals. Except in regard to works of a reproductive character, the Governanent ought to go penditure. There have, been marvellous developments during the war in the manufacture of munitions, explosives, and submarines. When our Naval Bases were started, they were designed on the supposition that submarines would be of from 200 to 500 tons burthen. Now submarines of 5,000 tons are being launched. regard to these matters may prove that the expenditure now being incurred on our Naval Bases is wasteful. We must make haste slowly in connection with the construction of our Naval Bases. I know that, the departmental officials are always urging upon the Government that these works are necessary, and should be proceeded with; hut I do not believe that they are necessary at this time. If , as I hope, the Allies have a complete victory, and peace is assured thereafter for many years, we shall be able to proceed slowly with our defence works, and to have the advantage of the most expert advice in the world.

For many years the Jesuits obtained from that factory were very disappointing. position to-day is satisfactory, since we do not know what has happened during the last eighteen months or more; but I do know that two things contributed to the high cost of the rifles at first produced there.

The Public Accounts Committee made certain recommendations in regard to the Factory, and certain changes were made'. We found that there was a want of co-ordination between the different departments in the Factory; and while I do not wish to do » a injustice to an absent man, I must say that the first manager, although he might have been an expert in the manufacture of rifles, was not, in my opinion, the best man to manage Australian workbetween himself and his men ager was primarily responsible .for what OC CT1FT6 d to whom I was referring. I think that T h a t is so. When he was largely .responsible for what happened in the Factory. Since the Committee of Public Accounts inquired into the working of the Factory, a considerable improvement has perhaps taken place. I cannot speak authoritatively on the point, b u t I believe the position haB Yes ; it is very improved. I am told tliat the rifles are costing less than they were; and I hope that we shall be able to produce a thoroughly serviceable rifle for much less than the output of the Factory first cost us. I have heard that the rifles produced by the Lithgow Factory are equal to any on service to-day, and I trust we shall be able to produce them at a reasonable cost. The honourable member for Dampier made some reference to the Postal Department. I take no exception to the construction of conduits for undergrounding telephone wires in our cities; but I consider that while the Government are providing for large expenditures in the I cannot say whether the metropolitan areas, country districts are being neglected.

280,Mr Charlton,"Quite so. I putTh© Department, however, has cut off the telephone, and has informed shipping people that they can use the telegraph line. As a matter of fact, a steamer on several occasions has gone from Port Stephens to Newcastle in less time than it has taken to deliver a telegram between the two points. This is very unsatisfactory. I ask the Postmaster-General to reconsider the decision of his Department. point of view of the safety of life that this telephone line should be restored. A vessel might be in difficulties off Port Stephens, where there is no means of saving l if e ; but if there was telephonic comthe machines. The trouble at the Small munication action could be taken to send relief from that poiut. I urge the Postmaster-General to at once restore this line. The honourable member for Dampier is opposed to the Government proceeding at once with the construction of the proposed arsenal, but, in my view, this Government and some of its predecessors are to blame for allowing the project to hang fire so long. No country can protect itself while it has to import guns, explosives, and other munitions of war. I am pleased that there is an item in the schedule to provide for the commencement of the proposed arsenal, which I regard as a most important national work. Works Committee was inquiring into the matter, it was suggested that it might be possible to locate the proposed arsenal at Lithgow, but we found that there was not a suitable water supply there. In the Pederal Territory, however, at Tuggeranong, the Murrumbidgee River provides a splendid water supply. A weir across the river would impound water suitable and sufficient for all the purposes of the arsenal. The site there is a beautiful one, and the land belongs to the Government. A railway has been projected -to junction with the New South Wales system,' and the land would be easy to build on, because it is fairly level. The site is only 9 miles from 'the site of the Capital, but between it and the Capital are two ranges of hills, which would prevent noise c-r smoke from affecting the Capital. It is proposed to set aside a large piece of land for a township of workmen's buildings. Over 5,000 persons will be employed at the arsenal, and, therefore, a large sum will be required to house them, 'but the Government will receive rent from those who occupy the houses it erects.

318,Mr Manifold (Corangamite) [7.59].,"The main thing we have to keep in mind is that we must gqt on with the building itself. It is useless to say that the Small Arms Factory has been a failure. takes have been made tit that factory. But does any honourable member who has gone into business claim that he has never made mistakes? The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) who has built his house on the day-labour principle, probably did so because he knew perfectly well that he could alter his plans if he found that he had make mistakes. No business can be conducted without mistakes. chinery has had to be scrapped because of mistakes. SoI am ready to admit that mistakes have been made in regard to the Small Arms Factory. But we can amend those mistakes. making good rifles at Lithgow to-day, because the mistakes have been amended. We did turn out a certain number of rifles not up to the mark, but we have got to that stage now when we can make good rifles, and continue to make them. In establishing our arsenal we have to ascertain what mistakes have been made, not only here, but also in other countries. In an enterprise with which I am connected we decided to build a new chimney stack, and we employed the best architect we could find in Melbourne, but when his plans were submitted to a prominent builder it was found that' they were forty-five years old. We remedied that mistake, and -the chimney stack was built on proper lines. The Oommonwealth must save all that it possibly can in regard to enterprises that are not required at the present time, but it must go on with everything that makes for the defence of Australia, so that the country may be self-contained from a defence point of view. Though we may not go on with the naval programmeI think that we should-w e must have naval bases for the British ships that come out here to defend us,' so that they may be docked and repaired. This war has taught us that we must have larger docks and larger naval provision. Because we commenced' to build at one place, and find that we chose the wrong place, and because we built two years ago for ships of a certain size, and it has been found necessary to lengthen the docks in order to accommodate vessels of larger size, that past expenditure must not be regarded as a waste of money. The foundation work is still there, and we I am ready to believe that miscan extend our. docks for larger sliips. Every dockyard in the world has had to be extended in the last few years. We must be prepared for what may happen after the war, apd, above all things, we must make Australia self-contained. Already we have been able to make cartridges for rifles very successfully. We have experimented, and we have made mistakes. Such things occur in every country. Very likely Germany has An immense amount of mascrapped more stuff than we have any idea of Let Us take the position of Great Britain. Nearly all of the vessels that were considered first class a few years prior to the war are rendered useI believe that we are less to-day, on account of the increase in speed orgun power. There is always a certain amount of scrapping going on. I trust that the Government will see their way not only to proceed with the arsenal, but also to enlarge the Small Arms Factory. No doubt it is very difficult to get machinery for the arsenal, but it is far better to get it now, and be prepared for the future than to wait until after the war. We do not know what may happen, and if we are to be left in Australia without an arsenal, or a place for the manufacture ' of shells, we shall be in a very awkward position. We should not spend our money in building a Federal Capital in the interior. We should so ""spend it as to ' develop Australia, and make it self-contained in the matter of defending itself should the emergency arise. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [8.7]. I am pleased to discover amongst the so called Nationalists a gentleman who is promulgating one phase of an Australian policy.

I am not disposed to criticise very harshly the schedule we have before us, but it does appear to me that there should have been a more determined effort to limi t the extent of public works to be carried out during the continuance of the war. The winning of the war is the one essential. The more nublic works we engage in the more labour we require here and the less w ill be the number of men available to serve the country's interest in that place where they can best serve it . The first consideration should be to make our position in this land secure, and, having done that, we should be justified in going on with public works expenditure. may be used is that any public works undertaken at the present time will probably cost at least 25 per cent, more than they would under normal conditions. It is impossible for us to lose sight of the present labour difficulties. They Btagger the imagination. What guarantee have we, in passing this schedule authorizing the Government to expend £2,000,000 on public works, that we shall get the works carried out? The honourable member for Cook( MrJ . H . Catts) said that in Australia we can produce anything, and I am glad to find myself in agreement with him on the point. We can produce anything, but at what cost? Every tiling hinges on that question. When a large section of the workers continually demands higher wages, and, when it gets what it asks for, makes that a basis for still further demands, our public works must cost a great deal more than they should. Therefore, we may reasonably expect the Government to hold its hand in the expenditure of this money until conditions are more favorable. That is a common sense position to I £80,000. I am not prepared to say member believe in the Commonwealth meeting its just liabilities? Port Stephens, for the purchase of which money is being asked, was taken over by the Government nearly two years ago. ment has incurred obligations it must meet them. Honourable members opposite seem to favour any proposal that will increase the burdens of the taxpayers. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) gave us a dissertation on labour conditions.

I have said that the house was built with day labour. statement, belcause I do not wish to do the honourable member an injustice. I nearly cannot see the wisdom of opposing piecework. Under that system the labourer is paid for what he does, and an inducement is offered to men to do their best. Under the present system, the slowingdown process, the do-as-little-as-you-can policy, is being adopted everywhere. This can be proved by facts and figures. It has been stated over and over again by men in responsible positions that under the piece-work system expert workers receive much more pay than under our present system, though possibly inefficients may earn less. The Government will have to employ a large amount of labour to carry out the proposed works, and it should give the men it employs the opportunity to demonstrate their skill and to profit by it .

Many insignificant saviugs, affecting prejudicially those in fche country districts, have been put into effect, and yet fche Postal Department is spending more money this year than it has spent in previous years.

My objection to the Estimates is that they go in too much for economy. I do not think it w ill help to w in the war if we throw the fathers of our soldiers out of employment, and make the people generally discontented. I agree with, the honourable member for Corangamite that the Naval Bases should be proceeded with. I bave no objection to the expenditure on the two most costly bases, but I must point out that a l l work has been stopped at Port Stephens, and now there are only two menleft in charge of the machinery. This is in spite of the fact The Small Arms Factory has that Port Stephens is, perhaps, the mostvulnerable point in the Commonwealth, considering that the first place attacked by a hostile fleet would he where it was possible to establish a coaling station. Altogether, I think there has been spent I about £20,000, exclusive of the resumption of land, at Port Stephens, and yet this is.the only base at which further expenditure has been stopped. The Tesult must be that the work already done w ill depreciate, and result in anything hut economy. „ As a matter of fact, the Government has even cut the telephone connection between Port Stephens and Newcastle, although Port Stephens is the haven for all ships in bad weather on the I should like to know eastern coast.

From what the Postmaster-General said, to-day, in reply to a question, I understand that the matter of telephone communication will be looked into; and I can only hope that, for the sake of £50, he will not isolate a lighthouse on this most dangerous portion of our coastline. The ship-owners aTe told that if vessels get into trouble there, all communication must be by telegram, although, as the honourable member for Hunter stated earlier to-day, a steamer on one occasion beat a telegram -between Port Stephens and Newcastle. quite agree that this is the time to practise economy, but the question arises, what is economy? I can show the Postmaster-General a way in which, he could practise economy, and that is in extending telephonic and telegraphic facilities in the back parts of the country, so as to induce settlement. If people in the country desire telegraphic or telephonic communication, they are put to all sorts of trouble, and asked to provide a guarantee ; and if that guarantee is called upon the chances are that most of the original people have left the neighbourhood, and one or two have to bear the burden. Where there are areas of land that would prove productive^ the Federal Government should do all that is possible to assist settlement. ter) -Only conduits and the placing of wires underground are provided for in the Estimates. money on conduits, it would be better to open up the country in the way I suggest. The resulting revenue might not go into the Federal Treasury, but it would ultimately go. into the State Treasuries; there is only one people and one set of taxpayers. This matter has been often discussed, but the time has arrived when we should do more than talk. For ten years the need for these facilities have been pressed on the Government, with no tangible result, although, as we know, the finances are getting into such a state that production, and still more production, must be the watchword. I hope the Postmaster-General will take a broad view, and allocate a fairly large sum of money towards the extension of these facilities in the country, although this may, for a time, temporarily inconvenience the city. The construction of these conduits may be good business, but, nevertheless, there are many proposed works in the cities that could easily be deferred, and we ought to know what is the policy of the Postmaster-General in this connection. -The suggestion that the proposed vote for public works is too large, because we are at war, is peculiarly puerile just now, when we consider that the major portion of the amount is really for war purposes. Out of a total of £1,862,000 I note that £1,371,680 is particularly for war purposes. For Naval Bases we are asked to vote £440,000, for the arsenal, £239,680 (including £114,680 for land), and the remainder is for Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the lime factory, the construction of the Fleet, and the purchase of land for defence purposes. Honourable members who suggest a limitation of the expenditure overlook the fact that, while it may not be for immediate defence purposes, it is a premium against future contingencies. Particular reference has been made to the Arsenal at Canberra as an item that might, perhaps, be omitted or delayed. I suggest to the honourable member for Corangamite that his statement in this connection is not quite correct. He said that the Public Works Committee had recommended three different sites, but, as a member of the late Committee, I can tell him that we turned down the first site selected by the departmental officers for the Small Arms Factory, and recommended in its stead the site known as No. 2. However, the site selected for the Arsenal was reported favourably on, and'is in a different portion of the Terriand in this country tory. There was only one report presented by the Public Works Committee on the question of the Arsenal; and I wish to repeat the statement.

I do not think that it is fche proper site for an arsenal. I do not think that the arsenal should be located anywhere in the Federal Territory. Certainly, it should not be so close to the political centre of the continent. There is no obviating' this glaring and outstanding fact, that' .wherever we put the arsenal, it will be the peculiar objective of an enemy. An enemy choosing to invade Australia would naturally seek to strike at the nerve centre of our defence. If he could capture, demolish, or restrict the operations of our arsenal, he would have the whole continent at his mercy. The Tuggeranong site is about 60 miles in a direct! line from the sea.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong has mentioned that India is reversing the policy of having a number of small factories, and is concentrating in one big centre; bnt India is also following out what the honourable member for Cook( MrJ . H . Catts) has suggested as a proper policy for Australia, that of not depending on one arsenal only, but of also making arrangements with manufacturing firms to have a certain amount of machinery always ready to be turned off the ordinary manufacturing processes to the manufacture of munitions.

On the other hand, I think that fchat is a qualification, because their business experience enabled them to decide what was the best thing to do, and where would be the best place to build the A r senal. I received their report with a considerable amount of hesitation, because, as a layman with a limited experience, I was nofc inclined to agree with their' conclusions. They suggested a concentration policy, drawing everything into the A r senal, wherever it may be established, and they approved of its establishment at Tuggeranong. When the proposal was made to duplicate the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow the Public Works Committee recommended that the duplication should be afc Canberra. The manufacture of rifles can easily be separated from the manufacture of other munitions, and I see no reason why it cannot be carried on both at L it h gow and at Canberra. It would not be a disadvantage to have a healthy competition between the two places. There is opportunity for two good factories ta be kept going. A t any rate, ifc would enable us to decide whether the location at Lithgow or the disadvantages of Canberra prevented us from burning out better work at oneplace than the other. ment of an arsenal we musfc include the erection of smelting works and steel works, the manufacture of guns, also the manufacture of carriages, and the manufacture of shells. Sof a r in our limited defence of Australia we have met with no diffi-. culfcy in having rifles manufactured at Lithgow and ammunition manufactured at Maribyrnong, and in getting the two together wherever fchey are required in any part of Australia.

406,Mr Finlayson,"I invite honornations, and they will be anxious to unload to any buyer. Much of the rnachinery in the munition factories in Great Britain, America,.and France will be purchasable when the war is over, and I know of no better commencement that we could make than by securing some of that machinery as our initial arsenal plant. I do not suggest that we should buy all our machinery abroad, because I believe that we can manufacture some of it in Australia. Honourable members who have an intimate knowledge of what took place in Australia when we tried to manufacture shells some months ago, will readily admit that the adaptability shown by our mechanical engineers with the machinery then at their disposal was a credit to them, and a surprise to most people. I suggest that we can afford to go slow iu the matter of arsenal expenditure. enough of the "" go-slow"" policy in this country. of the Arsenal we should do well to go slow, because after the war we shall be able to avail ourselves of the experience of the world in a way that we cannot do now. In a report read in the House this afternoon, we learned that the Commonwealth Government asked the Imperial Government for the services of a man to manage a certain branch of the Defence Department, and the Imperial Government replied that they could not spare such a man.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Charlton) The houorable member's time has expired. . agree with the remarks of the last bases. To say that Australia, with its speaker ( Mr Finlayson) in' regard to the vast coastline, can be best defended by necessity for a go-slow policy in consubmarines, is to speak entirely against nexion with the Arsenal and other defence the experience of this war. works. posed upon Australia it is that it shall be monest destroyer, and I do not think that self-contained in regard to defence, and I have heard of more than a few isolated I urge upon the Government that, instead cases of submarines having been of any of going slow in this matter, they should go as fast as they can, so that we may at any rate be able to make our machine guns, and munitions, and shells, locally, and with a view to the production of larger armanents later. The objection of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) to having 'the Arsenal established at Canberra does not seem to be based on a consideration of the practice that would be followed if war came to Australia. It is true that at the Arsenal ammunition, rifles, and cannon would be built, but not all our requirements in that respect would be made there. The Government would distribute throughout Australia men trained at the arsenal in munition work, so that all the big engineering establishments could be converted in a .very short time into munition factories. To say that the whole of the munitions and arms required for the defence of Australia should come from Canberra is an absurdity to anybody who knows anything about manufacturing ou a large scale. I trust that the Government will proceed as fast as they can with the establishment of the Arsenal on up to-date lines. At the same time, I disagree with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Manifold) about the mistakes that are being made. The honourable member seemed to think that we shall continue to make those mistakes, and that the fact that we have made them in the past does not matter. We should know what officers are responsible for the blunders that have taken place, and they should be punished. We are not doing any pioneering in Australia. We have for our guidance the experience of other countries, which have been engaged in these operations for centuries, and we should not expect to make the mistakes that they made in the first place. We should be able to proceed straight ahead in the light of knowledge gained by the experience of the whole world.

I do not propose to criticise the items in the schedule, except to say that I desire more information w it h regard to certain matters. I admit that those who have occupied seats in this Housef o r some years probably have all these matters at their fingers' ends, and that if I were an old member of the HouseI should know something about them. Asi t is, I think we should have some littl e explanation, and if the Minister had seen f it to furnish us w i th such an explanation at the outset, he would have avoided a good deal of criticism, and have saved honourable members a good deal of effort. One item concerning -which I should like some information is that of £90,000 in respect of the Commonwealth contribution under the Murray River WatersA c t of 1915. I certainly do not desire to urge a "" go-slow"" policy in regard to that undertaking, but I am anxious to know what is being done. I was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria when the Murray WatersE ill was passed through that House, and I took a very keen interest in it . The big reservoir at the head of the Murray would be in my State electorate, and naturally, therefore; I was keenly interested. If I remember the figures rightly, the Commonwealth, in giving £1,000,000 towards this scheme, is contributing something like one-fourth of the total estimated cost. It would appear, therefore, that the £90,000 provided for in the schedule to the B ill is part of a proposed total expenditure of £360,000 to be in curred now by the Federation and the three States interested in the work. total. wish to obtain is whether this is to be the initial expenditure on the head-works of the Murray. down-stream expenditure and up-stream investigation. latest figures I have seen, the investigation work has cost about £60,000, so that a very large portion of this amount should not be necessary for Upper When the enemy comes to AusMurray investigation. My information goes to show that if the Commonwealth and States concerned agree to build a great reservoir on the Upper Murray, they will make a big mistake. I know that engineers, like all other professional men, are anxious to have their name associated with'any very big work, and that this Upper Murray reservoir scheme would be the biggest thing of its kind in the world. be about the fourt h largest in the world. 1,000,000 acre-feet of water. In their investigations, so f a r, the experts have ignored the possibility of going up to the head of the river and building three or more small reservoirs, which would give the same results as the bigger scheme, and at tlie same time would have an advantage over it . If anything went wrong w i th the big scheme, then the whole thing would go; but if one of four small reservoirs failed, there would be no loss of life, since they would be at the head of the river, far removed from populated districts, while the general scheme would not be interfered with , since three would still remain intact. The experts say that the best site they can find is the junction of the Murray and the M it t a . Borings, we are told, have shown it to be the best, with the exception of that near Jingelic. country that would be submerged at the junction of the Murray and the M it t a M it t a , and I do not hesitate to say that if that site were selected, before a sod had been turned it would be necessary to expend £750,000 or more by way of compensation to land-owners.

418,Mr Leckie,"I know the class of that the construction of the big reservoir there would cut off a large number of people from their markets. The objections that have been raised to the provision of smaller reservoirs at the head of the river do not seem to be valid. Proper investigations have not been made of the possibilities of such reservoirs. We have been told that, the catchment area there is insufficient; but those who have seen the rivers coming down as they have been during the last year wquld hardly be disposed to give any attention to such a suggestion. Practically the whole of the water for the Murray River scheme comes from the north-east of Victoria and part of .Kosciusco. One of tbe advantages of providing reservoirs at the head of the river is that there would be practically no compensation to pay for land. The greater part of the country there consists of Crown lands, and £10,000 would probably cover all the compensation that would have to be paid. These works would also increase the value of the land, and lessen, to a large extent, its liability to flooding. In short, they would result in land that is now being used for grazing purposes being converted into valuable agricultural country fit for the production of maize, potatoes, orany other class of -produce requiring rich soil.. would probably be less per acre-foot, adopted, then I can only say that, it is would it not! of the building of tihe weir, apart from whether ifc should be applied to country the compensation to be paid, would be a districts. little more per acre-foot at the head of the river, since it is further away from railway communication, and the transport of found it a right policy. material would consequently cost more.

The only noint I raise them en bloc. relates to the question of site, and not' to any objection to the scheme itself. I am not going to criticise any more of these items, save that relating to the undergrounding of city telephone wires, which has already provoked considerable criticism. I should like to draw a comparison between the work of the Department in our cities and in our country districts. It seems to me that even if the Department proposed to gild the telegraph posts in our cities, it would be said to be a legitimate undertaking, but that when the Department cuts off the telegraphic or telephonic facilities which some little country' districts have enjoyed, it is said to be performing a great national duty. I decline to remain quiet while my constituents are injured in this way. I decline to see the benefits of civilization taken away from them while money is being freely spent by ' t h e Department in cities that are already very well served. Throughout the country there is considerable dissatisfaction with the administration of the Postal Department. That feeling is growing and becoming more bitter every day. If the Postmaster General will say thafc he has laid down the rule that before postal or telephonic communication is extended to a country centre a guarantee must be given by the residents to be served, we shall know And the cost of weiring where we are.

Eirst of all, this work was under the direction of the M in ister for Home Affairs, now represented by the Minister for Works and Railways; it was then transferred to the Minister for Home and Territories, and is now under the control of the Minister for Works and Railways. It w ill be seen, therefore, that we cannot blame any particular Minister; but the Government are to blame for not being more f r a n k and open with Parliawould appear that a Minister is actuated by a desire to shield his predecessor from the consequences of action,",65,September 1917 1917 1949

When a couple of small sections of railway are completed Lithgow will be connected with Brisbane, I have an official report showing Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and ft by the transcontinental railway with Perth, so, geographically speaking, no other place is in a better position.
