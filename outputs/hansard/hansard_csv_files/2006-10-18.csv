(Notice given 18 October 2006.) Wednesday, 18 October 2006 ----Skilled Migration taken place in the last couple of days. We all heard in the parliament about the issue of the 40 Filipino workers working for Dartbridge Engineering in my electorate. This is not a case of exploitation of the 457 visa system; this is a case of exploitation of workers. This is what has been happening. Yesterday’s revelation was that these workers were being abused by Dartbridge Engineering at Carole Park. As I said, it is not an abuse of the system, because it is exactly what the government intended the system to be used for. The government have changed the system. They have changed the industrial relations legislation to allow for lower wages, a dumbing down of skills and a lowering of conditions. It is being used, in concert with the changes to the 457 skilled visa program-which can in itself be a good program if it is used for the right reasons: for skills shortages, which would be fine-to exploit workers from overseas. Even worse, it is being used to exploit Australian workers. The reality is that we have people looking for work, people who want to work, and they are being replaced by cheaper labour. It is not the fault of the Filipino workers. That is not the problem. They are good, decent people trying to earn a living and they are being conned into coming to this country by labour hire companies that charge them exorbitant fees. They make eight men pay $175 each in rent, to live in one house, and for transport. They work them long hours a day without penalty rates, without overtime, without shift allowances and without any rights. They force them to sign contracts in the Philippines, where the only part of the contract-these so-called AWAs-that they see is the signature page. They have no real comprehension of what they are being led to. They are just given a promise that they will be treated fairly in the sense that they will be paid the market rate-the minimum allowed under Australian law-of about $42,000 a year. In reality, these people are being paid around $27,000 a year, when the going market rate in my area is around $50,000 to $60,000, even $70,000, for someone with similar skills. This is putting huge pressure on welders in my area. I warn welders in my electorate-and right across the country-‘Be very afraid of this government, because this government is replacing you with cheap welders from all around the world.’ Government member interjectingfrom overseas. That is not replacing a skills shortage; that is driving down wages. I am going to be asking the welders of my electorate and the Liberal electorate of Blair to come forward and tell me their stories and tell me whether they are looking for work. This is not the only company doing this. The people who are being replaced by these workers are finding that they cannot compete on wages and they never will.

282,Mr Ripoll,"You cannot get welders, but you can get them for a lot less if you get themIraq Representatives we have seen the Leader of the Opposition, once again, babble and bluster as he tries to avoid the terrible consequences of his irresponsible, pathetic and weak policy on Iraq. We see babble and bluster as Labor refuse to acknowledge the consequences of their policy which, if followed by our allies, would see Iraq descend back into the hands of Saddam Hussein; would see people who have suffered for generations, now trying to build a democracy, return to the very state they only dreamed of escaping. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith, for two days in a row, have now refused to address the consequences of their weak and pathetic policy. Earlier last year we saw for the first time elections in Iraq. We saw people confound the sceptics and stampede to ballot boxes in numbers nobody predicted. They did so with terrorists threatening to kill and maim them, and some threats were delivered. We saw people prepared to take the risk to help build a new democracy. I would like to remind those opposite of just some of the news footage of the time and of some of what was said by the people of Iraq as they began building their new democracypeople like the Kurdish woman who said, ‘This is the happiest day of my life,’ the man who said, ‘We just want to live like all other people, like all other human beings,’ and the other Iraqi who said, ‘Voting is a very good feeling-we want sovereignty and we want to get rid of injustice.’ What about the slogan painted on the wall in Baghdad, ‘Don’t live in fear’? What about that wonderful story that we saw on our TV screens of a 94-year-old Iraqi woman, demanding to vote, being wheeled by her family to a polling booth in a wheelbarrow? I would like those members opposite who profess to believe in freedom to tell those people what their policy really is. Members opposite would just walk away. They would leave Iraq to descend. They would hand it over to the terrorists. We hear precious little from those opposite. They would just turn a blind eye and allow the very people who suffered at the hands of Saddam Hussein to suffer in the future. What do they say to those families who had members killed by Saddam Hussein and now see that he has fallen, with just the chance of a democracy in Iraq? But those opposite will sit silently by while the Leader of the Opposition adopts Mark Latham’s policy. (Time expired) Antisiphoning List Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.46 am)-In recent weeks my office has been inundated with emails and letters from constituents concerned about the government’s proposed change to antisiphoning laws. Labor introduced the antisiphoning regime in 1992 to prevent events that had traditionally been shown on free-to-air television from migrating exclusively to pay TV. The current list covers events in 11 sports, as well as the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, and iconic events such as the Melbourne Cup, the Australian Open tennis, the AFL and NRL grand finals and Ashes Test cricket matches. Not everyone in my community can afford pay TV, and my constituents believe that all Australians should have access to these major events. Antisiphoning laws ensure that sport is accessible to all. Pay TV is quite understandably arguing its case to access sporting events that free-to-air television does not show. It calls it ‘use it or lose it’. I do have some sympathy for MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Statements By Members
283,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (9.43 Am),"For the second day in a row in the House of this view, and I understand the point it is making. But this minister’s early target is a sport which has been available and which has been well covered by SBS, and that sport is soccer. Every soccer fan will appreciate the support that SBS has given to the sport over many years, and we all remember the enthusiasm of the Australian public for the Socceroos’ tilt at the World Cup this year. But, thanks to this government, the Australian public and Australian soccer fans will not see the Socceroos’ qualifying games on free-to-air television again. Games in qualifying rounds used to be protected on an ad hoc basis, despite the ongoing calls of the Australian Broadcasting Authority that they be properly protected through the antisiphoning list. The ABA recommended to the government that each international soccer match involving the senior Australian representative team and the senior representative team of another country be protected. But the government saw it another way and we now see the result. Soccer is a sport for everyone. Around my electorate there are 35,000 registered soccer players, compared, for example, to 7,000 registered AFL players. This is a huge sport in my community, and both audiences and players come from some of the poorest groups in our community. You can watch the kids as they arrive from Somalia and the refugee camps in the Sudan with exceptional soccer skills. They may not have had a soccer field but they had a soccer ball, and they play with great skill. Go and see our local soccer clubs and you will see people from every group in our community, regardless of income level and regardless of background. It is a genuine community sport loved by people right across my electorate. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, has ignored advice from the ABA to protect Socceroos’ matches by the use of antisiphoning legislation and allowed all World Cup qualifying rounds to be bought up by subscription television-and in doing so has put them out of reach of thousands of soccer fans in my electorate. Senator Coonan has stated that the antisiphoning laws are there to protect events of national importance or cultural significance. Her decision shows that she thinks soccer is not such an event. (Time expired) Breast Cancer agnosed in females in Australia, but it is rare in males. It is also the leading cause of cancer death in females. In Australia, more than half of all breast cancers are found by a woman or her doctor after noticing a change in the breast. Each year in Queensland, more than 2,200 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 430 women die of the disease. The Queensland Cancer Fund recommends that, from 50 years of age onwards, women should have a mammogram every two years. Screening mammography is the best method available for detecting breast cancer early, with routine screening reducing the risk of dying from the disease by 25 per cent. All women, regardless of their age, should consult a doctor if they become aware of any unusual changes in their breasts. In support of raising awareness of breast cancer, all Gold Coasters were encouraged to honour those whose lives have been touched by breast cancer by taking part in the Pink Walk around the Glades golf course to mark the official launch of Pink Ribbon Day on the Gold Coast. Pink Ribbon Day is a national day set aside to raise awareness about breast cancerthe most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. At the official launch, the Queensland Cancer Fund joined with the Glades residential and golf resort in holding a Pink Walk last Sunday, 15 October, to raise money for vital research, patient support services and MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members

Gold Coast prevention and early detection coordinator Amanda Mullins said that the key objective for Pink Ribbon Day this year was to encourage women of all ages to focus on the importance of detecting breast cancer and prevention by maintaining a healthy and active life. Last SundayI walked with over 300 Gold Coasters to mark and recognise the significance and awareness of breast cancer in our communities. I want to congratulate John Brass and his team from the Glades golf course, who supported the walk; Gold Coast ambassador Chris Wheeldon, who walked with his fiancee, Claire; and also Mr Ray Stevens, the new member for Robina, and his wife, Ruth. I would also like to acknowledge Mrs Kay Redshaw, who has just been named the state winner in Queensland for the 2006 Queensland Cancer Fund challenge. Mrs Redshaw raised more than $67,000 for the Queensland Cancer Fund, which will help pay for the cancer research, patient support services and education programs we so desperately need. Kay has been working in our community as a volunteer for many years, and she deserves a huge amount of credit from all Gold Coasters for the amount of funds she has raised for the Queensland Cancer Fund. Congratulations to Kay and to all those who walked last Sunday in support of breast cancer awareness. World Poverty Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (9.52 am)-TodayI want to thank generation Y, who are out there leading the charge to make poverty history. It is generation Y who are the first generation with the resources, technological capabilities and globally agreed framework to end extreme poverty, and it is generation Y who are actually taking up the charge and leading the challenge to make poverty history. All of us this week around parliament have been attending various events for the Make Poverty History week. Most of the people are younger people-people who are out there trying to make a difference. We often say that young people are non-passionate, non-concerned and non-involved, that they do not care and that they are too busy getting on with their lives and their consumer habits. I have been blown away by the commitment of this generation, this group of young people, who are out there taking up the challenge, who are not prepared to say that it is too hard and who are prepared to say: ‘Yes, we can make a difference. We can make a difference in our lifetime and we will.’ On SaturdayI had the privilege of seeing about 100 young people take up the challenge. They were taking the challenge to knock out poverty. They took the step of going out and knocking on 10,000 doors around the suburb of Blackburn in the seat of Deakin. The member for Deakin, Phillip Barresi, Lyn Allison from the Democrats, a representative from Family First and I were all there. It was support from all sides of politics, with the will to see an end to poverty and to support these kids who were going out to knock on doors. I was pretty impressed. I do not like doorknocking at the best of times, but these kids were taking it up with gusto. They were absolutely prepared to go and do it in droves, and a good 100 to 150 of them turned out on Saturday to do it. Their aim was to spread the word about the issue of poverty. They were going out to speak to residents about foreign trade, debt and aid, to better equip them to support the campaign against global poverty. MAIN COMMITTEE They were going to talk to residents, not to push them into too much but to make them aware of the issue, to get them to sign up and to put the pressure back on us as politicians. We can all sign up to the eight Millennium Development Goals; we can all say that we want to see an end to extreme poverty, that we want to see global education and that we want to see AIDS and other diseases eradicated. But we all need to actually do it with dollars. These young kids are out there in droves, with lots of P-plate cars and with lots of them even having to be driven around by parents, because it was school-age kids going out there to knock on doors, to create awareness and to get people involved in this grassroots campaign. I want to particularly thank Hugh Evans, the 2004 Young Australian of the Year, who is behind the Oaktree Foundation, which is leading this charge. I also want to thank World Vision, which was there supporting this and rallying it. There was a call from Axle Whitehead, the host of the popular music show Video Hits, who launched Knock Out Poverty-an invitation to Make Poverty History-and invited others to join the battle. Others did join the battle and I hope we will see an end to poverty. (Time expired) Mildura Airport and to congratulate the Mildura Rural City Council, which manages the Mildura regional airport. Last night, George Vallance, the airport manager, stood at the convention centre in Cairns and graciously received an award issued to the airport, the Australian Rural Airport of the Year. This is a prestigious award. The Australian Airports Association is a not-for-profit organisation and celebrates its 25th anniversary next year. It represents the interests of over 260 airports Australia-wide, from local country community landing strips, of which I have a few across my federal division of Mallee, to the major international gateway airports. The charter of the Airports Association is: ... to facilitate co-operation among all member airports and their many and varied partners in Australian aviation, whilst maintaining an air transport system that is safe, secure, environmentally responsible and efficient for the benefit of all Australians. It is good to see that the association is offering encouragement to airports and I offer congratulations to the member for Wide Bay, because Hervey Bay, which is in his constituency, was awarded the Australian Major Airport of the Year award, so congratulations to the Minister for Trade, the member for Wide Bay, as well. But I want to talk about Mildura, and particularly the Mildura Airport. The Mildura Rural City Council took over responsibility for the airport decades ago when ownership of regional airports was reshuffled, and they have taken advantage of Mildura’s strategic location. Mildura is located conveniently between three capital cities-Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney-and you can fly out of Mildura every day, and four times a day to Melbourne and return. In the last decade this has achieved massive growth in passenger numbers, servicing about 68,000 a decade ago to 155,000 today and growing by 10 per cent every year. This has put enormous pressure on the Mildura Rural City Council. They have responded-the terminal has already been increased in size on two occasions-and they are now addressing and planning for a third extension as that growth continues. I want to congratulate Mildura Rural City Council, particularly George Vallance, the airport manager. I know he would have stood last night surprised but honoured. I also congratulate MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members

The Narre Community Learning Centre is a fantastic centre which recently approached my office regarding the loss of their right to allow individuals and businesses to claim tax deductions on donations to the centre. The centre is based in the heart of my electorate and is used by a lot of people who are coming back into the education streamwives, people who have been out of work et cetera. The centre previously provided a program that gave it a classification as a prescribed benevolent institute but, due to the Howard government’s scrapping of the funding of this program, the centre is subsequently losing this classification and, as a result, any donations to the centre, which are quite vital to keep the centre operating, may no longer be claimed as a tax deduction. How do you think that affects people in my electorate? This will be a significant disadvantage to the centre, which already has to compete with larger TAFE institutes for donations and sponsorship to continue to be able to provide their students with much needed chances to return to study. The centre has a completely different client base to that of the larger TAFE institutes in that students are typically from what some could categorise as being a disadvantaged background. The services that the centre provides are vital to adults returning to study, whether it be to finish their VCE equivalent or to undertake a course to further their chances of returning to the workforce with greater skills and confidence. As a consequence of this particular change the centre, which estimates that it received last year between $25,000 and $30,000 in sponsorship and donations, fears that this year it will not reach this amount again, let alone the goal amount that it previously had to raise, which was $100,000 in sponsorship this year by approaching larger businesses such as Bunnings to sponsor, say, a room for about $10,000. The Narre Community Learning Centre is a centre of very high repute in my electorate. It services the areas of Narre Warren and Narre Warren South. My electorate has the highest rate of couples with dependent children in this country by a mile. It has the highest rate of people with mortgages in the country by a long way. People such as housewives wanting to return to work and people wanting to finish their VCE are trying to access these programs. This institution, in trying to do the right thing, is trying to raise money and trying to get government support. What it has got from the Howard government is a slap in the face. It is about time the Howard government started doing something to assist families in the region in this area, rather than slap them in the face.

Securing this funding is a testament to the hard work undertaken by everyone at dancenorth to restore the company to its rightful pre-eminent position in Australia. I am delighted that our local dance company now has the certainty it needs to produce product of world standard. Dancenorth australia, which is based in Townsville, is the pre-eminent regional dance company in the nation. My confidence in its board, management and artistic team has been vindicated by the Australia Council’s recognition. I note that artistic director Gavin Webber is ecstatic over both the increase in funding and the response from audiences in Townsville. Mr Webber told me that the increase is a great vote of confidence from federal funding bodies and that dancenorth australia is now in a strong position to continue the major national and international initiatives that have been put in place in the last 12 months. This direction could not have been taken without the fantastic support that the company gets from the community, and Gavin Webber certainly thanks everyone who has supported the company. He went on to tell me that he is sure that no-one can complain about the diversity and talent that have been on display this year at dancenorth australia. He looks forward to continuing to challenge, entertain and surprise Townsville in the coming years. Recognising that the funding boost is great news, its general manager, Trevor Keeling, was also very pleased. He said that this not only means that the company is assured of federal funding for the next two years but is also recognition for the vigorous change in direction that has been undertaken at all levels during the last 18 months. He said: “Most importantly, it is recognition for the exciting artistic direction that the company has steered since the appointment of our Artistic Director, Gavin Webber.” Dancenorth is about to conclude its Townsville season of works with its end-of-year cabaret, nightcafe 06. I will certainly be attending. It will be opening on 26 October. Swan Electorate: Green Corps and out-of-touch government. Last week my office was contacted by Greening Australia concerning a Green Corps project in my electorate. Named ‘Queens Park: a right royal restoration’, the project is to commence on 13 November 2006. Among other things, the project will focus on conserving and enhancing the environment of the Maniana bushland and improving biodiversity of vegetation and fauna located in the Queens Park regional parks and recreation reserve. I was informed that participants will take part in numerous activities, including walkway construction, revegetation and fence repair and installation, and identify and monitor flora and fauna. The project is being run in conjunction with the City of Canning, Peet Ltd and the Quattro joint venture partners, which includes the Western Australian state Labor government. Greening Australia told my office there was to be an official launch and an opportunity for me to release a media statement. Less than an hour later the invitation was suddenly withdrawn by Greening Australia after telling me that they had been advised that, as Green Corps is a federal initiative, only Liberal members are to be advised of Green Corps projects and invited to the launches. Indeed, once it was identified that I was a Labor federal member, I MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Statements By Members

This is a disgraceful act by a sneaky, conniving government. This is taxpayers’ money being used to fund these projects-it is not coming out of Liberal Party coffers-and the Howard government should hang its head in shame at such a blatantly political manipulation of the system and of the efforts of the organisations and young people involved in these projects. I also note that, on its website, Green Corps advises the project is in Canning. In actual fact it is in Swan. It cannot even get the electorates right. I intend to alert the partners involved in the Queens Park project as to what has been going on in this shabby little affair. This smacks of the same disgraceful actions of this government when it told schools in my electorate that only Liberal members could attend the dedication of flagpoles. Yet again the government is showing its true colours. It is shameful, it is a disgrace and it is high time these people realised that they work for the people of Australia. The people of Australia fund these projects, not the Liberal Party, and it is time the government started getting all members of parliament involved in these worthwhile initiatives. Iraq Stirling Electorate: School Infrastructure state government in Western Australia of our state schools. Before doing so, I want to clarify an exchange that I had earlier with the member for Chisholm, who quoted an extraordinarily fallacious figure of about 600,000 dead in the Iraq conflict based on a report that had been produced and that received some publicity this week. Although it is very difficult to get a correct estimate of how many people have been killed, the official estimates are substantially lower than that. We need to reflect on the methodology used in that report, which was done by a North American organisation. The methodology involved a phone poll of an extraordinarily small sample from which they extrapolated the number of dead in that conflict. That is an unbelievably flimsy way to get information and it is an extraordinary assumption for them to make. I totally reject the figure and I do not think honourable members should use it. The Western Australian government, sadly, has all but abandoned students and parents in my electorate of Stirling. When visiting my local schools, as I do often, I am shocked to see the decaying buildings and infrastructure that is occurring on every level. The Carpenter Labor government is completely failing our educators. The Western Australian Labor government is swimming in cash. It has a surplus of $2.2 billion and collects $1,000 more from every Western Australian than the Court Liberal government did. In fact, it is the highest taxing government in Australia. Yet, when a school in my electorate of Stirling requires vital infrastructure, it is up to the Howard government to provide it. When I have visited these schools, principals have said to me that without the Howard government no infrastructure would be built at their school. I have been shown white ant infested walls of a main school building. I have been shown playgrounds that are no longer appropriate.

Debate resumed from 12 October, on motion by Mr Hunt: That this bill be now read a second time. Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 and its impact upon parts of Australia that I work in, let me first make the observation that it is absolutely scandalous that we are not able to have an extensive debate on the broadcasting legislation more generally because of a gag now being implemented which will prevent people like me participating in that debate in the main chamber. That demonstrates to me, and I think to the people of Australia, how arrogant this government is, how it seeks to deny those who are democratically elected by the people of Australia to have their voice heard and be properly represented in the chambers in this House. To impose a gag in the way in which it is being done by the government on such an important piece of legislation, which has implications for every Australian regardless of where they might live, is a shameful exercise. I will come back to that issue more broadly later on. The piece of legislation that we are discussing this morning provides a framework for metropolitan and regional television licences to begin transmitting digital services. The accelerated take-up of digital television has important public policy benefits. Ultimately, the successful transition to digital broadcasting will allow the return of the spectrum used for the current analog broadcasts. The spectrum can then be used for the delivery of new services such as digital radio, community broadcasting or telecommunications. Digital television transmissions began in metropolitan areas in 2001 and in most parts of regional Australia in 2004. The Broadcasting Services Act, the BSA, was silent on the transition to digital broadcasting in remote licence areas such as communities outside of Perth in Western Australia. This bill will make changes to the regulatory framework to encourage the commencement of digital services in remote licence areas where there are only two commercial stations. This legislation will allow WIN and Prime to jointly provide a third digital commercial television service under section 36 of the BSA, free from the obligation to broadcast high-definition programs. In metropolitan and regional markets, licensees are required to broadcast 1,040 hours per year in high-definition digital format. This is known as the high-definition quota. This bill will allow the joint venture company to elect to broadcast only in standard-definition format, thereby greatly reducing the costs of making the transition to digital broadcasting. As I said, the practical impact of the legislation is that the Golden West Network owned by Prime TV and WIN have told the government they will form a joint venture company to MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members

291,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.10 Am),"BeforeI embark on an analysis of what is in thebroadcast digital services into remote Western Australia. The new service will consist primarily of content from the Ten Network and it is expected to commence by 2007. Labor supports this legislation. It does something to reverse the absence of policy on digital television in remote communities-for remote parts of Australia. The fact that it is only now that this bill is getting through speaks volumes about the government’s lack of commitment to remote communities. I have to say, as someone who represents some of the most remote communities in Australia, that it appals me that it has taken until this time to have this legislation passed. Shortly, I will come to what I regard as a more appalling situation-the failure to address the needs of other service delivery organisations which provide television services in other parts of remote Australia. We all know the benefits of digital broadcasting technology. It offers better quality sound and image, the opportunity for more content and more economic use of the spectrum. In Britain, the government estimates that re-employing the spectrum currently used for analog broadcasting will save £2.2 million. Digital broadcasting has tremendous potential to provide improved services to greatly underprivileged and underserviced sectors of the community: those people living in remote communities. The government legislated in 1998 to give the Australian Broadcasting Authority-now the Australian Communications and Media Authority, or ACMA-the power to draw up a scheme for the changeover from analog broadcasting to digital. This is contained in the BSA at schedule 4. PartA deals with the non-remote areas and contains numerous provisions relating to the rollout. The planned switch-off for those areas was originally set for 2008 but, in the middle of this year, it was extended to a more realistic 2010-12. PartB of the schedule deals with remote areas. This does not contain specific measures for the phasing in of digital in remote areas. This matter is left to policy, yet to be developed, which is set by ACMA as per sections 7 and 7A of schedule 4 of the BSA. Supposedly, this was done to allow remote area broadcasters time to work out a digital model amongst themselves, reach a consensus and then come to the government. This is what has happened, as we understand it, with the Western Australian broadcasters. In my electorate we have a broadcaster that covers much of South Australia, parts of Western Australia, western New South Wales and even parts of Victoria and Tasmania. The government has left the broadcasters in the dark, and they are uncertain of what form their future obligations will take. This is a concern being expressed by Imparja Television, an Alice Springs based Indigenous broadcaster that began its operations in 1988. Its first broadcast, the World Series Cricket test match between Australia and Sri Lanka, went out to the people of Alice Springs, who at that point were very glad to receive it. Imparja’s vision is the promotion of Aboriginal cultural and values. The station is wholly owned by Indigenous groups, including the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, or CAAMA, the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Land Council, the Northern Land Council, Warlpiri Media Association, the Pitjantjatjara Council, Top End Aboriginal Bush Broadcasting Association, Maralinga Tjarutja trust and, previously, the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission In addition to its main broadcasts, Imparja also carries an Indigenous television service, ICTV, a digital service available to satellite viewers and also broadcast as a local community service in up to 120 remote Indigenous communities. The channel delivers 10 hours a day of programming, over half of which is in Indigenous language. This does much to further InMAIN COMMITTEE digenous culture and values and, in my view, it works to empower Aboriginal people through the medium of television. Imparja’s area of operation, the central and eastern remote area licences, is the largest of any commercial network in Australia. It covers most of the Northern Territory and South Australia and, as I said earlier, significant parts of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. It has a total viewing area of approximately 4.5 million square kilometres and an audience of just 430,000. To cover such a vast audience and distance, Imparja’s signal is pre-broadcast via repeater transmitter stations into over 250 small communities. In more remote locations, which are out of the range of conventional TV coverage, viewers need to have their own satellite dish and receive Imparja direct from satellite. This ensures that people in isolated homesteads, stations, mining camps, ranger stations, motels and other smaller communities have access to the service. There are significant cost pressures in catering to such a wide and sparsely populated geographical area. Let me now stress the importance of the service that Imparja provides. In addition to a number of popular programs which are purchased from channels 9 and 10, Imparja provides a substantial amount of local content. As well as a daily children’s program and news service, it has provided and delivered weekly community and sports magazine programs and full-length features on the Finke Desert Race, the Mount Isa Rodeo and the Camel Cup, to name just a few. In addition to these examples, Imparja also supports a further 85 local events within its footprint. That question of local content is very important, given the now truncated debate in the lower house. The frustration I feel as a member of this House, not being able to participate in the broader debate and make those points soundly on the new legislation which is going through the House this morning, is a shame and an indictment of this government. What we will see as a result of this legislation passing through the lower house is a concentration of media ownership, a great lack of diversity and no compulsion really for local content of the type I have just described, which is being produced by Imparja-to its credit-in Alice Springs in Central Australia. The problem facing Imparja is the future requirement of digital broadcasting. As I mentioned previously, there is no legislation setting out how and when digital broadcasting is to be implemented in this licensing area. It is a matter of policy and involves the government coming to a working agreement with the licence holders for those remote areas. Imparja and Southern Cross Television, the other broadcaster in the remote central and eastern Australia licence area, have been submitting options to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts since late 2002, detailing digital road maps and their respective views on different models. To this end, Imparja has employed the services of a consultancy firm, Deloittes, and its Sydney media unit. For all the work on a submission on its part, there has been, as yet, no response from government. Understandably, this creates a very uncertain environment within which to operate a business. The CEO of Imparja, Alistair Feehan, has written to me on precisely this matter. Imparja have known since the late nineties that they would be required to transfer from an analog to a digital technology. As such, they have had to reduce capital expenditure on analog equipment and are faced with the future capital costs of digital conversion. Of course, spending money now on what will soon be obsolete technology is not an appealing option and does not make MAIN COMMITTEE too much economic sense. At the same time, should the current analog transmission base fail, there are no short-term solutions other than an investment of further capital. This is already happening with a number of repeater television transmitters which rebroadcast Imparja in remote towns and communities. We should not underestimate the cost to the provider of addressing these particular issues. In May of this year, Mr Feehan wrote to Senator Coonan, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, imploring her department to work with Imparja. I quote from this correspondence: The integrity of our current service has been jeopardised due to the lengthy delays in finding a digital solution for the licence area. He said to her very clearly: ‘The integrity of the current service has been jeopardised due to the lengthy delays in finding a digital solution for the licence area.’ What do we hear from the government minister? Nothing in response. This is just another way that this government deals with the people of remote Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I know of your interest in the bush, and I, like you, am appalled at this treatment. On an earlier occasion, in February this year, Mr Feehan wrote to the minister: Our major concern is that the longer the issue goes on the more business is compromised in being able to remain a local broadcaster. I urge-in fact, I demand it-Senator Coonan to take note of Imparja’s predicament and do something about it: instruct her department to work with Imparja to come up with an acceptable solution for the rollout of digital television within that remote area that their licence requires them to service. If we do not, we are placing a heavy and undue burden on this particular broadcaster to provide an ongoing analog service when they know, you know, and everyone else in Australia knows that there is to be a rollout of digital services but there is no plan for that rollout because the government is too lazy to come to-or incapable of coming toan agreement and to find an appropriate solution for the rollout of that service to those many communities across Australia. Let us think about it. We are talking here about 4.5 million square kilometres of Australia’s landmass. Granted, we are not talking about Sydney, Melbourne or Perth. We know what sort of activity is happening in those places. We know where the cream is. We can see that, after the broadcasting legislation passes through this parliament today, potential investors may be lining up to purchase parts of the major metropolitan markets in media. They are not lining up to do anything in the bush because they know that the costs involved in providing the sorts of services that are provided by Imparja mean that the profit margins are very slim indeed. Of course, a business case which Imparja have to develop and have to convince their directors and their shareholders of is very difficult in an environment where the government fails to respond appropriately to their entreaties in terms of a plan for the rollout of digital. It is worth noting in the Western Australian model contained in this bill that, while it is a way forward for digital broadcasting in Western Australia, it cannot feasibly be applied in the central and eastern remote licence areas. They are quite distinct and different areas and it needs to be understood why they are different. In Western Australia there are a number of medium sized population bases-for example, Broome, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland, Albany, Bunbury and other places-which are covered by this licence for Western Australia. The region, as I have just demonstrated, that Imparja services is wider and far more sparsely MAIN COMMITTEE populated. The economics of the servicing of the central and eastern remote licence areas are very different indeed from the economics of the servicing of the Western Australian licence area. A plan to implement digital in this region-that is, the central and eastern remote licence areas-must involve the government engaging with the broadcasters and working out a plan that all parties will agree to. This cannot be so difficult. I know that the licence holders are keen to resolve this situation, but the apparent reluctance on behalf of the government to actually sit down and get a resolution is a major cause of concern. Ultimately, what we face here is the distinct possibility that there will be people in this remote service area of 4.5 million square kilometres who will miss out on getting a digital service and who will ultimately fall off the analog list as well, because at some point Imparja will be required to move over to digital. If they do not have a plan in place which is agreed and properly implemented then it is very clear that the people who are going to be disadvantaged by it are the viewers in their licence area. Of course, these people are voters. They may vote for the Liberal Party; they may vote for the National Party; they may vote for the Labor Party. But what is happening here is that they are being disadvantaged and ignored by the government. They will know they are being disadvantaged and ignored by the government, and it is very important that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, does something reasonable-not tomorrow, not next week, not in a month’s time, six months time or 12 months time but now. I know she has much to do at the moment to explain to the Australian community why the government should proceed in the way they have proposed in terms of the broadcasting legislation. I can tell you this, Mr Deputy Speaker: the issues of local content, diversity in broadcasting and diversity in the multimedia areas of media in Australia are extremely important to all Australians. Despite the commitment to roll out digital television, we note that the government has done what I think is a significantly poor job indeed in promoting digital television. That is a shame because it is a technology which has a lot to offer. By stretching out the transition to digital, the government is costing the Australian taxpayers. According to the government’s own figures, it currently costs about $75 million to meet the analog broadcasting costs of the ABC and SBS and to assist regional broadcasters. This figure was taken from a Senate committee report on a host of broadcasting and media amendments, released on 6 October. A survey conducted last year by the Australian Communications and Media Authority shows the poor take-up rate of digital television, which in itself is an illustration of the very poor performance of the government in this area. Seventeen per cent of the respondents did not know about digital television at all, 45 per cent did not know if they could access it, 42 per cent were not interested and 38 per cent did not know that digital could replace analog at some stage. The government has a responsibility to ensure that people who live in remote communities, wherever they might be in Australia, have access to digital television. What they have an obligation to do is to sit down with, in this case, the broadcasters who are responsible for the remote central and eastern broadcast areas of television and work out an appropriate plan for the implementation of digital technology in their broadcast areas. To not do so is unreasonable and unfair and, in my mind, shows the discrimination which these people are being dealt by this government. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE contribution from the member for Lingiari, who referred to the fact that he thought the government was ignoring the people of remote Australia with respect to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 that is before the House and calling upon the minister to make changes to communications policy to ensure that some of our remote broadcasters are in a position to have some certainty going forward before the switch-off of analog television. That took my mind back to the Australian Labor Party’s decision, when they were in government, to switch off the analog mobile phone network. One must really be, I suspect, a little sceptical and cynical of the Australian Labor Party when they stand up and preach for 20 minutes about the need for the government to do something, while in some way attempting to demonstrate that it has a touch of arrogance, when they in fact switched off the analog mobile phone network and converted it to digital, having taken the decision to disenfranchise through the use of mobile telephony many tens of thousands of remote Australians. Having that at the forefront of my mind leads me to be a little cynical about the true motivation of the member for Lingiari and to wonder whether or not he is engaged in a scare campaign, rather than being open and frank with the people of regional and remote areas such as those in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. I just wanted to put that on the record in the lead-up to this debate. I note some comments that have been made by the member for Lingiari-comments that I assume will be made by the member for Lowe-who takes a particular interest in the government’s position on broadcasting policy. I would also make some comments at this juncture to highlight my strong support for the government’s changes to broadcasting policy. Whilst there are certain aspects of them that I could take or leave-in particular the 4½ hours of local content requirement, for example-nonetheless, this new policy, which is being debated for a number of hours in the House and will move on for further debate in other places, will in fact see recognition at long last that the media landscape in this country has changed significantly since the original inception of media policy introduced by Paul Keating some 20-odd years ago. I turn now to the legislation that is currently before the Main Committee, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. The question may well be asked: why is a member from the Gold Coast speaking about a piece of legislation that predominantly deals with remote Western Australia? My response would be that that is a very good question. Nonetheless, I take an interest in this bill because I am concerned to ensure that the policy framework that is put in place by this bill will have application to and will be rolled out across the Northern Territory, parts of remote Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. In that respect, I am certainly pleased that the framework that we are putting in place is one that I believe achieves an appropriate balance between some of the commercial considerations of providing additional broadcasting services to remote parts of Australia and the desire that people have to be able to access the kinds of facilities and broadcasting services that people in metropolitan Australia have. With that thought in mind, I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate. This particular bill allows for the implementation of the agreed model for the introduction of commercial digital television services in remote Western Australia, which is defined now as being all areas outside of Perth. It includes the joint provision by WIN and Prime of a third MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
292,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.30 Am),"It is with a certain amount of irony that I heard thedigital-only commercial television service under section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. It also, as I mentioned, is applicable to remote central and eastern licence areas. Since the introduction of this bill, I am informed that both WIN and Prime have continued developing plans for the introduction of their digital television services in remote Western Australia-as I mentioned, that is all areas outside of Perth. I am informed that both broadcasters indicate that this planning is well advanced and, subject to the passage of this legislation this year, it is planned that the digital transmission of current television services in remote Western Australia in 2007 will commence at the beginning of that year, with the new third service starting shortly thereafter. This particular bill ensures that we will delete item 3 of schedule 1 to the act. This in effect will enable ACMA to use its existing discretion under subsection 38B(27) of the BSA to set a revised date to commence the allocation process for the third commercial digital service in remote Western Australia. ACMA has indicated that this will be done within six months of the passage of this bill and it receiving royal assent, but it will be done in consultation, most importantly, with both WIN and Prime. At the moment the BSA does not specify detailed measures for introducing digital television in remote areas. In recognition of the need to give appropriate considerations to the very special circumstances of these areas, ACMA is required to make a legislative instrument, referred to as a commercial television conversion scheme, to set out the terms of that conversion process. Passage of the bill will provide the framework for ACMA to develop the conversion scheme for Western Australia, allowing digital broadcasting to commence and the third commercial service to be provided. Under section 38B of the BSA and its associated provisions, commercial broadcasters are allowed in regional licence areas with only two commercial licences to jointly-or, alternatively, for one broadcaster individually to-elect to provide a third digital-only service. Where they elect to undertake this in a joint fashion, they must provide each of the digital versions of their new analog services and the new joint service on a separate TV channel and provide high-definition television programs. The amendments contained in this bill will extend these provisions in a modified form to remote areas such that they will allow remote area licensees who have elected to provide jointly the third digital service to multichannel the three digital services on a single radio frequency channel with exemptions from any HDTV quotas that might be applied. Similarly, if a third service is provided by only one of the two licensees, that licensee will be able to multichannel the digital version of their analog service and the new service on a single digital channel. To simplify these digital conversion arrangements in WA, it was necessary to ensure that all areas outside of Perth were technically classified as being remote. This model that is being adopted by the government for regional and remote WA does represent, as I mentioned, a balance between the public interest considerations and the special circumstances of remote area commercial television broadcasters. The fact is that these broadcasters do face significant cost pressures due to the very wide geographic area that they serve and the sparse population. Requiring delivery of HDTV to all viewers in this market would be a very significant cost to broadcasters. Viewers will also benefit from the new third digital service delivering a substantially increased range of information and entertainment. MAIN COMMITTEE This model will have application to those who are looking at operating in remote parts of the Northern Territory and Queensland-where I have a particular interest, of course. I am certainly pleased that ACMA has indicated, together with DCITA, that they are currently working with the two remote central and eastern Australian broadcasters-those being Imparja Television and Southern Cross Broadcasting-to develop a digital conversion model for remote central and eastern Australia. I am certain that, with the passage of this bill and further developments with respect to Western Australia, those parties operating in the Northern Territory, and Southern Cross Broadcasting, will be able to progress this matter further this year, including the consideration of providing a third digital service. Of course it is not possible at this stage to provide a firm date for completion of digital conversion arrangements, but it puts paid to the allegations the member for Lingiari raised that in some way this government was not responding to the needs of people in remote Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. The mere existence and introduction of this bill highlights that this government is extremely responsive and is taking significant policy steps forward to ensure that people in remote parts of Western Australia and, subsequently, Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory will be able to have access to quality digital programming and a range of channels similar to those in metropolitan areas. Most importantly, this bill also recognises the very legitimate cost pressures that arise through the operation of a digital service in remote Australia. It recognises that the additional costs that flow from covering such a wide geographic area with such a small population should be appropriately taken into account when it comes to decision making as to the kinds of licences and the application of the licences for licensees operating in parts of remote Australia. I commend the bill to the House. 1) 2006 deals with relatively minor though important changes to broadcasting services legislation for those living in remote service areas. In short, this bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act and Radiocommunications Act to allow commercial television licensees in remote areas to multichannel if they jointly or individually elect to provide a third commercial television service. The bill will also provide these licensees with an exemption from HDTV quotas that apply to commercial broadcasters in non-remote licence areas. I am pleased to see the government retreat, albeit only in remote areas, from the onerous and expensive requirement to mandate HDTV. The decision to compel commercial broadcasters to meet a 20 hours per week quota of high-definition television must surely be seen as a flawed decision. As members before me have mentioned, Australia stands as the only country that has attempted to compel its consumers to make the transition to this expensive form of digital broadcasting. High-definition broadcasting is inordinately expensive for broadcasters and consumers. The cost of high-definition equipment to consumers is three times the cost of standard-definition equipment, making it a technology that is out of reach for the vast majority of consumers today and-most likely-in the future. Most other nations have had the good sense to allow consumers to decide which technology should ultimately hold sway, rather than mandating a particular preference. Given that this bill shows a minor retreat from the government’s usual approach of mandating HDTV, one might have thought Australia was taking baby steps forward, but steps forward nonetheless, to join most other nations on this issue. MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
293,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.40 Am),"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No.However, in what is symbolic of this government’s incoherent approach to digital technology, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2006, which was debated in this House last week, proposes to allow commercial broadcasters to multichannel solely in high definition until 2009 for reasons known only to the minister. Standarddefinition multichannelling restrictions continue to remain in place. The decision makes absolutely no sense, but then not many of the government’s decisions on media reform do. Rather, the Howard government’s approach to digital television policy and media policy broadly is incoherent and full of contradictions and fails ordinary Australian consumers because it puts the media proprietors first. The question is: why? Debate on this bill is timely. It solicits remarks on the approach taken to media reform by the Howard government and it solicits comments on the changes we are likely to see in parts of the media sector. In the minister’s second reading speech on this bill, we were again witness to the minister’s protestations that the government is working hard to ensure the smooth transition to and the smooth introduction of digital television to Australia. The minister protests that the government is committed to ensuring all Australian consumers have access to the exciting new services that digital technology will bring to our homes and that the government’s message about the exciting new world of digital television is being heard. That only around 20 per cent of Australian households have purchased the necessary equipment to receive digital free-to-air broadcasts speaks volumes. While the minister believes the government’s message is being heard, clearly the message is not being accepted by ordinary Australians. Despite the government’s attempts to stimulate the sluggish demand for digital television, including the amendments in this bill, we are all entitled to doubt whether we will see acceleration in the conversion rate to digital technology. Our doubts are reasonable given the way the Howard government has approached digital broadcasting policy, ‘in it for the consumers’. What a load of humbug and cant! This minister mocks our intelligence. That is what she said; ‘in it for the consumers’! If the minister is truly in it for the consumers, obviously she has not read the submissions made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts inquiry into the uptake of digital television. Why hasn’t the minister referred to a submission from John White that Australians are not taking up digital television because people do not perceive additional benefits such as multichannelling? Why hasn’t the minister referred to the submissions from Steve Ulrich and Paul Macknamara that digital television does not offer enough additional programming or content to provide incentives for consumers to upgrade? ‘In it for the consumers’ is one of the most absurd and disingenuous statements ever to come out of the minister’s mouth. In light of the announcement that the government’s cross-media ownership laws were being watered down, we have seen media shares rise in value. I can assure members that it is no coincidence that shares in publicly traded media have risen in value. tent of the bill, please. lieves that the government has done the right thing and it is positive about the cross-media mergers.

296,The Deputy Speaker,"It has nothing to do with the bill, Member for Lowe.Director, Tony Bell, say that he believes media consolidation will take place reasonably quickly. Is it any wonder that at the moment Mr Packer is licking his lips? We see from today’s papers that the Packer family is having a field day with media reform. These are Senator Coonan’s ‘in it for the consumers’ media reforms. The bills have not even passed the House, Kerry Packer is not even stiff and James Packer is about to double the family fortune. I wonder what the ‘Packer Family First Party’ conscience is thinking this morning with all the poverty in Australia and with the great wealth of the Packer family set to double out of Mr Packer’s monopoly gambling interests and his keeping the monopoly in place through his media company. All thanks go to the ‘Packer Family First’ senator, Senator Fielding, and the Howard government. ‘Packer Family First’ Senator Steve Fielding has behaved in my view in a most venal way and has become the Judas of the parliament. Before the ink has barely dried on the Senate’s approach to cross-media changes and before receiving the rubber stamp from this chamber, we now have the good news that a conga line of media proprietors are seeking to expand their personal media interests. According to media reports this morning, Mr Packer will be selling some of his media interests, though still remaining in control of them, and using his new-found cash bonanza to target media acquisitions, including the Fairfax newspaper group and online and radio interests. We have news that Channel7 has launched a $200 million raid on West Australian Newspapers, the main newspaper company in Perth. We have woken up to headlines this morning that are disastrous for our democracy, including ‘The big media carve-up’, ‘Packer’s sale of the century’, ‘Introducing PBL Media, $6b predator’, ‘Packer hits $4.5b jackpot’, and ‘Stokes joins media frenzy’. CCZ Equities analyst Roger Colman had the good sense to tell the public, back in August this year, that if the bills were passed there would be a flurry of media activity. However, earlier this year the venal communications minister, Senator Coonan, said that she could see no big media changes, that ‘it is difficult to see that there would be a real flurry of activity’ on the media landscape. Senator Coonan is either incompetent or just hopelessly out of touch. Either way, she ought to be sacked for showing such contempt and reckless disregard for our democracy. What a disgrace. The parliament has not even passed the bills yet, and we have this flurry of activity that will result in less choice for consumers. What an appalling insult to this House, to the Senate and to the democratic process. What an appalling mockery of Australia’s precious democracy. What a black day for the parliamentary process. What a black day for our democracy. I ask again: who is really running the country? Four-and-a-half billion dollar deals are not struck overnight. How long has this clayton’s communications minister been doing the bidding of big media proprietors? Was the public consultation process legitimate, or was the minister just going through the motions? Why was the minister so keen to push these changes through a farcical two-day shotgun Senate inquiry? And the government is going to gag debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006 in the House in half an hour’s time. What a disgrace. Through the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill, the minister is gagging political debate in the media. As I speak, she and her party are going to gag debate in the parliament at 11 o’clock today. What a black day for our democracy. These are questions that must be answered immediately to restore some respectability and legitimacy to the govMAIN COMMITTEE",186,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
297,Mr Murphy,"In the next breath we heard the Southern Cross Broadcasting Managingernment’s entire media reform. Yet this is a clayton’s communications minister who will not answer them. She has not answered them in the past, she will not answer them now and she will not answer them in the future. PBL and News Ltd now have free reign to own virtually all of Australia’s major newspapers, a free-to-air television network, monopoly pay TV Foxtel and 70 per cent of the internet’s news and information sites, while no-one else is allowed to buy a free-to-air television licence. So much for the minister being ‘in it for the consumers’! While the big end of town jumps for joy at the minister’s half-measures and half-baked media initiatives, including the weak initiatives in this bill, consumers are increasingly becoming fed up. I draw the minister’s attention to Greg Graham’s letter to the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 October, which said: The only beneficiary of the new laws is big business, and John Howard needs to explain to me at least why its interests override mine. The government needs to explain this to Mr Graham, it needs to explain this to me and it needs to explain this to all other ordinary Australians, who are concerned that the government has fallen prey to the fangs of Australia’s media proprietors. Australia’s democracy is certainly entering a dark era. Despite Australia already having one of the most concentrated media ownership landscapes in the Western world, we are seeing plans that will see it become a lot more concentrated. A functioning democracy requires a sufficiently diverse source of news and political commentary to ensure members of the public are well enough informed to make their own judgements. We need a free and sceptical media that can promote a plurality of opinions. What sort of a pillar of democracy will our fourth estate be if it is owned by a couple of media proprietors? Will journalists freely dissect and report the serious issues of the day if they run the risk of impeding their employment prospects? As I mentioned, this bill uses half-measures to address current problems that are only compounded by other bills that are currently before the parliament. It is sad that people should be sceptical about the internet value of digital television technology, but it is sadder that such scepticism exists because of the actions and policies of the Howard government. We know the government can do something about this. The government can provide more compelling digital content, not token digital content, to viewers in remote areas through this bill. The government’s approach to this bill reflects the approach of the failed and discredited policies of former communications minister Senator Richard Alston. It reflects an approach that is stuck in the shadows of the government’s 1998 legislation in which it was somehow thought to be in the public interest to freeze further commercial television networks. Perhaps it was thought that we needed to protect the incumbent commercial broadcasters during the period when they had to invest in digital transmission all those years ago. That might have been fair enough then, but why, in the name of the public interest, are we transforming this freeze into an ice age? There is no public interest reason. It makes no sense to the ordinary Australian consumer. This bill aims to encourage existing broadcasting players to provide more broadcasting services in underserved areas without the need for inviting more licensees into those areas. Those who sit opposite might wonder why. The reason is simple. There cannot be more licensees because the number of commercial TV broadcasting licences has been frozen. What about providing to consumers more competition, greater choice and innovation from new entrants? Why give existing players an opportunity to rehash old footage on a digital channel? MAIN COMMITTEE Remember the submissions from Steve Ulrich and Paul Macknamara that digital television does not offer enough digital programming or content to provide incentives for consumers to upgrade? Why hand over the new service to existing media players when there is a risk that the content will be similar to or the same as the content that consumers in that area are already getting? Is the minister really serious about driving the take-up of digital television in these areas? Is the minister really in it for the consumers? Of course not. What is wrong with giving another broadcaster a free-to-air television licence if that broadcaster is willing to put forward the large sums involved in such an investment? If the minister truly were the consumers’ champion, there would be no freeze on the number of free-to-air television networks. As I have said before, John Singleton wants to put a 100 per cent Australian content television network throughout Australia, and that would take only five per cent away from the existing market. What is wrong with that? If the minister truly were the consumers’ champion, the conversion to digital television would be gathering momentum Australia-wide because free-to-air broadcasters would be unshackled from restrictions on multichannelling. The restriction on standard-definition multichannelling while opening up high-definition multichannelling is ludicrous. Given that the only network that has shown an interest in multichannelling, the Channel7 network, has stated that it has no plans to commence a high-definition multichannelling service, it makes absolutely no sense. This is a cunning attempt by the minister to appear as though she is giving something to consumers when in reality she is giving them nothing. The reality is that a prohibition on freeto-air networks and a ban on standard-definition multichannelling in non-remote areas are clearly designed to address the interests of media players. It is a compromise with the numerous media businesses that are naturally seeking to protect their turf. That is why I have been screaming in the House for the last six years, since the government proposed all these changes to the media reform landscape in Australia. What about protecting the public interest? What about being in it for the consumer? This bill and other elements of the government’s so-called media reform package can only lead me to conclude that this government is motivated not by the public interest but only by the interests of the two biggest media companies in Australia. Most, if not all, of the government’s media reforms appease the powerful commercial media interests, not the interests of consumers. It is amazing that the minister scratches her head and wonders why Australians are not taking up digital technology, when she is simultaneously selling them out in favour of the two biggest players. The government has refused to tell the Australian people the real agenda behind its policies, but the Australian people are not blind. Most will see right through the minister’s venal behaviour. What is most problematic about the Howard government’s approach to digital television is its track record of deviating from a commitment to providing a diverse range of services offering entertainment, education, news and information. At every juncture of digital TV policy, the government has navigated a dangerous path which appeases entrenched segments of the television and pay TV industry and most obviously PBL and News Ltd. Everything the Howard government has tried to do in terms of digital television has been nothing short of a win for stupidity and a triumph for incompetence. Sadly, the fumbling and bumbling approach to digital technology is only contributing to the MAIN COMMITTEE untenable situation whereby Australia remains in a world of analog while other countries make a permanent switch to digital. This is the case in remote and non-remote areas. I challenge the minister to undertake a genuine reform agenda, starting with this bill, that does not build upon the foundation of appeasing established vested interests. Why start from the premise of pandering to media moguls? Why not build from the foundation of exploiting opportunities presented by digital television rather than exploiting and flogging the poor consumers? If we can have more new broadcasters in the free-to-air television space, why stop this progress? If we can enhance viewing choice by allowing standard-definition multichannelling options for those in non-remote areas, why stop this progress? Why should we continue to remain shackled by decisions that seem purposefully designed to inhibit the development of digital technology? Why not listen to consumer and competitor concerns when reforming any elements of Australia’s media? Australia’s media need not remain a protected species. Since entering parliament, I have held the sincere belief that the government would stop singing from the same song sheet as the influential media moguls. The Howard government’s track record on media regulation has been appalling. Combined with the Howard government’s ruthless attempt this week to sell out our democracy to powerful media moguls, my belief has understandably waned. Members of the government should show courage and leadership and stand up for their principles rather than political pragmatism. Australia’s democracy is far more important than any short-term political gain. The public interest and the future of our democracy are at stake, in my view. They demand more than a short-sighted view to obtaining favourable editorial coverage from the media. Sadly, it appears that the bulk of the government’s reforms will continue to make it more difficult for competitors to rise from the ashes. The people who have the most to benefit from the spate of recent media bills from this government are the existing players. I say that again and again. The past week has shown that the Howard government is either utterly clueless when it comes to promoting digital technology or extremely cunning in protecting vested interests. Either way, media consumers and Australia’s democracy will be worse off for this bill and the media ownership bill, which is going to be rammed through the House of Representatives shortly. Nonetheless, I will not resile from my campaign, which has been going since 2001, and I will continue to live in hope that people in this House will come to their senses. I have previously accused the minister of engaging in venal behaviour and I do not resile from that. However, I know the Prime Minister to be a great believer in our democracy and a man who believes in civic responsibilities and obligations. That he did not wish to spend much political capital on this issue suggests that his heart really is not in it. Why didn’t the Prime Minister come into the House and speak on this bill? I appeal to him to review this bill and to put a stop to the assembly line production of other media bills. We need to do more to protect and promote diversity in entertainment, news and political commentary sources in this government. We all know that greater diversity of news and information is good for democracy and good for our country. As I have already mentioned, in his Australia Day address to the National Press Club, the Prime Minister made several exultant references to our democracy. He also said that a fiercely independent media strengthened by industry diversity has contributed to these democratic traditions. Actions speak louder than words and that is why I hope the government will embrace the opportunities presented by MAIN COMMITTEE digital television and put a stop to cross-media amendments that will put more power and influence in the hands of unelected media proprietors. It is a disgrace that the Prime Minister, ably assisted by Senator Coonan, is slamming a wrecking ball into the pillars of our democracy in Australia. We are going to suffer the ramifications of the media reform bills-this bill and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006, which we are about to vote on in the House of Representatives in a few minutes time. It is an absolute disgrace. The government stand condemned. They are not interested in the public interest; they are only interested in looking after the big, powerful media companies. lation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 after having just been one of the lucky people on the Labor side to speak in relation to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill and the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill. When you look at the content of this bill and what it attempts to achieve and the contents of the other bills, they are worlds apart. We are led, at least in the media ownership bill, into an area so deep and dark we have never seen anything of its like before in Australian history. It is a dreadful thing, as the member for Lowe referred to in what was a very broad discussion on this particular bill. I want to go to the core of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. What are the elements of this bill? What is it trying to do? For particular regional and remote areas in Australia-in one instance, virtually the whole of Western Australia and in other instances the Northern Territory, outback Queensland and outback New South Wales-we have a situation where currently there are one or two licensees taking an analog service through those remote areas. The difficulty those licensees will have is that, in being forced to make the transition to digital-and we know that that transition to digital was going to be in 2008 to start off with and was then pushed out to 2010, and I think the plan might be to push it out to 2012-it might be a bit like the Joint Strike Fighter in that we may be looking at 2015 by the time we finally get to put it into play. When in opposition in the past and since it has been in power, the government has made a great deal of the changeover from analog to the digital service with GSM. We had advice when we were in government on that changeover. Certainly, this government has had a whole string of advice about how it should make the transition from analog to digital. This bill is very interesting because it is completely in line with what the government decided in the very first instance when it looked at the whole question of high-definition television. Remember the early period when the government was looking at what it would do in terms of the transition to digital? It was trying to work out whether or not to go with high-definition TV, as recommended by James Packer and the PBL organisation and, I think, also News Corporation at the time. They argued that Australia should make an immediate and straight jump to highdefinition television. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, were both given high-definition TVs to have a look at what that service would be like during the summer cricket season. They enjoyed that for a number of months until someone found out and said: ‘Hang on, this is a bit rich, isn’t it? Why should two people who are making a decision about what kind of transition we should have be given a special privilege, at no cost whatsoever, particularly during the summer cricket season?’ It would, of course, affect one more than the other, given that the MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
298,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (11.00 Am),"It is interesting to come to the Broadcasting LegisPrime Minister is a bit more enamoured of cricket than the Treasurer is. Whether that had any effect or not, the government went down the high-definition TV road. I argued at the time that I did not think this was very smart. What might have been a better proposition for Australia as a whole-and I am not sure whether I still hold to this, but we will see where the argument goes-would have been to take a standard-definition route. If you took a standard-definition route and did not take the immediate jump, you could do what a number of European countries have done in making the transition. You could have much greater diversity and much greater approachability in media provision. The part of the band taken up by analog is very large. You can put either one highdefinition signal in its place, or you can put six standard-definition signals in its place. If you are interested in diversity and in providing a multichannelled experience, you would go with the SD model. The government went with high definition. What is this bill saying? If you have a couple of licensees in remote and regional Australia-those licensees are WIN and Prime in large areas of Australia and there is another entity in Perth-because of the wide geographical spread of Australia and the sparse nature of the population, you are going to have to have very deep pockets if each of those licensees is going to have to reach into those pockets to pay for the full transition to HDTV. Accordingly, this bill provides something like $19.63 million to assist. It says that, in those areas where there are two analog licensees, it will create another entity. That entity will have one digital channel-a third digital channel-which, in the wonderful way in which these bills are drafted, will serve effectively as one of the existing two. It is a mechanism to say two can become one. There will still be two licences in an area but this one digital one can serve for both. I think it is a sensible and necessary thing not to put the hammer onto companies and say, ‘You will have to provide it all yourself.’ We know that has been done from one end of the country to the other in the major metropolitan areas. There is enough depth in there. We also know that Channel 7, Channel 10 and Channel9 have completely different definitions of what HDTV is. So you do not get the straight 620p or the interlaced version of that, 1080i, on all channels. It is not the same HD broadcast on all, because they have adopted their own different standards. That makes it difficult for people who are making content and providing it to a number of those stations, but it also would make it difficult for people in remote areas in terms of what they are getting. You have both WIN and Prime which, from memory, have different definitions of what they are providing in HDTV. If they have one single channel to provide it and if they are saving costs as a result of utilising this, they will actually have to make some changes in the way they put their shows together in order to be able to run through the one single system. So what has been provided here could have been a great deal more if the government said: ‘We might make an exception here for remote and regional Australia, at least in the first instance, and go down the multichannelling SD route to provide more capacity, utilising the existing analog capacity. We could provide a great deal more diversity and give more choice to people instead of just the one HD signal. We can have up to six SD signals.’ They did not do that for Australia. The fundamental reason why? There were certain interested parties who came to speak to coalition members, ministers, the cabinet and indeed members of the opposition, pushing their barrow and arguing for what they wanted out of it. MAIN COMMITTEE What have we seen over the past 10 years in terms of the shape and nature of digital television delivery in Australia? We have seen that the take-up has not been really brilliant. It is about 17 per cent or so. It is still very slow. What has kicked on in that period and what has been most aggressive is people’s use of DVD. They have used some newer screens in that take-up. We know that in the next few years-and this will take quite a while to bed downToshiba will be putting their HD up against Blu-ray technology, which allows you to record roughly between 29 gigabytes and 50 gigabytes of information onto a disk. When you do that, you can actually tape one of these shows. If you record about an hour of television and you use MPEG2-and what is interesting is that, once we get the legislation through this place, doing this will be entirely legal for the Australian population whereas at the moment it is completely illegal-you are looking at a couple of gigabytes of information. If you do the same with HD, it jumps dramatically in terms of the amount pushed out-something in the order of eight gigabytes for just one show of an hour’s length or so. You need to be able to store a lot. This makes a great deal of difference to people who want to time-shift and look at the information later, but it also gives you an indication of just how rich what is being provided through HDTV is. The signal is much better, the amount of pixelation is much greater and it is a hell of a lot sharper. But you are replacing analog with just that one service. It may well be that, simply because of the quality of that signal, eventually people will pick it up and run with it. Part of the reason that they may do that is that they may see that DVD can in fact be surpassed. People who use DVD throughout regional and rural Australia now, those people who get just analog services-as we know, it is a bit hard to run down to the local shop in regional and rural Australia-are using the significant services available Australia wide through Telstra and other entities where you can order a DVD service. That has supplanted a lot of the normal television watching we have seen, and it is part of the problem in the free-to-air area where advertisers realise they are not getting the same sort of bang for their buck they got previously, because people’s viewing habits have changed. HDTV does allow for a significant jump in quality. If you have an appropriate system to use it and can access it, and if you have got over the hurdle of the cost of entry, you can take it up-and, as time goes on, a lot more people are coming in. The member for Gorton, who is here in the Main Committee, is a very crafty and sensible person. He just bought a new TV, but he did not buy it before the World Cup soccer because he knew the prices would have been up. He bought it after that, when there was a tremendous price drop. He got a television of the same quality for about half the price-and a lot of the punters out there are doing exactly the same thing. They are aware of the situation and they have waited. The member for Gorton, like so many others in Australia, waited to see the price drop so that it could become affordable. That is a key point in terms of whether the transition to full HD will be really successful. You cannot undo this part of the changes in the media area. We cannot just go back and say, ‘Let’s just run with SD.’ But I think there are a number of things we can do. In the digital TV bill, which I just dealt with in the House but did not in fact speak on, there are some reasonable changes and we are supporting them. One of the things the bill allows is some multichannelling, as this bill does. You need to get a bit of a spread and allow people greater access to different programming. The fundamental problem since the kick-off of high-definition television in Australia, in terms of the government’s response and the manMAIN COMMITTEE ner in which they have just run down the line of the major media interest, is that we have not had diversity of access because datacasting was completely knocked out. Who would datacasting have assisted? It might have assisted the Fairfax organisation. They have a fair amount of data to pump around the country. People may have had more access to a broader range of data. It would have been a situation as well where, if datacasting had been allowed-and people could have had a very difficult time trying to work out what that was and what it would mean-and if you multichannelled, could you actually have a bit of a TV show and all the rest of it? What would it mean? Would it be sort of like TV? We are still imprisoned in this dilemma. What we do not have in regional and rural Australia is enough choice in this regard. For a government that underlines how important that is, we do not have fast enough internet access that could actually change what they are doing. In fact, Labor has a plan-as we have for a number of things-to give to 98 per cent of Australians by 2010 fast internet access in the order of a minimum of six megabits per second. That is enormous compared to where we are now. We have gone from dial-up at 28 kilobits through to a provision where most people have roughly 256 kilobits-if they have woken up to the fact that they can pay as much for 256 kilobit access as they pay for 28 kilobit. The telcos are not going to ring you up and say, ‘Hang on-you can get a faster service for the same money.’ We are also in a period of immense transition where people in regional areas who are not so remote that they cannot get access have looked at other ways of doing things, of accessing high-definition content or accessing media content and data content through the internet. The innovative action here has been in the regional areas. That is where iPrimus and iiNet have said: ‘Okay, we can make some changes here. The copper network may be pretty dodgy because Telstra has not put the money in that it should have in order to maintain it, but if we put a piece of equipment into the existing digital exchanges’-a piece of equipment called a than 256 broadband.’ In the regional areas, where there was always the greatest deficit, people could actually have another choice, because part of what is happening in this area is that delivery mechanisms are changing. Where this bill deals with the transition from analog to digital, from a couple of analog services through to one dedicated channel which would provide those HD services and some associated multichannelling, in the future there will be some competition from elsewhere, because we do not have the full SD multichannelling involved here. If your internet access is fast enough, except for in the most remote areas of the country, you will be able to run to an eightthrough to 12to even 25-megabits access through the net, depending-as it does at the moment with the normal ADSL-upon how far you actually are from the exchange. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.18 am to 11.31 am increased through this action to license a digital channel, which can allow for some multichannelling at certain times instead of full HD. But the impetus Australia-wide is changing. I am firmly of the view that, in going from analog to digital TV, the use of that spectrum will still allow the free-to-airs to have a dominant position in the Australian market. This is not a MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
299,Mr Hatton,"The choice that people in regional and rural Australia have is marginallyview that is generally held but, if you look at the provision now, if you want to push out signals-analog, digital or whatever-to the broader market, you will see that the fastest, cheapest way to do that is to use the existing spectrum. Some have the view that you can supplant that by using broadband that is fast enough. As I indicated just before a division was called, Labor’s plan to provide fast broadband for Australia will certainly be revolutionary in terms of the 256 kilobits, at the very minimum, that we currently have. Even members of parliament have just been allowed to go to 512 kilobits. The bottom end of regional Australia’s utility at the moment-if they use ADSL2-is to have 1½ megabits, then from that point you run significantly right up to 12 megabits or so. That is fast, and it is fast enough to have TV delivery around Australia and to have a whole stack of services. It is fast enough to be able to subvert what the government has done in mandating HDTV with respect to only the existing players. It is also a question of whether you do it and whether you do it well enough, particularly in regional Australia. Part of the problem here is that those people who are most affected by this bill live in remote Australia, and you still have the problem that they are part of that two per cent that are the hardest to serve. But there are already faster satellite services available so that you get some breadth, some diversity, some slicing of the market to give people a chance to have a run. This is an interesting bill and a useful one for people in those circumstances, but it only partly recognises the changing nature of delivery of digital services to Australians. In fact, it is indicative of the fact that the government really does not know what it is doing in this area. It has for so long forestalled the dramatic increase in broadband access that Australia needs not just in the cities but in regional, rural and remote Australia. And where this legislation goes some way to making it cheaper for people to provide digital services, you have to go(Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (11.34 am)-The member for Blaxland made a few interesting points in his speech on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006, but it sounds to me as though the Labor Party is trying to back the Beta technology when everyone is walking out the door with VHS. It is always very dangerous for government to mandate technologies, and that was very evident in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts-which was a bipartisan report-entitled Digital Televison: who’s buying it? That committee looked into the uptake of digital television in Australia, which was very slow. I was certainly in the parliament 10 years ago when we chose HD, hence the seven megahertz spectrum. We seem to be talking all the time about these channels being seven megahertz, whereas the member for Blaxland quite rightly pointed out that it is no longer a seven megahertz spectrum; it breaks down into megabits per second. So we really should be talking about channels and megabits per second, be it an SD channel or a HD channel or one that is using MPEG2 compression or, in future, MPEG4 or MPEG6 compression or Pentiumwhatever type of compression technologies will be used in the future for broadcasting. Certainly the spectrum required gets smaller and smaller and hence the opportunities for diversity explode. Diversity in the media underpins the coalition’s policy in this area, but we do not want to mandate technologies that people can use. You want to make provision for wherever the market goes in the future so you can support consumer choice and give consumers what they want. MAIN COMMITTEE We have made a huge provision for HD over the last decade, in that that would be the standard that consumers would want. I disagreed with it at the time. I thought: ‘That’s a load of rubbish. No-one is going to buy digital television for a good picture, for goodness sake!’ TodayI am of a slightly different point of view given the number of televisions that are being sold with large screens-I am talking massive. Just the other weekend, I was with Len Wallis, who had a three-metre screen operating on very good quality HD. People are now designing their houses-you see it in project homes and display homes-to accommodate these TVs. Instead of the old family room and lounge room and what not, they actually have cinemas. Miss JACKIE KELLY-That is right. Consumers are arranging living rooms pretty much like this chamber, where you all line up in rows and watch massive screens. HD is critical. To get a good picture and good sound quality, HD is important. It is where technology is going. With the ageing population and people having eyesight issues over distance, good quality screens start to get important. So, although I disagreed with it 10 years ago, I do think HD technology is important and ought to be one of the choices that consumers have. Given that, we need to ensure that when consumers purchase the conversion to digital they have a choice of checking out HD, checking out SD and saying, ‘Yes, I will pay the extra for that service because I like it,’ or: ‘Look, no, I am not really that much of an aficionado; SD will do me. I’m fine with 50 bucks for a set-top box. I will use all my own gear. I am not really interested in anything else the digital age has to offer.’ That choice is important; hence the government has proceeded with a multichannelling option in HD. At the moment that is a fairly limited right, because there are not too many consumers out there with HD, but it ought to be an option that consumers have in future. I personally think that mandating an SD rollout and SD multichannelling is going to be a great driver of digital television uptake, as indicated by this bill, in allowing an extra SD channel in remote Western Australia. It is ring-fenced; it is only for remote areas. I notice that everything outside of Perth is remote: ‘regional’ has been redefined to ‘remote’ in this bill. It is a business model that has been worked out between government, Prime and WIN to provide some stimulus to the uptake of digital television in the regions and to give an option of an extra station. They cannot roll out HD across this area; it is much cheaper to roll out the SD transmitters. For consumers in the regions, it is a lot cheaper to buy the SD box. One of the drivers of the cost of this technology is the quantity being sold. Our committee received evidence about what will happen when the cities-particularly Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane-convert. With the analog switch-off, people must make a decision. They must purchase this technology. The competition in this market is huge. Every weekend you will notice that your letterbox is full of brochures from competitors with loss leaders from JB HiFi, Domayne, Retravision, the Good Guys, Harvey Norman-you name it. They are all really pushing these electronic goods. A switch-off in the cities will drive the price of goods down, so the more remote and regional areas will benefit from the cheaper prices. If you have switch-off in the regions before the cities, I think the regions will be paying a lot more for the equipment. That was a lot of the evidence that was presented to the committee about keeping some parity in the cost of switchover for consumers. MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Dslam And Using That Are Able To Give People Access To Adsl2 That Is 25 Times Faster
300,Mr Adams,"And popcorn!Let us have a look at what consumers are purchasing. What are they looking for in the new equipment that they are purchasing? They are certainly looking for extra services. It became apparent from all the international markets we examined that it was the extra stations that drove digital take-up. It was having something extra, which this bill provides. It provides an extra SD channel, which is different from anything you will get on the analog stations. I still have some concerns and reservations about where community broadcasting will go in the conversion, particularly in remote areas. Obviously Imparja, as the member for Lingiari correctly pointed out, is a great television station, moving ahead in leaps and bounds. It has the potential to be Australia wide and it is certainly servicing large Indigenous populations in Sydney and other parts of metropolitan Australia. We have invested in this national Indigenous television concept, and I think community television has the ability to deliver diversity in media as well, as shown by channel 31 in Melbourne. Where can these stations move to? Are they going to be a ‘must carry’ on ABC? Do they have a simultaneous channel? They do not need seven megahertz-they really only need a quarter of that-to simultaneously broadcast, so they keep their consumer while they switch over. The cost of putting together content for community television is certainly substantially reduced. Technological advances like YouTube clearly demonstrate that there is content coming from all over the world that people are quite happy to make publicly available. So there are large opportunities. One of the things that I have identified from looking at things is the SBS channel. SBS is sitting on a large swathe of spectrum. It costs government $100 million a year and it delivers probably one program a week for some of our non-English speakers. In Australia there are currently two pay TV platforms which deliver, in some instances, up to three or four channels in the language of the non-English speaker in Australia. They have a satellite footprint across Australia. It is about $60 a month. Anyone who wants to see a non-English program can actually flick between three or four channels all in the language of their choice on pay TV. You have to wonder, in today’s environment, at the value of spending $160 million on SBS. What can be done with that spectrum? I suggest that spectrum has a lot of opportunities in the community TV area, and that provides a lot of diversity. But, again, a lot of this tends to depend on where people are purchasing this product, what the consumer is doing and what the consumer wants. I think there are better ways of delivering it and we must always be on the move, but you cannot dictate technologies. We need to be very cognisant of the diversity required in the media to maintain our independence as politicians and to maintain consumer choice so that consumers can see what they want, when they want and how they want to watch it. That will be driven, I think, largely by them. Mr Brendan O’Connor-Pollies on ice! Miss JACKIE KELLY-We should organise to get our own back and put it up on YouTube! This bill provides a valuable service to consumers in remote Western Australia and obviously has a few lessons in it for other areas of Australia, but they have their own problems. I think it is always dicey to drive technology. I commend the bill to the House. lation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006, is important for television viewers in remote areas of Australia where there are only two commercial services on the market. The bill will assist MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Dslam And Using That Are Able To Give People Access To Adsl2 That Is 25 Times Faster
301,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.45 Am),"This brief piece of legislation, the Broadcasting Legiscommercial free-to-air broadcasters to deliver digital TV to Australians living in these areas. But once again the national broadcaster is not included in this, in the sense of having opportunities to broaden its footprint, yet there really are huge deficiencies in the ABC’s range in Australia. If commercial broadcasters take up the options made available in this bill, viewers in places like Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland and Geraldton will be able to experience the superior picture, sound quality and other benefits of digital TV-yet in Tasmania we are scratching to receive the public broadcaster in a good percentage of town areas. They will also have the benefit of an additional commercial television channel-and in Tasmania we will with Channel 10. I do not begrudge these improved services for people living in remote Australia, and I will support the passage of this legislation through the parliament. While this legislation mainly applies to remote areas, I would like to know what is happening to help the government owned broadcasting service to be screened in every home in my state. In Tasmania many areas have not received ABC television reception since the change from VHF to UHF. Now we are being asked to deal with the next change without any assistance to receive that new signal. The member who spoke before me, the member for Lindsay, mentioned pricing, and I know that the report she did was about the price of digital TVs and about bringing down digital pricing. The thrust of her argument was quite right: the more people that take it up, the cheaper TVs will get, as I have discussed with other people. But as you start changing the delivery signal in different areas some people that are on the edge miss out while some others pick it up, so there are winners and losers when you start changing signals. My electorate has 62 per cent of the landmass of Tasmania. It has a lot of dales, hills, mountains and trees, all of which can interfere with signals, so a lot of people have great difficulty in receiving signals. Digital TV transmissions began in metropolitan areas in 2001 and in most parts of regional Australia in 2004. The rollout of the infrastructure for digital broadcasting has proceeded very well. Free-to-air digital TV is available to 85 per cent of Australian households. The state capitals and 31 regional centres have access to all of their existing free-to-air television channels in digital form, except certain parts of Tasmania that are not considered remote, yet do not have the luxury of having a free-to-air service. The Broadcasting Services Act does not contain any provisions which set a date for the commencement of digital broadcasting in remote licence areas. This reflects the fact that population density is low in remote licence areas and, typically, to reach the audience, many retransmission sites are required. So, if they can have them for the commercials, what is wrong with providing a similar service for the national broadcaster? These factors make the transition to digital broadcasting very expensive for licensees in remote areas. So, while this legislation aims to help reduce those costs and to increase the incentive for incumbent commercial broadcasters to invest in digital transmission facilities, it does little to help the ABC. In remote areas where there are only two commercial television licensees servicing the market, broadcasters will be permitted, either individually or through the establishment of a joint venture company, to broadcast a new digital-only service. The new service will also broadcast the digital version of the existing analog services on the same channel. In other words, commercial broadcasters in remote licence areas will be able to multichannel. MAIN COMMITTEE Currently, this option is not open to commercial broadcasters in non-remote areas. In order to reduce the costs of establishing a new digital service, the bill offers broadcasters in remote areas relief from the high-definition quota. In metropolitan and regional markets, licensees are required to broadcast 1,040 hours per year in high-definition digital format. This bill allows remote licensees to elect to broadcast only in standard definition format. The ability to opt out of high-definition broadcasting will significantly reduce the costs of providing digital services in remote areas. As many people do not even get standard definition, it will be acceptable for a while until technology brings on new levels of reception. However, there is a significant policy gap because there are no details provided on what assistance will be available to ensure that the disadvantaged are not left staring at a blank screen when switch-over occurs. My Senate colleagues have done their homework on what is available overseas. The US congress has allocated nearly $US1 billion to subsidise the purchase of set-top boxes. In Britain, up to £400,000 will be set aside from BBC licence fees to assist the disadvantaged to switch. The task of achieving digital switch-over is a huge policy challenge. In the UK, where 72.5 per cent of households have access to digital TV, it is estimated that only 40 per cent of televisions have been converted. If it can be done for the BBC, I do not see why the ABC cannot be assisted to provide service to semi-remote or difficult terrain regions. My constituents in Glengarry, Flowery Gully, Royal George, the Tasman Peninsula, the west coast and many other places will have nothing. One of my elderly constituents, Ken Wagg, even felt tormented enough to climb a 60-foot tree on his property to improve TV reception. The reception was still no better, but he drew attention to people’s plight in that area. A member of the upper house of the Tasmanian Parliament and I persuaded Ken to come down. We persuaded him that there are safer ways of bringing this issue to the attention of the legislators. He went off with a petition and collected the signatures of nearly 4,000 people who have had difficulties with TV reception in their different areas of Tasmania. So it is really not good enough to allow just the commercials to have access to rural and remote concessions. People in my electorate are not that rural or remote, yet they still cannot get a decent service, either from the ABC or the commercials. Some of them would laugh to hear that they are supposed to be getting at least three channels. I watched a football match in one area of my state on the only channel I could get and I could not track down where the football was-so I can forget about the cricket. The situation is that people can buy into pay TV, but they do not get local TV news bulletins from the ABC. They can pick up other news bulletins from other parts of the country, but it is not local news. This is an isolating factor as well. I believe we have to do a lot more mixing of communications technologies whereby people can share whatever is available to get television, radio and mobile phone coverage. Not everyone wants to run around with a computer under one arm and a satellite under the other to try and pick up a signal. We also have this added complication of the change in media ownership laws, supposedly to broaden the ownership of commercial stations-purportedly giving us a greater range of programs. All it is really doing is allowing the current media moguls to cross-subsidise themselves. Those in regional areas will not only miss out more but also lose any sort of independence of view that they might have had. I am very disappointed in those changes too. They show that the minister is just not up to the task of being able to regulate media in this country. We saw members of the House gagged this morning by the Leader of the House, who probaMAIN COMMITTEE bly got a phone call from Jamie early this morning saying that he wanted the bill through the House today, that he needed the money because he has to buy a part of Fairfax. So we had debate in the House of Representatives gagged, and many people who wanted to speak on that particular bill and about media ownership could not do so. It is something which is very important for the democratic processes of our country, but it was denied. So while I agree that this legislation will be helpful in areas that we all have to deal with-and some people will receive some benefits: digital TV has great advantages-it will be less than helpful for some people in my state. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.58 am to 12.17 Ms HOARE (Charlton) (12.17 pm)-Like so much else put before this House by the government, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 contains a lot of small fiddly details, a few minor changes to existing policy and a glaring lack of useful change to target the things which most need fixing. Labor are not opposed to this bill, for we believe that people living in remote areas should have access to an amount and a variety of television content comparable to those who choose to live in our big cities. We cannot help but agree that any legislation to encourage faster take-up of digital television in this country is a step in the right direction. But this bill does not go anywhere near far enough in addressing the important issues surrounding digital TV, particularly as the government has refused to consider the amendment moved by Senator Conroy in the Senate which sought to address existing restrictions on the content which our two national broadcasters, ABC and SBS, are able to show on their digital channels. Labor’s amendment would have done away with the current restrictions which prevent our national broadcasters from showing national news, current affairs, drama or comedy programming. In short, these channels are prevented from showing anything that people might actually want to watch and have to resort to screening international news, music content and other throwaway scraps to fill their airtime. Yet Australian taxpayers are paying over $300 million to enable these channels to broadcast digitally. Are they getting their money’s worth? Hardly. It is to the government’s shame that it refused to accept Senator Conroy’s amendment. Had it been accepted and his proposals implemented, there is no doubt that this would have had a positive effect on the number of Australian households making the switch to digital TV, which is after all our goal here. At present digital TV is in a parlous state. Although the government has stated again and again its commitment to rolling out digital services across the country, we have seen no firm action to bring this about. Obviously the current plan of action is not working, as evidenced by the fact that at present only about 10 per cent of Australian households have purchased the technology necessary to receive digital TV. That means the overwhelming majority of Australian homes are presently not even capable of receiving digital transmissions let alone worrying about what is being shown on these channels. No wonder Minister Coonan was forced to abandon the government’s original 2008 deadline for switching off analog transmission. If this had happened according to their stated schedule, nearly every home in the country would have been without a television. MAIN COMMITTEE What we need is an integrated plan involving incentives for people to convert and upgrade to the new digital technology, along with a relaxation of the current restrictions on digital content so that, when people do make the switch, there is actually something on television that they would want to watch. Otherwise, why would they bother spending the not insignificant amount of money necessary to upgrade? In other countries, such as the US and the UK, governments have recognised that the takeup of digital television will have an important overall benefit for the country-not least the economic advantage to be gained from the freeing-up of bandwidth-so they have made a financial commitment to help people upgrade to the new digital technology. Similarly, in these countries digital TV offers more than analog, making it a much more appealing option. If the government were really committed to the rollout of digital TV in Australia, they would be wise to follow the example set by the US and UK. At present they are all talk and no action. This government has already demonstrated its lack of vision and leadership on digital TV programming issues, specifically in relation to Fly TV and ABC Kids, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s youth oriented digital channels. For example, launched in 2001, Fly TV broadcast music, arts, skating and sports content between 6 pm and 6 am daily and was immensely popular with young people who were able to access it. Advertised through the main analog ABC channel, the existence of Fly TV was no doubt instrumental in some parents’ decisions to make the switch to digital, as the channel offered entertaining youth oriented and youth appropriate programming during the timeslots when young people most often watch TV, and without the inappropriate violent and sexual content which often pops up on commercial TV. Watched by around 300,000 young people per month, Fly TV had the potential to bring young viewers to digital TV and to establish digital TV as a key element of the viewing habits of tomorrow’s adults. Yet in 2003 Fly TV was forced to cease transmission after the government rejected the ABC’s application for an extra $250 million in funding over three years to further develop the digital channel. In short, Fly TV was forced to close because this government, which is allegedly so committed to digital television, was unable to see the benefit of introducing hundreds of thousands of young people to this new technology, unable to look past its ideological mistrust of the ABC and see how they were leading the way in digital TV programming. Well done! Of course, part of the reason for the government’s continuing support for restrictions on digital television content is that they do not wish to offend or upset the powerful media barons in this country who presently control the commercial market. They do not wish to make Mr Packer, Mr Stokes and, of course, our North American friends CanWest cranky by threatening the vast commercial television empires by allowing competitive broadcasting on digital channels. This desire to placate big business is understandable-after all, with an election coming up next year, the government can hardly afford to have these media gargantuans turned against them. But giving in to the wishes of existing television licence holders at the expense of digital TV’s proper development is just not on. It is not acceptable that the government should hamstring digital TV’s development as it has by refusing to allow digital channels to offer competitive content with analog channels simply to ensure the corporate cronies still love them when the election is finally announced. MAIN COMMITTEE It yet again demonstrates the lack of backbone possessed by this government that it has chosen not to stand up to the Packers of this world and, therefore, also not to implement the policy changes which are sorely needed if we are ever to see a full take-up of digital TV. Spinelessness aside, the government should at least be congratulated on taking action to bring broadcasting services in remote areas more in line with the services available in metropolitan areas, as this bill proposes to do. Any action which will increase the quantity and diversity of programming in our most poorly serviced areas will receive the support of Labor. Country people deserve the same quality of services as anybody else. We particularly support amendment (1), which allows that, where there are only two licensees in a designated remote licence area, one or both of these licensees may broadcast a third digital channel, increasing the diversity of programming. This proposed change has already led to an announcement by Golden West Network and WIN TV that they will launch a joint digital channel in Western Australia in 2007, and we can only hope that more remote licence holders will also choose to take up the third channel option. There are many areas of Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory in particular which would benefit from the availability of a third channel. Yet again, this bill does not go far enough in addressing the issues at stake. Certainly the changes to remote broadcasting rules may lead to a greater take-up of digital technology in these remote areas, which I suppose is at least a start in getting this technology into more homes throughout the country. But the government should be doing far more. It should be making digital TV the more appealing option by offering incentives to upgrade analog technology and allowing digital broadcasters to offer competitive content with current commercial channels. It should be standing up to the bullying of Australia’s media barons and acknowledging that the success of digital TV, and by extension the advancement of Australia’s technological development, is far more important than its own electoral fortunes, more important than keeping its media-owning mates on side. It should be demonstrating leadership on this issue rather than allowing itself to be led by people who have their own interests at heart and not the country’s. and Resources) (12.26 pm)-I would like to thank honourable members for their support of this bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask why the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources is summing up on this bill and not the minister representing him. He is in the main chamber at the moment where they are summing up and debating the bills on other aspects of broadcasting legislation. The members that have spoken to this bill have raised a range of issues regarding broader digital television matters, including the pace of digital take-up by consumers and the implementation of digital conversion. One thing that is quite disappointing is some of the comments from members opposite who do not seem to understand the issue at large. The general take-up of digital television in Australia has actually been quite good. The conversion to digital is the most fundamental change that the broadcasting industry has seen since the introduction of television itself some 50 years ago. This government is working hard to ensure the smooth introduction of digital television in Australia. We are committed to ensuring all Australian consumers have access to the new services that digital technology will bring into our homes. MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Dslam And Using That Are Able To Give People Access To Adsl2 That Is 25 Times Faster
302,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismMr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that over 95 per cent of Australians can now access at least one digital television service with the purchase of a set-top box or digital television. The government is encouraged by the most recent industry estimates that, at the end of June 2006, over 1.7 million digital television receivers had been supplied to retailers and installers. Around 48 per cent of these were supplied in the 12 months to June 2006, which represents a household take-up rate of around 20 per cent. These achievements are all down to the Howard government’s willingness to take the lead and to establish sound legislative frameworks to support the smooth introduction of digital television into Australia. The claims by members opposite that the take-up is lagging behind that in other countries is not true. Let me disabuse opposition members of the view that Australia lags behind other nations in switching off the analog system. In fact, Australia’s new target for switch-over of 2010 to 2012 aligns itself with most comparable countries. As you may be aware, Germany will be completed by 2011, France is aiming for 2011 region by region, the US is looking for a nationwide switch-off in February 2009 and the United Kingdom is switching off region by region between 2008 and 2012. So claims opposite that Australia is lagging behind in this approach are without any foundation when Australia is compared to other leading nations. But we do have a plan and, notwithstanding the considerable progress to date, the government continue to drive digital take-up. The Howard government have introduced legislation to comprehensively reform the media industry in Australia and to allow the Australian media sector to move from the old analog based regime into the dynamic new world of digital content. Under this legislation, a range of new digital services will be gradually introduced. The legislation provides that, from royal assent, national broadcasters will be able to provide an increased range of programming on their multichannels, and I am happy to note that the opposition agrees with this approach-something new for them. Commercial broadcasters will be able to provide a high-definition television multichannel from 2007 and commercial broadcasters will be able to provide a standard-definition television multichannel from 2009, with full multichannelling from analog switch-over. The legislation will also facilitate the allocation of two unassigned digital terrestrial channels throughout Australia, as soon as practical in 2007, for the new digital services that do not resemble traditional TV. The allocation of these channels for new and innovative digital services will contribute to diversity, provide extra content and services for viewers and potentially assist with the digital take-up. As part of the new framework, the Howard government is developing a digital action plan for release later this year, to expedite digital conversion and bring the simulcast period to an end. Increased digital take-up will also be facilitated by further public education and a range of other measures to facilitate conversion to digital television under the DAP. I note criticisms of the government over the progress of the passage of this bill. Since its introduction, unrelated amendments have been proposed to the bill by non-government parties. It is disappointing that this has resulted in delaying the framework for the introduction of new services to viewers in remote areas. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in your position as the member for Page you would be aware of how hard it is sometimes for people to get access to digital TV reception. This bill works largely towards improving services, so it is interesting to note that the opposition are the main people putting up the barriers each and every step of the way. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill provides a framework to implement the model agreed with WIN and Prime for the conversion of their commercial television broadcasting services in remote and regional Western Australia from analog to digital. The bill facilitates, as a part of the conversion model, the joint provision by WIN and Prime of a third digital commercial service under section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. For the first time this will provide viewers in nonmetropolitan Western Australia with a choice of programming commensurate with that in Perth by allowing the broadcasters to multichannel three digital services on a single channel, with an exemption from any high-definition television requirements that might be applied to remote areas. The Howard government is providing them with significant cost savings that will help to underpin the continued viability of the remote broadcasting services. This is in addition to the significant funding assistance of $19.36 million over eight years that the government is providing to WIN and Prime, under the regional equalisation plan, to further assist them with digital conversion in remote Western Australia. Broadcasters will have the option of commencing high-definition television services in the future should they desire to do so. The bill also extends the same benefits to the commercial broadcasters in the other remote licence area, remote Central and eastern Australia, should those broadcasters choose a similar digital conversion model for that market. REP assistance will also be made available. The debate and discussions on this bill have gone on for long enough, and therefore I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 9 October.

Various states and territories, however, subsequently expressed concern that under this legislation it is unclear whether they can lawfully transfer DNA profiles from their DNA databases to the Commonwealth. There is also concern about the lawfulness of the Commonwealth disclosing DNA profile information that it holds to the states and territories.

304,Mr Ruddock,"The purpose of the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Act 2001The Commonwealth never held these concerns. However, these amendments to the Crimes Act will clarify for the states and territories that the transfer of information for interjurisdictional DNA matching is lawful. These amendments will go thus some way to allaying the concerns of the states and territories and to encourage all corresponding law jurisdictions within Australia to commit to implementing interjurisdictional DNA profile matching. I commend the bill to the chamber. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (12.36 pm)-It is nice on occasion to see that the government has the same difficulties that we in opposition do with the confusion sometimes of these matters between the houses. I rise to speak on the Crimes Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006. This bill amends and clarifies part 1D of the Crimes Act to take account of concerns held by the state governments that they are currently not able to fully implement the The bill will hopefully be one of the last planks in the creation of the national DNA database-or the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database, as NCIDD stands forremoving one of the remaining legal obstacles to the creation of the database. The bill inserts a new provision into the Crimes Act which provides for the creation of the database, as well as making a number of other amendments in order to clarify various points of law and amend drafting errors. The database was one of several that CrimTrac was tasked with building when the agency was first established in 1998. The object was to create a new DNA database containing DNA profiles from all Australian jurisdictions and a database that could be accessed by Australian police across all jurisdictions. CrimTrac’s annual report describes the purpose of the database as providing: ... police with access to a national DNA database and the capability to conduct rapid, automated interjurisdiction and intra-jurisdiction DNA profile matching. The database contains samples of DNA taken from crime scenes and samples of DNA taken from criminals. The object, very basically, was to allow a police officer in Queensland to take a DNA sample from a crime scene, perform a search on the database and then discover, for instance, that his or her profile of DNA matched a profile that had been entered onto the database in South Australia or Victoria. The benefits of such a scheme are immediately obvious. More criminals will be caught, and that is of course a great comfort to the victims of crime and the family members who are left to support, care for and sometimes even grieve for them. Such schemes should deliver a better justice outcome as time goes by, in that fewer innocent people will be convicted of crimes they did not commit. The Labor Party supports this scheme. We are very enthusiastic about it, as it clearly has the potential to be of enormous benefit in the fight against crime. Properly used, it can become a key tool for law enforcement. Unfortunately, as with most of CrimTrac’s databases, it has got off to a rocky start. To be fair, I will note that the ANAO report into CrimTrac from 2004-05 found that the problems were mainly legislative in nature. By virtue of the fact that it attempts to be a national DNA database, it also has to navigate a minefield of differing legislation, memorandums of understanding and other agreements. MAIN COMMITTEE Currently, it is used by states for varying purposes. New South Wales, the Commonwealth, the ACT and Tasmania use the database but only for intrajurisdictional matching-that is, matching only within their jurisdictions. Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia use, to various degrees, interjurisdictional matching. However, as I have already said, the vision of the database as a truly national database has not yet been realised. The legislation before us today seeks to overcome one of the remaining legislative impediments to interjurisdictional data matching. A number of state governments currently hold reservations about the legality of the transfer of information from their databases to the national database-and vice versa-and whether information held by the states could be lawfully disclosed. The legal question, as it was put in the Senate committee report, was based on the status of the national database. Is it a Commonwealth database? Is it an amalgam of state and territory databases? The legislation before us today seeks to answer that question and to remove, hopefully, the last or one of the last legislative impediments to cross-jurisdictional data matching. As noted above, the legislation itself makes a number of changes to the Crimes Act to clarify the legislation and to make one substantive change to allow the presence of a police officer at forensic examinations where samples are gathered. The bill proposes to insert a new section 23YDACA-I can see a renumbering process having to be before us at some time in the future-into the Crimes Act. It is a provision which specifically allows for the creation of the national database, based on the integration of information resident on the Commonwealth DNA databases, either in whole or in part, and the state and territory DNA databases, again, either in whole or in part. The integration of the state, territory and Commonwealth databases and information contained on those databases is now specifically provided for in the legislation. The item also provides that the NCIDD may be accessed in part by state and Commonwealth oversight and by other authorities for the purpose of conducting an audit. While Labor agrees with the sentiment of this section, a problem with it was noted in a submission from the Privacy Commissioner of New South Wales during the committee process in that the word ‘audit’ was not wide enough to encompass the full range of activities for which the NCIDD may need to be accessed. The commissioner identified that their access of the database would be for the purposes of conducting an investigation rather than an audit. This leads to some confusion about whether such entities will be able to access the database. To that end, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has recommended an alteration to this section to ensure that it is clear that entities such as the privacy commissioner can access the database for reasons other than strictly to conduct audits. The bill makes a number of alterations to existing sections. These are minor items which alter various sections of the act-for example, to alter the phrase ‘DNA database system’ to ‘Commonwealth DNA database system’ and to clarify the distinction between the Commonwealth DNA database and the state and territory DNA databases. Finally, the bill proposes an amendment which would allow the presence of a prison officer while forensic samples are taken from a prisoner. Currently, the presence of constables, medical practitioners, dentists and, in certain cases, a legal representative is allowed. The move to allow for the presence of a prison officer during these procedures is sensible and, again, one that the Labor Party supports. MAIN COMMITTEE As this chamber might be aware, the bill has already been examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which, overall, endorsed the bill, stating in its report that the committee considered ‘the bill will successfully resolve any lingering legal impediments to the transfer of information to and from the database,’ subject of course to the enactment of complementary legislation by the state governments. Aside from supporting the bill, the legal and constitutional committee made only one further recommendation, which was to alter section 23YDACA(2). The problem with this section of the bill as it stood in the other place has already been touched upon in my speech: there was confusion as to whether or not oversight bodies could access the database for reasons other than conducting audits. Oversight bodies may have legitimate reasons to wish to access the database for oversight purposes which are not necessarily audits. As such, the committee recommended that the proposed subsection be amended to clarify the access rights for investigating agencies. This was a technical recommendation to ensure that the bill operates as it was intended rather than to alter the operation of the bill. It was agreed to and the government moved amendments in the committee stage in the other place to give effect to this recommendation. In conclusion, as I said at the start of my speech, the national database, when fully functional, will become an invaluable tool for law enforcement agencies across Australia. The Labor Party fully supports the creation of this database and looks forward to its full operation across all state and territory jurisdictions along with the Commonwealth. As such, Labor supports the bill and commends it to the House. support for the Crimes Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006 and for very good reasons. The bill demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to the fight against crime by making this facilitation. It will provide very valuable investigative information to law enforcement agencies right across Australia. I note that Australia will probably be light years ahead of the United States in relation to the sharing of information to enable us to better fight crime. I know that the states and territories have expressed some concerns about the sharing of this information and the legality under the current legislation. The government did not have that view, but to put the matter finally at rest we have this bill before the House today. This will ensure that interjurisdictional DNA profile matching can occur. A couple of years ago I took the trouble to satisfy myself that the security and integrity of these DNA databases was okay. I came away absolutely satisfied that that was the case. There were some concerns in the community at the time that DNA information stored by agencies could be used for purposes other than what they were put in place for. There were suggestions that, for example, if you had a person’s DNA, you would be able to work out what their medical risks were in the future and that insurance companies would be very interested in that sort of information. But I am indeed satisfied of the integrity of the databases that are held in the country today. I would in fact go further in relation to DNA databases. I have long been on the public record arguing for every person’s DNA in Australia to be recorded, to be available for use in relation to crime issues and also for identification. From time to time there are horrific road accidents, for example, or there are people who lose their mind and do not know who or MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Crimes Act Amendment Forensic Procedures Bill No 1 2006
305,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.45 Pm),"I will be short in my comments. There is bipartisanwhere they are. A national DNA database could well be used to identify those people and put their identification beyond doubt. Australia, perhaps, is not quite ready for that yet, but the time will come. When it comes, it will be a very valuable tool for the police forces of Australia. I know the police forces would like to see it and strongly support it right now. I think the community is turning around. They are beginning to realise that these sorts of databases do not get misused. They are used for the purposes that they were designed for. I certainly wanted to add my support to this bill. I am very much in favour of our commitment to fighting crime through these modern scientific methods. Debate interrupted. Sitting suspended from 12.49 pm to 4.03 pm Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006. This bill, as we have heard, sets out to ensure that interjurisdictional DNA profile matching using the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database, The bill addresses specific impediments raised by states and territories which have previously delayed complete interjurisdictional DNA profile matching. The main problem is that, under current legislation, states and territories cannot transfer DNA profiles from their individual DNA databases to the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth cannot disclose DNA profile information that it holds to the states and territories. Clearly, this is a ridiculous situation and something that needs to be addressed, and I am very pleased it will be addressed in this particular bill. Other amendments will seek to ensure that the Commonwealth DNA database is clearly distinguished from the various state and territory databases. The bill will also allow prison officers to be present if the law of the relevant state or territory allows or requires such a presence while a forensic procedure is carried out on a suspect. This will ensure the safety and security of those who carry out forensic procedures. This is a sensible measure and one that Labor obviously supports. In essence, the bill seeks to create the legislative framework for the realisation of a truly national DNA database and specifically aims to remove any outstanding barriers to a fully functional, fully integrated national DNA profiling system. The establishment of such a national system is, sadly, long overdue. For example, the agency which will have carriage of the national database, CrimTrac, was conceived some six years ago. The National Exchange of Police Information, the NEPI, which was the predecessor of CrimTrac, was established in March 1990 during an agreement signed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The NEPI’s aims were to provide cost-effective services for the improvement of policing across Australia, acknowledging that our geography and federal system of governance provide significant challenges for law enforcement agencies. The NEPI’s successor, CrimTrac, built on the earlier success of this national resource and information sharing arrangement with access to DNA samples-a science which has seen such a dramatic boom in technology over the past decade or so-which are seen as a key part of its operations. CrimTrac’s role is to support Australia’s police services through the provision of information and investigative tools that will accelerate the identification of suspects of crimes, clear MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Ncidd Due To Legal Issues Surrounding The Sharing And Transfer Of Data
306,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (4.03 Pm),"I rise to speak to the Crimes Act Amendment (Forensicthe innocent, shorten crime investigation times and result in higher clearance rates. Obviously, higher clearance rates mean that many of the crimes that are unsolved at the moment will actually be solved because we will be able to go back, use previous DNA information and nab some suspects who we thought had committed crimes that we had not actually been able to pin on them in the past. SoI think this is a very positive move. The agency is underpinned by an intergovernmental agreement signed by the Commonwealth Minister for Justice and Customs and all police ministers across Australia. The establishment of a National Criminal Investigation DNA Database as part of CrimTrac’s activities was intended to facilitate access for all police forces to DNA samples from interstate prisoners or unsolved crime scenes. Importantly, as stated in CrimTrac’s 2005-06 annual report, the 1988. Each profile entered onto the NCIDD has a unique identifier which cannot be linked by CrimTrac to information that will identify an individual. The annual report states: DNA person profiles are automatically removed from NCIDD when predetermined destruction dates are specified on the system. The profiles associated with an index are set out in the legislation: for example, crime scene, offender, or suspect. Only the forensic laboratory in the police agency that supplied the identifier can identify individual names and circumstances associated with the profile. No trace of the profile or associated match results remain on the database. Unfortunately, movement towards the provisions in this bill before the House has been stymied, I believe, because of a lack of ministerial interest at a federal level. It is well known that when the current immigration minister, Senator Vanstone, left the justice ministry, she left the portfolio in a total shambles. Apart from a fondness for the canine Customs personnel, she showed little interest in the portfolio and its affairs were left in total disarray. Unfortunately, the move towards comprehensive national DNA profiling and data sharing was a victim of Senator Vanstone’s lack of interest and failure to provide leadership to the states on these very important issues. The sharing of DNA profiles between jurisdictions can be effective in both incriminating and, of course, exonerating suspects. When CrimTrac was officially launched, it was announced: The technology and hardware needed to set-up the DNA database is now on-line and operational. DNA samples in most States and Territories are now being taken and will be loaded onto the database in coming weeks. The system is expected to hold about 25,000 DNA profiles in the first year. This, of course, is yet to pass. Delays persist with implementing the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database because of the lack of uniformity throughout Australia and legislation and procedures governing DNA. It is currently used by the states for varying purposes. The Commonwealth, the ACT, New South Wales and Tasmania use the NCIDD but only for intrajurisdictional matching. Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland use interjurisdictional matching to various degrees. There are still differences amongst the states and territories in the categorisation of DNA samples, the powers of police to take samples and the rules for matching and retaining samples. This can cause problems in court if DNA evidence is matched across borders. Part 1D of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 deals with forensic procedures, particularly the use of DNA material for law enforcement purposes. It was inserted into the Crimes MAIN COMMITTEE Act in 1998 and was based on the model forensic provisions developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, the McCOC, of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The primary purpose of part 1D is to regulate the collection, storage and use of DNA samples and profiles. An independent review of part 1D of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 was conducted and published in March 2003. It was chaired by Tom Sherman AO, previously the Australian Government Solicitor and the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. The other members of the review were the federal Privacy Commissioner, the Senior Assistant Ombudsman, the General Manager of the Forensic Services Branch of the Australian Federal Police and the Deputy Director of the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The 2003 report concluded: The major deficiency identified by the Review is that the national system is not yet operational and only one jurisdiction (NSW) had loaded profiles onto the relevant CrimTrac database known as the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD). The Review calls for redoubled efforts on the part of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories to move quickly to negotiate the relevant arrangements which are necessary to make the system fully operational. As previous speakers on this side have made clear, Labor support the scheme and we welcome it. My home state, Western Australia, has been an enthusiastic supporter of the scheme and, I am proud to say, an early pioneer of intrajurisdictional matching. Indeed, when Western Australia and Queensland linked their DNA databases on 10 June last year, DNA from 14 unsolved crimes in Queensland was matched within days to DNA from Western Australia, allowing police to review the crimes and make arrests. Earlier this year it was reported that WA have some 55,000 DNA samples on the state database and that DNA matching within the state and with Queensland led to charges being laid for 1,213 unsolved crimes since July 2002. Yes, we caught up with those crafty Queenslanders when they snuck off home, and it was great to see that particular process in use. Those crimes were also of a very serious nature. They included rape, serious assault and offences that had remained unsolved for more than a decade. Western Australia continues to lead the way in DNA technology. Members may be interested to know that last year the Western Australian government, in an Australian first, distributed DNA kits to Perth bus drivers to help solve crimes on Perth’s buses. Drivers are able to capture evidence to help identify and prosecute the bus louts responsible for assaults on drivers. I know there have been some legislative hurdles in various states which have delayed the implementation of the database, but quite frankly this is a situation that required national leadership from the federal government and, as I have said, for a period at least, that was sorely lacking. I am concerned that the federal government has had the audacity to criticise various states for the delay. That really takes some front. After all, seven years after it was announced that we would have a national missing persons database, the federal government has failed to deliver on this desperately needed initiative. I refer to an editorial in the Age newspaper in July about the detention of Ms Cornelia Rau. The editorial states: It seems we have learned little from the debacle that so recently caused national shame, the detention of Cornelia Rau. Ms Rau had been placed on a missing persons register in August 2004 and in NovemMAIN COMMITTEE ber that year NSW police launched an appeal to locate her. Even with all this publicity, she remained incarcerated in Baxter Detention Centre for 10 months. The Palmer inquiry into her case recommended the establishment of a national missing persons database. There has been little progress towards implementing this. It is unforgivable that, in the 21st century when technology makes it possible to track people and events across the globe, a further 49 bodies await identification in Victoria while families are left to wonder what has become of one of their own. I do not need to remind the House that the immigration minister and the department were hardly revealed in good light by the Rau affair. The priorities of the federal government are really quite amazing. On one hand we are told by the industry minister that in just 10 years time some Australians could be waking up next door to a nuclear reactor. We all know that it took just a matter of months after the 2004 election for the Howard government to fundamentally alter the constitutional tradition of states rights with its incorporation of industrial relations under the Corporations Act. Yet when it comes to an issue such as the national missing persons database, implementing a national system that might actually do some good, it is too hard. Australia’s population is highly mobile, as we see today as workers move around the country to take advantage of economic opportunities. This means that our criminals are mobile too. Even as far back as the 1880s the Kelly Gang operated across state borders, demonstrating the need for cooperation between states. Well-known criminals have operated in many states across the country. The institutional framework for forensic information as foreshadowed in this bill will ensure that police can become more effective. This bill will improve the effectiveness of policing in Australia and should be supported. I commend the bill to the House. Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006. I think that most Australiansindeed, most people throughout the world-recognise that the world of crime fighting is moving forward at a frenetic pace. It is encouraging and also exciting to see massive steps being taken in the analysis of crime scenes and evidence that are greatly improving the ability of crime fighting organisations to accurately identify perpetrators and to prosecute them in court. DNA profiling is one such development. As noted on the Australian government’s CrimTrac website: DNA profiling is the single most important advance in police investigation techniques since the development of fingerprint classification systems in the late nineteenth century. The use of DNA in criminal investigations gives investigators an additional string to their bows in being able to more accurately pinpoint and identify perpetrators and then follow through to have them found guilty in court. I was impressed by the comments made by the honourable member for Swan about the matching of the databases of Queensland and Western Australia and how a large number of offenders were apprehended as a result of the sharing of those databases. Sharing information among the states and between the states and the Commonwealth also has obvious advantages in identifying criminals who may lead a transient lifestyle and have committed offences around the country. I suspect that for too long we have looked at the individual states and considered them to be islands, whereas, as the member for Swan pointed out, we have a highly mobile population. One could imagine that those who wished to fall foul of MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Ncidd May Be Implemented By All Australian Jurisdictions
307,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (4.16 Pm),"I am pleased to be able to join the debate on the Crimesthe law and those who wished to commit offences would usually not confine those offences to one jurisdiction. The states raise concern that current legislation may not adequately support the exchange of the DNA data with respect to individuals. That was not a concern that the Commonwealth had. However, we see this issue as being of national importance. If we are going to have a proper level of DNA sharing, what ought to happen is that all jurisdictions in the country must be happy with the law as it currently is. Consequently, the bill being discussed here today will help to reinforce the ability to exchange the DNA data of individuals. It will also give the state and Commonwealth authorities the confidence that the information sharing process will withstand any court challenge. Commonwealth crime fighting authorities store their DNA records in the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database, called NCIDD. Each of the states and territories also has their own databases. The fear expressed by the states is that, under the current legislation, it is not clear whether the data exchange is allowable. As I said, that was not a concern of the Commonwealth, but it would certainly be a bizarre situation if the individual states were not able to share this information which, in many cases, will aid in the solving of crimes that were unsolved for a very considerable period of time. It is important to recognise the rights of individuals, and these legislative hiccups as far as the states are concerned come hand in hand with an industry that is still in its relative infancy. It is interesting to note that DNA fingerprinting was first used to solve a crime in 1985 in England, just 21 years ago. I do not profess to know all the ins and outs of the science of DNA and DNA matching but, as I understand it, it involves a process by which a human’s individual genetic blueprint is able to be extracted and analysed. I am advised that every individual is different and in 1987, police in the United Kingdom collected DNA samples from over 5,000 men to eventually identify a 17-year-old as the perpetrator of a double rape-murder. In Australia, it is only 17 years since DNA was first used to solve a crime. That was in 1989, when such scientific evidence was used in a court here in the Australian Capital Territory to convict a man accused of sexual assault. The defendant had changed his story several times, first claiming he was not anywhere near the victim when the attack took place and then, following the collection and analysis of DNA evidence, saying that the contact was consensual. In that year, in Victoria, police used this technology to identify a man who raped 16 women over a four-year period. When confronted with this evidence, the perpetrator confessed to these crimes. These powerful stories are testament to the value of DNA profiling as a crime-fighting tool. It is a tool that all police and crime-fighting authorities around Australia now have at their disposal. It is of great assistance that the DNA information from convicted criminals is able to be stored, with this valuable information accessed to identify those who have previously been convicted and who may have subsequently reoffended. This, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, will be of interest to you because it proved valuable in 1989 when Victorian police were able to identify the perpetrator of an offence through the use of a DNA database. A search of the database identified the man and helped lead to his conviction, even though he had previously not even been a suspect with respect to that crime. The use of DNA fingerprinting is also able to prove innocence, and I think it is important to look at this in a balanced way. Also in 1989, in the United States of America, DNA was used MAIN COMMITTEE for the first time to clear a man of wrongdoing after he had already been tried and convicted in the courts for rape. He had served eight years of a 25-year sentence, but he was released and able to return to life in the community. I do not think society was actually able to give him his eight years back, but certainly it was good that he was not forced to serve the balance of the 25 years. It would be a shame if such stories of vindication as well as of successful prosecution could be derailed on legal technicalities. That is why it is really important to make sure that all of the Australian jurisdictions are happy that the law meets their ability to exchange DNA, and the Australian government has been pleased to cooperate with the states. We did not see that the problem was there, but there is a problem if the states feel that the law does not permit them to exchange DNA. The Crimes Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006 will redress the concerns of the states. It is in the best interests of all concerned that legislation that governs the use of DNA information is able to keep pace with the needs of rapidly developing crime-fighting methods. This is an important piece of legislation. I am pleased that it does enjoy the support of members on both sides of the House and I am very pleased to be able to commend this bill to the Main Committee. Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006. I believe it is very important to provide our police with the best and most modern tools available, because that is what the community expects of us. I say that for a number of reasons, not least for the fact that for the six or seven years prior to coming to this place I spent much of my time representing police officers from each of the states and territories, including the AFP. That work was not just in relation to industrial relations; it was in relation to ensuring that the issues of the police profession were acknowledged and in pursuing the best and most appropriate tools for our working police officers to ensure that they were in the best position possible to protect the community, as they are so charged to do. As all members would be aware, the community expectation of our police has certainly changed. We have seen that come out of a raft of inquiries, whether in respect of integrity or whatever. Certainly the expectation that the community have of their police force to keep them safe is at an all-time high. The community, quite frankly, are not unreasonable in that expectation and it falls on government to actually make sure that their police forces are equipped with the most modern tools of the trade. I do not believe that is unreasonable. In my first speech, which I delivered in this House some 18 months ago, I made the point that, whilst law and order are ostensibly state and territory based issues, there are certainly contemporary grounds now for the Commonwealth to become more involved both in respect of coordination and in respect of providing resources. The facts are that criminals know no bounds. They do not know anything about geographical boundaries. As a matter of fact, they will move conveniently from one jurisdiction to another. Therefore, it is appropriate that the Commonwealth does have a role in coordinating and assisting state and territory jurisdictions in the administration of the respective criminal acts and in making sure that the police officers who are defending the communities across the Commonwealth are adequately provided with the resources to do the job in a contemporary society. The purpose of this bill before the Main Committee is to amend the Crimes Act to ensure that interjurisdictional DNA profile matching, using the National Criminal Investigation DNA MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Ncidd Does Not Contain Personal Information As Defined In The Commonwealth Privacy Act

As you have heard from various speakers before me, Mr Deputy Speaker, forensic sampling has become a critical tool of modern policing. Many Australians watch crime shows now with some regularity and they would know only too well that solving crimes these days tends to have a fair bit to do with the collection and analysis of forensic data. While the process in real life policing throughout the country may differ slightly from what you might see on CSI and other programs, nevertheless, from my experience and involvement with the various police forces, I know the critical nature of access to forensic data in resolving crimes. There are some doubts about the ability of the current legislation to allow the sharing and transfer of data between state and territory databases and the Commonwealth. That is regrettable. I do not think any particular parties set out to instil these differences. But provided there is some doubt in it-and that does ensure that there is less reliance on the use of the national database-that is not good for policing and it is certainly not good for communities. Naturally, this would serve to be a particularly large impediment across jurisdictions in DNA data matching, particularly if we are talking about admissibility in terms of the way data is collected, how it is analysed and therefore stored in the database, and whether it is admissible in certain jurisdictions. I am sure that all members are aware of CrimTrac. CrimTrac is a Commonwealth agency responsible for a number of programs designed to provide national policing information services, investigation tools and national criminal history record checks. CrimTrac is also charged to manage the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database. Along with other members of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, I had the opportunity to visit CrimTrac. As I prefaced in my remarks, I have had considerable involvement with the respective policing agencies across this country and I have to say that that visit did open my eyes in terms of the resources we have in CrimTrac. CrimTrac, under its current CEO, Ben McDevitt, provides policing with a very professional capability. It certainly has a significant and powerful computer capability, but in terms of being able to deliver on results, I have to say that this organisation is probably second to none. CrimTrac provides support to Australian law enforcement generally, regardless of jurisdictions. Through the development, delivery and maintenance of modern, high-quality rapid response, electronic policing information and investigative tools, it has achieved much, and through cooperation and collaborative partnering with the various police forces that operate as stakeholders throughout the country. The principal system that is operated by CrimTrac is the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database, which is subject to these matters before us. In addition to that there is the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System, the CrimTrac Police Reference System and the National Criminal History Record Checking Services. These are extraordinarily powerful tools in terms of contemporary policing. While the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database got off to a very slow start-and it will not help any of us to start pointing a finger at state or territory jurisdictions-I have to say it has been proving its worth, and we are seeing that in terms of the records that are now being collected and used. As at June 2005, there were more than 152,000 records on the database. There were more than 41,000 crime scene records, 38,000 offender or serious offender records, nearly 59,000 suspect records and more than 14,000 records offered by volunteersMAIN COMMITTEE which is always very important when eliminating suspects. Believe it or not, people sometimes are persuaded to come along and volunteer DNA for the database for that very purpose. With each additional record, the database becomes a more important tool in policing. That is why the changes before us today are so important. It is not so much that it is going to be managed by the Commonwealth-and bear in mind that the Commonwealth did fund the establishment of the DNA database to the tune of about $50 million-but to some extent this is the Commonwealth fulfilling a responsibility in terms of law and order. It is not that it is a responsibility imposed on the Commonwealth through the Constitution, of course, but, as I said earlier, the nature of criminality these days means that it does not know geographical boundaries. We do need to have the most modern tools available to our police if they are to be able to do their work, which is to protect the communities they are charged to serve. As I mentioned earlier, in dealing with the interjurisdictional nature of collecting this forensic data, it is regrettable that it has got off to a slow start. I do not know if there are figures available about how many cases have possibly been jeopardised because of that, in terms of apprehending serious offenders, but I dare say that if the system is not working to the satisfaction of all stakeholders-and that is each of the states and territories and the Commonwealth-then the system is not working at all. This amendment bill before us today does put that beyond doubt, certainly to the satisfaction of each of the states and territories, which has to be a very good thing for criminal justice throughout this country. The bill before us today clarifies the points that have been raised by some of the states and territories, and I think it does now move to put it beyond doubt. The object of the bill is to remove any impediment to the creation and use of the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database. I think it should be understood how this database actually works. This is not about the Commonwealth making these checks and identifying from the analysis criminals or discounting criminal activity from various people. The Commonwealth is managing a national database-a collection of state DNA databases, if you like. A state or territory police jurisdiction will be capable of accessing the database to see whether there is a match. If there is a match, they will be directed to which state or territory the match lines up with. That is where it is important. This is not about the Commonwealth divulging information on people; it is about providing a mechanism by which information can be matched with the states. It is very important that we have some standardisation in the collection and maintenance of this data to ensure a reasonably clear passage in the matching process but, more importantly, as we travel further down the track, it is important in relation to the admissibility of evidence in courts of criminal jurisdiction. As most people would be aware, there are going to be protections for material that is collected on this database. That material is subject to the privacy provisions, but those provisions will now apply across each of the databases that feed material into the national collection system. I have said here and in other forums that we, the Commonwealth parliament, cannot take our eyes off law enforcement simply because it is predominantly a state or territory matter. We have an obligation to provide a degree of coordination, as the Commonwealth has done in this case. I believe this serves as a good example of what we can do effectively in law enforcement. I think we have a very good track record when it comes to what is able to be achieved in respect of national fingerprinting. I think that works and serves policing throughMAIN COMMITTEE out Australia very well. What is being achieved through this amendment and by putting beyond doubt the impediments in the existing legislation will prove to be very good for law enforcement generally throughout Australia. In the same way as we expect that for occupations to be able to compete in a very competitive world they need to have the best available resources, I think it falls to us to ensure that that also applies to law enforcement and policing. That should apply across jurisdictions. I am happy that the minister has joined us for this latter part of the conversation. I believe this bill serves the Commonwealth well. I think it has demonstrated that the Commonwealth does have a significant role in law enforcement. As I said earlier, the Commonwealth committed $50 million to initiate this national DNA database. Despite the fact that the development of the database has been slow and has had a long gestation period in terms of being utilised by each of the states and territories, it has nevertheless provided the police services throughout the states and the Commonwealth with a second-to-none crime fighting tool which, quite frankly, will prove to be of significant benefit to law enforcement agencies in this country. It is important that we have consistent rules in establishing the collection of the forensic material. The way we collect material is important, and so is the way it is going to be admissible in the state or criminal jurisdictions but, more than that, this is a very solid example of what can be achieved through federal and state cooperation. With that, I commend this piece of legislation. This amendment bill puts beyond doubt what was in the minds of those who had the foresight back in 1998, I think, to devise this as a project and who then, in 2000, moved towards the development of the model legislation. It is regrettable that the model legislation was not picked up in each of the state and territory jurisdictions in the way that the state, territory and Commonwealth ministers agreed initially, but I think this actually does now remove those impediments. This is an example of what we can do through cooperation. This is a very positive example of the Commonwealth’s role, which I think has to be seen as a growing role, in law enforcement across the country. Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006. As speakers have previously outlined, the purpose of this bill is simple enough: to ensure that interjurisdictional DNA profile matching using the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database, or the NCIDD, can be implemented across all of the jurisdictions in Australia rather than having disparate systems between the Australian government and the various state and territory governments. The principal features of this will be expanding the access of the state and territory officials to the lation with these other jurisdictions and clarifying that ministerial arrangements can also deal with the transmission of information to and from the database. My teenage children tell me that DNA is a vital thing these days-they see it so much on TV. It is interesting to note that a quick search in the media shows that there is quite a bit of information in the public arena about cases that are being solved, current cases and even old cases, here in Australia. In the Glebe morgue, for example, there are literally boxes and boxes of bones from people that have been found, and they are now trying to match them with the 400 long-term missing persons in New South Wales. In Western Australia they are even using DNA to try and track down stolen sheep, which is perhaps something that was not envisaged. MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Ncidd Does Not Contain Personal Information As Defined In The Commonwealth Privacy Act
309,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (4.41 Pm),"I rise today to briefly speak on the Crimes ActMore importantly in terms of the power of this tool for policing and solving crime, reports out of the UK talking about new techniques to recover quite poor quality DNA samples are predicting that they will have a 15 per cent increase in closure rates in cases with these new DNA techniques. The agencies there are dealing with some 130,000 cases every year using DNA profile testing. I would like to move on from that, though, and talk about why this is important in the community. In almost every survey that I send out in the electorate of Wakefield or when I have community information stands in the shopping centres in Elizabeth, Craigmore and Munno Para, the consistent theme that comes back from the electors and the people of Wakefield is that they are concerned by the levels of crime in their community. They are looking for leadership and action from the government. They do not particularly care what level of government, but what they want to see is things to make them safer in their community and in their homes. It is interesting to note that just today Adelaide’s paper, The Advertiser, has an article talking about a shortage of experienced police officers affecting the force’s ability to investigate crimes. It says that the retention of officers with experience is even more important than the recent round trying to recruit new officers from overseas. What the public expect to see is consistency from government in their approach to policing. That is why it was disappointing earlier this year to see that the state government were starting to talk about a three per cent to four per cent cut of some $20 million to the police budget as part of their well-overdue state budget. In the end that did not eventuate, but there was a significant period of uncertainty, which is of great concern to the electors of Wakefield, particularly if we look at some of the statistics on crime rates. Despite boasts about falling crime rates, in figures that have been prepared by the Office of Crime Statistics and Research, you can see that between 2001 and 2005 in South Australia sexual offences increased by 8.8 per cent, offences against good order increased by 19.2 per cent and driving offences increased by 31.3 per cent. There has also been information around about the fact that the reporting of many of the statistics has been changed to put a more positive spin on them. But the fact that people continue to tell me that their biggest concerns are crime and safety in their home says that these are something that all levels of government need to be working together on. In that regard, it was disappointing to see that one of the first things the state Labor government did when they came to power was scrap the Crime Prevention Program, which was a very successful program implemented by the previous government. I am glad to see that, from an Australian government perspective, we have continued and in fact expanded our National Community Crime Prevention Program. I was very pleased just recently to go to one of the local primary schools in Elizabeth, along with an organisation called Good Beginnings, to announce a $498,000 program under the Community Crime Prevention Program to look at early intervention with families to keep kids connected with families and learning so that we reduce the likelihood of people becoming involved in crime. From a federal perspective, we have also maintained the very successful Tough on Drugs program, which has seen a large fall in hard drugs like heroin, and a large awareness program for people. Anyone that you talk to about crime will very quickly make the link between the use of drugs in our community and criminal activity. Likewise, I notice that, in our spending on police at a federal level, the Federal Police budget has gone from $192 million when we MAIN COMMITTEE came to office to over $816 million this year. It shows the clear leadership that this government is looking to have in providing security and safety for our people. So there are a range of areas of concern-hoon driving, drugs, speeding and safety in the home-but prevention is probably one of the most important things. It is notable that this government is again trying to take the lead, even in things like the family relationship centres, which are trying to build stronger families and which have the flow-on effect of providing the sort of environment that our young people need to steer them away from the involvement in drugs and crime that leads to some of these statistics later in life. I support this bill because it is yet another example of the cooperation that needs to exist between levels of government and of leadership from the Commonwealth government in making sure we have processes that give our police forces at whichever level every tool that they need to successfully prosecute crime and make communities around Australia, and particularly in the electorate of Wakefield, safer. those members who have participated in this debate on the Crimes Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006, particularly the members for Gellibrand, Herbert, Swan, Fisher, Werriwa and Wakefield. CanI just say, in relation to the contribution from my friend the member for Wakefield, how much I appreciated his insightful comments about what was happening in his electorate and the relevance of these matters not only to law enforcement but also to the active role the Commonwealth is pursuing in dealing with issues of serious criminality. The commendation that he made about the work of our Australian Federal Police is something that I will pass on to the commissioner when I see him. The primary purpose of this bill of course is to address specific impediments raised by the states and territories that have prevented the exchange of DNA profiles on a national basis. I think it is very important that we have harmonisation of laws across the Commonwealth. While these matters have relied substantially on the way in which states and territories have implemented arrangements for DNA profile matching, these amendments are designed to allay the concern that the states and territories have and to encourage all jurisdictions to commit to interjurisdictional matching. The amendments address, amongst other things, the recommendations contained in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s report, and I wish to briefly record my own appreciation for the work of the committee and to thank them. The intent of this bill was to always grant access to states and territories to the relevant DNA information held and to ensure that officials authorised under relevant state and territory law would have access, not just officials with an audit role. The government’s amendments have removed the word ‘audit’ from the text of the bill, giving effect to that policy objective. The government’s amendments also clarified the intent of the legislation that state and territory databases remain subject to the control of the relevant state or territory. The amendments address the issues raised by states and territories and do not make substantive changes to the way in which DNA profiles will be used, accessed or controlled. The government’s amendments also change the situations in which DNA profile matching is allowed in order to mirror other jurisdictions’ matching tables and to remove any unnecessary restrictions on the matching of DNA of volunteers for unlimited purposes.

310,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (4.48 pm)-in reply-I first thank allposes also allow for DNA from suspects to be matched against DNA obtained from suspects at other times. Therefore, these changes implement the eight recommendations of the independent review of part 1D of the Crimes Act by Tom Sherman AO in 2003. Obviously, I am delighted at the support that has been given to the measure. I think it is a very important contribution to our continuing program of law reform in the area of criminal detection and apprehension and, as I said earlier, I thank all members for their contribution to the bill and commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Skills for the Future Debate resumed from 12 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (4.53 pm)-I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening in response to the Prime Ministerial statement to the parliament, Skills for the Future. It is certainly welcome that the Prime Minister has turned his attention to the issue of the skills crisis that has been affecting this country for quite a while now. Indeed, as has been indicated on a number of occasions, particular skills categories have been on the skills shortage list for nine out of the last 10 years. On top of that, ongoing warnings have been provided by the Reserve Bank almost each year for the past five years about the impact that that skills crisis was having on the economy, and in particular the role that it was playing in contributing to the increase in interest rates-indeed, three consecutive increases to date since the election and seven on the run. It is, no doubt, one of the most important challenges facing the nation and I note that the Prime Minister, as a background to his announcement, outlined that he thought the problem was that the labour market is the strongest it has been in generations and what we were suffering is the sort of problem we want to have because the economy is going so well. The unemployment rate, as it is measured, is so low it is a predictable problem, and in fact it is not really a problem but certainly something the government had finally decided to turn its attention to. I want to take issue with a few of the presumptions in the backgrounding that the Prime Minister provided in his statement. In particular, it is true that the overall unemployment levels have dropped, but this ignores the fact that there are within those figures categories of people who continue to experience high unemployment. For example, in the Illawarra region, which I represent, there have consistently been general unemployment figures of double the national average rate. Sadly, we have not seen a great improvement in that situation over the time that the Prime Minister has trumpeted the achievements of his government in the economy. Even more damning and more concerning is the fact that, in the last recorded figures on youth unemployment, youth unemployment in the Illawarra region hit 40 per cent for the first time. That is an unacceptable level of unemployment amongst our young people. It is cerMAIN COMMITTEE tainly something that concerns the parents of my constituents, who are concerned about the future for their young people. It is true that the Prime Minister can point to general averaged-out improvements in unemployment, though even there we could have an argument about the changes that were made to how we measure unemployment and whether work for one hour a fortnight really constitutes employment. But putting that aside, even if we presume that the average has hit that level, the figures ignore the fact that there are significant pockets of people who are not getting the benefits of the good times of the economy. It is incumbent on the government to address that. I profoundly believe that a government experiencing good times as well as bad should not just sit back and say, ‘Well, that’s tremendous. Everyone is doing fine.’ It has the responsibility to identify those who are missing out even in those circumstances and find ways to assist those people to be part of the good economic times. The statement that the Prime Minister made on Skills for the Future is welcome in that it addresses some of the issues for mature age people in the workforce, who may want to upskill. There is no denying that that is a useful thing to do, but it does not particularly address or target the issues in regional areas that have not experienced the sorts of growth that we might see in states such as Western Australia and Queensland and it certainly does not address the issues faced by many young people who are still locked out of those employment opportunities. I make that point because it has been very frustrating to me personally-as I know it has been to the Labor Party generally-that the Prime Minister has consistently refused to acknowledge that there was a problem. Having been a TAFE teacher for seven years of my life, before coming into this place, and having had sons in the age group looking for work, it is certainly something that has been consistently at the front of my mind. In March 2005, when there was a debate going on about the skills crisis in the country, the Prime Minister responded to a question asked by the shadow minister for education about the skills crisis. The Prime Minister said: ... I have absolutely no intention of embracing this absurd rhetoric-which is quite false, when you actually look at the increase that has occurred-that there is some kind of skills crisis. In March 2005, the Prime Minister was saying that it was all rhetoric, that it was absurd, that there was no problem. Was it a one-off brain snap? In March 2005 did he perhaps find himself anticipating an Easter break and perhaps not being on the ball in the game? No. He repeated it again, in September this year. He obviously continued with the view for at least 18 months. He said: AllI ask is that you not mistake boiler-plate rhetoric about a skills crisis ... with anything approaching actual policy insight. In September this year, only a month ago, we had the Prime Minister saying that we should not mistake rhetoric and concerns on this side of the House with any real policy imperativethat there was not a crisis, that there was not anything that had to be addressed. You can imagine how gobsmacked I was when this non-problem had $800 million thrown at it! That is what we saw from the Prime Minister’s statement to the House, which we are addressing today. According to the Prime Minister’s own definition, that is $800 million to fix a non-existent crisis-probably a first for any government. MAIN COMMITTEE So, to me, what that reflected was that the Prime Minister well knew that the reality out there in communities was that people knew there was a skills crisis. So did businessesindeed, I have had several representations in my local areas from the Australian Industry Group talking about exactly that problem. I look back over several surveys of small businesses, done by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, about what the key significant issues were for them and what they felt were the key blockages to business expanding, and they have consistently identified, for at least the last four years, that the major issue for them was access to a skilled workforce. Obviously all of those voices, including the voice of the Labor Party, made it clear to the Prime Minister that he could not continue to dismiss the issue as ‘boilerplate rhetoric’, but had to acknowledge that it had real bite in the community and that, in fact, people were seeing the reality of it on the ground and there had to be something done about it. It is important to address the issue, not only because of the real human stories behind families where there is insufficient work or there are young people who are unable to access work and make a start in a career but also because it is fundamental to our economy. That has been the message of the Reserve Bank consistently-in particular, the impact that it has on productivity growth. We had a pretty amazing record under the Hawke-Keating governments of achieving really significant-and, in fact, world-leading-productivity improvements and we have seen those basically disappear over the last 10 years. We have here a challenge, in the human stories of people in communities that have not been able to access the growth that has happened in the economy. They are saying: ‘We need our young people in jobs. We need our mature age workers who were made redundant through restructuring to be able to access jobs.’ Then we have had organisations like the AiG, the ACCI and the Reserve Bank saying the biggest blockage to our future expansion is the inability to access the skilled staff that we require and to improve productivity through upskilling staff. The frustration that we felt, I have no doubt, they were feeling. You only had to look at the number of times they kept putting reports out as a signal to the government to say: ‘We think this is important. For goodness sake, do something about it. It is not good enough that you have cut the funding through TAFE significantly-in fact, quite dramatically-up until 2000 and, begrudgingly and very gradually, reinstated some of it since 2000. Your brain-snap campaign ideas, such as Australian technical colleges, are too little, too slow and unlikely to really address the problems we are facing.’ So what we had was an accumulation of all those circumstances. The Prime Minister finally had to acknowledge that there was a problem and that he had to do something about it. So he gives us $800 million to fix a crisis that he has been denying for many years. Ms Macklin-Is still denying. In the proposal that the Prime Minister put forward, obviously the most significantly funded item is the provision of vouchers to people over the age of 25 who have not completed a HSC to go and get themselves literacy and numeracy training. I have to say-and on this comment I hope I am wrong, but I doubt I am-if somebody is out there in a job and is over 25, I very much doubt that they are going to be rushing to the government for a voucher to go and do some literacy and numeracy training at TAFE. I think that that is a bit pie in the sky. I MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Ncidd Aligning The Permissible Matching Of Dna Profiles Under The Commonwealth Legis
311,Ms Bird,"Indeed, the shadow minister is quite right-which he is still denying.think if they were going to provide a voucher they would have been better off providing a voucher that could be utilised for skills which were actually job related. I was an English teacher and so I think it is really important and a useful thing to do to upskill people in their literacy and numeracy. This is a pragmatic response. I think the take-up on this system is going to be very slow. And we saw bungling with the literacy voucher that this government implemented for school age children-a captive audience; it was not hard to identify who they were or how you had to access them-which dragged out to the point where there were kids who had failed the exam, were entitled to the voucher and did not get it until two years later when they were sitting the next exam. SoI think my cynicism about this particular program can be forgiven because of the track record the government has on these sorts of programs. Nonetheless, I will acknowledge that it is a worthwhile thing to do. I just think it is an awful lot of money for a not very well thought out process, and I suspect a lot of that money will still be sitting there at the end of the year. The other thing that the government has done is to look at providing traineeships for mature age workers. That is a good idea. There are people in industries who do a lot of work that gives them skills and, if they had the opportunity to get the actual qualifications to become a full apprentice and then a tradesperson, they would certainly take it up. The problem I have with this program is that, in an area like mine, the vast bulk of the apprenticeship opportunities actually sit in small businesses. If you are a small business-I am talking five to 10 people-it is highly unlikely that you are going to have the capacity to allow somebody who is working as a full worker for you now to become an apprentice. So who will be able to access these opportunities? Medium to large sized businesses. That is where the apprenticeship opportunities will happen. In my area, many small businesses utilise some programs whereby the group training companies employ the apprentices and they are then placed in small businesses to create those opportunities. The problem with this program is that it does not enable small businesses to effectively access it. I encourage the government to have a look at that, because it is worthwhile giving mature age people with practical skills they have got on the job the opportunity to upskill. The biggest gap in the whole thing, in terms of $800 million, is addressing that issue that I raised about an area like mine, where you have 40 per cent youth unemployment. When my son, who is now 23, finished school, for two years there were five boys sitting at my house every day. Four of those boys would have killed for an apprenticeship opportunity. They were desperate for an apprenticeship opportunity. All four of them eventually got one when they turned old enough to have a car and be able to travel to Sydney. That was the reality for them. So they all now do that terrible commute from Wollongong to Sydney, like 20,000 people do. Since the package was going to be this significant, I would have liked to have seen part of it target those young people, creating opportunities for them and supporting initiatives by people like the Illawarra Business Chamber, who have been targeting our chronic youth unemployment by providing expanded opportunities for young people in apprenticeships. It is a massive hole in this proposal. Heritage) (5.07 pm)-In speaking in support of the Prime Minister’s Skills for the Future package, I want to start in my own electorate of Flinders. This package comes in the context MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Ministerial Statements
312,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andof work done over the last 10 years which has seen unemployment drop by over four per cent, from a high in the nine per cent bracket to a low in the five per cent bracket. What that has meant in practice is thousands of jobs-over 4,000 jobs and 4,000 families who have had the benefit of work, who have had the dignity of work, who have had the economic outcomes which come from work and who have had the personal satisfaction of working. That is a profound and real outcome for people in the towns of Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Hastings, Somerville, Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang, Pearcedale, Cowes and Grantville-real jobs having a real impact on people’s lives. That is the local context and the human context of this package. The national context is that we have seen over 1.9 million jobs created between 1996 and now. So the story of Flinders is the story which has been told all around Australia, of 1.9 million individuals who have new jobs and new forms of employment. There has also been an increase in the participation rate to the highest level in Australian history. That rate includes those who have jobs and those who are looking for work. You would imagine that there would be a high unemployment rate if more people than ever, a greater percentage of the population than ever, were seeking to be in the labour force. No. We actually have the lowest unemployment level, of 4.8 per cent, in 30 years. If you want to see what is the real legacy of the last 10 years, it translates into this notion of the highest participation rate in Australian history coupled with an unemployment rate of 4.8 per cent, which is the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. Those two things together represent more people working not just because we have got a bigger population but as a percentage of the population than at any other time in Australian history. Against that background, the consequence of having more people as a percentage of the population actually employed means that we have the challenge of trying to fill the places of more jobs by chasing fewer spare workers. That is precisely the challenge that every economy seeks to balance. It certainly beats the alternative of having more unemployed workers chasing fewer jobs. In fact, it is a tremendous challenge to have to deal with. What are the actions that we have taken to date? There are three principal actions. Firstly, we have encouraged an increase in the number of apprentices from 154,000 in training in 1996 to 403,000 in training at present-almost three times the level of people currently passing through the apprenticeship process. Secondly, we make absolutely no apologies for the reforms which are encouraging employers to take on employees and encouraging more people to enter the workforce. They take the form of the workplace relations changes, and 205,000 jobs have been created since those reforms came into place. What that shows is that, given that this is three times greater than the long-term average for that same period, something must be happening. I make no bones about the fact that there is undoubtedly an effect from the booms in Western Australia and Queensland, but it seems unlikely that this growth in employment just happened to occur at precisely the time that there were changes caused by the workplace relations legislation. There is a high likelihood of a real correlation. Also, we make no apology for the Welfare to Work reforms to help people to transition back into the workforce. Both of these things have added to the work for apprentices in helping to provide and create the highest participation rate ever in Australian history. Given all of these things, there is no doubt that we have had challenges in trying to fulfil and achieve the quotas and levels that we want in relation to certain trades. So this package MAIN COMMITTEE that the Prime Minister puts forward, of $837 million over four years, aims to address four particular needs. Firstly, for people who in their midlife do not have the appropriate level of training or the desired level at school, there is a voucher of up to $3,000 to continue with training. This work skills voucher is a very important invitation and opportunity for all of those who want to increase their skills in whatever area. Moving onto the second of the initiatives, for mid-career people wishing to transition into the trades, there has been a barrier: the impact of loss of income whilst they go through the early apprenticeship years. For those people seeking to transition from other careers into apprenticeships mid-career, there is a $7,800 Commonwealth subsidy for the first year of that apprenticeship and a $5,200 subsidy for the second year of that apprenticeship. What that should do is help bridge the gap between the wages which they were receiving and the consequent drop if they were to seek to go through the training process. It is an appropriate response, and I think it is a very good one. The third area is in relation to business skills. For people who are running small businesses, especially those who are working in the trades, there is a $500 voucher to help them in preparing and understanding what is needed to effectively and efficiently run a small business. The fourth area is in relation to the long-term skilling of engineering. Already there have been significant contributions, but this package announces 500 new university places for engineering available as of next year. I think that that combination of four initiatives is a recognition that we have achieved the highest level of participation in the economy ever, that we have the lowest level of unemployment of 4.8 per cent in the last 30 years and that there are challenges that come from that. As a result-because of the work skills voucher, the encouragement for mid-career apprenticeships, the business skills voucher and the engineering places-I think this sets forward a very important path towards (a) helping with skills and (b) helping to improve the level of participation even further and drop the level of unemployment even lower. I am delighted to support this package, first and foremost because it will help people in Flinders. It will add to the more than 4,000 families who have received all of the benefits from new employment which they did not have in 1996. Secondly, I support the package because it will help contribute to the life and further economic development of the nation. I am proud to support the package and delighted to see it in the context of all of the changes and the jobs created over the last decade. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (5.16 pm)-The Prime Minister has finally been forced to act on Australia’s raging skills crisis. There is no question that the skills crisis is hurting Australian families and hurting businesses, and at last we have the Prime Minister acting on this crisis. Unfortunately it seems that previous government speakers, like the Prime Minister, do not recognise that this crisis exists, but Australian businesses and Australian families certainly know that it does. We only have to go back over the last 10 years to figure out why it is that we have such a serious skills crisis. We have had a government that has seen 300,000 Australians turned away from TAFE. Unfortunately it seems to be the case that only now that this skills crisis is hurting the Prime Minister politically are we getting some action. It is also the case that the Prime Minister is acting to desperately catch up with the range of Labor policies which have been announced over the last 18 months-policies that Labor has put forward to make sure that we do get more carpenters, plumbers, electricians, mechanics MAIN COMMITTEE and so the list goes on-into jobs and working. As many-most importantly, the Governor of the Reserve Bank-have said, this is the No. 1 economic issue facing Australia. Yet in the Prime Minister’s ministerial statement he said that we needed to put ‘the more breathless commentary about a skills crisis into proper perspective’. Australian families certainly have the skills crisis in proper perspective. They have the perspective of four consecutive interest rate rises at the same time that the Reserve Bank has been issuing warning after warning. We have a government member over there laughing. He is laughing at the fact that Australian families have faced four consecutive interest rate rises since the election and, of course, this government has continued to ignore the warnings it got from the Reserve Bank as far back as 1999. From as far back as 1999, the Reserve Bank has been telling the government that skill shortages are putting upward pressure on interest rates. Australian businesses, along with Australian families, have also got this skills crisis in perspective. The Prime Minister might not have it in perspective, but business certainly does, because business has been delaying billions of dollars of resource projects because of the lack of skilled workers. Business, like the Reserve Bank, has been telling the government for years that this is a very serious problem holding business back. We need to go back and have a look at why that it is: because of the huge cuts this government imposed a number of years ago on the funding of our TAFEs and our universities. It seems like it is only the Prime Minister who lacks the perspective to see the impact that the skills crisis is having on Australia. As I said before, the lack of skilled workers is the No. 1 economic issue facing this country. It is dragging down investment, slowing economic growth and holding back productivity. I refer government members to the statement on productivity just last week from the new Governor of the Reserve Bank-it is pushing up inflation and putting upward pressure on interest rates. These are all the serious economic impacts of the skills crisis. This Prime Minister created the skills crisis; it is his responsibility to fix it. As I said before, the skills crisis started when the government back in 1997 implemented massive budget cuts in our TAFE system and in our universities. In fact, not only did they first cut the funding to our TAFEs and our training system but they then abolished growth funding altogether. So for years our TAFEs were just treading water. Instead of training young apprentices, funding cuts actually sent our TAFEs into a survival scramble. In 1998, the government actually abolished the National Skills Shortages Strategy. They also slashed university funding-the place where all these very important professionals get trained-for example, engineers. Of course, the result of slashing the funding to universities not only has seen a decline in the number of Australians going to university but also has seen the government foist the funding burden onto Australian students, and now the debt carried by Australian students and graduates is soon to reach $20 billion. That is being carried by our students and graduates because of the extraordinarily short-sighted decisions made by this government. This appalling track record has most recently been highlighted by the OECD. What they show is that Australia’s public investment in tertiary education, that is, in our TAFEs and universities-the very foundation of our skilled technical and professional workforce-has gone backwards by seven per cent since this government was elected. We have gone backwards. We are the only developed country in the world to have gone backwards; the average across the rest of the developed world is an increase of 48 per cent. So everywhere else in the develMAIN COMMITTEE oped world they are investing in the future of their people, investing in training and investing in higher education. Everyone else is moving forward. Only Australia is going backwards. This year, the Howard government is spending proportionally less of the federal budget on vocational education than last year-less on this most critical area at a time when our national vocational and technical training effort needs a significant boost. The Australian Industry Group have been out there really pressing the point on the government. They released figures last month showing the extent of the skills crisis. They said two-thirds of our jobs need a vocational education, but only one-third of the working population has a trade or vocational qualification. The Australian Industry Group said that within a decade we will need an extra 270,000 technical workers. The mature age wage subsidy that was announced by the Prime Minister will support 10,000. The measures that are in this statement go nowhere near meeting the demands of industry for skilled workers. During the speech the Prime Minister boasted of his apprenticeship statistics. One thing he did not mention-not surprisingly, from this Prime Minister-is that today only one-third of the apprentices in training that he boasts about are actually in the traditional trades. You have to discount his figures as only one-third of them are in the traditional trades, compared to two-thirds who were in the trades 10 years ago. But the most extraordinary omission from the Prime Minister’s statement last week is that there is nothing to help our young people-nothing. There is not one initiative to ensure we get more young people into training, into the trades. It seems as though the Prime Minister either did not know or just completely ignored the fact that two-thirds of Australian apprentices are under the age of 25. There was absolutely nothing in this package to ensure that we encourage more young people into the trades and that we do more at school to encourage them into the trades. And, most importantly, there was absolutely nothing to help them complete their training. Forty per cent of our apprentices drop out of their training before they finish. One of the critical reasons we have such a serious skills crisis is that so many young people-40 per cent of them-are dropping out of their training before they finish their trade. Was there anything in this skills package to address that massive dropout rate? Not one thing. There was no trade completion bonus, which Labor has proposed. There was nothing to address this serious dropout rate. As the previous Labor spokesperson-the member for Cunningham-indicated, there is nothing to address the very significant levels of teenage unemployment, particularly in some parts of Australia. Her area of Wollongong has one of the most serious levels of teenage unemployment, where it is over 40 per cent, and there is absolutely nothing in this package to help those young people. There is nothing in the package to help lift training standards. One of the big criticisms of current training arrangements is the enormous number of what, in the vernacular, are called ‘tick and flick’ training practices, where we do not ensure that the training our young people are getting is really up to the mark. Once again, there was nothing in this package. Labor welcome any efforts to help those who do not finish year 12. We certainly believe that education and training should not be a once in a lifetime opportunity, so anything that helps people who have not had the opportunity to finish school is a good thing. We also welcome this change as, hopefully, a recognition by the Prime Minister that you cannot just leave school at 15 and stop learning. You do need literacy and numeracy skills to compete in our MAIN COMMITTEE modern economy. Year 12, or the equivalent vocational qualification, is fast becoming the new labour market minimum requirement-and I hope this skills package is a recognition from the Prime Minister that he should not be encouraging our young people to leave school at year 10. We do have some concerns about the workability and scope of the voucher programs that have been put forward because some international evidence certainly shows that existing workers with low-level skills are not likely to have full knowledge of what it is that they need to learn. They are often very reluctant to participate in learning and also have a lot of difficulty finding the time for training outside working hours. So these are some of the practical issues that these mature age workers will face in accessing this voucher. Another problem with what has been announced is that the training provided by the voucher is available only up to certificate II level. One thing that of course needs to be pointed out is that this level is nowhere near what is sufficient for a trade qualification and therefore will not do anything to address the skills shortage. Nevertheless, it is certainly better than nothing. We are finally getting the government to do something to help these people who have difficulty with their very basic skills, but we will be concerned if we do not see more action from the government to get more people into the trades. We do welcome the support for apprentices to undertake business training. We actually proposed a similar initiative as part of our skills account policy. We also, not surprisingly, welcome the extension of employer incentives at diploma and advanced diploma level. This was actually contained in the Leader of the Opposition’s skills blueprint announced a whole year ago. Obviously we are glad to see the government pick up these initiatives. It is also a good thing to see the wage subsidy for mature age apprentices. In fact it is interesting to note that this policy designed to help mature age workers is very similar to one that we had as part of Labor’s Working Nation program more than 10 years ago-a program that was, of course, trashed by the government. If they had not trashed all of those initiatives more than 10 years ago, in fact, the skills crisis would not be as bad as it is today. It is also very important to get these extra places into engineering. I would have to say that one of the problems with engineering is that we have actually had a decline in the number of Australian students commencing an undergraduate engineering degree. I think the government needs to look far more deeply at the problem of the shortage of engineers. Providing additional places is one thing; getting young people in a position to want to do engineering and encouraging them to do engineering is a big issue that the government has yet to address. (Time expired) nity to talk on the Prime Minister’s statement on Skills for the Future and to comment on some of the vacuous contributions of the member for Jagajaga. It is interesting to note that the ALP have had an interesting policy on dealing with the shortage of skills-and that was to create mass unemployment, because mass unemployment ensured they never had a skills crisis. Mass unemployment not only meant that people lost their homes, and high interest rates meant they lost their businesses, but it ensured there was no real demand for skilled labour. It is an interesting policy initiative and one that I am going to focus on a little later in my contribution. As I said, I certainly welcome the Prime Minister’s statement. I believe that this package represents a very well-targeted range of assistance for individuals who want to enter or MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Ministerial Statements
313,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (5.31 Pm),"It gives me great pleasure to have the opporturespond to changes in the job market. It will also do much to ease the skills shortages which we are currently experiencing. Of course the opposition is quick to criticise on the issue of skills shortages, but skills shortages are a challenge-a challenge that comes from success. They are a challenge that grows out of a vigorous, well-managed economy that is growing strongly year-on-year. They have grown out of our well-managed regime, which not only has resulted in lower interest rates, low inflation and elimination of government debt but is also delivering higher wages and better living standards. Unemployment is at 30-year lows. We have created 1.9 million jobs since 1996, and since March we have introduced Work Choices. The Australian Labor Party said that the sky was going to fall in, that there were going to be no more barbecues and that the world was going to come to an end. But what has happened? We have created 205,000 jobs. What has happened to wages? Have they gone down? No, they have gone up. What has happened to opportunities? They have only continued to increase. So we have seen greater job creation, higher real wages and continuing improvements in the Australian economy. Work Choices has not been the end of the world as was predicted by the soothsayers in the Labor Party. They are probably spending an hour every day wiping the egg off their face. So this issue of skills shortages is really a response to the success that we have achieved in managing the economy, giving people the confidence to go out and grow their businesses and employ more people. The package that the Prime Minister introduced into the House is part of a range of measures to meet that challenge. Before considering in detail the assistance offered under Skills for the Future, I would like to spend a moment looking at the measures that are currently under way for Australians, particularly young Australians-the types of measures that we have put in place to ensure that people have access to skills training. Let us look at the figures for apprenticeships, which are the foundation of skills provision. We heard the member for Jagajaga whingeing, moaning and groaning, but the figures show that there are some 403,600 apprentices-and that is compared to how many in 1996? Was it 300,000? No, it was not. Was it 200,000? No. In 1996, there were only 154,800 apprentices. In my electorate of Cowper, back in 1996, there were 710 apprenticeships. How many are there now? There are 2,100-three times the number. More than 90 per cent of those who complete a new apprenticeship find employment within three months. It is a very different employment scenario from that which existed under Labor. Rather than young people being cast on the scrap heap-young people with no opportunities-under this government apprentices are finding a job within three months. That is a fantastic outcome. One of the other measures that the government introduced was the $800 tool kit initiative. There is also $1,000 in scholarships for apprentices who complete the first and second year of their training in trade skills in areas of need with a small or medium sized business. Disadvantaged job seekers can benefit from access to a program which equips them to start the apprenticeship itself. There are also incentives for employers to take on apprentices with commencement payments which are higher in regional and rural areas and also higher for school based new apprentices. Five hundred new apprenticeship centres have been opened to make it easier for employers to comply with the requirements of taking on an apprentice. I am pleased to say that 300 of those are in regional and rural Australia. More than $10 billion has been committed over four years for vocational and technical education. Between 1997 and 2004, MAIN COMMITTEE we saw a 125 per cent increase in the number of students in this area of study. Twenty-five Australian technical colleges are being established for the tuition of some 7,200 students in years 11 and 12 in areas of skills shortage. With measures like these, we have already gone a significant way towards addressing the issue of skill shortages-as I said, a shortage which is born out of the successful economy driving up demand for labour. Our current economic success was built on reform, but we need to continue to reform in order to compete with other thriving economies in the world market. This government has always focused on ways of making our economy more efficient and, in particular, making the labour market more efficient and more effective. I am greatly encouraged by the decision to set up two pilot programs offering financial incentives for unemployed people to move to areas of labour shortage. Those seeking to move to areas of labour shortage will be assisted to find jobs in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, with up to $5,000 in assistance. I am pleased to say that my electorate of Cowper is one of the areas that is going to participate in the pilot program which is looking at getting labour from where it is available to where it is very much needed-working towards improving labour market flexibility and creating opportunities. There has been a very favourable reaction to this initiative in my electorate. I have been approached by quite a number of people who are keen to take up the sorts of opportunities that this program will provide. Innovative measures like these do much to improve our labour market effectiveness, reduce the shortage of labour and provide opportunities. I now turn to the measures included in the Skills for the Future package. I remind the Main Committee that it involves measures worth $837 million, in addition to the $10 billion in funding that I have already mentioned. Earlier, I mentioned disadvantaged job seekers. Clearly, those who do not have year 12 or equivalent qualifications are disadvantaged in today’s workforce. So this package provides work skill vouchers worth up to $3,000 for tuition in TAFEs or private or community colleges. The tuition can cover the most basic skills of literacy and numeracy and all certificate II courses, and will be available to unskilled workers wanting to acquire the sorts of qualifications which will make them more employable and create more opportunities for them. I think it is a great program. Understandably, measures to date have tended to concentrate on young people, those currently out of work or those who have never been employed, but this program aims to look at what we can do to upskill some of the mature age workers. In terms of the cost of youth and long-term unemployment to the individuals concerned and to the community, it makes good sense to look at a range of ways in which we can upskill all of our workers to provide a total workforce that has a much higher skill level. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 5.40 pm to 5.52 pm are well accustomed to the demands of the workplace, particularly later in their working lives. Yet we have a pool of well-motivated, experienced people. The fact that they have successfully held down a job under their own steam should surely not preclude them from assistance, particularly when they have so much to offer. Therefore, I welcome the support for mid-career apprenticeships, which should help those aged over 30 move from their current work into an MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Ministerial Statements
314,Mr Hartsuyker,"We tend to overlook those who have already acquired a skill andapprenticeship by providing a subsidy to bridge the gap between apprentice wage levels and what they might have been earning elsewhere. The benefit would be paid at the rate of $150 a week in the first year and $100 a week in the second year as the apprenticeship wage rises. This practical assistance to those who wish to acquire a trade later in life is something I think we should very much welcome. I know many employers in my community welcome the opportunity of taking on people at an apprenticeship level at a mature age, as well as younger apprentices. There is also the fact that many skilled workers and tradespeople have an opportunity to grow their business or to make the move from being self-employed to being an employer. Again, there is a problem in acquiring the necessary skills in moving from, say, being a plumber working on his own to running a business perhaps employing a number of people, with the responsibility that that entails. Under the Skills for the Future package, the business skills voucher for apprentices will provide up to $500 a year for apprentices taking an accredited small business skills training course. The package also includes 500 Commonwealth supported engineering places at university from 2008, in addition to the 510 places announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in July-a very important measure increasing the number of these highdemand engineering positions. Finally, for those seeking diploma and advanced diploma level qualifications, employers will receive incentive payments of $1,500 for each employee starting a diploma program and a further $2,500 on completion of the course. The current restriction on those who already possess qualifications from attracting incentives will be removed and existing employees will be covered, not just new employees. This recognises the fact that, in a rapidly changing world, we are likely to need more than one qualification in our working life. The Skills for the Future package provides targeted assistance across a range of skills to get more people into the workforce and to upskill those people who are already in the workforce in light of the changing economic circumstances we have. It covers adult literacy, higher technical qualifications and the improvement in the number of engineers-as the Prime Minister said, ‘from reading to rocket science’. It is a very well-targeted, broad package that will substantially improve the skills outlook in this country. This package will help people who need to upgrade or modify their qualifications and it will also give people a very basic start on improving their qualifications. It is a great package. I know that it will be welcomed by Express Coaches, in my electorate, which has grown from only six employees in 1985 to 85 employees today. They are keen to grow their business with another 35 workers, but they need to upskill them. This package will be of great assistance to them. Just before I conclude my remarks, I would like to reflect for a moment on the record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the federal minister for training between 1991 and 1993. It is interesting to note that we not only had a policy of mass unemployment as a way of controlling skills shortages; under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition as minister for training, the number of apprentices actually declined-from 151,000 to 122,700. It is hardly a proud record for a man who claims that he has what it takes to run this country. During his time as the responsible minister, he contributed to the skills shortage by actually presiding over a reduction, not an increase, in the number of apprentices. MAIN COMMITTEE I commend this package. I think it is a great package. It is going to greatly enhance the skills base of this nation. It is going to provide opportunities and create a more efficient economy. I commend the package indeed. points the member for Cowper made about the sky falling in, as the opposition has supposedly been saying. I would like to know if the member for Cowper would like to speak to some of the young people in my electorate who are unemployed. With a youth unemployment rate of over 25 per cent in my electorate, I have mums and dads coming into my electorate office every day to ask if I can assist their children to access apprenticeships. I tell them that this government’s only way of dealing with skilling the Australian workforce is to bring in apprentices from countries like India, Indonesia and China and to train them up under apprenticeship visas. I would like the member for Cowper to tell those people how rosy the sky is when kids in my electorate are looking for apprenticeships and cannot find one. As I said, the only solution this government has is to bring in apprentices from overseas on apprenticeship visas and to train them up here in this country-certainly on lower wages than what an apprentice would get if they were employed here. Of course, one of the conditions of those visas is to sign a contract of employment, an AWA. If you do not sign that employment contract, you do not get the visa. So do you think those people are going to sign the contract? They will all sign the contract, regardless of what the conditions are. That goes to the heart of this government’s policy and the sole purpose of not skilling people. The sole purpose of bringing these apprentices over is to drive wages down. That is the only reason. That is the reason they brought in Work Choices, and that is the reason they are bringing in overseas workers: to drive wages down and to ensure that conditions for the working people here in this country are far lower than they have ever been at any time in this great country of ourswhere we once had a proud record and we were very proud of paying a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. It is a very sad day for Australian democracy when we see the results of a whole decade of budget cuts, underinvestment and reliance on a tertiary education system where degrees cost $200,000 and people who pay up front get priority at university. This is what this government have done. They have ignored their responsibility for planning and managing the national workforce, and they have spent 10 years undermining Australia’s education and skills outcomes. The government take 20 minutes of everybody’s time, as they did the other day, to get up and state: ‘We’re going to put in $800 million to help people get a year 12 equivalency certificate. Aren’t we a great nation-building government?’ The government have had 10 whole years, an entire Public Service at their disposal and all the think tanks under the sun, and all they can come up with is a proposal to help middle-aged people in employment to revisit high school. Five billion dollars has been taken out of universities since the government were elected. And they want to talk to us about higher education and training. There was also $250 million cut from TAFE in the first two budgets of this government. The Howard government have been in power for the last 10 years, and for 10 whole years they have torn down TAFE. TAFE was the skilling school of our nation. The government have not given two hoots about skilling. All of a sudden, they are doing a backflip and showing some sort of concern. But how do the government expect Australian industry to cope when they rip money out of the higher MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Ministerial Statements
315,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (5.56 Pm),"I will just make a few comments about someeducation system, which includes TAFE training for trades and skills? They ripped $250 million from TAFE in their first two budgets, not forgetting the $5 billion they have ripped from universities. How does the government expect Australia to make use of the opportunities we currently enjoy, such as we do, and make preparation for an increasingly dependent population over the decades to come? Here is a small chronology of the government’s record since it has been in power. I have already mentioned the $250 million that was cut from TAFE in the first two budgets and the $5 billion cut from universities over the last 10 years. The first cuts that I mentioned were in 1996-97. In 1998-2000 there was a Commonwealth funding freeze. In 2001-03 the limited growth funding was restored very slightly, but the states were required to match $460 million over three years. In 2004 there was a rollover of the 2003 funding, with no indexation of the 2003 growth funds. In 2005 the Australian National Training Authority was abolished. This was the authority that had the responsibility for a centralised national training system and it was the advisory body to the government on training. It was a shame that it was abolished. How can this government talk about training when that is its record for the last 10 years? All we have seen is slashing and cutting. How can the Australian public trust this government on skills when it has an abysmal record like that? The other day the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry were kind enough to slip me, in my electorate, one of their most recent newsletters, in which they identified their members’ expectations and concerns. There was a survey of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry members. Forty-five per cent of those surveyed expected national economic conditions were deteriorating. Sixty-one per cent expected movement in prices-that is, inflation, higher prices. Eighty per cent expected interest rates to rise again somewhere in the very near future. The underlying cause of these perspectives within the community, the reasons for such bleak forecasts regarding costs and of course the cost of money, is the upward pressure created by this government’s obsessiveness with their out-of-date approach to national government. Formulating and implementing good policy for this country is every government’s duty, regardless of what side of the fence they are on, whether they are a Labor government or a Liberal government. That is the No. 1 duty of any government. We have not seen this. We have not seen good implementation or good policy in the skills area. We have seen neglect for 10 whole years of this government. All we have seen is a denial and nothing more. The member for Cowper earlier spoke about apprenticeships, and I would like to make some points on apprenticeships as well. The government’s New Apprenticeships scheme has been in operation now for some time. The government count it as one of their greatest successes, but many would argue that it has failed young Australians and failed our workforce requirements. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research report Australian qualifications framework lower-level qualifications: pathways to where for young people? shows that only 33 per cent of people enrolled in a certificate I qualification and 43 per cent of people enrolled in a certificate II qualification complete their courses. Of the few who do complete, over a third of participants said they saw no real job related benefits in the training they received. This government pays out over $76 million to employers as incentives to take on certificate II trainees, including $18 million for retail courses and $6 million for hospitality. Research MAIN COMMITTEE shows young people in these courses have been used as cheap labour and have not been given the skills they need for future full-time employment. It may well be that the government has identified a stale smell coming from the New Apprenticeships scheme, as it has reportedly started spending $24 million on giving it a facelift, renaming it Australian Apprenticeshipsthat is according to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser. Labour shortages and businesses having to import tradesmen from interstate at top dollar just to keep the companies’ production ticking over is not going to help to keep prices low. Fobbing off opportunity after opportunity for developing our own Australian-made energy industries is not balanced by subsidising a few thousand out-of-date LPG kits. Bringing in wave after wave of overseas workers is in itself not the primary solution to Australia’s workforce problems. I spoke earlier about apprenticeship visas. We also see 457 visas, under which we are bringing in people on lower conditions and less pay. The only objective of this particular policy is to drive down wages. Fear not, that is the only objective of this policy. As soon as we see a downturn in the economy, there will be a definite drop in wages. This is all part of the government’s scheme to ensure that wages will remain at levels lower than what they currently are. Let us take a look at health for instance, particularly at GPs. Everyone knows that we have national shortages of GPs in hospitals and in the community, but not everyone knows that the government’s own bureaucratic bungling has caused a queue of 1,200 doctors waiting for Medicare provider numbers. That is 1,200 doctors who do not have Medicare provider numbers and cannot start up waiting in a queue. That is 1,200 doctors on the bench itching to get into the game, frustrated by this government, when it is plain to see we are only fielding half a team. In response to this bottleneck, which is probably quite representative of much of Australia’s trade orientated infrastructure, the government again simply diverts its eyes to, in this case, the 457 visas. The number of doctors recruited from overseas last year included 980 GPs, virtually 1,000 for the year. The overall number has risen in the last 10 years by some 30-plus per cent. Now some 25 per cent of the medical workforce comprises doctors trained overseas. But what does this government do? It has slashed university funding by $5 billion since it has been in. The Australian Medical Association has found goodness-knows-how-many doctors and surgeons brought in from overseas and working in our hospitals without-believe it or not-even having had their competencies checked-and we hear stories every day. Still shortages remain and this government’s failure to adequately plan, invest in and support its own health industry remains evident. It is similarly evident in the industries and professions. It does not stop there by a long shot. The government’s 20-minute plan-as we saw the other day-for tackling the skills crisis also consists of vouchers to assist one in 10-that is right, only one in 10-of the people it has turned away from TAFE over the last 10 years. We all know that 300,000 people have been turned away from TAFE. As I said earlier, TAFE was the skilling school of our nation and the place where people did learn trades, and this is the best that the Howard government can do: turn away 300,000 people from TAFE and then give one in 10 the opportunity for a callback however many years later-a bit of tokenism, I say. Mrs Bronwyn BishopMr Deputy Speaker, I wonder if I could intervene under the relevant standing order and ask the member if he would like to answer a question. MAIN COMMITTEE an intervention? ades. Industries like textiles and footwear have all but gone. Many of these industries used to train and take on many apprentices. The national challenge has been to orientate the Australian workforce towards industries with a much brighter future; that has been the idea anyway. But as we have seen old industries close down, has Australia invested enough in the education of the workforce so that people are able to invest themselves in industries and produce goods and services that will take up a greater share of the nation’s GDP as we work our way through this century? The record is clear and the conclusions are obvious. Australia is the only country in the OECD where public investment in tertiary education, universities and TAFEs fell in the last decade by seven per cent. The rest of the OECD countries increased their investment by an average of 48 per cent in the same period. The record is abysmal. It is a national embarrassment. Worse than that, it is almost as if the government has already decided that our next generation-or at least those from places other than Kings College and similar places-are just as likely to be in the ship-breaking industry, no doubt soon to come to the outskirts of Australia’s major cities. Again, we get back to the reality: 300,000 people turned away from TAFE and only one in 10 getting a call back. Australia is crying out for much more than this, and I hope that next year’s Labor government will deliver much more than this. Australia a number of times in the past 10 years. It has taken a good 10 years for the Prime Minister of Australia to finally make some comments and put a program together in the order of $830 million entitled Skills for the Future. What is not here? Skills for the past 10 years, skilling Australia through a full decade in which the demand for skilled labour and the necessity to train that skilled labour have been evident for at least the last decade. Why has it been evident? All you have to do is look at two particular indicators. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, if you look at the average age of farmers in Australia you can tell that there is a significant problem not just with the age of the community as a whole but with the age of people who are managing and working on farms Australia-wide. Likewise, there is a significant problem in the trade skills area. The average age of skilled tradesmen in Australia is now 54 years of age. People who work in the trades know in 2006 what they knew in 1996-that is, that the group of people coming behind them is narrow and thin. They know that, as they age, there is that band of people who trained in a period when there was still a very strong, full apprenticeship system-not a combined system where traineeships took the place of full apprenticeships and where concentration on the traditional trades was downgraded for quicker, cheaper traineeships that the government has lauded for the past 10 years. But they also understood then, as they understand now, that the great training institutions of the past-not just the technical and further education colleges of Australia but the institutions that train people internallyused our technical and further education system to bolster, improve and extend that training. We are dealing here with the modern Telstra in particular, and we are also dealing with entities such as State Rail. What we have seen for more than 10 years now-in fact in Telstra’s case and certainly in State Rail’s case I suppose it is more in the order of 15 to 20 years-is MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Ministerial Statements

318,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (6.10 Pm),"I have spoken on the question of skills and skillingthat there has been a complete walking away from their traditional place as the key trainers for Australia. I know that whilst we were in government-and, indeed, prior to that-one of the key reasons for what effectively has been four, almost five, decades of declining apprenticeship numbers across Australia was that those who were the engine room of providing those trained people pulled out of the game. One of the reasons they did that was that they thought that they were expending a lot of money in training people and it was not really good that a lot of those people were pinched by outside companies. The private companies would come and take the fully trained Telstra employees-or Telecom employees as they were then, or PMG employees as they were previously-take advantage of all of the work and the skilling that had been put into those people, and offer them higher money to come and use those skills outside. Some took it; some did not. Some remained loyal to the institution that had helped train them. If you look at the period of the late 1960s through to the early 1970s, you see that much of our training was in fact bonded training. There was bonded training at Telstra. That training occurred at the Telstra facility at Redfern. I know about it because my elder brother, Kerry, did his training there. He went to De La Salle Ashfield as part of the old system, did fourth year at De La Salle Ashfield and instead of going on to the leaving certificate went into a full apprenticeship with the original PMG, which transformed into Telecom. What was available to him was an extremely high-class, totally dedicated system of training that turned out a fully trained telecommunications technician, someone who could have later chosen to go on and take that through to an engineer level. He chose not to but he spent most of his working life productively in that organisation. Over a period of time he saw others take jobs outside and take their training elsewhere in the community. If you look at it not from the point of view of the Post-master General, Telecom or Telstra but from the point of view of the community as a whole, these great engines of training and skilling for the future of Australia provided skilled people for the whole community at virtually no cost to the private employers. They grabbed those people who were trained here. Similarly, State Rail provided fundamental training across a broad range of skills for tens of thousands of people. They did that in my electorate at the Chullora railway yards for boilermakers-for Paul Keating’s father who worked as a boilermaker; he helped train other people as boilermakers-and for Jimmy Doherty, his mate who worked with him up there. Those people passed on their skills in significant trades to the next generation. They did that in Blaxland in the Chullora railway yards. But with the change in philosophy, Telstra decided that it wanted to keep more money unto itself and State Rail decided to get with the action that was in not only the rail area but also a range of other state utilities such as the electricity commission and so on. Instead of maintaining their equipment in the way they used to, instead of reinvesting by training new people for the future, they effectively pulled out of the game. That means that those skilled people are not available in large numbers to those enterprises and they have to catch as catch can. They have done that now for a couple of decades by finding people who were trained by someone else, and that has largely fallen directly on the technical and further education system, which depends for its operation on the states. But that system fundamentally depends on support from the Commonwealth government-the money provided to the states-in order to run effectively. MAIN COMMITTEE Prior to us losing government in 1996, I think it would have been in 1994 or 1995, I went through the Bankstown Technical and Further Education premises with the then federal member for Blaxland, who had actually trained in the electrical section at Bankstown. In going through with him, what became apparent was something very strong and very real. Here was someone who had trained in a practical trade and then gone on to do the first part of his work in the electrical industry, as Laurie Brereton, the previous member for Kingsford Smith, who was a fully trained electrician, did. Kids who left school seven years before me did not go through to uni; they went out, sought trades and went into an area that was traditionally a working class area. What Paul Keating understood and what he wanted to do in government was to rebuild the technical and further education sector. That job has still not been done, a good decade since then-and more. Why not, even though it is staring them absolutely in the face? We get to 10 years on, 12 October 2006, with the Prime Minister finally in panic and crisis mode because the problem is so evident that it is staring everyone in Australia in the face. What do we get? We get $837 million thrown at the problem. Who is it thrown to? Guess what? It is thrown to people 25 years and over who might need to retrain or it is thrown to people who come within a particular set of parameters-those people on disability support pensions, those people on income support in some other way or those people on carer pensions. It is those people who have been given training assistance in the past in order to get themselves into the workforce. When we were in government we saw full well how much derision there was from the current government when it came to our training efforts to try to give people a chance to get through the period of recession that we had. That fantastic program, Working Nation, reignited this country and reignited its skills base. There was very little for people when Labor came into government in 1983, coming out of a recession. I have been waiting 10 long years for this Prime Minister to say: The contrast with previous episodes of commodity boom-related labour market tightness is very stark. For example, in the mid-1970s demand pressures in some sectors led to a surge in wages and inflation across the whole economy. His memory must be deficient-we know it has been deficient at other times-because that wage pressure was not just in the mid-1970s. Phil Lynch was Treasurer in the mid-1970s. When did the wage pressure really come on? It came on in the late-1970s-1979, 1980, 1981-under the Fraser government, with John Howard as Treasurer. That wages pressure came out of a resources boom that never happened-a resources boom touted by that government. They said that there was going to be $29 billion worth of investment in that resources boom, and not one single person in the country saw that become evident. But what did happen? Because that resources boom was pushed and touted so heavily by that government, the strongest unions in the country, the metal workers, went out for 20 and 30 per cent increases. What has conditioned this Prime Minister in his responses ever since then? Wage push inflation and cost push inflation-the two keys when he was Treasurer. What dominates him now-dominates him to this very day, dominates the whole structure of his approach in industrial relations and dominates his view of the Australian workforce-is that you have to have a Thailandisation of the work conditions for Australians and that the fundamental problem in Australia is the cost of labour. Get real! It is not 1979, 1980 or1981 and there are not the conMAIN COMMITTEE ditions under which he operated unsuccessfully as Treasurer. We have a situation where there is a deficit of skills Australia-wide because the reinvestment into Australia’s people has not been put there by the federal government of Australia. They have not pushed the agenda. They have not forced this, even though the evidence was there and stark. Why have we gone into crisis mode? There must be a skills crisis, if the member for Bennelong is going to come out with a major package-scant as it is. The package is $837 million over five full years. What is in the package for young people under 25 needing training? Not a zack out of this package is directed towards them. What do we have in this package to completely reshape our education system in terms of driving skills? What we have got is 25 technical education colleges. How many are actually operating now? I am not sure. I think there might be one. score-but, if you are going to start from the ground up, I suppose you can say that four out of 25 is a start. We know that a whole series of them has problems. Why? One of the reasons is the demand that Australian workplace agreements be the only agreements in place in those technical colleges. Even if you take the total number of people who go through a technical college, it is a drop in the bucket in terms of the need that Australia has for skilling its workforce. Ten years ago we were in a position where, with determination, effort and a sensible approach to this, we could have built Australia’s trade and skill capacity and skilled our tradespeople, where we could have not only provided for our own needs in Australia-and filled the gap that is there and evident, where 54 or 55 is the average age of trained and professional tradespeople in Australia-but also exported those skills to Asia. The great opportunity that was lost then was the capacity to build Australian companies, based on skilled Australian tradesmen, and to export those skills into the Asian market. Instead of that, what have we got? I was down at the Landmark in Barton-where group after group seemed to be involved in construction of that building-and the penny dropped for me in terms of what was happening and the fact that there was something rotten with 457 visas when, at quarter to five in the afternoon, a troop of Chinese plasterers, plastered head to foot with dust, came out of there. They had no work boots and no safety shirts or safety helmets-none of the sorts of things that other people had to have. Everybody else had knocked off at 3.30 pm or quarter to four, and I thought: ‘Here is an entire tranche of people brought in because what should have been done for young Australian people’-the people who needed to be trained as skilled work people-‘has not been done.’ All this government has done until now is substitute foreign workers for Australians. We should train Australians. (Time expired) economy. It not only boosts opportunity for the individuals concerned but also boosts productivity. It is a win-win outcome. I have said before in this place that education is the great enabler of a society and skills development is the means by which we become smarter, more innovative and more adaptive and compete at the higher wage end of the job opportunity scale. It is a means by which we become more productive and provide more diverse and rewarding opportunities for our people, not just young people.

321,Mr Crean (Hotham) (6.25 Pm),"Skills development is one of the key drivers of anis always important in these debates to remind people that education and skills development is a public good. (Quorum formed) So investing in our capacity to advance education and skills is one of the essential investments a government must make-not just that it can make but that it must make-but it is an investment that this government has failed to make. Labor have been arguing for a decade that this government is letting the country down and letting its individuals down by failing to invest properly in skills development. Belatedly, not only has the government acknowledged the problem but it has understood it has had to act; hence, this injection of $837 million over five years to address the problem. It is an investment made too late and still too narrow in its focus. This is a skills crisis that we have been warning of for years and, particularly in the context of the resources boom and the capacity constraints, what that failure to invest in skills has produced. We have heard the government rabbit on about infrastructure bottlenecks, but only now has it admitted the problem of the skills shortage. Over the years under this government, we have seen a crisis resulting from the underfunding of our universities and TAFE sectors, where the government has shifted heavily the cost of funding these sectors to the individual and the states-a government vacating the field and expecting others to pick up the cost. In 10 years, 300,000 people have been turned away from TAFE-300,000 Australians turned away from acquiring skills that would have benefited them and the nation. It is interesting-and the member for Blaxland made reference to this-that, whilst this is an important but belated statement, Labor are aware of the government’s commitment in the lead-up to the last election to establish the Australian technical colleges. It was a program that was deliberately designed to circumvent the states’ TAFE programs-a program that the government had underinvested in-but I think it is pretty instructive to look at what has been achieved. The government promised two years ago that it would establish 25 colleges. Only four of them have been established to date-I think there might have been an additional one established just recently which would take it to five; let us give them the benefit of the doubtwith just 320 students. Is this a serious response to the skills crisis? That is the fundamental question that I think has to be posed. No wonder we have still got the problem that has resulted in this sort of statement. So we have again been proven right, just as in the last term the government belatedly realised it had to do something with another one of those important public good areas-healthand reinvest to save our Medicare system because Labor had identified the problem and posed costed alternatives to address it. At the end of the last parliamentary term we went to the election proposing an initiative, fully costed and funded, which would have seen an additional 20,000 places in our TAFEs and our universities. Just imagine the opportunities that that would have provided-the opportunities not just for individuals but for the nation. My point in saying that is that it is easy for oppositions to just be critical of the government but Labor have had a consistent track record of putting forward constructive alternatives to address this problem. When we were in office-the 13 years that we were in office-we saw a real commitment to lifting the skills and educational ability of our people. We increased skills funding by 55 per cent in real terms. We increased TAFE funding by 56 per cent in real terms and we increased university funding by 60 per cent in real terms. This government comes nowhere near that sort of commitment. MAIN COMMITTEE We recognised the importance of addressing the problem from a national perspective and established the Australian National Training Authority. We developed the Working Nation program, which I had the privilege to not only develop but implement. It is a tragedy that it was not able to continue, because it was making huge headway. One of the mechanisms under the Working Nation program to complement the jobs compact and the subsidy arrangements in terms of getting long-term unemployed back into work was Netforce. This mechanism recognised the importance of driving skills development not just in the traditional trades but also in the new economy jobs, jobs not traditionally known as trades but jobs that nevertheless needed skills development for which there was no accredited training. It was Labor that established that mechanism. I think it is very interesting when the government gets up and talks about its record on unemployment. We should not forget that when the Prime Minister was Treasurer in the Fraser government that was the record unemployment that was created in this economy. It is also true that under Working NationMrs Bronwyn Bishop-I would like to ask the honourable member a question under the standing orders, if he wishes to accept it. cept the question? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-I wonder if the member for Hotham could tell us what year it was under the Keating government that there were one million unemployed. ployed exceeded one million under the Fraser government, and that was one million unemployed in a lesser workforce so there was a higher proportion of unemployed under the government that John Howard was Treasurer in. That is what I can tell her. WhatI can also tell her is that we do not hide from the fact there was an unemployment problem under us, but we were prepared to do something about it. We were prepared to invest in getting people back into work-but not just in menial jobs; we were prepared to link them to effective accredited training. I said before that under Working NationI established the traineeship program and Netforce. It is very interesting to note that in Labor’s last year in office, in 1996, traditional apprentices-and I got these figures out of the library today-numbered in excess of 126,000. That was the figure just for traditional apprenticeships. They did not reach that figure again under this government until 2004. Almost eight years later, this government had stagnated. Despite the fact that there had been increasing prosperity and increasing economic growth, this government dumbed down the training system and did not produce one extra traditional apprenticeship training place.

What the government did was to scrap the measureMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjectingWhat the government did was to scrapMrs Bronwyn Bishop-Yes, I was wishing to ask a question. our traineeship system. I introduced the trainee system in 1995. In 1995, there were only 12,000 in the trainee system. Within two years, that had quadrupled to 48,000. The government benefited from the system that I put in place. It was a good system. They retained it, even though they scrapped Netforce, and the numbers that they now claim credit for are the direct result of the boom in traineeships, not traditional trades. The same figures from the library show that, in the latest year recorded, traditional trades accounted for only 148,000 out of a total of close to 400,000, but 60 per cent of what they call new apprenticeships in fact are our traineeships. So let us have none of this nonsense about their set of figures. I will just make this point in terms of comparisons, because it is also pretty revealing from these statistics. In 1990, under the Labor government, when Kim Beazley, I think, may have been employment minister, traditional trades were at their peak: 161,000, a figure that this government has never been able to achieve in its term despite a resources boom. So there you have it: a Labor government that had a commitment to skills development and employment growth, showing what can happen when you start to invest in the skill development of a nation. We hear of this government in terms of the need to address skills shortages. Nowhere is it a greater problem or issue than in the regions. You would know it, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, from your electorate-the inability of regions to go forward because this government has failed to invest in the skills development of its people. I again remind people of what Labor did when it was in office. When the skills shortage problem faced us back in the Working Nation days, I set up the area consultative committees under the Working Nation program to ensure that local training programs matched local industry needs, taking the supply with the demand. The area consultative committees were resourced to undertake skills audits to identify the skills and deficiencies within particular regions. We involved the local chambers of commerce and industry in identifying their skills needs. We encouraged local bodies to establish what the demand for their labour was. I remember coming up to your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and working with the area consultative committee to address its needs. That network of area consultative committees, which still exists today but is not resourced in the same way as we did it, was responsible for placing 300,000 jobs in six months-and then we lost office. The point I am making is that local empowerment works when you use government as a facilitator and to resource the capacity to address the skills needs of a particular region. We want to go back to developing and tapping that sort of mechanism because we have shown that it works. But it will not work unless a government is prepared to make the investment in MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Ministerial Statements

That is what Labor has shown a preparedness to do. It is what we keep putting forward the policies to do, and it is what this government eventually is forced, kicking and screaming, to embrace. We say: yes, we welcome this money, but more needs to be done in terms of not just giving people the opportunity but empowering regions to identify their needs to develop the training programs that suit their particular needs, to get back to doing what we demonstrated they were capable of delivering on-a government prepared to work with communities, not dud them and disinvest in the means by which people obtain their skills and the nation its productivity growth. (Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.40 pm)-I welcome the Prime Minister’s Skills for the Future statement. In doing so, I have to say I am very disappointed that it took so long for the government even to acknowledge that we have such a chronic skills shortage here in Australia. The promises and commitments that the Prime Minister made when he made his statement are a start, but they are nowhere near enough. BeforeI get to the actual substance of my speech, I would like to pick up on one thing that the member for Mackellar spoke about. It is in relation to the programs that have been put in place to address unemployment. I go back to the early eighties, when unemployment under the Fraser government peaked and it sought to introduce a program to address that unemployment. The program that they introduced was a program called wage pause. Wage pause necessitated all people employed by the Commonwealth having their wages frozen, and the difference between what they would have received and what they were actually paid was used in job creation programs. When the government lost power in 1983 and the Hawke government came to power, there was CEP and the other programs that have already been spoken about. Unemployment was not just a child of the Hawke era or the Keating era. Unemployment had been simmering for a very long time. Its seeds were to be found in the time of the Fraser government. Turning to the matter that we have before us today, I would like to state, as have previous speakers before me, that Australia is facing a chronic skills shortage. The Howard government’s solution has been to import workers from overseas, and we have been the only OECD country to reduce investment in universities and TAFE-and I will be concentrating quite a bit on TAFE. Australia’s investment has fallen by eight per cent since 1995 whilst that of OECD countries has increased by 38 per cent. I think it is an absolute disgrace that 16 per cent of young Australians aged between 15 and 19 are looking for work-and it is higher in areas like the area that I represent in this parliament. The area that I represent has traditionally supported the trades. When young people left school, they aspired to be tradespeople. I think the member for Blaxland touched on the fact that businesses and industry no longer employ people in traditional apprenticeships. The tradespeople that we have still working in industry were skilled in the seventies and eighties. I think the change in the way businesses operate and the change in the way governments and government departments employ and make a commitment to training apprentices have also impacted, the simple fact being that we do not have enough tradespeople. BHP in Newcastle used to employ a massive number of apprentices each year. Its demise has also seen the end of those apprenticeships. Whilst young people coming through the MAIN COMMITTEE schools in the Hunter aspire to become tradespeople, opportunities for them to undertake trade training are very limited. There are limited opportunities for them to access training through TAFE colleges and limited opportunities to access training with employers. One of the good things that has happened in recent times has been the expansion of the group training scheme. In a letter I sent out to my constituents recently, I highlighted the stories of a number of young people in my electorate who had chosen to train as apprentices through a group training scheme with Delta Electricity. Delta Electricity previously employed a massive number of apprentices. Now they take only a few through the group training scheme. That is one area, removed from government to some extent, that has caused problems with our skills shortage. But I am afraid that the Howard government cannot escape the blame for where we are today. We on this side of the parliament have raised issues time and time again with respect to industry, the traditional trades, the doctor shortage, the nurse shortage and the shortage of allied health professionals that exists in all of our electorates to some extent. The government have, up until very recently, ignored the fact that there were problems. Even when you recognise that a problem exists, there is always a lag time. The government have adopted the cheap approach of bringing people in from overseas, and I would have to say that that was very much a stopgap approach. What they should have been doing was investing in young Australians and also in a group that I think is an untapped resource within Australia-mature workers. I think that if we had programs, particularly in the area of technology, that were structured around targeting and upskilling older and more mature workers, it would be a great benefit to our nation. I have heard Professor Saunders, from the right-wing think tank, say in this parliament that mature age blue-collar workers would never work again. I object to that. I think that if you give them the proper training, if you give them the skills they need to work in industry today, they will be a worthwhile asset in our workforce. Earlier this week, teachers from TAFE came to visit me, and I am sure that they visited a number of members in this parliament. They highlighted to me how vocational education had suffered under the Howard government. There were the funding cuts in 1996 and 1997, which reduced the funding base for the 1998 ANTA agreements. That really had an impact and that was the first slash into the TAFE system. I could see how that was having an impact within my local area. From 1998 to 2000, there was the Commonwealth funding freeze, growth through efficiency and deregulation of the training market. I think that the quality trainer of our young people is TAFE. In our TAFE colleges we have experienced people in trades and highly educated, professional people who teach courses in our TAFE colleges. I think that the fact that this government has absolutely ripped money out of our TAFE colleges throughout Australia is unforgivable. What it has done is rip apart the infrastructure that provides the basis for quality training for all our young people. Once you deregulate to the extent where a number of the new apprenticeship courses that are not in the traditional trades, that are very soft courses, are taken up and counted as part of the training and the skilling of the nation, that is a real distortion of fact. I share with the House an example of one young person in one of those new apprenticeship schemes who came to see me. He was employed to do floor sanding. He did part of the certificate III course-when his employer would actually allow him to leave his employer’s home, which was where the young new apprentice worked. The jobs that the person did while he was doing MAIN COMMITTEE this new apprenticeship scheme were cleaning his employer’s car, sweeping the floors and tidying up around his employer’s home. He went to TAFE. He did part of the certificate III course and, once the employer received the payment, he sacked the young new apprentice. His father was able to negotiate a real apprenticeship for him in the area of plumbing, and he had his trial period. The new employer was very happy with him but, when he went to sign him up, he found that he could obtain no benefits, simply because the apprentice had done this mickey mouse certificate III course that had led nowhere, where he had been exploited and where he had learnt nothing. There he had an opportunity to do a real apprenticeship where he would be setting himself up for the future, and he could not do it because he had done this mickey mouse course. They are the kinds of apprenticeships that the Howard government talks about when they talk about how they are training all these young Australians. I would argue very strongly that the training that they are providing is second class. Between 2001 and 2003 there has been limited growth funding restored to TAFE colleges. In 2004 there was a rollover from 2003. When ANTA was abolished in 2005, I believe that really impacted on the nation’s ability to assess what skills it needs for the future and to determine the direction and the needs in the area of training. In TAFE it has led to larger classes and a reduction in courses. I know that it is very difficult for young people to do preapprenticeship schemes. There is definitely concern about the quality of some of the VET courses and it has been very detrimental to young Australians. It makes me quite upset when I hear that something like 40 per cent of the people who start the new apprenticeship schemes do not even complete their training. Labor’s skills blueprint, which I am sure most members of this House have looked at and appreciate the benefit of, addresses this issue and looks at ways to prevent this dropout that occurs with the new apprenticeship schemes. We want to give traditional apprentices $2,000 on completion-a $2,000 trade completion bonus. In addition, we believe that we should not be bringing 2,700 skilled workers in from overseas. We should not be bringing apprentices in from overseas; we should be training Australians for those positions. We should certainly be creating opportunities for all those young people in my area and in other areas throughout the country who would desperately love to train as a tradesperson and would desperately love to obtain an apprenticeship. We need as a nation to really address this issue properly-not in a half-baked way, like the Prime Minister did. We need to recognise the issue and make a real investment in the training of our young people and a real investment in upskilling our mature workers who would be only too willing to obtain the skills that are needed-skills that have been identified by industry as lacking in our economy. Once we have done that, we will take our economy into the 21st century and we will be able to compete much more effectively in the global market. The Prime Minister should look at the Labor Party’s blueprint and adopt the recommendations and the programs that are set out in it. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bronwyn Bishop) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 6.56 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Service Trusts (Question No. 2225) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 5 September 2005: (1) Is the use of service trusts by doctors a legitimate means of asset protection. (2) Do the draft ruling TR 2005/D5 and the associated booklet distributed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provide specific advice to private medical practitioners on the tax consequences of the use of service trusts. (3) Does the approach by the ATO to this issue require doctors to restructure their business affairs and encourage doctors to leave the medical workforce prematurely, exacerbating existing workforce shortages. (4) Is the intended target of compliance activities in relation to service trusts accounting and legal firms as distinct from medical practitioners. (5) Will he ask the ATO to prepare, in consultation with stakeholders, specific guidelines covering service arrangements in private medical practice to ensure that the guidelines match the circumstances of the profession in order to avoid the early exit of doctors from the medical workforce. (6) Without identifying individuals, can he provide details of private rulings and agreements reached with taxpayers by the ATO in settlement of disputes in respect to the use of service arrangements. (7) What percentage mark-ups on salaries and other expenses does the ATO accept as part of these rulings and agreements. (8) How many service arrangements have been audited since 1990 and how many of these audits have resulted in an adjustment to the service entity arrangement. (9) Can he provide information demonstrating that the interpretation adopted by the ATO in these audits matches the interpretation outlined in TR 2005/D5 and the accompanying draft booklet, “Service Arrangements”. (10) What were the percentage mark-ups on salaries and expenses that the ATO found to be inappropriate as part of these audits. (11) Has any work been done to analyse the impact of TR2005/5 on the supply of medical practitioners, the services of general practitioners and the profitability of their enterprises; if so, can he say what impact the changes to these arrangements will have on the medical workforce. (1) The Commissioner is aware that service arrangements have become an established part of ordinary business practice and can serve commercial purposes. (2) Draft taxation ruling TR 2005/D5 has now been issued in final form as TR 2006/2. It explains the ATO view of the legal considerations involved in determining the deductibility of fees and charges paid to service entities. These legal principles, which are based on decisions of the courts, apply to service arrangements generally. These common principles apply to all professions, including medical practitioners. There is no basis on which to distinguish between professions in terms of the application of these legal principles. The draft booklet on service arrangements has now also been issued in final form. It provides practical guidance to help taxpayers decide whether payments made under their service arrangements are commercially realistic and reasonably connected to the main business. The booklet has been",240,Ministerial Statements
333,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:prepared around the common types of services that are provided by service entities. The guidance relevant to these services is considered common across professions. The booklet also provides two case studies that deal with medical practice arrangements that differ from conventional service arrangements. The ATO has worked with the Australian Medical Association to develop this specific guidance. (3) There is no requirement for any taxpayer to restructure their business affairs because of the Commissioner’s approach. Taxpayers can continue to use service arrangements, and continue to claim expenses that can be reasonably connected with services and benefits provided to the main business. (4) Taxpayers across all professions are required to comply with taxation laws. Members of all professions should conduct their service arrangements in a manner compliant with relevant taxation laws. (5) The Commissioner has and will continue to work with the medical profession to minimise any adverse individual and community effects that are associated with obligations on taxpayers to comply with tax laws. The ATO has worked with the Australian Medical Association to develop specific guidance for the medical profession already contained in the guide. (6) Legal restrictions exist on divulging and communicating information on the affairs of taxpayers. Further, settlements reached with taxpayers contain standard confidentiality clauses that prevent the disclosure of details about the settlement. When settling disputes with taxpayers, the ATO operates pursuant to guidelines set out in the Commissioner’s Code of Settlement Practice. Under these guidelines, regard is had to a range of factors in settling disputes. (7) The Commissioner’s booklet on service arrangements provides guidance on rates that the Commissioner accepts as commercially realistic. These rates are described as comparable market rates and are based on work undertaken during earlier audit and other compliance, risk and intelligence activities. There are also rates included as specific guidance for the medical profession in terms of medical practice arrangements that differ from conventional service arrangements, following consultation with the Australian Medical Association and a degree of independent verification. These rates are based on a fixed percentage of gross practice fees to calculate service fees, as opposed to a mark-up on costs approach. These rates can only be relied upon by general practitioners who operate under those unconventional arrangements. The risk of being audited will increase according to the degree of divergence above those rates. (8) In 1996, work began to scope the risks associated with the use of service arrangements in the accounting and legal professions. In his 2000-01 Annual Report, the Commissioner identified concerns over the use of service arrangements in the accounting and legal professions. Prior to these concerns emerging, service arrangements were not the subject of systemic audit activity. ATO records at 30 June 2006 indicate the following information about audits and reviews of service arrangements: Size of business No. of audits1 No. adjusted Large Business2 completed 2 (over $100m turnover) 3 cases finalised without further action Nil2 Small Business Small to Medium Enterprises 1 completed 1 (SME) ($2m-100m turnover) 2 cases finalised without further action Nil2 Micro Businesses (up to $2m turn13 cases finalised without further action Nil2 over) 1 Audits undertaken since 1994. Records prior to 1994 may not specifically capture details about audit issues involved. 2 Cases are being finalised without further action on service arrangement issues pursuant to the Commissioner’s announcement giving taxpayers whose claims fall below a threshold 12 months to review their arrangements or for other administrative reasons. In addition to these audits, the ATO undertakes Client Risk Review processes that may or may nor proceed to audits. ATO records indicate the following information about these reviews involving service arrangements: ATO Business Line No. of client risk reviews No. adjusted Small Business SME ($2m-100m turnover) 25 in progress Nil2 completed 1 7 cases finalised without further action Nil1 Micro (up to $2m turnover) 17 completed Nil2 3 in progress 1 Cases are being finalised without further action on service arrangement issues pursuant to the Commissioner’s announcement giving taxpayers whose claims fall below a threshold 12 months to review their arrangements or for other administrative reasons. 2 Cases were initially identified as potential shams. The majority of those cases were finalised on the basis that services were genuinely being provided by the service entity, however many of the reviews identified an issue as to whether the service fees had been correctly calculated. Accordingly, the ATO has recommended that fees and charges be reviewed by 30 April 2007 and has indicated that there is little risk of future audit if the service arrangement is generally in line with the guidance provided in the ruling and companion guide. (9) The audits completed were finalised using the same principles and measures contained in the draft and final versions of the ruling and booklet. The Commissioner has assured me that the interpretation adopted in these finalised audits is consistent with his published views in the draft and final versions of the ruling and booklet. (10) Net profit margins considered to be inappropriate have been associated with the following gross mark-ups on costs charged to professional firms: 50% on salaries and 15% on non-salary expenses, 30% on all expenses. A gross mark-up is considered inappropriate where it cannot be reasonably associated with net profit margins comparable to arm’s length arrangements as set out in the Commissioner’s booklet. The same gross mark-up figure can be acceptable in one arrangement and not be acceptable in another. This depends on the nature and extent of the business activity of the service entity and the expenses that it meets or expects to meet out of these mark-ups in carrying on these business activities. (11) Taxation ruling TR 2006/2 (previously released in draft as TR 2005/D5) supplements existing Ruling IT 276 and is not a departure from the existing law or from the Commissioner’s administration in relation to service arrangements. Accordingly, the release of the ruling is not expected to have an appreciable or systemic impact on the supply or profitability of medical services. The Commissioner has given taxpayers 12 months to review their service arrangements. During this time, only the highest risk cases will be subject to audit activity. For this purpose, the Commissioner has announced that he will be looking at cases where the service fees paid are over $1 million, represent over 50% of the gross fees earned by the professional practice, and the net profit of the service entity is over 50% of the combined net profit of the entities involved. The Commissioner will also look at cases where there are serious doubts as to whether the services were actually provided by the service entity. Any changes made to existing arrangements to support their compliance with tax laws are not expected to affect adversely the profitability of medical enterprises.

Medicare: Bulk-Billing (Question No. 3879) Ms Annette Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: Can he provide an update on the latest GP bulk-billing figures across Australia, including the federal electorate of Adelaide. Bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances by electorate are published on an annual calendar year basis, in February/March each year. The bulk billing rates for non-referred GP attendances for the electorate of Adelaide (based on patient enrolment postcode) and for Australia in calendar year 2005 (year of processing) are as follows: Calendar Year Region Per cent of services bulk billed 2005 Adelaide 68.4 2005 Australia 74.7 Note: Excludes practice nurse items Notes to the statistics Medicare data is based on year of processing by Medicare Australia and may not be the same as the year in which the patient received the service. Electorate level data should be considered as estimates only. Allocations of services are based on the reported postal address postcodes of patients. Therefore some data will not accurately reflect the address where the patient actually resides. Additional information and explanatory notes for these statistics are available on the Department’s website at www.health.gov.au/electoratereports.

(2) Can he confirm that a private company, Sees Pty Ltd, and the Commonwealth Bank, have made a profit from an ‘off-budget financing’ arrangement in the recovery scheme. (3) Can he explain why the federal Government used private sector finance to help fund the recovery scheme, when the Government could have provided the cheapest source of funding. (4) As the federal Government and private companies have received more than they out laid before Ansett workers have been paid back in full, does he intend to propose any changes to the way schemes such as the Special Employment Entitlements Scheme for Ansett (SEESA) are administered, so that they better ensure a fair and just outcome for workers. (5) Can he confirm that ticket-levy collections to fund the Ansett recovery scheme have been redirected to non-Ansett recipients; if so, will he identify those recipients. (1) All terminated Ansett employees have received 100% of their outstanding SEESA entitlements. Where former employees have entitlements in excess of the assistance already provided by the Australian Government under SEESA, their entitlements remain the responsibility of the Ansett Administrators.",256,Questions In Writing
338,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Air Passenger Ticket Levy was administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The distribution of the ticket levy is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. (2) This is a matter for SEES Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank to answer. (3) The Australian Government’s primary objective was to put in place a mechanism to ensure that Ansett employees received their entitlements under SEESA in a timely and efficient manner. A further objective was that this mechanism should be designed in a way that would minimise its impact on the budget. (4) No. SEESA has met the objectives set by the Australian Government. (5) See answer to Question (1). Asia-Pacific Region: Death Penalty (Question No. 4174) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 September 2006: Further to his response to question No. 3906 (Hansard, 6 September 2006, page 144), in which countries, in what circumstances and on what dates was the death penalty commuted. Australia’s opposition to the death penalty is well known. In addition to co-sponsorship of an annual resolution on the death penalty at the former UN Commission on Human Rights, Australia has raised this issue with many of the countries we reported on in our answer to No. 3906 since August of last year. Regarding the conditions and results of our interventions, while we do not have information available that directly links a death penalty commutation to our efforts in every case, we do know that in some instances, our efforts have been successful. For example, we have made representations on four cases in Vietnam in recent years An Australian citizen was arrested on 16 June 2003 and charged with illegally trading in narcotics and sentenced to death. An application for Presidential clemency, supported by a letter from myself, was made in August 2005. Senator Ellison also wrote to his counterpart in Vietnam, and personal representations were made by Prime Minister Howard to the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Mr Billson also raised the issue with the Vietnamese Government during a visit to Vietnam in 2005. His application for clemency was granted on 30 December 2005. A Vietnamese citizen and Australian permanent resident was arrested in December 2002 for illegally trading narcotics and sentenced to death. An appeal for clemency to the President, supported by myself, was submitted in August 2005. Senator Ellison also wrote to his counterpart in Vietnam, and personal representations were made by Prime Minister Howard to the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Mr Billson also raised the issue with the Vietnamese Government during a visit to Vietnam in 2005. His death sentence was commuted to life early in January 2006. An Australian citizen received a death sentence in 2002 for drug trafficking. She made a request for clemency on 27 December 2002. The Prime Minister and I made representations to the Vietnamese authorities on her case. Her death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment on 8 July 2003. An Australian citizen arrested on 2 July 2003 in Ho Chi Minh City for illegal trading of a narcotic received a death sentence. His appeal for clemency was supported by the Prime Minister and myself. In August 2005 the President of Vietnam commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. The Australian Government will continue to encourage those countries that impose the death penalty to commit to the principles espoused in the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",257,Questions In Writing
