This came into being about four years ago and is funded under the auspices of nine local municipal councils. We have had a fairly chequered history in terms of parochialism in my area, but I congratulate the councils for putting together this joint authority. As I said, it is funded by the local councils in partnership with the state government and, of course, just recently, with the Commonwealth government through the Sustainable Regions Program. They have put together an economic development plan based on numerous studies in the past about areas that need assistance in order to grow our economy and to start to enjoy a rising standard of living in Tasmania. It was great to see the economic indices improving in the last economic report given by the Tasmanian Treasurer. The six shortlisted regional priorities undertaken by the Cradle Coast Authority related to participation in education, training and employment, investment in existing growth industries, value adding of traditional industries, creation of new long-term industries, protection of the natural environment and reversing the population decline. Twelve million dollars over three years is targeted towards these areas, and that shortlist is now being put into areas of strategic targeting comprising $2 million allocated to stronger learning pathways; $3 million to a tourism investment program and development in tourism; $3 million to food industry value adding, which is so important in my very fertile area of the north-west coast; and $3 million to wind farm related industry clusters. Wind farming is a burgeoning industry in my electorate and will get bigger now that Basslink has been signed off. We have wind farms popping up all over the north-west coast, which will add to and complement our hydro schemes and provide energy for Victoria, which so desperately needs it during the summer. Finally, $500,000 has been allocated to natural resource management careers, and $500,000 to family and business migration. The idea of allocating this $12 million over three years-and I congratulate this government for at least trying to look at a different model in the provision of priorities for regionswas, in fact, based on the Braddon Plan of the Labor Party at the last federal election. The government has pinched a good idea-and why wouldn’t you, if it can work for regions like mine that are doing it hard? I congratulate the Cradle Coast Authority on this initiative and look forward to working with it very positively, as I always do, to see economic development in our region continue to prosper even further. Environment: Wentworth Group Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.43 a.m.)-I want to commend the Wentworth Group for their Blueprint for a living continent document that they have recently produced. It is a very important benchmark for where we need to go in Australia to achieve a sustainable environment.

323,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.40 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to comment on the9156 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 bottom line, the social aspects still need a lot more development and understanding. We need a holistic approach to this if we are to achieve in Australia the sorts of outcomes all of us wish for. For example, a sustainable environment depends on the existence of a social system which sustains institutions and a culture which delivers to the people a life worth living in that location-it is a closed loop. The social system needs to deliver generations of motivated, skilled and committed people who can appropriately manage the land for the lifetimes it will take for its recovery. You cannot be green if you are in the red, and you cannot pull up your socks if you have none. The regions with the most degraded natural capital are the places with the least sustainable communities-as the young leave, the local economy shrinks and community infrastructure deteriorates or is withdrawn. Calling out a greater voluntary or cooperative effort in these circumstances is not effective. This is not to dismiss the extraordinary efforts of volunteer Landcare and other groups trying to protect land and habitat. However, too many of them report the burnout and frustration caused by having too few hands to do the work. While grants for fence posts, seedlings and wire are essential for the survival of such groups, so too are funds for facilitators, coordinators or even secretaries, paid at an acceptable salary and for a reasonable period of time, to coordinate, facilitate and do the legwork that was once done by volunteers. Addressing an unsustainable social system in regional Australia requires specifically designed programs or adjustments to universal approaches that compensate for the rurality impacts. The manifestation of these impacts include: declining school retention rates; poorer levels of access, participation and completion rates in higher education; poorer health; higher suicide rates; teenage pregnancies; and lower socioeconomic status compared with the total population. We have examples now where we understand through, for example, our ecosystem services that you can deliver incomes to some farms that are beyond the food and fibre incomes that traditionally have delivered them a livelihood. That is now being explored through Natural Heritage Trust funding, and BushTender in north-east Victoria is one such example. Indigenous protected areas are doing similar work. I call on all Australians to understand that for people to manage the landscape they need to have a life worth living. That requires some very serious understanding of their need to work cooperatively and to work across a whole catchment or a whole landscape. That is a new paradigm and it requires a great deal of very important thinking. I commend the Wentworth Group and I ask them to go further. Jagajaga Electorate: Eltham High School Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.46 a.m.)-I am very pleased to be here in the Main Committee this morning to congratulate one of the great government schools in my electorate, Eltham High School, which Deputy Speaker Jenkins would be very familiar with. Eltham High School has just received two awards in Australia’s Best Schools competition. Nearly 300 schools were nominated and Eltham High School was the only school across the country to receive a listing in two categories. That is a really outstanding result for this fantastic school. The first category in which the school received an award was for schools which display a high level of overall achievement in several areas that have been sustained over time. Eltham High School certainly fits into that category, whether for academic or extracurricular activities. It has a great record both inside and outside the classroom. I have seen the outstanding Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9157 work that the students produce in their written material, in debating and public speaking, in mathematics and in science extensions. The school really encourages the students to pursue their interests in these areas. In the creative areas of photography, media and visual and performing arts, the students are encouraged in the most active way possible to explore all means of expression. A couple of weeks ago I was at the school and it had the best display you could possibly imagine of outstanding art and craft works, which really shows the community the talent that exists at the school. The second category in which the school received an award recognised schools that excel in a particular area. Eltham High School received this award for its outstanding music department, headed by Mr Ken Waterworth. The music program involves about a quarter of the students at the school and is widely recognised as being exceptional. The children in the music department participate in both the Melbourne Bands Festival and the Royal South Street Eisteddfod, and they have won a number of awards. As Principal Paul Rose says, the school’s music program is second to none in Australia. I certainly endorse that statement. Music is very important in our family. I know how proud parents can be when their children are involved in their school music programs. When the children at Eltham High School perform it is an absolute joy to listen to the music they produce. It is outstanding. It is appropriate that this great school has received these awards because it does encourage participation so much. It is a wonderful government high school. I congratulate everyone at Eltham High School for their achievements. (Time expired) Environment: Envirofund work that has been made possible through the Howard government’s Envirofund initiative in my electorate of Ryan. Thanks to the Envirofund, four community groups in Ryan have been offered more than $57,078 to help protect our local environment. The environment certainly occupies the thinking of the good people of Ryan, and I am delighted to be able to inform them of the government’s funding for four projects. Every member of the House knows that the environment is everybody’s business, and that is what Envirofund acknowledges. Directly funding local community groups harnesses a community’s local knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm and brings together lots of people in the community to achieve a very positive outcome for the community. I have pleasure in informing the House about the four projects that have received funding. The Western Edge Revegetation of Smith’s Rainforest group is run by a Ryan resident, Mr John Smith, and he has received some $6,000. The Pullenvale Forest Park and Moggill Wetlands extension project, headed by the Pullenvale Catchments Group, has received almost $18,423. The habitat restoration that is taking place between Brisbane and the D’Anguilar Range, which is coordinated by the Moggill Creek Catchment management group, has received some $16,154. A group which is enhancing the protection of a significant koala habitat in the electorate of Ryan has received some $16,240. That group is run by the Moggill Koala Hospital Association. Through the $20 million that has been provided by the Australian government, Envirofund is making a tremendous contribution. It is continuing to help communities come together to address local issues and protect the natural resources that are in the community, which makes a difference to the quality of living for the people in our communities. The Howard govern-",143,Representatives Main Committee

This is about giving people the authority to have some control over their communities. To date, some 400,000 Australian volunteers have been involved in more than 12,000 Natural Heritage Trust projects, many of which are in the electorate of Ryan. The government’s Envirofund is a new community-focused component of the Howard government’s $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, and I am pleased to advise the people of Ryan that I am working very hard in this parliament to promote the environment. I will be coming up with a few initiatives in the new year that will further promote the environment and the people of Ryan’s very strong interest in it. Agriculture: Sugar Industry lian families and Australian jobs, and it is a huge kick in the guts for Golden Circle, which is one of the largest employers in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane and one of Australia’s most progressive companies. The government would like the community to believe that only a new tax can save the sugar industry. What will save the sugar industry is a genuine commitment from the federal government, which simply does not exist. As a son of sugar cane farmers from Bli Bli, I have always had a commitment to the sugar industry and understand its importance to the regional economy of Queensland. It is just a pity that the Howard government, and members of the National Party particularly, do not have the same commitment. The sugar industry want the tax because they know this government will not provide the funding for it in any other way. But the truth is that the sugar tax will hit Australian families and manufacturers hard for five years. The tax will have a particularly dramatic impact on Golden Circle, which employs up to 1,500 workers in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane and sustains hundreds of small businesses in that area. This company provides a livelihood for hundreds and thousands of people in the north-eastern suburbs, but it is also owned by primary producers. It is taking the fight up to the multinationals on the supermarket shelves-whether it is jams, canned fruit or their new range of baby products. What will the Howard government’s sugar tax do to Golden Circle? It will kick it in the guts, as I said before. At $30 per tonne, this sugar tax will cost Golden Circle $750,000 a year-funds that will come out of the pockets of Golden Circle’s growers and owners, who are the farmers of the near regions. What has the government done to defend those growers? Nothing. What has the member for Fisher done to defend those growers? Nothing. What has the member for Hinkler done to defend those growers? Nothing. At a time of severe drought across most of Australia, the Howard government has introduced a sugar tax that will punish one group of farmers to benefit another. That is simply un-Australian. Golden Circle, the grower owned cooperative, either cuts the dividends back to its growers-the farmers-or passes the cost on to the consumer; but it cannot pass the sugar tax on because that will only benefit imported products. Here we have a proud Australian owned company, a proud supporter of Australian primary producers, being discriminated against by this government and in particular the National Party. So $750,000 a year will be the hit to Golden Circle. If the Howard government were serious about the sugar industry, it would do what federal Labor proposed earlier this year, and what the Beattie government in Queensland is doing, and that is to find the resources out of consolidated revenue-but it does not have",145,Representatives Main Committee

This government, under this Treasurer and this Prime Minister, is taxing Australians out of existence. This government will say that anyone who opposes its taxing does not support the sugar industry. Well, we do, and we support the farmers, which is what the National Party is supposed to do but does not. Why punish the people who consume and value-add Australian sugar? Is that really an incentive for them to continue to support the industry? We need to support the industry, not sell it out. (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Links for Excellence in Engineering Program industrial boom has sparked an exciting new partnership between local secondary schools and various engineering enterprises in the city. Spearheaded by Toolooa State High School, Comalco and NRG, the Links for Excellence in Engineering program is a visionary collaboration which will tap the vast reserves of engineering knowledge and practical skills contained in the region and deliver those skills to local secondary students thinking of a career in the engineering sector. Other key participants include the Central Queensland TAFE, Central Queensland University, Boyne Smelters and the Office of State Development. The core facility will be the Gladstone Skills Engineering Centre, which will provide real life engineering experience while training students, with the aim of becoming Australia’s best-practice model for school-industry partnerships in engineering and manufacturing. The epicentre of this project will be the creation of an off-site campus at the NRG power station in Gladstone which will mirror the demands and expectations of a real workplace. The opportunity to create this state-of-the-art facility came through negotiations with NRG, which mothballed its apprenticeship training centre some years ago when the company outsourced apprenticeship training. By accessing industry-standard machinery and equipment, Gladstone secondary school students will develop high-level planning, communication and teamwork skills that they will require in the work force. With $10 billion worth of projects on Gladstone’s drawing board, the centre is both timely and relevant. Through its community fund, Comalco has already provided $237,500 towards the creation of the centre. Additional funds are being sought from ANTA. Comalco’s CEO Sam Walsh has made the centre his pet project. Pleasingly, the centre has triggered the possibility of creating further specialised school based training facilities in Gladstone, a construction program at Gladstone State High School and a business centre at Tannum Sands State High School. I congratulate the participating bodies and their representatives for their vision: Roger Atkins, Toolooa’s principal; Bill Fry, the TAFE director; Bob Prater, Head of Campus at CQU Gladstone; and Mark Greenaway, the coordinator from NRG. The Links for Excellence in Engineering program is indeed an exemplary project, and I am sure it will provide a stellar creche for Australia’s future engineering work force. 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded.

327,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins),"Order! In accordance with standing order9160 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 we are running slightly early. Amendment Bill 2002, when first presented in the House in July this year, was the transfer of the operational responsibility for the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to Comcare. The opposition indicated at that time that it was something we would be able to support. The Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority, otherwise known as the Seacare Authority, has responsibility for the occupational health and safety and workers compensation schemes for seafarers. The occupational health and safety responsibility arises under the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. The workers compensation responsibility is found in the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. According to the Seacare Authority’s latest annual report, the OH&S Act covers 29 employers and approximately 260 ships. The seafarers act covers 26 employers, 3,152 employees and 135 ships. All in all, the Seacare Authority has an important responsibility in ensuring the safety and well-being of those persons who work in the Australian maritime industry. It does this by protecting seafarers from risks to their health and safety and by ensuring that those who are injured at work receive appropriate rehabilitation and compensation. The authority itself employs no staff. It has seven members, six of whom are appointed by the minister. The chairperson of the authority is Mr Geoff Gronow, a lawyer, and the deputy chairperson is Mr John Rowling, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Safety and Compensation Policy Branch of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. Furthermore, there are four members selected from the industry, two of whom represent employers, namely, Mr Warwick Norman and Mr Malcolm Herndon; and two from the employees’ side, Mr Paddy Crumlin and Mr Martin Byrne. Mr Crumlin is the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia and Mr Byrne is the assistant federal secretary of the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. The last of the seven members is Mr Clive Davidson, who is the chief executive officer of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Labor supports the current compositional arrangements of the Seacare Authority. We say that it is appropriate that industry bodies such as the Seacare Authority draw on those who represent the employees’ interests through their unions, as well as industry representatives and other specialists in the field. It is also pleasing to note that there have been no work related fatalities under the Seacare scheme over the last financial year. Indeed, the industry has been fatality free for the last seven years. Unfortunately, however, it is the case that it is a dangerous industry, and the accident and dangerous occurrence rate and the incidence of injury continue at relatively high levels. The latest annual report says that the maritime industry has a greater incidence of compensable injuries than other high risk industries such as mining, construction, transport and storage. Its rate is considerably higher than the Australian average. Again, this reflects not the endeavours of those involved in overseeing the industry safety but rather the dangerous nature of the industry to which I have referred. Until 1997, the Seacare Authority was placed within the Department of Transport and Regional Services. In November 1997, with a shift in ministerial responsibilities, the operational",147,Representatives Main Committee

330,Mr Mcclelland,"The primary purpose of the Workplace Relations LegislationThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9161 responsibility for the Seacare Authority was transferred to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, as it is now known. However, with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations under the current minister, the government proposes that the Seacare Authority should move again, this time to Comcare. I can indicate that my office has consulted with representatives on the Seacare board and also with legal advocates who commonly do this sort of work, and they concur with the government’s proposal. Labor supports an arrangement whereby the Seacare Authority, which has responsibility for the occupational health and safety and workers compensation issues, will be more closely aligned to the Commonwealth’s principal provider of such services, Comcare. This will allow greater scope for the sharing of ideas, expertise and resources, and as such this part of the bill is to be commended. In October this year, the minister wrote to my office to foreshadow various amendments to the bill that would be principally of a minor or technical nature and would be directed at amending anomalies, updating obsolete provisions and smoothing out legislative hitches in acts of parliament that come under the minister’s portfolio responsibilities. After discussions with the minister’s office, all of the provisions now contained in the amendments that are to be moved by the government are agreed to by Labor. As stated earlier, some of the amendments are simply to update obsolete provisions or modernise the language of the relevant act, such as amendments to the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977. Some amendments will delegate provisions that require updating regulations from time to time. This approach has much to commend it in the context of these particular regulations because it will allow necessary changes to legislative instruments to be made more expeditiously in circumstances where they are essentially of a non-controversial nature. Other amendments remove sexist language, substituting gender neutral language. While this move is largely symbolic, it is nonetheless important. The changes dealing with the Criminal Code merely undo hitches which may have criminalised what should be lawful activities, such as casting a vote in a union ballot, and in other circumstances providing appropriate defences and qualifications. It should be noted that there are some amendments which perhaps exceed what could be called minor and technical, but they are sound and we believe they should be supported. For instance, I indicate our support for amendments that will allow for full benches of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal at first instance with applications for equal remuneration and orders to give effect to certain articles in the Termination of Employment Convention. Till now, such applications were to be dealt with by a single member of the commission, even though many such applications had a potentially groundbreaking effect on the nation’s industrial laws. We believe it is appropriate that such significant matters receive the attention of a full bench of the commission from the start, not just under an appeal procedure. I should also mention an alteration to section 170N of the Workplace Relations Act which will allow equal remuneration applications to proceed even during a bargaining period. We believe this makes sense. The important objective of ensuring that female workers are not treated in a lesser fashion than their male colleagues should not be put on hold simply because enterprise bargaining is occurring. There are also other alterations, which I will not specifically address. In our opinion, they all have merit and are supported. 9162 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 In concluding, I wish to indicate that the Australian Labor Party will continue to support balanced, fair and sensible legislative proposals from the government. I extend my thanks to the minister and his department for their cooperation and the information provided to my office in consultations over this bill. place Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, as it relates to further refinement and reform in an area of industrial relations which brings greater efficiency to the workplace. The main purpose of this bill is to effect a statutory transfer of operational responsibility for the Seacare Authority from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to Comcare. There are three reasons for these new arrangements. First, there are sound operational and governance reasons for these decisions, in that the location of the Seacare Authority with Comcare will avoid potential conflicts of interest that occur from time to time within this department where officers who provide secretariat support for the authority also provide policy advice to the government on the Seacare scheme. Second, the current arrangements are considered to be inefficient, given that a small departmental secretariat is attempting to support a small industry scheme when Comcare has the staff and expertise across the full range of workers compensation and occupational health and safety issues. That expertise should serve to reduce costs for both the government and the employers in the Seacare scheme. Third, there are natural synergies between the Comcare and Seacare schemes. Both are industry based schemes and the core business of each is injury prevention and the administration of OH&S, compensation and rehabilitation programs. Comcare already supports the Seacare scheme in relation to, firstly, the conduct of the internal review function on compensation decisions under the seafarers act; secondly, approval of rehabilitation providers; and, thirdly, the provision of impairment policy and assessment guidance for medical practitioners used in assessing injured seafarers. The minister has provided an assurance that the Seacare scheme will continue to be separate and autonomous. The Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority considered that there would be advantages to the authority and the industry in the new co-location with Comcare. The new administrative arrangements involving Comcare actually took effect on 1 July this year. However, the statutory scheme, which still refers to the department, has not yet been amended. The major purpose of this bill is to update the legislation to reflect these administrative changes. Back to the amendments. I will just give some background to this legislation. The background is that there are a number of Commonwealth statutes relating to occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. However, in terms of workplace legislation there are two major Commonwealth schemes. The first relates to Commonwealth employees and the second covers seafarers, and this is the subject of the amendments of this proposed bill. In relation to Commonwealth employees, the object of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 is preventative in nature and includes securing the health, safety and welfare of Commonwealth employees and employees of Commonwealth authorities. Commonwealth workers injured in the course of their employment are provided with workers compensation benefits and rehabilitation programs under the Safety, Rehabilitation",148,Representatives Main Committee
331,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.08 A.m.),"It is my pleasure to speak today on the WorkThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9163 and Compensation Act 1988, the SRC Act. Among other things, the act establishes a Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the SRCC. The commission has 10 members who meet at least three times per year. It carries out regulatory functions under the SRC Act, such as providing advice to the minister, producing guidelines for determination of Comcare premiums and issuing policy guidelines. The committee also has functions under the OH&S (Commonwealth Employment) Act. For example, it is required to ensure that statutory obligations are complied with, provides ministerial advice, advises employers and employees about occupational health and safety, collects and analyses occupational health and safety information, formulates occupational health and safety policies and strategies and accredits courses. Underpinning both statutory schemes is Comcare. Comcare was established under the SRC Act. Its functions include managing workers compensation claims made by Commonwealth employees. Importantly, too, it provides administrative support for both the SRC Act and the OH&S (Commonwealth Employees) Act. For example, Comcare has a statutory duty to supply secretariat services, assistance and staff to the SRCC, which has neither its own staff nor its own budget. The seafarers scheme is the second of the two. The Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992, the seafarers act, is part of a Commonwealth legislative scheme covering occupational health, workers compensation and rehabilitation for certain seafarers. The seafarers act is concerned with workers compensation and rehabilitation. It applies to seafarers or trainees employed on prescribed ships engaging in intraterritorial, interstate and overseas trade or commerce. The Commonwealth occupational health and safety statute relevant to the maritime industry is the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993, otherwise known as the maritime industry act. It is designed to address the causes of workplace accidents and thus reduce workplace injury. A major element in this act is a consultative framework to enable ship operators and maritime industry workers to cooperate in developing a safer working environment and better work practices, and the duties of care to be observed by all who work onboard ships and in offshore industry and mobile units, such as drilling rigs. The complementary relationship between the seafarers act and the maritime industry act is underscored by the fact that the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority, better known as the Seacare Authority, which is established under the seafarers act, also has responsibilities under the maritime industry act. Under the seafarers act, the authority’s functions include monitoring the operations of the act, promoting high standards of claims management and effective rehabilitation procedures, cooperating with other bodies to reduce the incidence of work related injuries, formulating occupational health and safety policies, accrediting occupational health and safety courses and, again, providing advice to the minister. Additional functions conferred on the authority by the maritime industry act include ensuring that statutory obligations imposed by the act are complied with, advising operators and employees on occupational health and safety matters, collecting and reporting on information relating to occupational health and safety and, again, formulating policies and advising the minister. Like the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the Seacare Authority is a part-time body which does not employ its own staff. It has seven members and its costs have 9164 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 to be met through the budget of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has provided policy and administrative and secretariat support to the Seacare Authority. The appropriation for the administration of the seafarers act in the department’s portfolio budget statements 2002-03 is $202,000. From the date that the proposed amendments come into effect, the appropriation will be transferred to Comcare. The opposition spokesman has referred to some additional amendments, of which I will also make some brief mention. There is a proposed series of miscellaneous amendments to the bill. I go to the effect of these amendments. The first amendment includes moves to modernise the National Labour Consultative Council Act 1977 to ensure its relevance and durability by renaming the ‘National Labour Consultative Council’ the ‘National Workplace Relations Consultative Council’, updating the purpose and membership provisions, clarifying the travelling allowance provisions and enabling regulations to be made for the purposes of the act. The second amendment clarifies the intention that an ex-Australian Defence Force memberan ex-ADF member-be able to be appointed to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal while being a member of the Reserves. It also clarifies the scope of the acting member provisions and removes sexist language, which the member for Barton referred to. The third amendment corrects unintended and unforeseen consequences arising from the enactment of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001. The next amendment amends the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to transfer to the Remuneration Tribunal the power to determine rates of travelling allowance for travel within Australia by presidential members and commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, better known as ‘the commission’. The rates are currently prescribed by the AIRC under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. A further amendment allows the commission to deal with applications for orders for equal remuneration during a bargaining period. The next amendment allows the full bench or the president of the commission to deal with certain applications arising outside the context of an industrial dispute. A further amendment requires the rules of the commission to allow for electronic lodgement of applications under part 6B of the Workplace Relations Act, including applications for certification of agreements. The second last amendment requires the president of the commission to provide information and documents as specified in regulations to the minister. The final amendment I wish to refer to makes other clarifications and corrects a number of minor typographical and drafting errors. I am pleased to speak on this uncontentious bill because it does what is intended. It is supported, as we know, by the opposition in that it streamlines and makes more efficient the operation of the seafarers scheme and will result in increased budgetary and working efficiency. I commend the bill and the amendments to the House. lation Amendment Bill 2002 is to transfer the responsibility of compensation and occupational health and safety from a seafarers specific organisation to Comcare. I think it is a very sensible proposal, brought into being partly because of the difficulties that have been experienced by the Seacare Authority in providing effective insurance for some of their activities. Moving into Comcare will allow effective coverage. The insurance arrangements for employ-",150,Representatives Main Committee
332,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.20 A.m.),"The objective of the Workplace Relations LegisThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9165 ees under the SRC Act were in doubt. The Seacare Authority commented in an issues paper that the Seafarers Act is largely modelled on the SRC Act. Many of the 2001 amendments to that act are also potentially necessary and relevant to the Seafarers Act. So there are a number of changes that are necessary to the seafarers act relating to insurance provisions. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has advised the authority that there are three reasons for the new arrangements. Firstly, there are sound operational and governance reasons for this decision to locate the Seacare Authority with Comcare. To me that makes a lot of sense because they basically do the same thing. We are putting seafarers within the Comcare ambit. I guess that is partly because Australian seafarers travel to international waters and so it is pretty hard for an authority or an effective mechanism to extend the reach of the Commonwealth to provide protection under Australian law. Comcare can do that. I think that is sensible. The second reason the minister has given for the changes is that the current arrangements are inefficient because there is a small departmental secretariat involved and that small secretariat has to provide the full range of occupational health and safety coverage necessary for seafarers. Thirdly, the minister’s advice is that there is a natural synergy between Comcare and seafarer schemes. Both are industry based. The administration of occupational health and safety and compensation rehabilitation programs are all part of the daily process of Comcare. I think this is good legislation. Having been involved in the Ships of shame inquiry-the significant inquiry that was done by a committee of the parliament to establish some of the working conditions of seafarers, both foreign and Australian-my view is that the legislation removes some of the special treatment that seafarers have had but does not reduce their entitlements in any way. So it makes a lot of sense. This is part of a package of sensible reform on which the government has embarked. In the last financial year of the Labor government real wages growth was zero. Over the life of the accord there was a five per cent decline in real wages. That is not acceptable. This government has been able to bring people employee entitlements. When companies have gone broke, the government has been able to increase real wages. Over the life of this government the lowest paid workers have received safety net increases of $82, a 7.9 per cent increase in real terms compared with the 14.9 per cent reduction in real average wages over the term of the Labor government. This legislation for seafarers fits in well with a package of changes made by the current government and I know that there are more changes planned. Even the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme, which is so strongly criticised by members opposite, has provided $360 million for employees under entitlement protection schemes. It has never happened before. The Labor Party had 13 years to get it right but did not. It took an incoming coalition government to solve the problem and provide almost 80 per cent of eligible workers with 100 per cent of what they are owed. Good stuff; they had no alternate schemes on the horizon. The legislation will bring seafarers within the ambit of Comcare, which is another sensible change. This will provide them with all the protection they need, solve the difficulty of insurance for employers and ensure that employers and employees are protected by that process. So what we will have in Australia will be a much fairer system. Looking ahead, I am pleased to see that the Democrats have agreed to the changes that we needed to have. The fair dismissal bill has also been finally acknowledged by the Democrats, 9166 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 so there are more changes there. The prohibition of compulsory union fees is something that the government is keen to introduce; it is very sensible legislation. The following changes have produced positive results and great benefits to the average working person in Australia: secret ballots for protection, a genuine bargaining bill, a fair termination process, the transmission of business and giving the IRC power to order certified agreements that do not transmit with a business, registration and accountability of organisations, improved remedies for unprotected action, simplification of agreement making and even some of the past activities and simplification of a number of matters that may be taken into account as part of an award. I compliment the government for the changes they have made. In the area where I live and work there is great activity at the moment and that can be sheeted home not only to a very buoyant economy but also to a more sensible working environment. It is sad to see that the Premier of Victoria wants to change that process and go back to the past. Even a member of the Grollo family-everybody in this place knows that the Grollo reputation of doing deals with the union movement is legend-has said, ‘We do not want to go back to those bad old days. We want to stick with the changes that have been achieved as they are much more sensible.’ The final straw that broke the camel’s back was the building unions recently deciding that they were going to go on strike because a couple of casual workers were terminated under the process that was outlined in their employment agreement. They were casual employees on 24 hours notice, but when they were put off in the appropriate manner a strike was called. Coming up to an election I guess the Premier of Victoria is vulnerable, but with his vulnerability he is gutless and will not stand for the things he should. He knows what is right. You can say what you like: we have not had trouble on the waterfront, nor have we had trouble with the Seamen’s Union in any way, because sensible things have been done. The sensible things include changes like this one that we are dealing with today that is moving the whole of the seafaring authority administration across to Comcare. That is one of the benefits of the changes by this sensible government, and it is time that the Australian Labor Party understood that, because they are out on their own. Even the 50 per cent rule will not change anything. It will not change the control by the union movement of the Australian Labor Party. in the committee today. It is almost a pavlovian response: you say something critical of the union movement and they respond to the bell ringing. I am concluding my remarks by saying that this is sensible legislation. We have all agreed to it. It is a great shame that the Australian Labor Party cannot bend a little to see what the majority of Australians want-that they should fail to take their orders from the union movement, the CFMEU and that bunch that are so active in Victoria, and come to this parliament to bring about changes that benefit the workers they claim they represent. ister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (10.31 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank members for their contributions to this debate.

As with the original bill, these amendments have opposition support. As the shadow minister indicated, they were fully discussed earlier with the opposition. I thank the shadow minister and his office for the constructive spirit in which these amendments have been considered. There is a range of them, but I will simply highlight three which I think are the most important in practice. One amendment will update the membership provisions of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council, taking into account the changes that have occurred in employer groups over the last few years. Another will enable the Remuneration Tribunal, not the minister, to determine the rates of travelling allowance for members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A further amendment will require the rules of the commission to provide for electronic lodgement of applications. Again these are housekeeping measures. Nevertheless, they are important and necessary, and I am pleased that that has been recognised by the opposition. I commend the amendments to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments.

Uncharacteristically, even though I was not a member of this committee, I want to commend the committee-",155,Representatives Main Committee
337,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.36 A.m.),"Let me say at the outset how pleased I am this9180 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 think, is a very good report. While I cannot say I agree with everything in it, I can say that the thrust of it and the subject itself ought to be brought to the attention of a broad section of our community, particularly those people who are responsible for making decisions in the education sector. SoI commend the committee and its members for the work they have put into their deliberations and for the excellent report which has been drafted by the committee secretariat. As colleagues of mine were on that committee, I make that commendation personally. Uncharacteristically, as I say-I would not normally do that, but in this case it is warranted. Prior to entering this place, I was for some time a schoolteacher. I am the father of two young boys. The subject that this report addresses is something I am very concerned about, not necessarily because of my own children but because of what I see in our communities generally-and that is right across the board. It is worth pointing out that we have seen much social change over the last 20 years-in fact, the last 50 years-whereby relationships within our community have changed. I might say that due credit for that must be given to those people who ran and drove the campaign of feminism, which has brought about the empowerment of many women and given them a great deal of freedom-although there is still a way to go in that area. On the other side of the coin, though, there is a real question about men’s identity. I notice that the majority of us here in this chamber are male, and we have a view of our own identities. But I just wonder how our view of our identity as males is shared by other people in our community, and I think understanding what it is to be male is a real issue. I think this report partly addresses that issue. It is certainly clear that many males do not have a clear idea of what it means to be a man. For young people, particularly young people in schools, there are few clear models of what it is to be a man in contemporary society. Modelling is a very important learning process for children. Exposure to different examples of behaviour gives children an idea of what types of behaviour are appropriate. Many commentators have noted the conflict between social stereotypes for males and social values. There is the social concept of the very masculine man-the hero who is uncommunicative and withdrawn-which conflicts with current social values of being articulate, educated and having excellent communication skills. This creates some obvious problems and adds to the confusion that exists for boys and young men. Whether we like it or not, gender identity is central to our sense of who we are. Given that the meaning of being male in contemporary society is so unclear, I do not think the findings in this report are all that surprising. I want to see young men fully engaged in our society and given a place within it where they can contribute effectively. The level of disaffection of our young people is soaring. The best indicators of this disaffection and disengagement are the horrendous levels of youth suicide, particularly in regional and rural Australia. The poor performance of boys at school is very concerning. However, it is only one indicator of a wider social issue that this parliament must start to address. The report paints a clear picture of boys’ underperformance in many areas of education. In terms of the literacy levels in primary schools, the National School English Literacy Survey of 1996 found that on average boys do not perform as well as girls in each of the aspects of literacy: reading, writing, speaking and listening. Furthermore, the difference between boys and girls is greatest",167,Representatives Main Committee
338,Mr Cadman,That’s terrific. Thank you.,168,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Snowdon,"It is my pleasure. I commend it for its work and for what generally, IThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9181 in the lower socioeconomic groups. National literacy benchmark data in 1999 for years 3 and 5 show that girls consistently outperform boys. In terms of year 12 retention rates, it is clear that increased education is associated with decreased unemployment; that is, keeping kids in school increases their likelihood of getting gainful employment. The cost of leaving school before a person reaches year 12 has been estimated to be $74,000 over the duration of their lifetime. Nationally, the retention rates for boys and girls were equal in 1975. In 2000, the gender gap in school retention was 12.6 percentage points. I also draw to the attention of the House one of the most striking features of the entire report: the school retention rates in the Northern Territory. While the national rate of school retention to year 12 in 2000 was 72.3 per cent, in government schools in the Northern Territory only 27.2 per cent of boys and 35.2 per cent of girls complete year 12. In non-government schools, 50 per cent of boys and 68.2 per cent of girls complete year 12. This is slightly better but still appalling in comparison with the national average. These figures in comparison with the national rate of 72 per cent are an indictment of successive governments that have failed to provide adequate educational opportunities for all Territorians. You might be thinking, ‘Have you taken into account the Aboriginal factor?’ But what difference does it make? The fact is that only 27 per cent of boys in Northern Territory government schools finished year 12 in the year 2000. The education system should be structured in such a way as to address the cultural values of particular sections of our community. This is particularly so when it comes to Indigenous Australians. It is very clear that the education system in the Northern Territory has not come to terms with its obligations to fully comprehend and provide appropriate educational services for Indigenous Territorians, and particularly for Indigenous males. On countless occasions I have been on my feet in this place berating both sides of politics for their failure to address the real disadvantage faced by people in the Territory every day. I find myself doing it again, but I will not stop working for justice for people in this situation, and most particularly for equal treatment and fair and equal outcomes in terms of education. This situation is not surprising and is indicative of general social trends. At one level, the data showing that boys are not doing as well as girls at school is not surprising; the poor performance of boys reflects broader social trends, not debatable psychological differences inherent to boys and girls. The development of gender identification is one of the most prominent and important processes of development. By the age of three, children have a strong sense of what is appropriate gender based behaviour. For some boys, particularly those in lower socioeconomic groups, appropriate career choices do not involve higher education. Historically, boys’ career choices have involved apprenticeships and manual or unskilled labour. However, it is now evident that these types of job opportunities are rapidly diminishing. These changes in opportunity have coincided with a definite change in socially acceptable careers seen as appropriate for boys. As mentioned earlier, the last 50 years have seen a revolution in gender relations. Society has rightly and very effectively redefined what it means to be a woman, but it has been slower at redefining what it means to be a man. For some men this has resulted in a crisis of identity. We are now at a point at which we must actively redefine what sort of behaviour is appropriate for men. This process is already happening, but it is one that we in parliament have so far avoided. The men’s movement is evidence of this change. It involves men asserting their identity as men in a way that respects women and acknowledges the value of both genders. 9182 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 The idea that someone like Steve Biddulph, author of such books as Raising Boys, could draw hundreds of men to a men’s meeting would have been laughed at 10 years ago. In the Indigenous field, Mick Dobson’s recent address to an Indigenous men’s conference is evidence that Indigenous men are striving to forge new standards of what it means to be male in the 21st century. The impetus for this movement has been a great deal of pain and confusion, which to some degree may be reflected in the poor performance of boys at school. The report includes some very important internal contradictions that need to be mentioned. It has not decided whether gender identity is something that should be encouraged or dissuaded. At one point, the report comes close to stating that gender identification should be dissuaded. Point 3.20 states: ... that boys and girls, men and women, should be consigned to particular roles in society merely by virtue of their sex is rejected. Gender roles and gender identity are interconnected ideas. This statement is akin to saying that boys and girls are no more than individuals and should be treated as such. And yet the report then goes on to treat boys and girls as legitimate groups by making recommendations that affect boys and girls differentially. I contend that it is not treating boys as boys and girls as girls that is the problem; it is a debate about what it is to be a boy or a girl. Once we have worked that out in a socially acceptable way we can move on to treating them as such. We need to actively redefine where boys and girls differ and the ways in which we should treat them as equals. I also note that the report, when discussing the effects of family structure on boys’ levels of educational attainment, says ‘government policy is relatively ineffective in influencing such things as family structures’. I contend that this is a cop-out. The casualisation of the work force has dramatically affected family life, increasing stress on fathers and mothers. This parliament should not underestimate its ability to lead and effect social change. If there is one positive thing the government should be doing, it is helping to build stronger families and making better fathers-fathers who can communicate effectively with their children and who can help them navigate through an increasingly complex society with a seemingly overwhelming number of choices. This can be done through giving boys the skills they need to be successful people: teaching them to be better communicators and more effective in resolving disputes. The problem is not psychological; it is sociological. I am very cautious of this report’s implicit emphasis on inherent learning differences between boys and girls. This emphasis mirrors the report’s emphasis on the individual rather than on social gender identity which is inherently collectively based. The emphasis on different learning styles suggests that boys’ underachievement at school is psychological and can be addressed almost exclusively by changing curriculums and teaching styles. There is a general assumption that girls are innately more verbal than boys. It is true that girls score higher than boys on verbally based tasks and boys score higher on visuo-spatial tasks, although the cause of this difference has been a hot topic of debate in psychological literature for the last 40 years. What is clear in the literature is that the difference between boys and girls in these tasks, particularly visuo-spatial tasks, has dramatically decreased over the past 30 years. This suggests that the difference in learning style preference is based on socialisation. The problems faced by boys in contemporary society are generally socially based; that is, causes are not psychological but social. The danger in psychologising these problems is that, as leaders Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9183 of this society, we are effectively able to escape any responsibility that we might have to shape and effect social change. Boys in contemporary society need good role models of what it is to be a man. The great lack of male teachers in the primary and secondary education systems means there are very few, everyday male role models for many boys. The representation of men and women and their relationships is very important. There are many boys now who lack adult role models or whose experience of adult men is of those who are uncommunicative, violent or abusive. The socialisation of boys within families and schools is increasingly distorted by the increasing absence of appropriate and constructive male role models. These boys come to rely on alternative and usually unbalanced models of masculinity which abound in the media and popular culture. These alternative models readily display such qualities as restricted emotionality, excessive self-reliance and non-relation attitudes towards sexuality. Media depictions of sporting heroes display a very restricted view of masculinity, including being extremely competitive, tough and stoic. Masculinity is much broader than this; but how are we to teach our boys this if there is no-one to model this behaviour for them? The report correctly identifies the need to get more male teachers into schools, particularly into primary schools. If there is one recommendation that should be implemented with urgency, it is the one to engage more males in the schooling system. Boys need to see that it is not unmasculine to be caring or to show that they are hurting or are troubled. Further, boys need to know that it is okay to be loving in the broadest sense. If there is one thing that I want to be able to model and teach my boys, it is this: it is masculine for men to love and be loved. the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training into the education of boys, Boys: getting it right. I want to thank my colleagues, many of whom are here today, for the opportunity to join them after the parliament reconvened last year and to continue as a member of the committee. As a father of three boys, it was an invaluable experience and one on an issue that has concerned me for some time. Indeed, I have seen my wife crying at times because she felt that our sons were being disadvantaged by a system which she, as a teacher, did not understand. As a highly qualified individual in the education area, she was unable to identify the factors that she felt were disadvantaging our sons as compared with females. She did not feel resentful towards the education of females; she just felt that there was an unfairness in the system for our sons. I think the committee identified with its first recommendation the real reasons why the establishment-the institution of education-has appeared to have got it wrong. The committee’s first recommendation is that: ... the Minister for Education, Science and Training act to have McEETYA revise and recast Gender Equity: A Framework for Australian Schools into a new policy framework which is consistent with The Adelaide Declaration on the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century and reflects the positive values expressed in that document: I think this is the crux of what we came to, because it is fair and it is positive. Recommendation 1 continued: the framework should provide an overarching policy structure for joint and distinctive boys’ and girls’ education strategies which➾ address boys’ and girls’ social and educational needs in positive terms;",168,Representatives Main Committee
340,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.51 A.m.),"It was a pleasure to be involved in the report of9184 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 ➾ allow for school and community input to address local circumstances; the achievement of the goals and values expressed in the framework and the boys’ and girls’ education strategies should be evaluated against a range of social, employment and educational indicators; and these indicators should be used by McEETYA to inform changes in policy and practice to ensure the social and educational needs of boys and girls are being met. It is not just about young people or students generally but boys and girls being considered as individuals. I think that the more we can individualise and meet the needs of a person being educated, the more we are likely to achieve. The more an individual’s deficiencies and abilities are understood, the better equipped the teacher will be to present a relevant and worthwhile teaching program to properly meet that person’s needs and maximise their potential. I quote from the report again: Gender Equity: A Framework for Australian Schools was formulated to account for these concerns and the document states clearly “that boys have needs that are not being met effectively by schools.” However, Gender Equity: A Framework for Australian Schools is not a fundamental re-examination of the gender equity strategy intended to tackle boys’ education issues from the ground up as happened for girls. In fact, a footnote to the introduction exhorts people to read the National Action Plan for the Education of Girls 1993-1997 as a companion document. Therefore, right at the very base of this process we have an unwillingness to look at the educational needs of boys as being something that is distinctive and, in fact, just lumps both genders together as if they were identical. They may be equal, but they are not identical. During the hearings it was surprising that, when asked, witnesses could not provide evidence or quantitative research to support the introduction of the 1997 gender equity framework. One of the flaws in education that I feel most strongly about is changes being implemented and not evaluated or monitored so that we can find out where we have come from and where we are heading. We seem, in many instances, to come up with an emotional response to what is perceived to be a problem, write a program for that, make a statement, change the system but not then evaluate the process. In every other walk of life we tend to do that, but in education generally we do not and that is a shortcoming that I would like to see changed in education in Australia. The factual circumstances identified in this report make it a serious national problem which we must do something about. Let us look at the achievement of boys and girls in terms of the raw data and the key indicators: in measures of early literacy, 3.4 per cent fewer year 3 boys and 4.4 per cent fewer year 5 boys in 2000 achieved the national benchmark than girls; the retention rate for year 12 boys was 11 points lower than the retention rate for girls in 2001; and girls were achieving higher average marks in the majority of subjects at year 12 and the gap between girls’ and boys’ total marks had widened markedly. For example, in New South Wales in 2001, the average tertiary entrance score for girls was 19 percentage points higher than it was for boys-and you can track it over a period going back to about 1987, when you can see the difference starting. In admissions to higher education, 56 per cent of university commencements are female. And there are other indicators-suspensions, expulsions, truancy, even juvenile delinquency-you can run through which indicate that boys are not achieving as well as girls. I would like to draw the committee’s attention to a quote from Dr Kenneth Rowe, principal research fellow of ACER, regarding literacy, where he says: Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9185 As for specialist maths or four unit mathematics at year 12, a content analysis has demonstrated that on average the level of the nomenclature and the sophisticated verbal reasoning skills that are required for us to even understand what the problem is is on average four times greater than that required in Australian history and English literature. So not only does the student have to understand what is being asked, they must translate it then into a mathematical logarithm and justify or explicate the solution. That is an anti-male process because, as the committee identified, the level of boys’ language skills is not generally as high as it is with girls. Therefore, an additional penalty has even been built into subjects such as science and mathematics. I trust that governments, state and federal, will look carefully at the recommendations the committee has brought forward. Not only is the policy basis identified as being off track and wrongly oriented; it is also not fair to all children in the education system. The national economic potential is being demeaned and lessened because we are not taking advantage of the potential of all of our citizens and all of our young people. We are creating measurable social problems such as truancy, juvenile crime and delinquency. The recommendations for literacy and numeracy, which are foundational and most important, run through the connection between schools, teachers and male role models in the teaching system. The report comes forward with a controversial but sound proposal on HECS programs for equal numbers of male and female teachers. That is a recovery type requirement. It would not normally be seen as radical, except that the number of males within the teaching service has declined so much. The report recommends that the Commonwealth work in conjunction with the states and territories to provide the changes that are needed. The recommendations bear some analysis and cannot be read separately from the report. The report, I think, is a very good report. I would like to pay tribute to the chairman, Kerry Bartlett, for the skills that he brought to the process, and also to the deputy chairman, Mr Sawford, for his cooperation, knowledge and experience in this area, both as a teacher and as a member of this committee. Your contribution was very valuable, Rod. The committee was a parliamentary committee in the best sense of the term. The report was struggled over. I think that is a good thing, because a report where you struggle over the wording and struggle to get the concepts right and clearly expressed is often the best report. It forces you to go right to the substance of the evidence that is taken, analyse it carefully and present it by way of the parliament, saying to the citizens of Australia, ‘This we believe. This is our considered opinion after having gathered every bit of evidence we could.’ This was not a prejudiced or biased process. We had a couple of wonderfully gifted female members of parliament help us, so it was not a gender favoured process. The recommendations were our sincere conclusions as a parliamentary committee. The staff were wonderful. The opportunity of comparing the Australian system with the New Zealand system was a bonus. We found that in New Zealand and internationally they have identified the same problems that we have identified in Australia, and they are struggling with remedies as well. The committee was willing to go right to the core of the thing and look at the gender equity problem and the way it is being expressed. We do not wish to offend women. We maintain that women have been disadvantaged. We want to make sure that they are not disadvantaged again. The committee believes we should continue to make sure that girls are not disadvantaged, but that we should not neglect boys in the process. This is not a process which says, ‘It has been the girls’ time and now it is the boys’ time.’ It says, ‘The girls have reached a level of achievement which is wonderful to see. It is wonderful to see young women achieving what 9186 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 they are achieving, but not to see boys fail.’ We could be accused of neglecting boys’ interests if we continue with the populist or politically correct line of saying that the gender equity process we have established should not be challenged or changed. We need to do that. We need to go to the root of the problem, change the curricula, the processes and the teacher education program and make sure that male and female teachers understand the different cognitive processes of boys and girls. Boys and girls learn in different ways, and teachers need to be aware of that. It is not something that depends on more male teachers; it depends on people understanding. I conclude with the anecdote that we had in Queensland from a male teacher who took the adventurous step in his school of splitting the sexes for one year. He taught the boys. He said that it was the greatest challenge he ever had because their attention span was so short, their activity levels were so high and the range of topics that they wanted to examine made it extremely demanding for him. When I questioned him about whether he wanted to continue it for another year, he said, ‘No, I’d rather have a mixed class next year because the pressure levels to retain that high level of teacher input will drop with the girls coming in, as they are more word focused and will be able to take the concepts that I offer the class much more easily than the boys.’ I thank the secretariat and my colleagues for a very valuable exercise. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (11.06 a.m.)-The tabling of the report Boys: getting it right by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training is most welcome and I congratulate the committee on this quality contribution. The report has been a response to a perception that boys are underachieving in education and do seem in our society to be struggling to find positive ways to express their special identity. The report found that there are many research measures and indicators to confirm and demonstrate that with regard to the achievement of boys in education the perception is reality. The 2000 statistics show that in literacy fewer boys than girls in year 3 and year 5 achieved the national benchmark. The 2001 statistics revealed that the retention rate for boys-that is, the number who stayed on at high school and completed their senior secondary studies-was 11 percentage points lower than that for girls. Comparison of the results in years 10 and 12 between boys and girls show that girls are outperforming boys in the majority of subjects and that the gap between their scores is widening. Girls now take up 56 per cent of admission places at universities in Australia, but boys are still figuring very well at the tertiary level, based on vocational skills at certificate level. Also, let us not forget that, post education, girls still have some problems with careers that are dominated by men and that the glass ceiling, post education, is still real. In schools around Australia boys also dominate the suspension and truancy rates, as well as the remedial learning and behaviour programs. Although 80 per cent of students suspended from schools are boys, some would suggest, and I would agree, that ethnicity and social circumstances are major determinants, as well as gender, and that these factors also need to be looked at when trying to address these outcomes. But that was not the role of this committee. The aforementioned indicators combined should be sufficient to set off alarm bells with educationists and with government departments and ministers. However, the committee also noted in its inquiry the worrying trend in social outcomes and indicators for boys. These social indicators show that boys figure at a significantly higher level in suicide rates, instances of substance abuse and self-harm, in motor vehicle deaths and Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9187 injuries and in juvenile crime. Although the inquiry report necessarily confines its terms of reference to the role of education in impacting on the quality of life and outcomes for boys, it goes without saying, but is always worth repeating, that turning boys into fine men must encompass many areas of social action as well. Although not a member of the Standing Committee on Education and Training, I have had almost three decades of experience in education as a teacher, a trainer of new teachers and a principal, so the report is of particular interest to me and to the many parents and teachers of boys in my electorate of Newcastle. For me, the recommendations do pass the scrutiny of experience but I know that many of my former colleagues in education will say, ‘We have been telling governments this for so long. We welcome the recommendations but we want action, resources, commitment and leadership by the federal government.’ I agree with them entirely. The recommendations are important, and so they must be appreciated by this parliament to successfully guide government action. Discussion, then, is necessary. To my former colleagues I say this: although I know how frustrating it is that this government seems slow to respond to the ever-changing needs in education, let us take every opportunity to remind them of the dimensions of the problems faced every day in schools around Australia. This report’s recommendations, although resulting from an inquiry into boys’ education performance and needs, also respond to those wider challenges. In that spirit, the report recommends a national policy framework that provides for joint and complementary education strategies for boys and girls but also emphasises the need for education strategies that deal effectively with the nature of learning by individuals as well as by gender. The report also recognised the need for parent training, teacher training and professional development, the importance of literacy for educational and vocational success, and the very apparent need to introduce incentives for merit based appointment of more men in the profession of teaching. Fortunately, the recommendations are not about advantaging one group over another. They are not about making boys more like girls, or vice versa. The report is in no way tokenistic to the issues of gender and education but emphasises the need for approaches to education that are gender complementary as well as gender specific. In the gender education debate there have been critics who would say that girls were overassisted in early gender policy initiatives and therefore boys were overlooked. This is a simplistic view, but I note that submissions to the inquiry point out that, in responding to underperformance by girls, girls were actively encouraged to take on the success areas dominated by boys at the time. Those included sport, mathematics and science, leadership, self-esteem and similar programs. Obviously this approach did assist girls to lift their collective performance outcomes, but no doubt this success did have a significant impact on boys, as they struggled with some of the current social challenges and changes to education generally. The report makes 24 recommendations, but I take the opportunity to emphasise just some of those that my experience as an educator suggests are paramount and urgent if young people in Australia, particularly boys, are to achieve their potential and make valued and positive contributions to their personal relationships, their community and this nation. Recommendation 2 deals with pre-service and in-service training and emphasises teachers’ understanding of individual and gender based learning styles. Certainly 30 years experience tells me that girls and boys are different, and that is something we all should celebrate. The 9188 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 recommendation includes joint funding for this approach to teacher training. I impress upon members that, when a teacher is effectively able to respond to the learning styles and needs of each child that they have responsibility for, success is more easily assured. But that is very hard; learning styles are different and learning styles change. The children of today learn from their pre school environment-before they come to school-and for the majority of them the information age is a real part of that process. Their world is more cluttered with the signs, symbols and sounds of communication, but there is less quality discrimination perhaps in the barrage of information they are exposed to. That is recognised in recommendations 4 and 6, which emphasise the need to build strong foundations in literacy and numeracy through parent training. As a former educator of young children, it seemed to me very evident that children no longer have the patterning of language, the wonderful experience of jingles and nursery rhymes or the play experiences that support prenumeracy skills. In this busy world, where parents are generally working and where there are many sole parent families, those sorts of experiences that we thrived on are certainly no longer part of many children’s pre school experiences. Pre school, boys particularly do not engage in language as much as girls do. The reasons for that are strongly linked to cultural habits and stereotypes. The need for boys to be physically active and to engage with their environment is clearly responded to and understood by parents, but the need for that to be supplemented by language training is not so well appreciated. A child who is exposed to and encouraged to participate in an enriched language environment has a greater chance of literacy success when formal instruction is commenced. Of course, successful behaviour management with babies and pre school children is a challenge that any parent is aware of but that not all parents can overcome or respond to well. The report’s support for education and awareness programs for new parents is something that would be welcomed by educators. Early intervention is absolutely crucial, and if I have any criticism of this report it is that it was constrained in placing enough emphasis or giving sufficient guidance to government to take on the challenges of social and educational early intervention. Recommendations 5, 7 and 8 identify the importance of literacy learning to educational and post-education success. These recommendations support hearing and vision screening. The parliament needs to be aware that in many states these screening programs have been cut. They have been reduced and actual on-site testing in schools is no longer occurring in the same way that perhaps you and I experienced. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of carrying out screening programs for vision and hearing in schools at regular intervals so that health workers and teachers can interact and discuss any concerns teachers may have. Often this face-to-face interchange reveals other physical conditions that impact on a child’s learning and well-being. Cost cutting in this important area often leads to rather expensive consequences later in life. The report also responds to the submission by Australian Hearing regarding auditory processing. It reveals wonderful new research that shows boys are at a disadvantage with auditory processing, and learning language is not just a visual response but very much an auditory response. Recommendations 7, 8 and 9 look at the need for strong literacy programs. They also suggest joint funding of a literacy coordinator in every school-something I know that all schools would welcome. They also target literacy in secondary schools. Secondary teachers, who are very much focused on content, certainly are finding it more difficult to incorporate communication learning and communication skills across all areas of the curriculum. Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9189 Recommendation 13 goes to something dear to all teachers’ hearts, and particularly those who teach young children-the reduction of class sizes to 20 in years kindergarten to 3 by 2005. While the committee recommends that the Commonwealth contribution should be to the capital cost that that would incur, obviously wages would be the highest cost. I think that there might have to be some cost sharing in that area for that to be implemented. No measure could perhaps be more significant. Recommendation 17 targets teacher training, emphasising behaviour management. A big issue for teachers in schools, whether it is teaching boys or girls, is the integration of children with special needs into mainstream classes. Some of those children exhibit their frustration with their disabilities and special needs through behaviour difficulties. That is another area that I think the report does not emphasise enough or come to terms with, but perhaps submissions were limited in that area. Certainly particular programs, and support for teachers, are also needed to help manage the behaviour of children with social difficulties that may arise from parenting problems, such as in sole parent families. The other area that I was particularly pleased to see emphasised was the personal qualities and suitability of teachers. It has become much more evident that there is a need for that sort of matching to be done. Of course, to attract people into the profession of teaching means that remuneration and inducements for teachers need to be addressed, as stated in recommendation 18. Recommendation 20, that a substantial number of HECS-free merit based scholarships be provided for equal numbers of males and females to undertake teacher training, is a wonderful initiative. I congratulate the committee on that. I also note the New South Wales Secondary Principals Council submission, which stresses that economic and structural changes have been major factors impacting on the education of boys. They say that the change in the economic market and the jobs that are being created mean that boys with lower education outcomes have no job opportunities. In my electorate of Newcastle, we have high youth unemployment and lower retention rates in high school, and boys figure very strongly in both those. Those retention rates are exceeded in areas such as Wollongong and comparable areas on the North Coast and in metropolitan Sydney. Certainly, in my electorate there is an urgent need to improve those retention rates. I note that a submission was received from a leader in the field of gender based programs, Richard Fletcher, who is well known and very well regarded in the Newcastle electorate. Richard is the manager of the Men and Boys Program under the auspices of the Family Action Centre of the University of Newcastle. Their work is outstanding. He is a leader in the field and perhaps a good friend of Steve Biddulph as well. Together, they are certainly making a difference in this field. I also point out to the parliament the ALESCO program run by the WA in Newcastle. That program uses some federal and some state funding to target kids who have left school before year 10. It is a wonderful success; 30 students took on this program this year and 20 will actually sit exams. Those kids would never have gone back to education without this program. Of course, boys dominate those figures. I also want to point out the wonderful contribution that boys make in Star Struck, a program in Newcastle that sees boys and girls performing on stage. The boys mass item is a wonderful feature every year that has given a great boost to performing arts for boys and the opportunity to showcase their special talents. 9190 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 There is certainly a need for schools to recognise that boys do like a bit of risk and excitement. I will always remember very fondly, having been the principal of perhaps the most disadvantaged school in my electorate at the time, the introduction of a circus to the area. This circus gave boys and girls the challenge not only of performing but also of conquering skills and fears. It was particularly successful. Therefore, camping programs, experience based learning and learning that is relevant are of particular interest to boys and should be retained because they capture their interest and attention and complement the way they like to learn. I stress that this report is an excellent one and that the government must respond to it. Education is the key to the future success of this country, and I urge the parliament to pursue the implementation of this report’s recommendations. port by thanking my colleagues on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training. It was an honour for me to be a member of that committee and an honour to be part of the group that has brought this report to the parliament. I enjoyed working with all of the members on the committee and valued their input and experience greatly. I also thank the committee secretariat. Quite often, people forget the enormous amount of work that is put in by the secretariat, and they did a great job in collating this report. I also want to thank all of the people throughout Australia that contributed to this inquiry. We had over 200 submissions from a broad range of people: individuals, associations, groups et cetera. We had submissions from famous people like Sid Sidebottom, a member of this House; his contribution was excellent as well. An opposition member-Outstanding! his submission, but we had a wide range of submissions and that is another reason why this report has developed into such a meaningful document. In addressing the report in particular, I will speak primarily about the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in an area that most people would accept as critical-education. That relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories-and how it grows and develops-plays a key role in addressing some of the significant challenges that we currently face in educating young Australians. As much as Australians have acknowledged the importance of continually improving our children’s education, to my way of thinking there remains considerable inertia towards change that in the 21st century is simply not good enough. Key areas of concern included in the report touch on gender equity framework, curricula, pedagogy and assessment, literacy, teacher-student relationships, behaviour management, male role models in schools and the school environment. A disturbing trend which I think emerges from the report is the lack of a more cooperative approach by the Commonwealth and the states and territories. I believe this lack of a unified approach, if you like, is acting as an increasingly significant inhibitor to real progress in educational reform. I believe there are two clear-cut areas where a more unified approach would provide real benefits for all Australian students, both girls and boys, and they are data collection and the monitoring of the outcomes of Commonwealth funding. If we look at the data collection area, this is important because it enables the genuine evaluation of educational models and their performance in achieving practical outcomes for our children. During the inquiry it became increasingly apparent that it was very difficult to",171,Representatives Main Committee
341,Mr Pearce (Aston) (11.21 P.m.),I begin my remarks on the Boys: getting it right re,178,Representatives Main Committee
342,Mr Pearce,"Yes, it was an outstanding contribution. In the report there is a quote fromThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9191 obtain comparative-or, if you like, apples with apples-data from the eight different states and territories. This is largely because of the very nature and the stand-alone operation of their respective education systems. As a result, the report recommends that national education data currently available be reviewed with the focus on providing greater consistency and uniformity in the future to ensure that decision makers have access to the most comprehensive information available. The second area I would like to touch on is the monitoring of the outcomes of Commonwealth funding. This is increasingly important as the federal government invests in education at record levels. Future federal governments of whatever political persuasion may become reluctant to continue to increase funding for education given that quite often the states and territories are not prepared to increase their own funding. There is growing concern that additional Commonwealth funding might simply be used to offset the diversion of state and territory resources elsewhere rather than deliver further benefits directly to Australian students. This concern is reasonable given the deliberate decision of every state and territory, despite being primarily responsible for funding, not to match the consistent increases in Commonwealth funding in recent times. The major question is whether the states and territories will continue to drag their feet on reforms which provide greater consistency and uniformity across Australia for the benefit of all of our kids. An example of this is the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan. The plan represents a coordinated approach to improve the literacy and numeracy standards of all Australian children, which involves assessment, reporting and remedial action where necessary. The National Literacy and Numeracy Plan is a prime example of what can be achieved if the Commonwealth and the states and territories work together to improve education in Australia, but it should be the rule rather than the exception. This does not mean that the states should surrender their role as the deliverers of educational services; rather, it means that better outcomes for all Australians can be achieved by sensible cooperation between the state, territory and federal governments. For the sake of maximising the achievement of all Australian students now and in the future, the states and territories need to realise the potential for mutual benefit from working together in the delivery of education to local children. This most recent report of the standing committee identifies the increasing disparity between the educational achievements of boys and girls. It shows that in many key areas boys are underperforming when compared with girls. This should sound warning bells not only to all parents of boys but also to all concerned with the future of our society, and indeed our economy. We cannot expect to compete in an increasingly sophisticated and educated world if our male students are achieving below par. Of course, finding and implementing solutions will not be easy, but at least in this area we have hard, comparable data from around Australia which tells us that this is a national problem. Whether it is totally an educational problem or whether it also involves the role of parents and a change in society’s attitudes has yet to be determined. But, in a world made even smaller by technology, it is increasingly important that we have comparable education standards across Australia. If the states and territories want the Commonwealth as a financial contributor, they should also be prepared to accept the federal government as a partner in bringing all governments together to achieve improved standards in education and in the collection and dissemination of research which will help us create the right educational framework for our children in the future. 9192 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 The federal government is committed to help provide the best possible education for Australian children. The government has demonstrated this commitment by increasing its investment in Australian schools in every budget since its election. This year it will see total funding of $6.5 billion provided by the Commonwealth. Recognising the importance of making this investment work harder for our children, the government has provided national leadership in developing higher educational standards for Australian students. This hard work by the Commonwealth is already beginning to deliver benefits, with initial results already showing an improvement in literacy and numeracy skills among Australian students. I commend this report to the House and, in particular, I commend it to the states and territories. By working together, the Commonwealth and the states and territories can deliver better educational outcomes for our most precious resource, our children. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (11.31 a.m.)-I too, along with most other members, welcome the report of the Standing Committee on Education and Training on the education of boys and wish to commend the committee for its inquiry. I do think it brings together in one document a number of aspects of a discussion on these issues that has been occurring throughout our education system in the states and the Commonwealth and at the school level for some considerable time. I do think it creates an agenda for the Commonwealth. However, I hope and trust that this is not the end of the matter, because I think there needs to be continued discussion and there is much still to be done. In particular I want to speak today about that broader debate. There are issues in our society that have a significant interconnectedness to the matters which are the subject of this report. That is where I think the debate and discussion need to go next. Let me commence by acknowledging the work of an organisation which is known as Boys Forward. Ian Lillico and Chris Gladstone founded Boys Forward. Ian Lillico is an education consultant who has worked for the Western Australian education department for over 27 years, and I understand he gave evidence to the inquiry. Ian has worked as a teacher, a head of department, a deputy principal and a principal, and Chris Gladstone has spent over 30 years with the education department in Queensland. These two men bring a wealth of real life experience to the problem of boys in schools. Their approach is one based on the real world, one of direct experience, and Boys Forward is about a holistic approach to the issue of schooling and subsequent employment for boys. Ian was successful in obtaining a Churchill Fellowship in the year 2000 and he prepared a very detailed report for the ASPA conference. This report contained no fewer than 53 recommendations on the subject of the school reforms required to engage boys in schooling. These recommendations went far beyond the question of what happens in our schools. They were not just about professional development for teachers and, as a whole, I would commend them to education authorities generally around Australia. One of those issues that they talked about was the importance of male role models and as part of that, I guess, the question of the nurturing of boys and the need to give them hope for the future. I just want to address these issues briefly. Recommendation 10 of Ian Lillico’s report stated: The sense of touch has become dirty in our Australian culture but is absolutely essential for connecting with boys-particularly by parents and teachers. Violent and aggressive boys are often the victims of being under-cuddled as young children and touch therapy is one of the techniques used worldwide for bringing these boys back on track. Even though stranger danger is essential we have to allow for boys to Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9193 be given a pat on the back; a shake of the hand etc when they have done something well. We must allow teachers to do this without fear of recrimination to develop a connection with boys who communicate their feelings for each other in a non-verbal way through wrestling and play fighting. I think this is a huge challenge for educators and for the Australian community because of the fear of recrimination about things like sexual abuse and inappropriate contact that have now built up in our communities. I believe we need to take this debate forward and explore it, particularly when something as important as nurturing and touching is considered to be a respected therapy in assisting people who have been alienated from our society. I believe that this is just one area where the debate needs to be taken forward. I was fortunate this morning to hear much of the comments made by the member for Lingiari in this area. I would wholeheartedly concur with those remarks and look forward to greater discussion in that area alone. The second part that is important is the question of hope in our society for boys and young men. I want to put this in the context of recommendation 27 from Ian Lillico’s report, which states: Adults need to be optimistic about the future so that boys will be also. Our media is very negative and doom and gloom is in our papers and lounge room every day of the week. Adults must balance the negativity with hope and optimism as many boys fear the future, are anxious about their future lives as men and often don’t want to grow up. I think that is entirely accurate, and, to a certain extent, who can blame them when they look forward to employment prospects in Australia at the moment? Almost one in four people are employed in casual and temporary employment. This is particularly so amongst young men, who are becoming the next largest growing group in the ranks of part-time and casual employment. Another example is in the area of home ownership. In Australia we are seeing a decline in the opportunities for young people to become home owners. I think young men are particularly conscious of that and do feel that sense of gloom and doom. I have surveyed a number of 16and 17-year-olds in my electorate of Hasluck. One question on the survey was: what do you fear the most? I was absolutely overwhelmed to discover 27 per cent of them were fearful of war and the fact that, as a consequence of decisions made by adults in our society, they would be caught up in that. SoI think if we are going to be serious about creating an environment where boys get an opportunity to reach their true and full potential, then the debate needs to go far beyond just what is happening in our schools. The professional development of teachers as well as attracting them into the profession are critical in this area. I think most people would now acknowledge that, in the same way we suffer from a shortage of nurses in our community, the next professional group to face similar shortages is teachers. That is something that we need to address now and as quickly as possible. One factor that most strongly influences outcomes in this area is the value that we place upon occupations. You often hear that dreadful truism quoted: those who can, do; those who can’t, teach. It is a fact, I think, that teaching is not an honoured profession in this country. We laud our sporting stars and our actors; we rarely extol the virtues of our teachers. Frankly, I think you have to ask yourself who has more influence over our children. I think each school day Australian children spend more time in contact with their teachers than with any other adults. You might ask: when was the last time the Australian of the Year award was made to someone in the teaching profession? Where is the public recognition of this most important 9194 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 occupation in Australia? In that regard, I join with others in giving credit to the Australian newspaper for the series that it ran on excellence in education. It held up teachers and schools as important, so it was a small step in the right direction. Teachers deserve our respect and appreciation, and they deserve our ongoing and continuous recognition of the importance of their role. To that end, I think we must take immediate action to address what will be an increasing problem. I understand that the federal government’s response to the committee’s report was to set aside a substantial amount of money in the area of professional development; I think it was some $82 million over the next three years. On my very rough calculations, that is somewhere around $102 per year per teacher for professional development, and I think the support should be vastly more than that. The federal government needs to have regard for the fact that it has the primary responsibility for teacher education, and current policies are undermining that. The nearly $3 billion cut to university funding has contributed to this problem. I am advised that some 7,787 people who were qualified to enrol in teaching at universities in Australia were turned away due to a shortage of places. You cannot say that we value teachers and the role they play in the community and then not provide the necessary funding support in the higher education system to see them gain their training. In that regard, I commend Thornlie Senior High School in my electorate. As part of their vocational education and training program, they have piloted a program for 16and 17-yearolds on the study of teaching. The program exposes them to practical experience in the classroom and gives them an understanding of the more detailed requirements of the profession. It is hoped that a number of the students who undertake that program will see teaching as a valuable profession for them to head into in the future. The other area that the report touches on is the relationship between boys’ education outcomes and parenting and family situations. I want to commend another school in my electorate, the Midvale Primary School. For many years they have been about implementing an open school program which effectively brings the community into the school and as part of that includes families. They have successfully run the FAST program-Families and Schools Together-which creates an environment for promoting the roles of teaching and the school and involves the parents in that program. As part and parcel of its operation, the program identifies and deals with family issues. I have previously expressed concern that funding cuts in the area of family and children’s services to the stronger families program has seen the winding up of that program at Midvale Primary School, and I again urge the Commonwealth to consider this issue. If it values the recommendations in this report, then it will recognise the interconnectedness to issues in that broader area. I would like to urge members to examine what they can do in their own electorates to see that the recommendations of this report are implemented. I am pleased to say that, in my own state of Western Australia, the state minister for education, Alan Carpenter, has announced the largest teacher recruitment campaign for government schools that we have seen in Western Australia. Some additional 2,300 teachers are to be recruited for the start of next year, with a major priority being to attract male teachers into primary schools. I think the Western Australia government ought to be commended upon that. The Western Australia government is also spending $28 million on behaviour management and discipline strategies in a number of schools, and as a result of that program we have alThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9195 ready seen significant improvements in attendance rates and suspension rates. An extra 347 teachers are being placed in primary schools next year to give all primary schools the flexibility to operate with a maximum class size of 24 students. I think that the Western Australian government, as I say, ought to be commended for that action, and I hope that we will see similar results in other states. As I indicated at the outset, I think the report is a valuable document. It provides a great challenge not only to education authorities but to members of parliament and the Commonwealth and state governments. I can only conclude my remarks with the hope that we are up to that challenge. already said in the context of this debate and on the tabling of this report, but I want to take the opportunity to make a few further comments, particularly in light of the media response and some media statements since the tabling of the report. The report certainly has stirred quite a degree of media and community interest. That is not particularly because of any great quality of the report itself but because of the very issues that the report raises. The issues in the report do touch a nerve in the community and resonate strongly with the concerns of parents, teachers and some academics in this whole area. Certainly not everyone has agreed with everything the report said, nor would we expect that to be the case. Some disagreement and some debate is a healthy thing. Certainly the report has prompted and initiated that debate, and that is a healthy thing. However, it has been disappointing that some of the responses to the report had been somewhat superficial. I want to respond to two of those areas that I thought required some further elaboration. The first concerns some comments that have seen the report in the context of a wider gender debate and seen it as part of the ongoing gender debate in the community about competition between men and women. This is particularly unhelpful, and I think it is particularly inaccurate in terms of the context of the report and what the report was trying to do. As one example, I quote comments by a Sydney university academic, Bob Connell, in an article in the Australian newspaper on 29 October. He referred to the report as resuscitating the ‘competing victims syndrome’ and the debate over which sex is treated worse in the classroom. He said: To the extent the current debate has been shifted back into a boys vs girls framework, it is damaging to education. Gender equity policy discussion has already moved beyond this dichotomous thinking, but it seems that some commentators on the issue haven’t caught up. Until the current flurry of publicity, I thought the rhetorical battle had died down. I’m shocked we’re back where we were 10 years ago, having a gender war. It doesn’t reflect what all educators want, which is a good education for both boys and girls. This report was not part of that rhetorical battle, and it is not part of a gender war. In fact, any reading of the report makes it very clear that that is not the case. We pointed out very clearly in the report that education is not a competition between girls and boys. That is not what the report is on about, but it is naive to pretend that there is not a problem. It is naive to pretend that boys are achieving as well as girls or that they are achieving as well as they ought to and as well as they could. The underachievement by boys can and must be addressed simultaneously with raising the achievement level of girls as well. We can certainly-and we mustaddress the underachievement by boys without threatening the gains that have been made by girls over the past two decades. The report made that very clear. To see this as part of an at-",178,Representatives Main Committee
343,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (11.45 A.m.),"by leave-I do not want to repeat what I have9196 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 tempt to somehow resurrect a gender battle really is simplistic nonsense and a misreading of the report. One encouraging indication-it is only a very small one so I would not want to place too much emphasis on it-that we can close the gender gap and raise the achievement of girls and boys simultaneously is the change in the national literacy benchmarks between 1999 and 2000. Again, I do not think we can place too much emphasis on that. It is a very short time frame, but over those years at both the year 3 level and year 5 level the gender difference has diminished and the achievement levels of girls and boys have both risen. We can do both. We can close the gender gap. We can address the underachievement of boys while at the same time promoting further achievement for girls in education. This is not a competition. It is not part of a gender battle. It is not in any way a threat to the achievements that have been made by girls. Some of the comments around this-we saw them in some of the submissions as wellwere really quite misleading. Some of the attempts to defend the status quo in schools, particularly in terms of the achievement of girls, were framed in terms of what happens post school. Some even said, ‘It doesn’t matter because in the end, it all sorts itself out. Women do not do as well in the workplace. So if there is a bit of an imbalance in school, it all sorts itself out in the end.’ I contend that that is wrong. Clearly, the fact that 56 per cent of university enrolments now are women and not men suggests that inequities in the workplace in higher paying careers are very soon going to change in any case. Since we did the report, I phoned Sydney University to ask them about the top faculties in terms of university entrance. In the eight faculties at Sydney University that require the highest UAI admission-those eight faculties, presumably the most competitive ones, have something to do with workplace career potential, earnings potential-58 per cent of new enrolments are women, not men. It is a nonsense to say it all evens out in the end. Even if there are still inequities in the workplace, you do not address them by ignoring the imbalance in schools. It is our responsibility as educators and as governments to do what we can to ensure that all students, boys and girls, are achieving to the maximum of their ability at school. Some of this rhetoric has been defended in terms of the issue not so much being girls or boys but being other factors such as socioeconomic status et cetera. A number of contributors said that is the wrong question. You should not be asking about girls or boys; you should be asking which girls and which boys? The report acknowledged that there are differences between socioeconomic levels. Particularly and most importantly at lower socioeconomic levels the disparity is the greatest. We need to be addressing disadvantage in education for girls and boys right across the country because of remoteness, rurality, aboriginality and low socioeconomic status. Within that disadvantage, we need to be addressing the underachievement of boys, particularly at the lower achievement levels. The second area I want to elaborate on is males in teaching. I want to refer to the submission of the Australian Education Union. Following the debate, I was interested to see the response by Denis Fitzgerald, the Federal President of the Australian Education Union, to the committee report’s assertion that there has been a state of denial. It is almost as though he is in denial about the comments about the denial. I note for instance in the Australian, in the same article to which I referred, Mr Fitzgerald said: It’s a worldwide crisis in masculinity and not a singularly Australian phenomenon. Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9197 That might be the case but that does not in any way diminish the importance of it. It might be a worldwide crisis. The evidence shows that in nearly all OECD countries boys are underachieving compared to girls. We cannot dismiss it as some sort of a crisis in masculinity. It is an issue in education. It is related perhaps to broader issues of masculinity but it needs to be addressed in our schools. In that same article, Mr Fitzgerald says-other commentators and union spokesmen have also said since the tabling of the report-that male teachers is not really an issue; it does not really matter that much. That prompted me to go back to the submission by the Australian Education Union. They said: Another misguided concern often raised in the context of boys’ education is the lack of male teachers and the impact this has on boys. They went on to say: Research has found that the sex of the role model is less important than the modelled behaviour. We would all agree with that, but that is not the point. The point is that you cannot dismiss the sex of the teacher as having no impact on boys. It is an issue. The evidence to the inquiry made it clear that it is an issue that needs to be addressed. Nor is it adequate to say, as the submission said: Suffice to say that, with the decision-makers in schools and the bureaucracy being predominantly male, it is hard to fathom such a statement. The preponderance of male role models throughout the media, business and society is another factor to consider in rebutting any statements of a lack of influence by males on boys in schools. The point is that that is a denial of a problem that is there. We do need more males teaching in our schools. This is not to say that women do not teach well. We all acknowledge that women can and do teach every bit as well as men. Women can and do teach boys, and boys with learning and behavioural difficulties, every bit as well as men. But the point is that boys need both. They need to be exposed to different learning styles and different teaching styles. With those opposite who have taught before, we know that the temptation is to tend to teach in ways that we learnt. If most of our teachers are female, the style of teaching is more-not entirely, but more-inclined to follow a pattern of learning that perhaps does not reflect boys’ learning style. I also point out that boys, as well as girls, need positive male role models. That is particularly the case since we have seen an increasing amount of family breakdowns. In just 11 years, between 1989-2000, the growth of one parent families with kids under 15 years of age has grown from 14 per cent to almost 21 per cent, with 89 per cent of those households headed by women. That is not to say that there is anything wrong with what those women are doing in their families, but boys need positive male role models in their lives. Just as boys need to see women in positions of authority in school, they need to see men in positions of authority, men in front of classroom and men in positions of caring and interaction with them. It is important that they have balance in the classroom. Also, if we are trying to give the message to boys that education is important, we need to have men in the classroom. If we say to boys, ‘It is important that you learn, you try hard at school and you do your best,’ and they look around and see that there are no males in the school and, in some cases, they have never had a male teacher-and they might be in year 6-they might quite rightly ask, ‘If education is so important, why aren’t there men doing it?’ It is very important that we practise what we preach. We have a situation now where only 21 9198 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 per cent of primary school teachers are male and 10 to 15 per cent of those coming into teaching are males, although it depends on the particular institution they enter. Thus, the committee has made recommendations regarding the need to bring more males into teaching. The report has made 24 recommendations. I know that some of these carry quite a large price tag and some of them are the responsibility of state and territory governments but, if we are serious about the education of our children and if we are serious about providing maximum opportunity for, and maximising the achievement of, boys and girls, we need to address these concerns and seriously take on board these recommendations. The responsibility is there for state and territory governments and for the Commonwealth government. Not all the recommendations carry a large price tag. The first recommendation, regarding a new framework that sets out positive goals and values with distinct, as well as common, educational strategies for boys and girls, can be achieved without a large price tag. Greater focus on preservice teacher training, developing skills in pedagogy, making our teacher trainees aware of different learning styles, equipping them to be able to teach literacy and numeracy in ways that address the learning styles of boys as well as girls, can all be done without a lot of extra spending. The guidance that we have recommended for parents in developing preliteracy and prenumeracy skills in their children can also be achieved without a large commitment of funds. But, ultimately, some of the recommendations will require funding and it is essential that governments take these responsibilities seriously. In conclusion, I thank everybody who has been involved in this inquiry. It was a pleasure to work with my colleagues. I also thank the many people who gave valuable evidence to the committee. I thank the secretariat for the tremendous work they did. There is no single cause for the undereducation or the underachievement of boys. There is no single answer. The recommendations that we have made are a step in the right direction. It is essential that these recommendations be taken on board. We can no longer ignore the underachievement of boys. issue of the education of boys and, in particular, to comment on Boys: getting it right, the report of the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training into the education of boys. I would like to acknowledge some significant contributors to the inquiry: the current chair, the member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett; the deputy chair, the member for Port Adelaide, Rod Sawford; the inquiry secretary, James Rees; and the former committee secretary, Richard Selth. They played a very significant role in the fashioning of this report based on the evidence presented to the committee. As the previous speaker, the member for Macquarie and chair of the committee, alluded to, the report has elicited a response-and, indeed, that is exactly what it should have done. The report is based on, and is a response itself, to what people regard as an important issue in education; and not just in education but in society itself. It is a serious report dealing with a serious issue. The fact that it has elicited that response is very good. There will be a full range of responses to the 24 recommendations made in this report. Indeed, it was a long standing inquiry: it started on 21 March 2000. Some 21 members of the House of Representatives have been involved in it; that shows its importance. It has received 231 written submissions and 235 witnesses have come before the committee. There has been significant input. That is how importantly this inquiry has been regarded.",183,Representatives Main Committee
344,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.00 P.m.),"I am very pleased to contribute again to theThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9199 However, while it is all well and good to comment on the report, one hopes that the report is actually being read in to to and that people are not just rushing to the recommendation pages. We tried to take that into account in the way we structured the report in that there is an introduction, an executive summary and then the body of the report, which try to give some substance and context to the recommendations. We welcome comment and positive criticism of this report so that we can advance this issue. I was a little taken aback by one commentary on the report by a Mr Christopher Bantick, who wrote an article in the Hobart Mercury, which is a daily distributed throughout Tasmania. I believe the article was also syndicated in some other papers on the mainland. The lead-in to the article says, ‘The public debate about educating boys is largely missing the point.’ The public debate that he was talking about is centred and based on this report. The first thing that the author criticises is the title of Boys: getting it right. I assume the title is being criticised because, according to the critic, this report did not get it right. There could be no other reason why he did not like the name of the report. However, it is always difficult to come up with a name for a report which encapsulates the issues you have been looking at and which stimulates debate. The author goes on to say, as a few other commentators have said, that basically the report says that the answers to the way we deal with boys in education are to pay teachers more, get more male teachers into the profession, have smaller class sizes and offer scholarships. That is their assessment of our report. If you read the recommendations of this report, you will see that those things play just a minor role within the context of assessing what the issue is, what is happening now, what we can do to assist boys and girls in education and in the outcomes of learning, and the things that governments, communities and schools can do to make it better. If that is their full assessment of this report, they did not read it. I suspect they did read some parts of the report, because they then head off to comment about some of the submissions. I need to point this out. I do not mind criticism-that is fine-but in analysing this you will see some of our problems in trying to have this report taken more seriously by people who profess to be educators. Mr Bantick claims to be an educator, certainly in the past. His article says: The report, unhappily, is not a waffle-free zone. What does ‘a waffle-free zone’ mean? It goes on to say: Much in it is contentiousOkay. That is interesting. It then says: ... and plain wrong. That is an issue. One of the interesting things is that the author goes on to say: Take, for example, the quoting of Ian Lillico, principal of City Beach High School in Perth, Western Australia. Lillico notes: “Boys, in particular cannot make the connection between what they are doing and how they can use it.” The author goes on to say that we all know this is ludicrous. To be fair, the author did not go to the quoted submissions from Ian Lillico, a noted and respected educationalist who spent a great deal of time writing a submission for this. The report quotes Mr Lillico extensively in parts because we regarded that evidence to be considered and well tested. It states: Boys like to be able to see how what they are learning relates to life outside or beyond school and may find it difficult to engage with what appears to [be] irrelevant subject matter. 9200 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 It quotes Mr Lillico: The curriculum has to be relevant. The idea of teaching some of the things that we have learned, and maybe have never used since school, is very difficult to get across to kids these days who want to see how it applies to their lives. Boys, in particular, cannot make the connection between what they are doing and how they can use it. For heaven’s sake, if you take the quote in its full context it is purely and simply saying that people, but particularly boys, learn best when it is relevant to them. Mr Bantick is criticising a noted educationalist for something that is totally out of context. He goes on to say that what is wrong with boys, and where the report gets it wrong, is that nobody likes boys for what they are. He says that is what is wrong with the report. He talks about what is wrong with boys and about the indices that are at work and that show that they are not getting the desired learning outcomes and all other outcomes that we regard as important in education, and says that the reason is that we are not concentrating on what they do well; we concentrate on only what they do not do well. For heaven’s sakes, if he read the report again, he would see that the whole report is supportive of young people-all young people: boys and girls-and people in education, and of course it stresses the things they do well. But this report deals with what we regard as some of the difficulties in learning outcomes; otherwise we would have a massive tome before us. To level that criticism at Mr Lillico and the report is, I think, absolute tripe, to be fair. I would also like to point out that Mr Bantick says: One of the clear messages the report delivers is that boys need positive role-models. Although this is a reasonable idea, it should not be achieved at the expense of women teachers. To be fair, this report constantly points out that we are not involved in the business of saying that we need more men teachers because they are better than women teachers or that we should have fewer women teachers so that we can have more men teachers. That was never said or implied. For him to imply that we have said that women teachers are not good teachers and are not very important in the lives of their students is absolute rot; but that is what he has implied. The article goes on to say: There is a risk that, following the report’s recommendation of more male teachers in boys’ schools, blokey role-models may fall into the very worse kind of misogynistic yobbism. How that is derived from the report is beyond belief. Just as an example, the section on male teachers in the report is positive about male role models as it is about female role models in schools. But nowhere does it advocate that we have male role models in schools just for the sake of having them. They are there for a positive reason. At paragraph 6.95 on page 161, the report says: An understanding of gender issues is important but the role modelling and teaching by males whose relationship and commitment to boys is genuine is the most important factor. The report then quotes the transcript of evidence of Mr John Flemming, System Director, Boys in Focus: We know that they watch us very closely, so the way we work with women, the way we talk to women, the way we can work as a colleague is something these boys are watching all the time because in the environments that they are from that is not the sort of relationship they are used to seeing. We are very aware of that sort of thing, that what we display to the boys is what they will want to take on board. Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9201 That is why we have male role modelling in the report. SoI found the article very trite and unfair on the report. I do not wish to labour the point. Of course we want people to make a critical response to this report, but I ask publicly that people read it and not quote selectively from it to push some bandwagon that they may be running with or to get some sensational idea up so that they can get some interest in their column in the newspaper. This column is headed ‘Crazy about boys’. I think that is just crazy. I have certainly gone off track here but it had to be done. It was in the system; the juices were flowing. I would like to point out, as I did last time, that this report-and I am very proud to say this-has basically said that the Commonwealth should put its money where its mouth is in assisting in the education of children in schools, particularly boys. There are 11I thought it was 10 last time, but my numeracy skills are not too good-specific recommendations involved with funding, either in a joint sense with the states, or by the Commonwealth on its own. Very quickly, these recommendations include joint funding for additional professional development for practising teachers, learning the strategies that work successfully and passing them on and sharing them; that the Commonwealth fund further research into the impact of different assessment methods on the measured relative attainments of boys and girls; joint funding for the implementation of the strategies used in the Victorian study on auditory processing in primary schools throughout Australia; increased joint funding for teachers’ professional development and that it be directed towards a greater focus on literacy, early diagnosis and intervention to assist children at risk. This is a hell of a lot more recommendations than a few of the critics have said that we have recommended. This is real mechanistic stuff. Other recommendations include joint funding for the provision of a literacy coordinator and an early intervention intensive literacy teacher in every Australian primary school, the proportion of a full-time equivalent load depending on the size of the school and the measured level of literacy need; that the Commonwealth ensure that existing funding under the literacy and numeracy program to support students in middle years is used effectively to provide intensive literacy support programs; and the reduction of class sizes in years K to 3 to no more than 20 students by 2002. That is a very significant contribution. recommendations were that the Commonwealth fund research to evaluate different approaches and strategies to maximise engagement and motivation of boys and girls in the middle years and to fund comparative research into the influence that different school structures, curricula, assessment systems, the availability of alternatives to senior school, behaviour management and other factors have on the apparent retention rates and attitudes to school of boys and girls. Very important is the sharing of information and strategies and alternatives to senior school. We should fund assessment of existing programs being run by states and territories and community organisations to assist the most vulnerable and disengaged students with a view to expanding successful programs. That is very mechanistic; very practical. The Commonwealth could provide a substantial number of HECS free scholarships for an equal number of males and females to undertake teacher training.

Finally, I would like to congratulate every teacher involved in teaching in our schools both boys and girls-male and female teachers-and to congratulate them on the great job they do. It is our job to support and assist them and I am very happy to do that. standing committee with potentially emotive inquiries like this one is not easy to achieve. However, this particular committee report, Boys: getting it right, did achieve unanimity in all the recommendations. That is some achievement. This is not to say that there was not vigorous debate and strong exchanges of view. I am sure the chair will agree on that. But we did achieve it and we got there. I think Alan Cadman made this morning a very relevant point: it was a better report for that process of vigorous debate. I have already spoken in the House on the tabling of the report and I do really appreciate the opportunity to speak in a more informal way on aspects of the report that possibly may be overlooked but that I think are important parts to be acknowledged. When the submissions were first received and the first public hearings were under way, the committee could have taken partisan views on some of the loopy left and the very reactionary right views put forward and on the conspiracy theories on both sides. But to the credit of everyone on that committee-all 21 members-it did not occur and the committee members did retain their objectivity. That objectivity was tested again and again, particularly by the majority of academics, practically all state education departments-public or private-Australian Education Union spokespersons and some spokespersons of professional associations, whose responses were generally of denial, distancing and distraction to the questions of committee members that there could even be a problem with the education of boys. It was therefore refreshing and instructive that at the very first meeting of the committee the Commonwealth department of education put the inquiry into a context with factual information. They suggested in no uncertain terms that differential attainment levels across the curriculum between girls and boys was indeed occurring. It was also instructive to hear the views of experts and academics: people like Dr Ken Rowe of ACER; Dr Catherine Rowe, a Melbourne paediatrician; Professor Faith Trent; research fellow Malcolm Slade from Flinders University; Richard Fletcher; Richard Brown and so on. They expressed serious concerns, and they have been doing so for a long time, about the direction education was taking in this country in dealing with boys’ needs. However, no-one ought to be surprised that some of the most powerful evidence came from principals, teachers and the students themselves. One could not help but be impressed by the professionalism of so many Australian school principals and their teachers. Let us give two contrasting but nevertheless similar examples of the outstanding professionalism of Australian teachers. Roseville Public School is located in a very affluent area of Sydney. The principal and the deputy principal have an objective, no-nonsense approach to education, regardless of politically sensitive rhetoric or propaganda. They recognised they had a problem with increasing differential attainment levels between boys and girls and that they were not acceptable. They went to the parent body with a plan: relieve the deputy principal of",189,Representatives Main Committee

They costed it; it came to 100,000 bucks. The parents took up the challenge. They raised the money. Fathers, many of them executives with flexible work schedules, became involved in the school day. In less than four years, the differential in attainment levels between boys and girls was reduced from over 20 per cent to around one per cent. That is as it should be, because boys and girls have intrinsically similar intellectual capabilities. Were the gains made by the girls compromised? Of course not. Both girls and boys had higher attainment levels. It took four years. There were clear aims, a structured, balanced curriculum and explicit, active teaching. There was no magic recipe but plenty of common sense and hard work. That is what they did. What they did not do tells a story, too. They rejected the propaganda; they rejected the rhetoric; they followed their professional instincts to deal with a very real problem they identified, and they were not prepared to deny it. However, that success costs money. Eagleby State School in Queensland is located in a low income, low employment area. Fortunately for the students and parents of that school, they had a principal appointed who was also not prepared to accept low attainment levels for boys or girls, and that it was a low socioeconomic area was not going to be an excuse. He trained large numbers of parents and then involved them every morning in literacy and numeracy programs-explicit, active and structured. The principal led a remarkable turnaround in the attainment levels. Again it took four years. That is right: it took four years. There is no overnight or fast track to success; it is determination and hard work. It has ever been so. There are three distinct periods of education in Australian since 1950, and I mentioned this in my previous speech but I want to mention it again. From 1950 to 1970 education in this country decidedly favoured boys. This is when I went to school-and you, too, Kerry. Sid of course is much younger. Higher retention rates, higher attainment levels at year 12, higher university admissions-it was all in favour of boys. But in the next period, 1970 to 1990, it changed around. Here is some data. In 1976 the retention rates for girls and boys in this country were exactly the same. In 1981 in New South Wales the difference in attainment levels between boys and girls at year 12 was less than one percentage point. That is not the case now. I will not go back and repeat all the indicators that people have mentioned in this debate, but we all know that they have gone the other way. If the figures were reversed, would that data be acceptable? Of course not, and nor should it be-and it is not acceptable in the current form. Some people have tried, unsuccessfully, to paint the report as nothing more than pushing a competition between boys and girls-denial-or as a report that wishes to diminish the gains made by girls. The report does no such thing. There is not even a hint, not even a word of that. In fact, it states quite clearly the opposite. The report encourages all girls and all boys to achieve their potential. That is as it should be. That is in the national interest. The current situation is not. The committee also went to New Zealand and talked to politicians, education bureaucrats, union and school representatives on the matter of boys’ education. None of the committee members was surprised at what was said on the record: comments were remarkably similar to those made by their counterparts in Australia. It is a little different in New Zealand-we had 9204 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 drinks and nibbles afterwards, you see, and it was a little bit informal, whereas here in Australia they came in, they spoke and they left. Here are some quotes I took down, and Alan Cadman will remember these because I made sure when the person spoke to me that he came over as a witness. Here is one from a senior bureaucrat: ‘IfI said what I believe, that would be the end of my career.’ Another person said, ‘Political correctness has confused the whole education debate, and not just the boys.’ ‘Thank goodness there are still some principals and teachers who follow their instincts as to what works or does not work,’ said someone else. ‘I am afraid intimidation of contrary views is par for the course these days. Conformity is the name of the game.’ Teacher training has also lost its way in this country. Boys and girls do learn differently-it has always been the case. Go back to the Greek philosophers. It is not as if this is a new thing, for goodness sake-it is a basic fact-yet it is being ignored in our teacher training institutions. Boys are disadvantaged-not all boys but most boys-and some girls are also disadvantaged. For too many prospective teachers the profession is undervalued, and it is relegated to a second income status. The principal of Scotch College in Melbourne reported to the committee that not one boy in his school, which has an enrolment of over 3,000, wanted to be a teacher-not one. Males in the primary intake in New South Wales, as reported by the chair, are less than 20 per cent. The committee has recommended HECS-free scholarships on an equivalent basis for male and female trainee teachers to redress the current imbalance. I hope the government takes that up. We have also recommended higher remuneration for schoolteachers. You cannot have a profession as important as teaching continue to be disregarded in the community. The kids know this and will tell you, ‘It is too hard for too little money.’ Current policies affecting the direction of education need to be appropriate for all boys and girls. The gender equity framework which has been spoken about today was agreed to in 1997 as a national policy. It is a totally inappropriate policy. The genesis was the report entitled Girls, school and society. There is nothing wrong with that, but it was just slopped together and adopted as a national policy for girls and boys without any identification or research into the needs of boys. The unanimous view of the committee is that the policy needs to be recast. In fact, while I was deputy chair of the committee, I deliberately asked numerous witnesses if they could provide any quantitative evidence to support the gender equity framework. We will all remember the silence of that response. The response to the tabling of the report has been overwhelmingly positive. Certainly, the response from education departments has been non-existent. But their silence is welcome. The member for Hasluck reported on the initiatives of the Western Australian government, which has done what we told it to do. The education departments got it wrong. Hopefully, they will take the lead from their successful school principals and teachers and rewrite the policies for everybody-boys and girls. Denis Fitzgerald, the Federal President of the Australian Education Union, gave a negative response through the letters to the editor section of the Sydney Morning Herald-as well as the Australian, as reported by the chair. Surprisingly, in the Sydney Morning Herald it was not a response to the report; it was an attack upon me for having the temerity to suggest that the Australian Education Union was in denial about boys’ education. You did not have to go too Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9205 far in its submission to find the denial. Its recommendation No. 2 was just rhetoric. Let me read it to you: 2. This organisation does not endorse the introduction of a separate boys’ education policy. Gender Equity: A Framework for Australian Schools already provides an appropriate national policy framework for addressing the educational needs of boys. So, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, it wants the status quo: ‘she’s right mate; she’s okay’. The key words in the recommendation were ‘already’ and ‘appropriate’. They can mean nothing else. If that is not denial, I do not know what is. In his letter Mr Fitzgerald could have had a go at us and commented on the gender equity framework and how it was developed; he could have argued its exposition and argued its rightness or wrongness. But he did not do that because he could not. He could have commented on the disparity of all of the indicators currently going on; he did not do that either. He could have actually provided a critical and constructive response; he did not. His response was personal, uninformed and unworthy of the important position he holds. He ought to spend a little more time in getting remuneration and conditions for teachers right and a little bit less time on the propaganda. The only other response that could be construed as negative came from Christopher Bantick in the Mercury. I will not go through what the member for Braddon said about him. But Mr Bantick summed up his piece with the remarkable phrase-I do not know what he was on when he wrote that story-‘Boys hold the key to their own learning.’ The profundity of that! Doesn’t it just sort of come in and whack you right around the ears: ‘Boys hold the key to their own learning.’ I hope he is not teaching now! There was no reference at all in the whole story to policy, pedagogy, procedures nor programs. I trust the government will respond positively to this report; it deserves no less. However, as far as I was concerned, the most remarkable finding of the report was the failure of so many to recognise that boys and girls learn in different ways, and that a good education balances the difference in opportunities that boys and girls can have in education. Everyone has said here today that girls generally-not always-have superior verbal, linguistic and processing skills to boys. In a joke we say, ‘They can talk under wet cement.’ Boys generally have superior visual, spatial and problem-solving skills to girls. Often, if you give a problem in a verbal way to a girl, she will process it much quicker than a boy; but, if it a visual problem, it might be around the other way. Education is not a matter of verbal or visual-good education has both. It is not good enough that boys cannot express themselves and it is not good enough that girls of talent in this country are being discouraged to participate in higher levels of mathematics and science. The way we are going we will not have any engineers, architects, mathematicians or scientists in 25 years. We know that girls like self-directed and passive learning, essay type responses and continuous assessment. That is a good thing. And we know that boys like the directed, active and explicit teaching, examinations and tests, concise type responses and multiplechoice answers. But that is a good thing too. Girls like collaborative activities. Boys like the challenge of competition. In many schools, collaboration is in and competition is out, but they both have positive and negative aspects. Collaboration can reduce everything to the lowest common denominator. Competition can be negative but it can raise people to the very highest level. In education one size does not fit all. 9206 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 It never did and never will. This report, if nothing else, makes exactly that point. I commend it to our colleagues on both sides of the chamber. to have the opportunity to take note of this magnificent report by the Standing Committee on Education and Training into the education of boys and to follow my colleague from Port Adelaide, whom I admire and respect not only as a politician but as an educationalist, a person of great talent. I congratulate the chair of the committee, the member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, and the other members of the committee. I also congratulate the secretariat because I know, having been on that committee before, the excellent work that they do. One of them is sitting here today, taking all this in. They have produced a world-class report on an issue which is under review throughout the world. As a former teacher of many years in several states and having experienced education overseas, one thing that has always worried me is getting the mix right. I have managed in my 25 years of teaching prior to this life to work in a whole range of schools from what I call the private-public schools, the state schools-the East Launcestons and the Lenah Valleysthrough to country schools. Probably the best schools I ever taught at were district high schools where you had K to 10, which is an excellent mix. For most of my life I worked in disadvantaged schools, the really difficult ones. Once you got involved in those, you never escaped. You had few volunteers. I always challenged people who thought they were good teachers to come out to some of the schools that are really challenging and see what you can do. A lot of them said, ‘No, thanks. I don’t want to be involved in that.’ I am a little disappointed to see so few members of the House speaking on what I consider to be a really vital issue. As the report says, it is about foundation building, about getting it right and catering for everybody. When I mention that something that comes to my mind is class sizes. Nothing used to annoy me more than seeing the minister for education on TV or in the newspaper saying, ‘No, our class sizes are 22 or 23. Compared to New South Wales, South Australia or wherever, we have an excellent pupil-teacher ratio.’ Those of us who had 34 kids in the classroom were saying: ‘What the hell is going on? He’-or she-‘has stated that it is 22.3.’ We used to laugh in the staffroom and say, ‘Well, if you count all the people in Bathurst Street who are in the education department, stuck them out in schools and divided the number of children by the number of people employed by the education department, the ratio was probably right.’ But we never, ever saw people from the education department. We invited them to come out to the school but, apart from the days when they came out to assess our capability or otherwise as teachers for potential promotion, they stayed right the hell away, especially from disadvantaged schools. The committee’s recommendation that the class size should be 20 by 2005 is excellent, but I would like to suggest that for the early childhood area-up to, say, grade 2-it should be 15. I visit many of the schools in my electorate on a regular basis, to keep in touch with the system. I have publicly stated that as soon as I get out of here I want to go back as a mentor, especially in high schools, to challenge some of the grade 9 and 10 boys who are wasting their opportunities. When you go into schools you notice that the issues of class sizes and being able to particularise education or learning for a whole range of people, especially disadvantaged kids, is something that is not really addressed by education departments right across Australia. I notice in the report that the committee visited a couple of schools in my neck of the woods. A couple of them are just down the road from my electorate office. It was really",190,Representatives Main Committee
348,Mr Quick (Franklin) (12.31 P.m.),"I would like to say at the outset how delighted I amThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9207 disappointing that I was somewhere else-interstate, I think, on another committee hearingand I was not able to be there when the committee went to Newtown High School, Bridgewater Primary School and Herdsmans Cove. I spent probably the best and the worse parts of my life at Bridgewater Primary School. It is interesting to see that Glenda Murray got a mention in the report, because Glenda was a teachers aide when I was there in 1981. When I went to Bridgewater Primary School, there were 750 kids in open learning. It was probably one of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia at the time. We had 750 kids and all the rooms were open plan. My first experience was 120 kids in a room with four teachers. I had never taught before in a team situation. There were 60 desks and 60 chairs, a billiard table and a table tennis table. We said: ‘Where the hell do the rest of you guys work?’ They said, ‘We do our work on the carpet, we do it outside, we do it on the eight-ball table or we do it on the table tennis table.’ I felt that those kids from homes with few education resources and with parents who were under the hammer economically and socially should be able to go to school and have quiet, peace and harmony. But, when you had 10 kids out of 120 go off their faces-which happened on any given day-the place was in turmoil. The first thing we did was to spend $146,000 dividing up the quad into a double and two singles to try to cater for the individual differences, needs and aspirations. One of the four took stress leave and never came back. I was determined to go down to grade 3 and try to intervene in how the system operated. I mentioned Glenda Murray. We had a community development officer who involved the parents in the school so that they understood how the process worked. We spoke to them about the individual needs of their children. We had full-time music staff, a full-time library and full-time phys ed staff. We had half a dozen special ed teachers, as we called them, who were taking kids-boys and girls-in and out of the classroom, trying to recognise what they needed. It worked remarkably well. The community development officer worked herself out of a job after two years. Parents were in the classrooms all the time. They were learning, their children were learning and they realised the importance of education. We managed to get class sizes down. Our library was utilised on a regular basis and after school. We were one of the first schools in Tasmania to introduce a computer system that was networked in all the classes. We had computer specialists. We challenged the kids. I said: ‘You come from a crappy suburb-it has so many problems-but you are no different from the kids that I teach at Lenah Valley or East Launceston. I challenge you. There is a standard.’ Was there support from the education department? When things were going well, yes. When things got difficult and we had to challenge ourselves not only as teachers but as members of a greater community, they did not want to know. I am here because of my dissatisfaction with how the system works. So many of the things that you have mentioned in this fantastic report are things that have really irked me. Consider teacher training. My daughter is just completing a DipEd at the University of Melbourne. I spent countless nights on the phone going through scenarios: this is what worked for me; perhaps you might try this. She went to Presbyterian Ladies College and Caulfield Grammar School, then she went back to the real world of a senior secondary college in Melbourne which I will not name, for obvious reasons. She was challenged. In lots of cases the teachers had given up. This is one of the things that really worries me: so many of the teachers have given up because there is no support from the 9208 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 head office. There is no support, for whatever reason, from a lot of the superintendents. It is very hard to run a fantastic education system. As the member for Port Adelaide commented, members could name dozens and dozens of schools in our electorates that are doing a fantastic job, but they do not have the financial resources-that little bag of money-to be innovative and operate outside the box. I would imagine that every member in this place has put their hand in their pocket and spent part of their electorate allowance paying for guitar lessons or sponsoring a kid who is an excellent trumpeter but we cannot find someone to do these sorts of things. People have mentioned parents and friends working their whatsits off to raise $8,000 at the school fair so they can put some resources into the school. In my mind as a primary school teacher, we have it all wrong. We are concentrating at the wrong end financially. We ought to be back here. I have waffled around this issue because it is something that is really important. As I said, this report is world class. It mentions Commonwealth-state relations. As someone who has been in this place for 10 years, it also irks me when we have duckshoving, blaming and counterblaming about whether it is the Commonwealth’s fault or the state education minister has not done this, that or the other. This is a blueprint. I would like to see education ministers, principals, parents and even some of the children in the senior secondary colleges read this report, look at the recommendations behind it and implement them. To hell with who has to pay. We had a fine education system. I remember spending a year on exchange in Adelaide in 1976, because the reports were that Tasmania had the best system, but you had better go and see the South Australian system. As someone who spent part of his childhood in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, I remember going up a class and down a class learning to write in three different ways. We should have the best system. We have the capacity to pay for it. We have the experts and the dedicated teachers. It is a matter of putting all the bits of the jigsaw together. Let us find the money. Let us challenge people. In my day, and I imagine the member for Port Adelaide’s, it was a calling to be a teacher. You were proud to be a teacher. You were respected within the community. The children and parents respected you and you worked tirelessly-hours before and after school and on weekends-to provide the best education. It was not for the bright kids or the kids that were having real hassles, but for everybody. You challenged them. I can honestly say that, in my 25 years of teaching, I only lost one child in the system: poor old Joseph is in jail for murdering his mother. But I have challenged every other child. Some of them come up to me-as I imagine they do to the member for Port Adelaide-and tap me on the shoulder and say, ‘ Remember me?’ And you can, because you have had an influence on their life. You have changed it. How remarkable our country would be if every child who went through the education system-whether they were able-bodied or disabled-had the resources, the dedicated teachers and the system in place to provide them with the very best in education. They want it for nothing. We are selling our children short, we are selling our teachers short and we are selling Australia short. This report is about foundation building. It is a fantastic report. I have purloined lots of copies and I will ensure that, in the next couple of months, everybody in my electorate will be well aware of this report and will ask their ministers for education: why is this not happening? Congratulations to everybody involved. This is a fantastic report. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9209 Motion (by Mr Neville) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. HMAS Sydney lost off the coast of Western Australia during a furious sea battle with the German raider Kormoran, and 645 crew lost their lives. For many Australian families, the grieving and the closure for the tragedy have not occurred to this day. Last Sunday, at the request of Harley Doyle, the President of the Port Adelaide Naval Association, I participated in a small but most important ceremony and book launch at their club rooms. The Port Adelaide Naval Association is effectively representative of all former and current naval personnel in South Australia. In the early 1990s it was responsible for the commissioning of a memorial plaque for the Sydney. The plaque was originally located at HMAS Encounter, the former naval base in Port Adelaide. On its closure, the plaque was transferred to Peace Park in Adelaide. Six years ago, a very determined member of the Port Adelaide Naval Association, Keith Shegog, decided that the plaque was not enough. He decided to document the views of the families in their own words. A labour of love and respect has resulted in the publication of a most important written history of HMAS Sydney from the families of the crew who were so tragically lost. Too much history is written through the ideas and views of just one person. It is history that often lacks authenticity, spontaneity and, dare I say, accuracy. Keith Shegog’s book does not do this. Rather, he puts the views of the family members in their own words-controversial though some may be. The families come from all over Australia, including the 59 families of lost crew from South Australia and the seven families who live in Port Adelaide. Keith’s work has a twofold purpose. It tells the stories from the point of view of the families and in some ways it helps the families to cope with their grief. And grief there certainly is. My role in the book launch and the memorial ceremony was to introduce Commander Pat Burnett, RAN retired, who was to launch the book, Lost but not Forgotten: The Story of the Sydney. Pat Burnett is the son of Captain Joseph Burnett, the commanding officer of the Sydney at the time of its loss. In a moving address, Commander Burnett told the story of the impact on his family when they were told their father was lost at sea: last conversations, last and important images of his father, important words to attach to his grieving and to be a blueprint for the rest of his life. It was a contained, responsible speech delivered with quiet passion and dignity. It was helpful for those who are still unable to achieve closure for their grief, and it was entirely appropriate for the occasion. Keith Shegog thanked his fellow club members for their encouragement and assistance in keeping to the task. For his six years of great work, he can be justly proud of his outstanding effort. Recording in a written form oral histories of important events like the impact of the sinking of the Sydney is what neither we in Port Adelaide nor indeed the Navy have been very good at, but we are getting better. We added to that written record last week when I was contacted by Erica Jolly, who at her own cost had published a magnificent history of vocational education in South Australia called A Broader Vision. Erica not only researched the history of vocational education in South Australia over the last 100 years; she also included in her publication the views of former colleagues and students who participated in so-called central",194,Representatives Main Committee

I have only managed to read some introductory comments plus a few selected stories from known contributors but, if that small sample is any guide, Erica’s publication will be not only broad but extremely powerful and timely. Interestingly enough, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training will conduct its next inquiry into vocational education. There could be no better background, I believe, than this particular history and I look forward to reading it over the summer break. It refreshes people’s memories that often we got things in the past right. We have overlooked so many things that we have done well and we have relegated them to the past. It is about time we dusted them off and brought them out again. (Time expired) Petrie Electorate: Community Activities Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.51 p.m.)-On9 November, I had the great pleasure of joining COASIT, the Italian welfare association, at their fundraising fashion lunch at the Italian Club. Over 250 people attended and it was a highly successful day. I want to pay tribute to all of the organisers, including Dina Ranieri and the chairwoman of the fundraising committee, Gina Salinitri. The funds from that particular day will provide for the much needed work of this Italian welfare association, particularly in the areas of advocacy and aged care. The assocation also provide respite and home and community care services and they do a wonderful job. It is one of only two events that they hold each year. They had a large dinner and black tie ball and a fashion parade. It was beautifully organised, and I want to pay tribute to the fine work that they and their many volunteers do. The area of volunteering is something quite new to the Italian community. Because of the large extended families, that community never really had a need to engage in volunteering, but more and more the assocation is training people to become volunteers and to go out and help in carer and respite services. I also want to pay tribute to them for the fantastic work that they do with respect to the Catholic Education program in Queensland in ensuring that the teaching of the Italian language in schools to all students continues. It has been a very successful program not just for those who are descendants of Italian families but for the greater Australian community as well. I also want to pay tribute to Frank Beitz and Gloria Lee, who recently travelled to Papua New Guinea to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary commemorative services for the Battle of Milne Bay. They attended along with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Danna Vale. I also want to pay tribute to Mr Bill Guest, who visited Papua New Guinea in August to commemorate the anniversary of the Kokoda Track. As part of the federal government’s saluting their service, a very innovative web site has been set up. It is to show the service records of Australians who enlisted during the war and to provide a valuable snapshot of our country’s wartime history. It has some wonderful search engines which are capable of searching massive databases by name and by service number, honours received, place of birth and place of enlistment or town or suburb on enlistment. So now generations of Australians will have easy access to that information and also family members with respect to wartime history. It will be a very valuable source for researchers from all over the world who are looking at information Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9211 on this period of military history. I pay tribute to those Australians who have given their service. It is also a great way of ensuring that their enduring honour and distinction are duly noted. They are just part of a range of initiatives under this program. There is a web site, which is www.ww2roll.gov.au. I also had the great pleasure of attending a morning tea recently with the members of the Redcliffe Domestic Violence Association. I was very successful in securing $100,000 for them to employ a part-time counsellor, and I am absolutely delighted to say that that counsellor has now commenced work in the Redcliffe area. She has been inundated. It is a terrible thing to say that she has more work than is cut out for her, but it is a much needed service that was never there. The excitement of those women attending that particular morning tea was there for everyone to see. On a happier note, I am pleased to say that $250,000 has been contributed from black spot funding for the corner of ANZAC Avenue and Sutton Street, a notoriously bad spot for many of the Redcliffe community. I am very pleased to be hosting on 25 July the Redcliffe branch of the National Servicemen’s Association, with some 50 local national servicemen. I will be presenting them with their national service medal. It gives me great pleasure to present those particular servicemen with that medal. We are very grateful for what they have done for our nation and community and for the wonderful work that they contributed to our country. I will be delighted to be joining them. National Roads and Motorists Association to see the shocking decline in the NRMA, which used to be one of Australia’s great mutuals. Now the infighting and the personal obsessions at board level are destroying the organisation. Most of the media comment on this matter is focused on the Members First group. The Manson girls down at Fairfax have not just reported on the NRMA; they have been participants, part of the infighting and neurotic obsessiveness. While the Members First Group is not without fault, the other side of the argument-the ‘Talibot’ group-has escaped public scrutiny. It is time to correct this imbalance. Its directors, led by Richard Talbot and Jane Singleton, have set out to win control of the NRMA at any cost, even if this means bringing the organisation to its knees or indeed breaching the laws of good corporate governance. The NRMA AGM held in November 2001 saw Singleton deliberately and knowingly cast her proxies contrary to the recommendation she made in the notice of meeting. The notice of meeting explained the matters to be discussed and decided upon at the meeting. One of those matters was a removal resolution for directors Whitlam, Coyne, Easson, Sanchez, Callaghan and Shaw. The resolution was subsequently lost. Jane Singleton, in her director’s statement contained in the meeting notice, recommended that members vote against the removal of the directors. She followed up this direction with several letters to the editor and media statements asking that members of NRMA give her their proxies. It can be assumed that members allocated Ms Singleton their proxies on the basis of her recommendation in the notice of meeting; that is, to vote against the removal of the directors. When it came to voting in the poll on the resolution, Jane Singleton voted her proxies contrary to her recommendation. She misled the members. She did it secretly, of",197,Representatives Main Committee
350,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (12.56 P.m.),"With many other people, I have been disappointed9212 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 course, and she has never disclosed the fact. So much for transparency and so much for being an advocate of corporate governance reform and consumer rights. Other NRMA directors subsequently wrote to ASIC complaining of Ms Singleton’s behaviour. ASIC wrote back indicating they were not pursuing the matter. At the time Jane Singleton was a key witness in the Nick Whitlam prosecutions and had prepared a section 90 statement for ASIC on Whitlam’s matter. Most likely ASIC refused to do anything with Singleton because they did not want their key witness to be exposed as a fraud. Jane Singleton is also a chronic leaker of confidential board information, despite sections 181 and 184 of the Corporations Law and directors’ common law duty not to use information obtained by them improperly. The NRMA successfully won a court case against Fairfax and AAP calling into account a number of journalists for publishing confidential board information. In his judgment, Master Macready argued that this information was confidential to the company and that the company had a right to know who leaked the information because prima facie there was a breach of the Corporations Law and the company may wish to instigate proceedings against the leaker. Jane Singleton is the leaker. In an affidavit in the court, AAP said that Jane Singleton presented as the likely culprit for the disclosure of the discussion in the boardroom. To make certain, discovery has been undertaken through the journalists themselves, the matter the court ordered. Fairfax now is appealing. They do not want Ann Lampe, their relevant journalist, in the box. Jane Singleton has done everything in her power to have the Fairfax matter discontinued. She does not want the journalist to be in the dock revealing the source because, if that happens, it will show that she in fact is the leaker. She is hiding behind the journalist’s refusal to disclose sources as a way of protecting herself from the breach of the Corporations Law. She has a clear conflict in her attempt to pull the Fairfax matter. She wants it pulled because otherwise she will be found to have breached the law. Her participation is clearly a further breach of the Corporations Law because she has a material personal interest in the matter. Once again ASIC has shown absolutely no interest in this issue. Singleton is mentioned in the AAP affidavit, yet ASIC has not conducted an investigation. The company itself has written to ASIC concerned about this leak and other leaks, but ASIC has taken no action. Clearly ASIC does not want its star witnesses to be held to account. In another matter Singleton indicated that she supported Sir Laurence Street to act as an independent chair of the special meeting of NRMA on 17 October but, on the day, voted against it-another example of her saying one thing in the meeting notice and receiving proxy votes and then casting her vote contrary to that recommendation. Again she deliberately misled the members of NRMA. She is a serial deceiver. The NRMA is falling apart. Leakers and liars like Jane Singleton are not fit to serve as directors. Her colleague Richard Talbot has also acted to destroy the NRMA. The Insurance Australia Group recently estimated that he has cost the company $800 million in legal costs and disruption of its governance. Imagine the good that could have come from the productive use of $800 million in the community, NRMA fulfilling its historic role as a mutual organisation looking after the interests of its members, looking after good community causes. Richard Talbot and his henchpeople have wasted $800 million of NRMA money and they stand condemned for such an exercise. (Time expired) Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9213 National Roads and Motorists Association with the member for Werriwa, but this is one of them. I actually rise to speak on much the same issue, on the NRMA. Having had experience, when I was a minister in New South Wales, of Richard Talbot, who was an employee in the RTA and was a perpetual leaker, I agree with him totally. He has been nothing but a destructive force on the NRMA since he joined the board, and he should be right at the top of the list to be removed from the board. Ms Singleton’s contribution has been totally negative to anything to do with road construction in the whole of New South Wales. She also has no right to represent the interests of motorists in the very fine state of New South Wales. Having been once asked by Nick Whitlam to join his team and run for the board of the NRMA when I left state politics and having declined the opportunity-I am of course glad that I did-I followed this with interest. Certainly his comments are worthy of support. The new chairman, Ross Turnbull, has called for the whole of the board to resign so that a new board can be introduced. That seems totally fair because there is no-one in New South Wales who would not agree that the NRMA board has become totally dysfunctional, totally incompetent in terms of what it set out to do originally, and totally factionalised with internal politics that leave this place for dead. The prime concerns of the NRMA should be first and foremost to look after the interests and needs of the motorists in New South Wales-both regarding safety of the roads and the construction of new roads across the network. In my own area, when the F6 was recently cancelled we heard not a word from Mr Talbot or Ms Singleton expressing their concerns that motorists in my area were condemned for many long years to not having a decent road out to the area. As an organisation, the NRMA has a long history. In my area we have some of Sydney’s worse traffic snarls and we have the second worse accident black spot at the Fiveways roundabout. Motorists in my area are not interested in the dysfunction at the top of the NRMA; they are concerned that a van gets there quickly if they have broken down and they are concerned to have better representation of their interests in the public domain. They deserve representation by a body that concentrates on the issues rather than the personality clashes that constantly occur. The problem came to a head at an extraordinary general meeting that was held at the Sydney Convention Centre on 17 October. This meeting was a demonstration of the sad state of affairs of the NRMA. It was called on the basis of a requisition with 100 signatures on it, the minimum requirement under the NRMA’s constitution. There were 100 signatures out of the two million members of the NRMA statewide, causing $4 million to be spent on calling an extra meeting. The true intentions of those who called the meeting and the extent to which the NRMA has become politicised became clear when busloads of members began arriving at the convention centre about a quarter of an hour before the meeting was due to start. From all reports, the behaviour of many in this crowd was appalling. I hear that when new President Ross Turnbull asked for a moment’s silence to remember those lost in Bali, there were many in the audience who simply ignored this request.",199,Representatives Main Committee
351,Mr Baird (Cook) (1.01 P.m.),"There are not many occasions on which I might agree9214 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 I welcome the appointment of Mr Ross Turnbull to the presidency of this troubled organisation. He has a tough job ahead and I wish him well. He has already demonstrated his ability to take tough decisions in other areas in public life and likewise at the NRMA by closing down that meeting in the face of heavy protests due to the fact that not all of the people who turned up could actually fit into the venue. In the weeks following the meeting that was called to consider two motions to remove separate factions of directors, Mr Turnbull has requested that all board members resign their positions and submit themselves to the members for re-election. This request has not been met. However, the issue will come to a head at a forthcoming AGM when there will be a board spill. On behalf of those members who are not getting out of the NRMA what they deserve, I would say to all directors that it is desirable that there be a major renewal of the board at this meeting. We hope to see a sea change in the organisation. We look forward to seeing a board of directors that is responsive, accountable and, above all, looking after the needs of its two million members, not their own power base. I support the member for Werriwa in his call for reform. I would also say to the current members of the board, ‘Get out of the way’ to make way for those who have the genuine interests and needs of the motorists of New South Wales at heart, not their own internal faction fights. does not believe that the question before the chair is that the NRMA should be reformed, the question actually before the chair is that the Main Committee do now adjourn. Bowman Electorate: Older Persons Legal Service easy and inexpensive access to essential services is one of our most important duties as politicians. It is a task that is becoming increasingly difficult under this government that has presided over the closure of so many Medicare offices and allowed bulk billing services to virtually disappear in communities like those that make up the Bayside and Redland suburbs in my electorate of Bowman. I was recently approached by Mr Scott McDougall, the director of the Caxton Street Legal Service in Brisbane, who let me know about the impending closure of yet another vital service in my electorate, a closure which would not have to go ahead if the Attorney-General would commit to a small financial contribution from the Commonwealth. The service I am talking about is the Older Persons Legal Service. It is run by legal practitioners who visit community centres like the Donald Simpson Centre in Cleveland, giving our seniors the opportunity to access free legal advice in familiar and comfortable environments. Increasingly, older people need access to reliable legal advice on matters ranging from wills to neighbourhood disputes and, sadly, serious issues like elder abuse. I understand that research indicates, and experience confirms, that our seniors are often hesitant to contact legal services to find out about their rights. By working out of the established community centres and offering a home visit service, the Older Persons Legal Service has been able to reach those who might otherwise find it too difficult or intimidating to access the legal service and advice that they need. The program has proved very successful, but it looks like its capacity to help older people gall I thought that his request for financial assistance was quite reasonable and, knowing the importance of this service to seniors in Cleveland and the surrounding suburbs in the Redland",201,Representatives Main Committee

354,In The Redlands Is Going To Be Cut Short Due To A Lack Of Funding. When I Spoke To Mr Mcdou,"Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9215 Shire, I undertook to write to the Attorney-General to bring the situation to his attention and to seek his intervention to allow the service to remain on foot. I would like to emphasise that the program costs only $70,000 a year and that is not a lot of money to a national government, but to the people who run the Older Persons Legal Service it means the difference between staying viable and sinking. Furthermore, when you consider that a funding allocation made as part of the 2002-03 Commonwealth Community Legal Service Program is now not able to be taken up by a Queensland based group and will be reallocated, funding for this vital program would seem an obvious choice-at least I thought so, as did the Caxton Street Legal Service and the legal practitioners who have offered their time and expertise as part of the program. Judging by the report that went to air on Tuesday morning of this week, the journalists and producers of the AM program on ABC Radio thought so as well. But apparently the Attorney-General did not, or at least I assume that is his position because he did not have the courtesy-as he never does-to reply personally to a member of parliament’s correspondence. Certainly, he does not respond to correspondence from those of us on this side of the House. Instead, I received a letter signed not by his chief of staff but by his departmental liaison officer, essentially telling me, the Caxton Street Legal Service, the program’s lawyers and its many clients in the Redlands not to hold our breath. I have been a minister. I think that there is nothing more discourteous than ministers of this government writing to other members of parliament and not even bothering to sign the letter. I can accept that from, perhaps, the chief of staff, but when it gets to the point where the department liaison officer is writing to you, it is obvious that ministers are arrogant and really do not care. Although most ministers do write to you and do sign their letters, the office of the Attorney-General is notorious. I do not think that I have ever seen Williams’s signature on any letter. I do not know whether he writes to his own members; it would be interesting to find out. I want him to know that it is a discourtesy. A lot of my colleagues and I, as a former minister-someone who is more senior to him in terms of time in parliament-do not like it. It is about time he started to get off his backside and started to do a bit of work. I like the bloke-I think he’s all right and he’s a nice fellow personally; I have nothing against himbut whoever is advising him should advise him that arrogance and discourtesy are not things that we members of parliament like. Members will be aware that legal aid services can scarcely afford airline tickets to Canberra. The Attorney-General’s office made an appointment to see McDougall. They turned up down here-they had to do it at their own expense-and not only could he not see the Attorney-General but even his staff said that they had no time to see him. He had to go back to Brisbane. He spent the money for nothing. He was unable to see the Attorney-General, after they had made an appointment. I say to the Attorney-General: for all your good personal points-you are calm, meek and mild-get your office into gear. It is disgraceful the way they are acting now. The Attorney-General can get back a little kudos, show a little good humour, accept criticism, do the right thing and give my people a little money. There is money there. It is a service that is dedicated to our seniors and it is a program that has been proven to help to break down the barriers that older people encounter when attempting to access legal advice. I call upon the Attorney-General again to honour the request to ensure that my constituents and the seniors who have benefited from this program across the greater Brisbane area, in Chermside, Deception Bay and Ipswich, have continued access to free legal services. (Time expired) 9216 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 Environment: Point Nepean Point Nepean in Victoria. I wish to set down four key principles for protecting this extraordinary piece of land: firstly, that there should be no housing; secondly, that we should seek some form of public ownership; thirdly, that we should seek to protect the bushland; and, fourthly, that there is sustainable and acceptable use of that land under a viable arrangement. I do this in the context of a promise which was made by the state government, which has severe difficulties within it. Last week the Victorian state government said that it would make that land a national park. On the face of it, that would seem a positive move. Yet if you look at the context, you will find that this proposal was a sham, a fraud, a fix, a farce and simply untrue, unbelievable and unsustainable. The reason is that the Commonwealth previously offered 260 hectares of land at Point Nepean to the Victoria government. It did that as an offer of land for free. It did not seek a dollar, a razoo or any other payment. It offered that land for free. What was the state government’s response? The state government rejected that offer out of hand. On 20 March 2001 the Victorian Premier wrote to the Commonwealth saying, ‘The Victorian government is unable to accept the transfer of Point Nepean on the terms currently offered.’ What were those terms? Those terms were that the Commonwealth government would give it this piece of land for free. That is an extraordinary situation. that the Commonwealth had put in $4 million for restoration of the heritage buildings under the Federation Fund. On 11 September 2002, with the election approaching, the Victorian government revised its position on Point Nepean and said, ‘We will accept that land if you give us between $25 million and $35 million to manage it on an ongoing basis,’ reversing all principles of land transfer within Australia over the last 150 years. It was an extraordinary position and one which was unsustainable. Given that they wish to make a so-called ‘national park’ out of the area, they were offered the land for free and rejected it. What more could they want? They want to make a windfall profit. They are holding the people of the southern peninsula to ransom whilst they seek to make windfall profit from the land. In particular, the Victorian government subsequently leaked the Prime Minister’s response, saying, ‘We’re very sorry, but we’re not going to give you that,’ without providing the detail that they had rejected the offer for free land, and followed it up with a request for $35 million. What was the basis of their request? They claimed that there would be unexploded ordnance which would need an extraordinary amount of expenditure to clean it up, yet the report released last week into the unexploded ordnance shows that the cost of remediation is almost negligible. What an extraordinary position! This fits in with the fact that four days before the election the state government, with bipartisan report, passed green wedge legislation through the lower house which it said would protect the land at Point Nepean. It passed that legislation knowing that it was going to call an election the following week before the legislation could ever make it to the upper house and, therefore, having passage through both houses, given that there was a guarantee of bipartisan support. It claimed that it had legislated to protect that land, yet we all know that legislation requires two houses. It would have taken them two days of sitting at most to complete that, yet they prorogued parliament and in the process dissolved the legislation and made a mock-",202,Representatives Main Committee

(Time expired) Industry: Research and Development has been in the Mural Hall this week, with the opportunities for hands-on information, web sites and new ways of doing things. I am especially interested in the hospital without walls. I am sure that those things will be very significant. My colleague the member for Franklin is nodding his head. I know that he will be as interested in talking to the state minister for health in Tasmania as I am. Today, I would like to highlight the problems that we will face if we do nothing to improve investment in research and development in Australia. Since 1996, Australia has dropped the ball significantly on everything to do with development of research in Australia. The government has ignored the needs for government assistance to ensure that research continues to grow in all aspects of activity, whether it be in the private sector, our universities, the CSIRO or the CRCs, which do not have a lot of support from the government, and to encourage individuals to develop personal ideas. R&D is very important. Funding for universities is being reduced, students are having to pay more and more and, therefore, they are dropping out. Many of those students may well be the idea stars of tomorrow, yet while struggling to pay the rent their ideas go on hold or are lost. Without funds, tax incentives, development programs or other methods of encouraging both the private sector and the community to look at research, we might as well sell this country to some overseas interests and all move to New Zealand. As we all know, there have been massive changes to the manufacturing industry over the last 50 years, which has improved our productivity in every sort of way. That is now reaching its zenith in Australia, which means that the work force has been honed down. Production is relevant to the amount of investment into the research, and that has meant that Australians have been working smarter to produce a greater amount of manufactured output. I cannot say the same for farming. The farming industry is carrying a very heavy load. Twenty per cent of farmers are carrying the load of producing 80 per cent of the primary produce produced in the process. Land is being degraded and water use is being raised as the major restraint to farmers being able to develop further. Listening to the Wentworth Group last night, it made me think that the revolution that happened in manufacturing processes has also got to happen in our farming processes. Farming has got smarter, but not across the board. The Australian farm survey report of 2002 says that small family farms dominate the broadacre and dairy sector of Australian agriculture, although they account for only a modest share of gross value of production. Around 65 per cent of farms are small farms and they account for 25 per cent of gross value of production. This is not only expensive on land use, but also it is expensive production when you look at the land degradation that is likely to occur because of the difficulties of producing on marginal and semi-marginal land, particularly in times like the present drought. While I want to help farmers stay farming and producing on the land, unless we can do something about their return and help them to operate smarter, anything we might try to do to help prevent further land degradation and to preserve our watercourses is going to be useless.",204,Representatives Main Committee
358,Mr Adams (Lyons) (1.17 P.m.),"I would like to commend the government display that9218 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 Research is the key, and funding of research and trials has to be available. All levels of government should be involved, but it has to start in the federal sphere, in the universities and colleges and even in the schools. It is not enough to leave it to the private sector to come up with the necessary ideas. The Wentworth Group has argued that, while farmers have rights, they also have a duty of care to protect the environment, as all Australians do. They also argue that the current generation of farmers are not responsible for all the damage that has been done to our landscape over the past 200 years and that, if Australia wants its damage repaired, all Australians should be prepared to provide the financial assistance to help achieve this outcome. That is very true, but to do so we need to do things smarter and we need to do things with research. We need to be funding that research and we need to be using that research to improve what we are doing. For that we need real leadership from farmers’ organisations themselves, and especially from parliaments and from governments. This government is certainly failing us here in Canberra. It has failed to give any leadership in this area and it should be condemned for that. (Time expired) Health: Parkinson’s Disease the opportunity to speak at the launch of Parkinson’s Disease Awareness Week in the Southern Highlands. I say ‘fortunate’ because the occasion provided me with an insight to the state of mind of the victims of the disease, of which I had little knowledge. About 40 people attended the function at Bowral, which was also used to present a book by Michael J. Fox called Lucky Man to the local library, detailing the author’s own experience with Parkinson’s disease from the age of 30. Since having read this book, I do not mind admitting that it made me feel very humble in regard to what people will go through to live a normal life in society-a society that really does not understand. It is a book that I recommend you read. If you do, I guarantee your outlook on life will become completely different. Parkinson’s disease affects about 80,000 people in Australia, a figure which has doubled over the last two years, with the worrying development that at least 10 per cent of them were aged under 50 years. Whilst it was termed ‘shaking disease’ by an English physician in 1817, it was not until the 1960s that research revealed that pathological and biochemical agents in the brain were involved. We know now that it is a debilitating disease, the extent of which convinced me to support the proposal of Teresa Gambaro, member for Petrie, for funding towards a study to measure the disease’s prevalence. After speaking at the launch, I was determined to pay homage to the people I saw at Bowral and, in particular, to their courage in the face of this level of adversity. I would like to pay homage to Faye McCarthy, Mrs Shipton, Mrs Lees, John and many others whose names I cannot remember, and also, particularly, their local doctor, and Michael J. Fox and his books. Al Forester, my neighbour for many years and a Parkinson’s sufferer, is another and, of course, Colin Graham, who impressed me greatly, as I do see him as a brilliant mind trapped in a wasted body. In the space of about half an hour, I learnt of the joy of people and their ability to rise above their affliction and to look at things in a positive light. Their ability to make jokes about their condition, to master tasks that we take for granted and to continue to involve themselves in everyday tasks instead of withdrawing into a world of self-pity is an attitude that has to be admired.",205,Representatives Main Committee
359,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (1.22 P.m.),"A few months ago I was fortunate enough to be givenThursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9219 Learning more about Parkinson’s disease gave me a greater understanding of what these people are going through and what they really need and want. They do not want pity, nor do they want charity. What they want is to be accepted into your world, a world where they are treated on equal terms. After this event, I made the undertaking that I would bring Parkinson’s disease to the notice of parliament to raise awareness of the disease, and to encourage programs of support for the sufferers. This is why I urge all members of the House to get to know their local Parkinson’s disease support groups and to lend their support to the initiatives to confront this disease head-on. As I said earlier, the incidence of this disease is growing every year, and 100 per cent growth in the space of just a year should be viewed with some concern. While we are searching for a cause, let alone a cure, we need to support with compassion and understanding those individuals who are presently afflicted. I am also thankful that I took the position of supporting stem cell research, for it promises hope to sufferers and their loved ones. This disease does not only affect the sufferer but can also have a devastating effect on the partner or the carer. There are a lot of anxieties as to what life will bring and whether you can cope. In younger people there are additional issues such as giving up work and financial security and the sudden change in lifestyle from independence to reliance. These are issues we do not have to confront in our everyday lives and until we do we cannot fully appreciate their impact. You have to ask yourself the question: what would you do if one day you were diagnosed with the disease? What would you feel and how would you cope? These are valid points, and there are 80,000 people in Australia alone who are dealing directly with the issue. That is why I have so much regard for those people I saw in the Southern Highlands. On the day, the ladies of the group who had Parkinson’s disease made pikelets, scones and sandwiches. That is a simple enough exercise but an absolute trial when you are afflicted by a tremor. But to them it was an achievement and they were proud to have been given the opportunity to help prepare for the function. To us, an act like this is only a small thing, but it shows how much difference small acts make. It is always difficult to describe one’s feelings when put into these situations but I was strongly moved by what I saw. The best of humanity is always on display, and from their attitude we should take heart and be inspired. We never know when we might need to draw on that inspiration ourselves. Again, I urge all my colleagues to acquaint themselves with the Parkinson’s disease groups and to assist by showing them that we do care and we do understand. Social Welfare: Australia-Germany Pension Agreement few people in our electorates-a group of people who are now nearing the end of their lives, who have experienced the terrors of World War II. These are people who are fighting for the recognition by the German government that they are entitled to a pension from that country. Members would be well aware that the German authorities during the term of the Third Reich kept meticulous records. One would therefore assume that most people would be able to prove the fact that they indeed fulfilled the requirements necessary to qualify for a German pension. However, it is not hard to visualise what must have happened in many cities in Ger-",206,Representatives Main Committee
360,Mr Quick (Franklin) (1.27 P.m.),"TodayI want to raise an issue that impacts on a select9220 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 many in the latter years of the war as the countless bombing raids destroyed most of the large cities and then the invading Russian forces wreaked relentless destruction. The German government has endeavoured to ensure that those who do qualify for a pension are entitled to receive it. After the war, as the country was being divided into West and East Germany, many Germans, and people whose countries bordered Germany and who were coerced into working in Germany for the duration of the war, fled to countries throughout the world. Recently the Australian and German governments have agreed to protocols for the establishment of an Australian-German pension agreement. People now living in Australia are realising that they might have qualified for a German pension but are unsure of what is required to establish their bona fides and whether they possess the necessary documentation to substantiate their claim for a pension. The reason I raise this issue is my concern that a Western Australian firm is perhaps taking advantage of this situation. Migrant Service Publication, overseas pension compensation consultants of Albany, have obviously been trawling phonebooks throughout Australia looking for names of people which have some Germanic connotation. They then send a letter out to these people offering to check out whether they meet the qualifications to establish their bona fides with the German government. I would like to quote from a letter sent to one of my constituents: If you would like us to process and finalise your application under the mentioned conditions, please send us the enclosed proxy and terms of appointment signed where marked. Because we already have organised proceedings according to the requirement of the pension agreement and are processing all claims directly with the German pension authority, we are not only saving time but also considerable costs, so that we are able to keep the cost to a minimum as shown in the terms of appointment. Then in bold it says: As always, when we are not successful, you do not pay anything. My constituent signed the proxy agreement, which says: I hereby appoint Migrant Service Publication to implement the necessary steps and proceedings concerning the German Pension. When the claim is successfully finalised I will pay Migrant Service Publication the amount of $589 plus GST. If the claim is not accepted by the German pension authority, Migrant Service Publication will pay all the costs and I will not have to pay anything. So my constituent signed. She then received a letter from the State Insurance Office Hesse, Appeals Section, which stated that, in the appeal case of my constituent, the Appeals Committee of the State Insurance Office Hesse, sitting in Kassel on 11 March 1999, had decided that the appeal was rejected. Costs would not be reimbursed. My constituent decided, ‘OK, I have gained nothing,’ so she wrote to Migrant Service Publication: Given that my original application through your organization was rejected I would like to advise that I no longer wish to proceed with my claim. Please do not take any further action on my behalf. As I have not responded to your correspondence or given you authority to act on my behalf for a number of years, please withdraw all previous proxies and accept this letter as termination of your services. To her surprise, she received a letter: Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9221 We are in receipt of your letter dated 01.10.2002. Based on the proxy that you gave us in 1997, asking us to achieve a German pension for you, we have searched 17 overseas archives. Just recently we found the required papers including a statement from the International Tracing Service establishing the fact of your forced labour. … … … With the papers we have found we should be able to achieve a positive result. … … … The costs we had since 1997 total $1970.00. If you want us to retract the legal action we took on your behalf, because the pension authority did not want to award you a pension, we will have no other choice and to charge these costs you ... This is despite all the other previous things. I urge all members in this place to raise this issue in their electorates, as I am sure that my constituent is not alone in this issue. It really worries me that these people, who are well into their 80s, are being taken advantage of by a firm in Western Australia that has some dubious background. Ryan Electorate: Community Service Awards liament is that it provides the opportunity to meet a host of people with different backgrounds and different interests, including people in the business community, men and women of the professions, and veterans in our community. One group of people which it is always a special delight to meet is young people. I would like to take the opportunity in the parliament today to speak of awards that I will be presenting in my electorate this Friday. I initiated Ryan Recognition Awards for young people as well as for those in the community who make a special contribution to the electorate and who perform great services beyond the call of duty as part of our civil society and, as very patriotic Australians, as part of their contribution to our country. I would like to mention some of the people who will be recipients of these awards. I will be presenting trophies, medallions and certificates back at my electorate office tomorrow. Doing so will be a great privilege for me. I want to mention the names of those who will be receiving the Ryan Recognition Awards. These men and women will be receiving trophies. I want to salute their contribution to our community and, if time permits, to point out some of the things that these wonderful Australians do to enhance the quality of life for those in the community of Ryan. Mr David Wells is one. He is a school cleaner at the Darra State School. Besides doing a fantastic job at the school, he also shows great pride and respect for his community of Darra by giving his own time after hours to keep the streets and the shopping strip in Darra very hygienic and presentable. I salute David Wells for his tremendous contribution. Henry Bodman is another Ryan resident, and he is heavily involved in Rotary and Meals on Wheels. He is also a trustee of the Smith Family in Queensland, and I certainly salute his contribution to the Ryan community and to the wonderful charities and causes to which he gives his time to make a difference in them. Mrs Mary Mahony, Mrs Eileen Hall, Mrs Betty Mapperson, Ms Barbara Robins, Mr Jack Duff, Mr David Preston, Mr Richard Johns, Mr Geoff Morrison, Ms Patricia Minaar, Ms Beverly Preston, Mr Ross Wieckhorst and Ms Bronwen David will all be receiving Ryan Recognition Awards tomorrow.

I am sure that every member of the parliament, if they were to have the pleasure of meeting these young people, would be delighted to do so. I am sure that all my colleagues in the parliament have young people in their electorates whose contributions to our community they are also acknowledging. These future Australians will make a difference, I think, in our country in every sector. I am sure that all members of this parliament have pleasure in doing the same thing for young people. I want also to mention the Ryan Youth Encouragement Award that I will be presenting tomorrow in my electorate office. This will go to very young people who are making a difference already. Their names are Mr Brett Mitchell and Ashlee-Rose Jennings Page. I want to mention their names in particular because these two very young Australians are indeed people that I think many in this parliament can learn a lot from. Ashlee-Rose has shown a maturity and responsibility beyond her years in helping her family through some difficult times. She is only nine years old, but when her mother was ill she took on enormous responsibility looking after her mother and babysitting her little sister. I am sure that her parents and her family are indeed very proud of her. Another nine-year-old, young Brett Mitchell, already takes an active role in his local community. A young, keen historian, Brett at age nine takes a local interest in historical landmarks and has written letters and contacted the media to alert them to the great things that can be done in the local community by preserving special landmarks such as Simpson’s house in particular in the community of Ryan.

Though the nominees in each category are too numerous to name, I would like to make particular note of the achievements of the individual Community Service Award finalists. Firstly, there is Abdullah Magor. He is a tireless worker in our local and state Muslim community. He has worked towards building relationships and fostering understanding between the many cultural and religious diversities in the community and his work is of enormous benefit especially at this time. Gerald Simms has been actively involved in the local seniors community for many years, having served on a number of seniors boards and committees including the Addie Mills Senior Citizens, Kalamunda Senior Citizens, the Jack Healey Centre Management Committee, the Kalamunda Branch of Retirees and the Villa Maria Residents Association. Gerald’s tireless service to the local seniors community really does speak for itself. Dawn Williams for several years now has dedicated much of her time to training and organising the Gosnells Ambulance Cadets. Dawn’s outstanding service to the community not Thursday, 14 November 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 9223 only provides valuable training in first aid but also serves to build self-esteem in many young people in the local community. David Young is a retired member of our community who assists as a literacy tutor at the Salvation Army Harry Hunter Rehabilitation Centre in Gosnells. David also tutors people coping with drug and alcohol dependency problems. He works hard to ensure that his students achieve confidence in themselves, and works tirelessly to help all his fellow community members who are in need. As well as being an active member of many seniors organisations, Pamela Daniels founded the Dawson Park Primary School Breakfast Club approximately one year ago. The club serves breakfast at the school to children who arrive in the morning without having eaten. She is also involved in the program where local seniors visit Maida Vale Primary School to interact with the students and help build bonds in the community between all age groups. Pam is wonderful! Joseph Leahy, at almost nine years of age, was the youngest nominee this year. Recently the Wirrabirra Childcare Centre in Thornlie was broken into, some equipment was stolen and some property damaged. Joseph read about the break-in in the local paper and decided that he wanted to help out his old child-care centre. So Joseph, along with a little bit of help from his dad, raised over $500 from people and businesses in the local community to donate to Wirrabirra Childcare Centre to help replace items stolen in the break-in. I highly commend young Joseph for his desire to help others and I encourage him to keep it up. Carla Parry is an extremely active member of the Gosnells Community. She has been a member of the Gosnells Youth Advisory Council for the past three years and has been the driving force behind local projects such as the establishment of the Kenwick Youth Centre and several Youth Week concerts. She is a human dynamo. Carla is now using the skills and knowledge that she acquired to mentor other young people in the development of their community consultation skills. Unfortunately, there can only be two award winners in this category. One is the youth award, which went to Carly Maimby. Carly established a youth group through her church in Midland. She actively assists local youth with drug problems through counselling and helping to provide food, clothing and accommodation. Carly also assists on a weekly basis at a metropolitan food bank by helping deliver food to those in need in the Midland area. Her compassionate, generous nature and desire to help those in need is an example to us all. The overall winner, Jennifer Morrison, has been actively involved with the East Kenwick Primary School for nearly 19 years. She volunteers her time and services in a countless number of ways, from many hours in the school canteen to working as a volunteer in the school library. She spends time listening to children read, assisting on school excursions and serving on the school P&C. Jenny has assisted the school in ways too numerous to list. Staff attest to the immeasurable contribution she has made. Her outstanding commitment and dedication to the school and the local community are truly inspirational. This group of people are an outstanding example of the strong sense of community spirit that exists in my electorate of Hasluck. There is no doubt that volunteer workers are a special group of people who are often the last to seek thanks or recognition. They have a strong sense of dedication and commitment to the common good. These new annual awards that I have established are a way of recognising their tireless work and I hope, in a small way, they dem9224 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 14 November 2002 onstrate the community’s gratitude for their invaluable service that benefits us all. It was certainly very humbling to read the testimonials about each and every one of the award nominees who were entered. I would like to conclude my adjournment speech today by thanking all community volunteers for their efforts. Keep it up! HIH Insurance and Community Services) (1.42 p.m.)-I rise to make some remarks about the apparent decision of the liquidator of HIH to sue the Commonwealth. I do so notwithstanding the sub judice convention, on the understanding that standing orders permit this contribution at this nascent stage of proceedings in a civil action. I also do this with confidence that any judge who hears the matter will be sufficiently robust to withstand the private opinion of one member in this place. I note that the American psychologist M. Scott Peck suggested that all forms of mental illness involve an unwillingness or an inability to take responsibility, an incapacity for self reflection and a desire to find someone else to blame. The great civilisational scholar Professor Arnold Toynbee, in his examination of 21 civilisations throughout history, found that 19 of them collapsed not from the ravages of external assault but from an internal cultural malaise. I want to put it to the chamber that one of the forms of mental illness-or cultural malaisewhich our culture faces today is the increasingly litigious, rights-based culture that sees the answer to every human problem in finding someone to sue. At a time when it is increasingly difficult to get doctors to fill practices in regional and rural Australia, the flood of litigation by disgruntled former patients is seeing a virtual evacuation of the specialisations of obstetrics and radiology. Even general practice is being exposed to greater litigious risk. The net result of that for the community is to make good health care less accessible. The victim culture has fostered a reflex of looking for someone to blame for all of life’s misadventures and vicissitudes, and the two most popular targets have been insurance companies and the agencies of government. But, in the end, these large organisations do not have an unlimited capacity to absorb the costs of a rights-based culture. In the end, they are nothing more and nothing less than the collective representation of their individual elements: corporations representing their management, staff, shareholders and the goodwill of their customers, and governments comprising elected representatives, employees and the constituents they serve. What goes around comes around. The chickens eventually come home to roost. There is a desire among some for profit without risk. It is not the purpose of prudential regulation to ensure that no company fails. The Soviet Union operated an economy in which no company failed. Regardless of the quality of the management, the quality of the product and the competitive advantage of the sector, every corporation was state owned and none was allowed to fail. In the end, the Soviet Union collapsed because its economy failed. In the same way, the Japanese economy is one of the worse performers in East Asia after North Korea, in part because of its ethic that large banks and trading houses are, as a matter of national pride, not allowed to fail. As a consequence, nine out of the 10 largest banks trading in Japan today are insolvent. Part of the genius of Western civilisation was the realisation that individuals are usually better placed to make decisions about their lives than central authorities. Individuals are the",209,Representatives Main Committee

They are not perfect and they make mistakes, but they are better than distant bureaucracies and central authorities. As a result, we have deliberately set out in the democratic project to limit the scope of private interventions by the state, thereby preserving a large domain of individual freedom. The quid pro quo for that freedom is that individuals take responsibility for the consequences of their decisions. They keep the profit of good commercial decisions and they bear the loss of bad and unlucky decisions. There is luck in life. The expressions ‘caveat emptor’, ‘the vicissitudes of life’ and Shakespeare’s ‘slings and arrows’ all communicate to us in this culture that we are not entirely the masters of our own destiny and that life involves difficulty. For HIH’s liquidator, Tony McGrath, to now sue the regulator for the failure of a company whose excesses, management failures, lack of discipline and commercial failings are so apparent to the whole world following the royal commission is, to me, a demoralising new development in this cultural malaise. In spite of the fact that the rating agency, Moodys, gave HIH a BBB rating until the day it collapsed, the fact that HIH was trading on the stock market as having a capital value and the fact that HIH’s directors, who bore personal responsibility for debts incurred while trading insolvent, believed that it was solvent, it is claimed that the government is to blame for the failure of this enterprise. This is a malaise that we must turn around. It is a mental illness that will kill our culture. This is Australian victim culture at its worse. Do not imagine that this kind of action can take place in a vacuum. The detrimental effects cannot be sealed off from the community as a whole.

Centrelink: Public Toilet Facilities (Question No. 947) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 24 September 2002: (1) Which Centrelink customer service centres in WA have public toilet facilities currently available for use by customers of the agency. (2) Which Centrelink customer service centres in WA have locked the public toilet facilities in their buildings, denying their use to customers. (3) Are there public toilets in the Innaloo Centrelink customer service centre; if not why not. (4) When outfitting the Innaloo Centrelink customer service centre, were public toilets included in the plans for the centre. (5) Does Centrelink have a formal policy about the provision of public toilet facilities at its customer service centres; if so, is this policy publicly available. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Centrelink Customer Service Centres in WA that have public toilet facilities available for use by Centrelink customers are Albany, Geraldton, Gosnells, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Morley, Spearwood, Fremantle, Mirrabooka, South Hedland and Warwick Grove. (2) The Centrelink Customer Service Centres in WA that have locked public toilet facilities are Mirrabooka, Fremantle and South Hedland. Customers can access the facilities upon request to Centrelink staff. These Customer Service Centres have been forced to have restricted access to their public toilets due to constant vandalism and damage to facilities. (3) The Innaloo Customer Service Centre does not supply separate male and female public toilets. It does have an unlocked facility that includes baby changing and bathing equipment, a chair for nursing mothers, washing facilities, sanitary unit and a toilet accessible to customers with a disability. While signposted on the door, the sign makes no reference to a toilet being available in the room. In designing the Customer Service Centre, a decision was taken not to include separate male and female public toilets because of the availability of such facilities in the adjoining shopping centre within 100 metres of the Centrelink Customer Service Centre. (4) Separate male and female facilities were not included in the design. A “Parents’ Room”, which incorporated a toilet, was provided. (5) The Centrelink Policy on Providing Public Toilets is: B.1.2 Policy on Providing Public Toilets Centrelink policy--Centrelink has a policy of providing public toilets for its customers at Customer Service Centres, including toilet specifications for people with disabilities. Public toilets in existing leased premises-Problems in applying this policy may occur in existing leased premises if costs, shortage of space and lessor agreement precludes provision of toilet facilities. Providing public toilets is given higher priority to those offices without public toilets nearby. Public toilets in newly leased premises-Provision of public toilets is an integral component of Centrelink’s accommodation requirements when new leases are being negotiated and will be incorporated into the building design. Public toilets will be provided BEFORE Centrelink’s occupation in newly leased premises. Policy if public toilets are not provided-In existing offices where public toilets are not provided, a sign in the Public Contact Area must be displayed giving the location of the closest public toilets. This sign must also state that any customer with an urgent medical or personal need to use a toilet should seek advice from a member of staff. Defence: Contracts (Question No. 970) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 October 2002:",216,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
367,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the fol(1) Is the Minister aware that the former preferred tenderer, Australian Defence Industries (ADI) has been effectively excluded from participating in the next stage of the Replacement Patrol Boat Main Gun contract by the decision to nominate the Israeli defence manufacturer, Rafael, as the preferred tenderer. (2) Given the current international situation, what were the grounds for nominating a Middle Eastern defence manufacturer for this important contract. (3) Did former Defence Minister Reith meet with the Israeli Ambassador and representatives of Rafael between 1 August and 10 November 2001, when ADI were the preferred tenderers. (4) Is the Minister also aware that ADI’s MSI-DS25M gun mounts are able to be produced at a similar if not lower price, within the contract guidelines and offer superior performance for Australian conditions. (5) Will the Minister provide an assurance that ADI will be able to participate in all remaining aspects of this tender process. Mrs Vale-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Minister is aware that Rafael has been announced as the preferred supplier of the Replacement Patrol Boat main weapon system. (2) Rafael were selected as the preferred supplier of the Replacement Patrol Boat weapon system because their offer provides better value for money to the Commonwealth. Rafael has offered to undertake the production of this weapon system, with the exception of the first unit, in Adelaide by General Motors Defence Australia. This company also proposes to support the system throughlife at its repair and maintenance facility in Palmerston, Northern Territory. These arrangements will result in significant benefits for Adelaide and the Darwin region. Overall a greater Australian industry involvement content is provided in Rafael’s proposal compared to the ADI/MSI tendered solution. (3) Defence has no knowledge of former Defence Minister Reith’s meetings or appointments with the Israeli Ambassador or Rafael representatives during this period. (4) Prices for the MSI-DS25M gun mounts and the through life support tendered in ADI’s proposal were less competitive than Rafael’s proposal. (5) ADI are expected to continue to participate in the tendering process relating to the Replacement Patrol Boat, given that they are one of the successful short-listed companies competing for the build and support of these new vessels. Fuel: Ethanol (Question No. 984) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Is it the Government’s intention to promote the use of ethanol as a substitute for petroleum fuel and as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions; if so, can he produce figures that show all the inputs and outputs including those to the cane farmers’ properties such as (a) tractor fuel, (b) fuel consumed transporting the cane to the mills, (c) fuel consumed in the mill, (d) energy used in the fermentation plant, (e) energy consumed in the distillery producing the ethanol and (f) the fuel consumed in the distribution and sale of the ethanol so produced. (2) Can he provide figures in relation to the level of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the use of ethanol compared with conventionally produced petroleum; if so, what are these figures; if not, why not. (3) Can he provide figures in relation to the level of carbon dioxide emissions that would result from the reduced efficiency of engines running on 10% ethanol and for modified engines running on pure ethanol; if so, what are these futures; if not, why not. (4) Can he say what sum it would cost to modify the average family model motor vehicle sold in Australia so that it could run on pure ethanol; if not, why not. (5) Will the Government establish an ethanol-fuelled motor vehicle industry as exists in Brazil. (6) Can he provide figures for the average fuel efficiency of the Australian light motor vehicle fleet; if so, how do they compare with the OECD countries, if not, why not. (7) Can he say whether it would be better for Australian motor vehicle manufacturers to improve the fuel efficiency of the currently manufactured motor vehicles rather than promoting ethanol schemes; if not, why not. (1) The Government has a broad strategy to increase production of biofuels to 350 million litres/pa by 2010. Environment Australia is currently undertaking a $5 million study to test 20% blends of ethanol in petrol and to investigate demand-side issues that may be affecting market acceptance and take up of bio-fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol. The Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) commissioned CSIRO and RMIT to undertake a comparison of road transport fuels (including ethanol) through a full fuel cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and emissions affecting air quality. This study is available on the website at www.greenhouse.gov.au (2) Yes, results from the CSIRO/RMIT comparative study of vehicle fuels commissioned by the AGO indicate that the achievement of significant net CO2 benefits from the use of biofuels, including ethanol, is associated with the use of leading edge management practice and technologies at all stages of the life cycle. (3) Worldwide, neat ethanol engines have to be purpose built by the vehicle manufacturer and are not usually produced through a process of modification. Carbon dioxide emissions from engines are a product of the efficiency of the engine as well as the greenhouse intensity of the fuel. (4) To the best knowledge of the Government, no Australian manufacturer has considered or therefore costed such a modification. (5) The Government has no plans to establish an ethanol-fuelled motor vehicle industry as exists in Brazil. (6) The Australian national average fuel consumption for new passenger vehicles was 8.28 litres per hundred kilometres in 2001. Average fuel consumption is not directly comparable across countries due to differences in the proportions of different fuels and engine types used in each country and differences in underlying fuel consumption tests. By way of comparison, in July 1998 the European Commission and the European Automobile Manufacturers Associations agreed to a voluntary average fuel consumption target of approximately 6 litres per 100km by 2008. (7) There is no one solution to address the challenge of increasing emissions from the transport sector. Improving the fuel efficiency of new passenger vehicles and increasing the use of alternative fuels are two available options. These are not the only options and they should not be considered to be mutually exclusive. Environment: Smelter Emissions (Question No. 986) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to new smelter emission figures released by the Australian Aluminium Council. (2) Is he able to say whether, in its 1999 public report on emissions, the Australian Aluminium Council reported emissions were about 6.2% above 1990 levels, however the latest figures released earlier in 2002 showed smelter emissions in 1999 represented a much greater increase on benchmark levels than had previously been reported. (3) Is he able to say what are the correct smelter emission figures. (4) Was he aware of the discrepancy between reported and actual smelter emissions. (5) What action has he taken to investigate the discrepancy and to ensure accurate reports in the future. (1) Yes. I am aware of the new smelter emission figures. (2) This is correct. I have been advised that an incorrect figure for 1990 smelter emissions was mistakenly included by the Australian Aluminium Council (AAC) in its 1999 public statement pro-",221,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
368,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,223,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
369,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:vided to the Greenhouse Challenge program. The figures were corrected as soon as the discrepancy was identified, and an amended public statement has been placed on the websites of both the Greenhouse Challenge program and the AAC. (3) Yes. Total smelter emissions from direct and indirect sources were: 1990: 26.2 Megatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions 1998: 28.9 Mt 1999: 29.9 Mt 2000: 31.3 Mt. While these figures do indicate an absolute increase in direct and indirect smelter emissions as a result of a 43% increase in production over the period 1990-2000, relative emissions (emissions per unit of production) have reduced by 16% over the same period. (4) I was advised of this discrepancy and that action had already been taken by the AAC to correct this mistake. This erroneous information was at no time included in any calculations of the impact of the Program. (5) As soon as it became aware of this discrepancy, the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) consulted with the AAC to identify its cause. This investigation established that the AAC had made a mistake in reporting its 1990 smelter emissions, which were used as the basis for comparison with its 1999 emissions. As soon as the error was identified, the AGO and AAC corrected all relevant information and ensured that the revised information was included on both websites. This error was at no time included in calculations of the impact of the program. The AGO is, nevertheless, now giving even greater attention to the checking of all public statements before they are published on its website. Transport: Comcar Drivers (Question No. 992) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 15 October 2002: (1) Further to the Minister’s answers to parts (4) and (6) of question No. 895, does the Depot Supervisor have access to information that identifies which drivers are employed under the collective Australian Public Service award, or a collective agreement or under an Australian Workplace Agreement. (2) What specifically are the operational requirements referred to in the Minister’s answer. (3) Will the Minister table or make available the standard guidelines which determine the use of casual drivers; if not, why not. ourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Operational requirements refers to the number of drivers needed over a span of hours. (3) Specific guidelines which determine the use of non-ongoing resources are as noted in my response to Question 895. These are: (i) Driver availability – which refers to times in a week/day/weekend when a driver declares he/she is available for work; (ii) Fatigue management – which refers to how long a driver has previously been driving (either week/day) and takes into account other activities of the driver; (iii) Cost effective use of resources to meet operational requirements – which refers to the cost involved in allocating, for example, a driver and vehicle for a single short job. Other unforeseen factors may need to be taken into account in the allocation of work on any given day (e.g. changed weather conditions). Foreign Affairs: Australian Ambassador to Indonesia (Question No. 1002) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 October 2002:",223,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
370,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honIn view of the very great respect held on both sides of the House for the outstanding job done by Mr Ric Smith since he was appointed Australia’s Ambassador to Indonesia, will he consider asking Mr Smith to remain for a further period of time in his post in Jakarta, particularly at this critical time in our relationship with the Government of Indonesia; if not, why not. Like the Honourable Member, the government considers that Mr Ric Smith AO has done an outstanding job as Australia’s Ambassador to Jakarta in challenging circumstances. I fully endorse your comments on Mr Smith. Mr Smith was to have returned to Australia the day after the Bali bombings to take up the important position of Secretary of the Department of Defence. Following the Bali tragedy, the government asked him to stay on for around two weeks to facilitate coordination with the Indonesian Government in Jakarta, and then to lead government efforts on the ground in Bali. He has accomplished these tasks and returned to Australia on 31 October to take up his new assignment. Mr Smith has been replaced in Jakarta by Mr David Ritchie as Charge’ d’affaires a.i. Mr Ritchie is a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an experienced and highly regarded officer. Veterans’ Affairs: Payments (Question No. 1021) Has the Minister’s Department made payments to the national or State and Territory branches of the (a) Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, (b) Australian Industry Group, (c) National Farmers’ Federation or (d) Business Council of Australia for consultancies, training and other purposes in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98, (iii) 1998-99, (iv) 1999-2000, (v) 2000-2001, (vi) 2001-2002 and (vii) 2002-2003 to date; if so, what sums and when. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Yes, payments were made to the Launceston Chamber of Commerce in 2000-2001 and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce in 1998-1999. The payments were as follows: Organisation Sum Date Launceston Chamber of Commerce $1.32 22/8/2000 Launceston Chamber of Commerce $12.00 22/8/2000 Launceston Chamber of Commerce $330.50 8/11/2000 Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce $300.00 24/3/1999 (b) No. (c) No. (d) Yes, a payment was made to the Business Council of Australia in 1998-1999. The sum was $495 dated 25/4/1999. Defence: Special Purpose Aircraft (Question No. 1031) Mr Leo McLeay asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 October 2002: (1) When the Governor General travelled overseas recently to attend the El Alamein commemorations did he use a special purpose aircraft. (2) If so, (a) what type did he use, (b) what date did it (i) leave and (ii) return to Australia, (c) how many passengers travelled from Australia, (d) how many passengers could have been accommodated and (e) did it make any refuelling stops en route from Canberra, if so, where.
