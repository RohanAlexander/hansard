If so, when was Sir George so informed? informed some time ago that his term cf office would be extended for twelve months. Some communications subsequently took place between the Government and Sir George Reid, and on 22nd A p r i l I think-ther e was an earlier notification by cable-Si r George was in formed by letter that there would be no further extension of the term after the twelve months had expired. good enough to give the House the reasons why he desires that the services of Sir George Reid shall not be continued ? of High Commissioner was five years. I presume Parliament had good reasons for fixing that period. In addition to the five years, however, Sir George Reid is to serve this Government for an with the Liverpool additional period of twelve months.

Was an appointment made for that inventor to meet Lieutenant Harrisoni n Sydney on 20th November, 1914; did that officer have the meeting referred to, ancl, if so, did he report to the Department on the invention? 3. Has the Defence Department considered that officer's report, and arrived at a decision; if so, has that decision been communicated to the inventor, and, if not, what has been the cause of delay? 4. Has the Minister of Defence any objection to send, confidentially or otherwise, a report to the inventor; if he has not, w ill he direct this to be done promptly? honourable member's questions are as folr low:1. Yes. Many letters have been received in regard to this invention. The first is dated 30th October, 1909, the last l l t h May, 1915. On 14th March, 1914, Mr Temple furnished some particulars of his invention. These were referred to the officer in charge of the Aviation School, who examined them, and submitted an unfavorable report, a copy of which was sent to Mr Temple on Oth April, 1914. 2. Lieutenant Harrison met Mr Templei n Sydney about the 26th November, 1914. On the same day he was recalled to head-quarters for active service, and he left for service abroad immediately afterwards. He did not submit any report. On receipt of a letter dated l l t h May, 1915. from Mr Jolm Plumb, on behalf of Mr Temple, inquiry was made from Lieutenant Harrison, who had, in the meantime, returned to Australia, and that officer sent in a rough note he had made at the time of his interview w i th Mr Temple. 3. This note confirms the previous report communicated to Mr Temple on OthA p r i l , 1914. Mr Plumb, on .behalf of Mr Temple, w ill be informed accordingly. The reason of the delay in so informing him is the pressure of more important and more urgent work in the Department. 4. See 3.

In the previous competition for the lay-out of the city tbe conditions were not acceptable to British designers, and practically no designs from them were forthcoming. 3.

Is it a fact that tbe sorters are before the Court for an increase in their salary? 4.

CATTS -I s operation of a duty to be suspended whenever it is ""common knowledge"" that there is a shortage of the article to which it applies? Surely the Minister can tell us on what information the Government acted. So far as I am aware, we have never been given that information. The Prime Minister stated that the drought was only a little one, and was felt over only a part of Australia. If that be so, there must be other parts which enjoyed a bountiful season, and produced straw, hay and chaff, bran and pollard and oats in abundance. We*ought to be told what parts of Australia escaped the drought, and what the production in those areas was. drought was only a little one, the present proposition is wrong. MrJ . H . CATTS pends on tbe extent of the shortage, which may have been so serious that it warranted the action taken by the Government. We have had the intimation that the House was never consulted on this matter. Certainly we have not had an opportunity to consider it . Now that we have been consulted, the Minister should give us what information he possesses. The Government could not have acted in the dark. I should like to know if Ministers are able to ascertain the position of Australia in regard to other commodities besides those named in the motion.. anything under the amendment moved by what' he proposes to do in regard to the the honourable member the other day.

Queensland Government, I think: MrJ . H . CATTS If it were ascertained that there would be an actual shortage between crops, and that, no matter what price might be offered for fodder, it could not be got locally, the action of tbe Government was justified' because the import duty would then have operated only as arevenue duty, and I am not in favour of the imposition of revenue duties, and have never voted for them. I rose because this is the first occasion on which this matter bas been mentioned, in the House. a dozen questions on the subject. MrJ . H . CATTS -This is the first time that the House has had an opport u n it y , to consider the matter. We are asked now. to r a t if y the action of the Government, and the Minister shouid be in a position to give us the information on which the Government acted. The honourable member for Cook has placed tbe Ministeri n a somewhat difficult position. He must realize as clearly as any one else that it is difficult for the Minister to explain how widespread the drought was when the Prime Minister consistently referred to it as a little In other words, if the drought. ThePrime Minister has always denounced any one who has at"" tempted to draw attention to the sufferE v e r y t h in g deings of our producers as the result of the bad season through which we have just passed. To dare to do that seems to be, in his opinion, unpatriotic and un-British. He appears to fear that the Germans might hear' of it . Consequently out of the purest patriotism he has consistently spoken of the drought as only a little one, although, as we all know, it has been very widespread, and it is not altogether f a i r to ask the M in ister of Trade and Customs to make a' fool, so to speak, of his leader.

The first consignment of lucerne for Victoria is about to be landed, to be followed by the first consignment of cereal fodder; but, in the meantime, thousands of head of stock have died. the Minister that the fodder is coming in duty free constitutes, in my judgment, not Free Trade, but the highest form of Protection that could be offered to count r y producers at the present time, seeing that f u l l y 90 per cent, or 95 per cent, of the farmers are buyers, and not growers and sellers. While I concur in the action of the Government in removing these duties, I should like some explanation from the Ministeri n regard to the application made from Western Australia for a remission of tbe duty on maize. The action of the Government in regard to grain and pulse is perfectly clear to tbe people generally, but they went further, and remitted the duty on hay and chaff; and a statement has been made that that action was taken only after a deputation of Melbourne people bad waited on the Minister-that it was a relief granted, not so much to pastoralists and farmers, as to city people. quence of any action of city people that I communicated with all the Premiers and urged them to take steps! vouch for the accuracy of the statement, except in times of drought we are exbut I know that it was not repudiated porting practically the whole of these at the time it was made. th© Minister to seriously consider the resionally be imported from New Zealand; presentations of the Western Australian and, therefore, the duty is quite worthpeople in regard to the importation of less to the farmer in ordinary years.

The argument that was used as against the importation, namely, that maize could be purchased in Australia, has been proved to be absolutely incorrect; and I see no reason why those who require that commodity should not be placed in the same position as those who require hay and chaff. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [4.17].

In October, when the Premiers met in Melbourne, I visited the Conference on more than one occasion, and afterwards, on behalf of the Pederal Government, I approached the Premiers individually, with a view to some joint action being taken.

Subsequently the Government agreed;-and a public announcement was made to this effect through tlie press-that as Parliament was not sitting, and in view of the shortage-as far as we knew it then existed, judging from the prices that were being, obtained-instea d of importing ourselves, to do the next best thing, .While we could hot remit the duty, as Parliament was not sitting, it was agreed that whatever duty was paid should be ear-marked, and subsequently repaid to the importer.

It is not the fact that there bas been an entire absence of policy in regard to this territory. In my opinion, there has been clear evidence of a well-defined policy, and I do not know that we can object altogether to it , because that policy has been in consonance with the Government's general belief. It has been a Socialistic policya policy which, however suitable it might be to some people under some conditions, is bound to f a i l when applied to the development of a territory such as the Northern Territory. Last year the total deficiency amounted in round figures to £500,000 . Out of that deficiency the sum of £26,880 has to be provided for in tbese Estimates for the payment of salaries. The Minister admitted in this Committee, some time ago, that the Northern Territory presents very great difficulties. I think his speech was the most pessimistic utterance that I have ever listened to from a Ministeri n charge of a large and important Department.

The cattle taken up there have been so treated that they appear to have been lamentable failures, and the whole thing is depressing in the extreme. In view of the fact that the Government's Socialistic policy, when applied to the Northern Territory, has proved itself a failure, [ think it is high time that we should seek to induce the Government to adopt some other policy. we should* at the earliest possible moment, get rid of a large number of the highly-paid ofncials Who have been sent up to the Territory, and save the expenses incidental to their existence there, which Would be by no means limited to the large amount paid in salaries. Having done this, the Government should embark upon some well-defined policy whereby the natural resources of the Territory can be developed. There is tjnly one way in Which that can be done, it is by the establishment of railways. The Northern Territory should be coupled tip, according to our agreement with South Australia, to Oodnadatta, and in the direction of the Macdonnell Ranges, at the earliest possible moment; but I think, also, that there should be railway communication with Queensland. The only policy that can be of any service must be a vigorous policy. As things are now, we are simply frittering away £100,000 this year, and £100,000 next year, without accomplishing anything. There must be a vigorous policy if the Territory is to be developed, and. I suggest that that policy should be a borrowing policy, to raise money so that the necessary railways can be quickly constructed. railway is concerned, I do not think that -tbere is any question at all about its desirability, or that the country in the Macdonnell Ranges is not eminently suited to the production of meat, and more particularly beef. I venture to think that if there had been a railway across that area at we exorbitant prices which have recently been charged for meat in Australia. The construction of such a railway in accordance with a policy which would not impose any immediate additional taxation on the people, would open up the country, would gradually lead to its being inhabited and exploited, and would so benefit, not only the Territory ""itself, but the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. Since We are contributing year after year so much towards the maintenance of the Territory, we are entitled to expect that, sohiething shall be done at the earliest possible moment to give us a return for our money, and, so far as I can see, the only means by which we can secure a return is the production of vast quantities of meat at a lower price than that at WhatI suggest is that which we can obtain it elsewhere. I listened carefully to the speech made last week by the honourable member for Wimmera, who advocated a policy with which I am in no way in agreement. The honourable member urged that we should obtain from India the services of an engineering expert, possessing high qualifications, to advise us with regard to an irrigation policy for the Northern Territory. I am soundly convinced that an irrigation policy is suited only to a welldeveloped country, and not to a virgin land like the Northern Territory. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not give any serious consideration to such a policy. We can readily guess what would be the report made by an irrigation expert from India. He would, in all probability, say that we have in the Northern Territory the necessary water supply to irrigate certain parts' of it, and that, under certain conditions, it would be a profitable venture. But we must not lose sight of the fact that his experience of irrigation would have been gained in a country where the cost of labour is purely nominal, whereas no successful irrigation policy could be carried out where labour is at such a price as that likely to prevail in the Northern Territory. The DepartSo far as the Oodnadatta ment of External Affairs is becoming more interesting since it now not only administer^ the Northern Territory, but also controls Papua. 1 have a few observations to offer with regard to that Commonwealth. Territory. The last report which We have received from the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua shows that in the present time, 1912-13 the territorial revenue amounted should have been saved the to £54,000, or £6,000 in excess of the revenue for the previous year, and more than double that received five years ago. These figures, so far as they go, are eminently satisfactory. They indicate progress and development, and show that the administration of the Territory is moving, to' some extent, along satisfactory lines. statement embodied in this report which acts as an antidote to any feeling of congratulation which the reading of these figures might arouse. I refer to the paragraph in which it is stated that "" the volume of trade last year shows a decline of £11,000."" That is an unpleasant fact in respect of a country that has been developed to a considerable extent at our expense. were £112,000, and of that amount the Commonwealth contributed in various ways £63,000. one half the total revenue. most serious aspects of this decline in the volume of trade is that it relates to exports, which were £5,000 less than for the previous year. The Lieutenant-Governor's report, goes on to sayThis decline in the exports is dne to the reI n various places, we are told, there is duced output of gold, which was £15,000 less than the previous year. I regret that this is so, and I think it worthy of note that the gold-mining ventures in Papua are uot proving as successful as we might have hoped. In the absence of a larger output of gold, the progress of the Territory is not likely to be rapid. There is yet another very unsatisfactory fact relating to the occupation of land in Papua. I am surprised to learn from this report that the area under lease has decreased regularly since 1911. was 60,000 acres less than in 1912-13. That is not an evidence of development. There must be a screw loose somewhere, and we have to ask ourselvas whether we are securing a fair return for our money. Judge Murray refers to a report made by D r . A r t h u r Wade, which deals with petroleum in Papua, and is good enough to say that it is eminently satisfactory. I regard it as being eminently unsatisfactory. I have been studying recently the question of petroleum and oils, and find that it is said by one excellent authority that if a map of the world were marked with a red spot at every place where there are indications and showings of petroleum, it would present the appearance of a person suffering from smallpox. by that statement is that indications of petroleum are very widely distributed over the face of the earth. But there are certain places where petroleum is in But there is another important great abundance, where it has proved of' inestimable value and of great profit. I , for one, would thank Godi f we could find a good flow of crude oil in Australia or Papua. It would be worth making a considerable sacrifice to secure. D r . Wade's report gives some indication that there is likely to be a favorable issue to the operations being carried on in various parts of Papua. He tells us, at The total receipts last year page 15 of his report, thatThree miles to the east of the mission station at Orokolo we found a series of mud volcanoes in the coastal fringe of hills just over one mile north of the fishing village of Hohoro. . . . From Ekoa a series of vents extend eastward for about 4 miles towards Vaiviri on the Vailala River. The mud volcanoes consist chiefly of large flat cones varying from a few inches in diameter to about 20 feet. Much gas is escaping, along with brine, and good showings of petroleum. The sum total of the encouragement appears to be that the indications are good. a possibility of striking a good flow, b ut we have no definite assurance on the subject. The writer of this report goes on to urge the need of caution. He is a prominent authority, and we find h i m statingAfter mature consideration of all the conditions, I , therefore, recommend that the plant necessary for the safe, rapid, and economical development of the Papuan areas is the P-rker Mogul rotary of the latest type, and that the Parker firm be asked to supply to each plant two drillers with a guaranteed practical exI n 1913-14 the area under lease perience of their system. This, however, will entail considerable expenditure, and it may bewell to delay until the present plants on the field have been more thoroughly tested. In other words, we must be cautious. Before entering upon an enterprise which would involve much expenditure, we must make tbe best use of the small and inefficient plant we already have. Again, at page 34 of his report, D r . Wade statesGate valves should be available on the fieldfor controlling and checking the flow of oil, should it be struck. ""Shouldi t be struck!"" Notwithstand ing all his knowledge and experience as a geologist, D r . Wade is not prepared to> make any more definite statement. A t pags 37 of his report he advises rigid The idea sought to hs> conveyed economyRigid economy, as far ns efficiency will allow, should be exercised until commercial quantities of petroleum are struck. Operations? should be hastened with this in view in order to put the working on a sound financial basis.",20,Department Of External Affairs
209,Mr Richah D Foster,O r more than,22,Department Of External Affairs
210,Mr Palmer,"-Quite so. One of theI come now to what ia the more important part of this report, which deals with the policy of the Government for the development of the field which has been examined. D r . Wade saysThe declared policy of the Commonwealth Government is to reserve the oil-field for Government exploitation. It is, therefore, obvious that the development must necessarily be comparatively slow for financial reasons. He says furtherThe effect of the Government policy will, therefore, in case of success, mean that no great output, sueh as is the case in privately owned fields, can be expected from New Guinea for a considerable period. This comes from a disinterested source. The author of this report is not committed to a policy either for or against State owned or State-controlled fields. But -he points out that if this work is undertaken by the Government, it must necessarily be a slow, and therefore an expensive, process. ber putting a proper interpretation upon the report? Wade states furtherThe oil indications, however, extend over a wide area, and, should the Government think fit, a portion of the field oould be thrown open to private enterprise. Taking Eerema as the dividing line, if the Government retained the enormous area to the west, there still remains a large area to the east which iB likely to be idle for a long time. It may be worthwhile considering whether it is good policy to leave this area undeveloped. I would urge the Minister to give some consideration to this particular recommendation. D r . Wade reports thatIf private enterprise is to be admitted, it must be done in the early stages, otherwise if tlie results in the initial stages of the Gounder his control is Norfolk Island, to vernment exploitation of the western field fall short of expectation, it may make it difficult for companies to raise the money required. Suoh disappointments are always possible. A good deal of importance attaches to that proposal. If we are going to develop this or any other portion of the oil fields by private enterprise, then, as D r . Wade says, it is essentially necessary that private enterprise be given the first chance, because if an area proved disappointing it would be very difficult to induce any one to put capital into such a venture in other parts of Papua. Another serious matter-tb e last to which I shall draw attention-relate s to the question of labour. D r . Wade saysLabour is not cheap in Papnn when compared-with wages paid in other oil fields with which I am acquainted. Wages vary from 10s. to £2 per month for labourers and foremen, and, in addition, the men must be housed, fed on meat, rice, tea, sugar, and vegetables, or equivalents, and supplied with a quantity of tobacco weekly, according to Government schedules. A few skilled native workers get as much ns £8 a month with these additions. On the whole, the Papuan labourer is well paid, well fed, ivel] housed, and well treated in every respect. WhilstI am not advocating cheap labour, I do say that if we 'are to make a success of ventures of this nature in competition with other places where still cheaper labour is available, we can only do so at the expense of the general community, and the cost of the article must increase. That is a very serious consideration, and it is well that the Committee should be acquainted with these facts. not very princely. for native""labour. wages which the Government are paying to natives. tion to these matters in the hope that the Minister will think twice before entering upon a large expenditure in the development of these oil fields, because the report which is referred to by Judge Murray as satisfactory seems to me eminently unsatisfactory, having regard to the little assurance that could be given that the oil is really there, and that, even if it is tliere, it is doubtful whether we can work it at a profit. I turn now to another matter. Amongst other interesting places which the Minister of External Affairs has which somereference was made in the course of the debate last week. I was amongst those who were privileged to pay a visit to the island a little time ago. A gentleman who has resided in the island for many years, and has made his home there, describes it as "" B e a u t if u l ! Sublime! Incomparable!"" and he saysWithin its borders are neither public-houses, pawnbrokers, workhouses, madhouses, nor gaols. Add to this its prodigal profusion in nature (for its resources, owing to its wonderful fertility, are proverbial} by the Providence of its Bountiful Creator; its freedom from all conventionality and restraint, the allurements of its occupations on land and sea, the diversity of its refined pastimes and enjoyments, and you have at once a most bewitching island, an ideal home.",22,Department Of External Affairs

The island is not self-supporting, and has not been so during the whole time it has been under the control of the New South Wales Government. According to the reports of Mr AtleeH u n t , at least £1,500 per annum, probably a great deal more, will be required fo carry on and finance the island. The question at once arises as to what use this island is to Australia. It is situated a little more than 1,000 miles due east of Sydney, and has an area of only about 8,000 acres. cannot be more than £40,000 or £50,000. The island is at a great disadvantage in having no natural ports or harbors, but one reason why we should retain it under our control is that if we relinquish our hold, it may be occupied by undesirable neighbours. whatever expenditure is necessary to maintain the island will be borne cheerf u l ly by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. land is done with Australia. great value is to be attached to the trade of so small an island. The present population is largely composed of the Pit cairners, who were the descendants of the Bounty mutineers. lived on tbe small island of Pitcairn, but subsequently, when their numbers bad considerably increased, they petitioned the Imperial Government for a larger island on which to make their home. As the Imperial authorities were at that time about to remove the convicts from Norfolk Island to Tasmania^-and in that fact we have the origin of the name "" New Norfolk ""-the Pitcairners were permitted to enter into possession of the vacated island. census, there were on Norfolk Island 596 Pitcairners, 193 persons connected with the Melanesian Mission-mostl y black boys from other islands who are taken to Norfolk Island for theological training, and subsequently return to their homes -and about 150 other residents, chiefly pure Britishers. making this island pay its own way offers wide scope for the exercise of good government on the part of the responsible Minister. land in 1913 represented a value of £ 9 , 3 7 1 , and came almost exclusively from Sydney, and the exports were worth' only £ 1 , 5 3 1 .

In the first, instance we bad to give to men sent to the Territory a twelve months' engagement, and, of course, men so appointed are somewhat in the position of being able to please themselves as to what they will do, and what they will not do. Tbeir position is very different from that of men who are appointed by the day, and may be dismissed at any time. The drink evil, with which I do not propose to deal now, but to which I may refer at some length when the proposals of the Minister of External Affairs for the nationalization of the drink traffic in the Northern Terriof some of the honourable members of the tory come before us, has also played its unhappy part in the Territory. strongly in favour of pressing on with the agricultural experiments that have beeu begun. The honourable member for Parramatta, when a member of the New South ""Wales Government, was, as Minister of Mines, in charge of the Hawkesbury College; but it is more than probable that that institution did not then pay its way. now. But the teaching that it has given to young Australians, and the experiments which bave been carried out there, have been worth the expenditure upon the college. Wagga Experimental Farm, and similar places. I understand that in Tasmania land which was at one time considered useless is now found to be of great value for apple-growing. Discoveries of this kind are largely brought about by experiments; and in the making of experiments there are sure to be mistakes and loss of money. I was of the opinion tliat the honourable member for Angas, when Minister of External Affairs, did not find his ment Board, which, I think, has dona Treasurer as sympathetic as he might have been. that. member for Swan has good and large ideas, and does not hesitate to spend money on any scheme in which he -liasconfidence. His career in Western Australia proves that. He had faith in Western Australia, and did not hesitate to spend money there. But when Treasurer of the Commonwealth he made one or two remarks about the Northern Territory which were not as complimentary as I should have liked to hear from him -though , no doubt, they expressed hishonest convictions. I , therefore, thought that be was not as sympathetic as he might have been in regard to the experiments that were being carried on in the Northern Territory. Mistakes may have been made in the development of the Territory; but, in spite of that, money must be spent there, and the country has a great future. Listening to recent speeches Opposition, one might think that this I am and the last Fisher Government did not desire to assist the pastoralists in the Northern Territory, yet, when, as Minister of External Affairs, I laid certain regulations before tbe House for the government of the Territory, they were condemned by honourable members of the then Opposition as too liberal. We were prepared to give to the pastoralists areas larger than some of the German principalities; but I was compelled by the speeches and actions of lionorable members of the Opposition, and one or two members of the Labour party, to withdraw my proposals. It is the policy of this Government to help the pastoralists as well as to encourage closer settlement. In attempting closer settlement in otlier The same may be said of the parts of Australia mistakes have been made and failures have occurred. Except for one week wben the Labour party was in power, and could not do much, Victoria has been governed continuously by Liberal Administrations. The State Government have, I believe, honestly tried to settle people on the land, according to their ideas, though these, of course, may differ from the idea* of some of us.

What the honourable member for Barrier says is quite correct. great advantages to he obtained in the southern region, we shall not get men, especially married men, to take their families into such an isolated place, where so many hardships and dangers bave to be faced. attention to by the Leader of the Oppositi o n ; and it is one that this House and tbe Minister w ill have to consider. instance, on page 9 of the Administrator's report we readRecently tlie Chief Surveyor has handed me reports from three of his surveyors, who assert a deficiency in their men's work of 60 per cent, during the summer months. This means that a man is only doing 40 per cent, of tbe work that is done in the States. There is another statement of great"" interest in the report, that which deals with a subject that has been so often discussed in this House, namely, day labour versus contract labour. Honourable members opposite have declared, over and over again, that the Government are getting a very much better return under day labour than under contract; but on page 76 of the report we are told by the Superintendent of Public WorksDuring the last year, both systems, viz., day labour and contract, have been tried by this Department in carrying out work, and from the figures submitted herewith there oan be but one opinion which of the two systems is the better.. In my two preceding annual reports I have touched upon this question, and I should be wanting in my duty if 1 did not again call Your Excellency's attention -to the great difference in the cost of similar works carried out by tbe two different systems. pure and simple! There is no great national policy about this! MrM c WILLIAMS It is all very in terestingI give two instances :Two workers' cottages in Beetson-street erected By day labour eost £640 each. A cottage of similar design at Fanny Bay gaol, carried out by contract, was finished for £530. besides paying cartage on the longer distance. It will thus be seen that £110 was the difference paid in wages on this day-labour job as compared with an exactly similar one carried out by a contractor. The whole of the materials for both jobs was supplied from the Public Works store, in one instance to the Department, and in the other to the contractor, the price for materials in both cases being the same. Further, the Superintendent saysThe teacher's residence, Darwin, by contract cost £f,0S3. A similar house built on block 598 by d,ay labour cost £I,'330 8s. 7d. Certainly in this ease the whole of the foundationWhile there are blocks had to be blasted out and the material carted about a mile further than was the casein the first Jiouse, but even, after allowing for this expenditure, £130, the eost of the house by day labour was £1,200, or £119 more than the contract house. man's supervision ? sacked. MrM c WILLIAMS He ought to be sacked for telling the truth? Is that your policy, then? that spirit at all. I mean he should have been sacked for not doing the work better. MrM c WILLIAMS I know nothing about this officer. My only knowledge of him has been from reading his report; but I do say that when the bead of a Department makes a report through a Minister to this Housei t is the duty of the House to give it careful consideration. He goes on to sayI do not hear the contractors complain about losing money. In fact, the contractor they have on the Fanny Bay job offered tp take on as many cottages as 11 , e could get at the same figure. There are other quotations here to which I might refer. One, for instance, in which he states that, although the contractor is not working his men as easily as the men are worked by the Government, yet, owing to the curious irony of tli,e situation, these men are giving the contractor in finitely better services than ever they gave to the Government. In dealing with the difficulty of getting men, the Administrator reportsThe great trouble of farming in the NorthernTerritory is the dearth of capable farm bands.

I may not be in the House next week when the question ol the nationalization of the liquor traffic in the Northern Territory comes up for discussion, and I should like now to express the opinion that this proposal on the part of the Government is the most serious that they could make. A number of so called hotels up there should be purchased by the Minister and a fire-stick applied to them. not like to burn down any man's house without paying him for it , and some of these hotels are fit only to be burned. nationalization of the liquor traffic should not be undertaken without the very gravest consideration. I do not think it is in the interests of Australia that the Government of the Commonwealth should become the owners of the hotels in the Northern Territory.

MrM c WILLIAMS that, as the honourable member knows very well, there have been two or three attempts to close the parliamentary refreshment bar, but that not one honourable member who has come forward with such a proposal has stood by it and given the House an opportunity to vote upon the question. I shall vote to close the parliamentary bar: but that, surely, is no reason for establishing Government bars in the Territory. D r . MALONEY (Melbourne) [5.54] I have f u l l belief in the potentialities of the Northern Territory, and hope that it will prove the salvation of the Commonwealth. The several States have shown a strong objection to hand over to the Commonwealth any land for settlement purposes, and we must therefore look to tbe Northern Territory as a field for our experiments in that direction. The exoeriment in land tenures in the Federal Capital Territory is, I feel sure,' being followed with a great deal of attention by the thinking, economic world. When our own people are supplied with farms, when, instead of hundreds of applicants for one block of land, there are hundreds of blocks of land awaiting settlement, we should take charge of the current of emigration from the Old World, which, I feel sure, will set in as soon as this terrible war is over, and direct it to tbe Northern Territory. Peoplei n the older The countries of Europe, perhaps over-burdened with taxation, will look to this newer land so l i g h t! than in any other country. The executors of the estate of a millionaire in Victoria would have to pay a 10 per cent, probate duty, whereas in Great Britain they would have to pay 15 per cent. Again, a man investing in property in Melbourne would have to pay a municipal rate of Is. 6d. in tbe £ 1 , running up, in the case of some of the suburban I think the Gomunicipalities, to 2s. 3d. in the £ 1 , whereas in London the municipal rating ranges from 8s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. in the £ 1 . millionaire dying here would have to pay honourable nearly 25 per cent, by way of State and Federal probate duties. is only temporary-it is to prevail only during the war. temporary about it .

I would point out that recently there were something like 1,""000 applicants for three blocks of land in South Australia, and over 500 for one block in Victoria. But wben we have supplied tbe wants of our own people, I should like to see us extend our arms in wide welcome to the white races of the Old World, and employ them in filling up the empty north.

I have never failed to express my appreciation of what South Australia did for the rest of the Commonwealth in holding the Northern Territory for it.

It is also very necessary that, instead of wasting time on what is likely to prove, shall I say, a profitless discussion, we should proceed to set our house in order. When the war comes to an end, we shall have to deal with greatly changed conditions. willingly We shall have huge financial and industraining trial problems to solve, and the sooner we prepare for them the better for the people of Australia. My chief object in rising to-night is to take exception to the argument which has been repeated again and again during this discussion, that we are committed, under the agreement made with South Austraexperimental farm,' where lia, to build a railway north and south from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek.

Therefore, I say again, let us, for goodness' sake, be done with theoretical propositions, and, guided by tlie experience of the past, develop the Territory along the same lines as those on which other portions of the Commonwealth have been so successfully settled and developed. honourable member for Lilley has pleaded with Parliament to adopt a practical method of settling tbe Territory, and to be done w it h theoretical ideas. Apparently tbe practical method of the honourable member is to adopt the suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan, that a railway should be taken into the Northern Territory by a side window. The strategic railway mooted by the Government at the present time is practically based on evidence given before the Commission that investigated the Northern Territory railways and ports. Mr. J. Harper, Assistant Commissioner for Railwaysi n New South Wales, proposed a scheme somewhat similar to that suggested by the honourable member for Swan. He was asked (Q. 620-21), "" A r e you aware that the contract with South Australia absolutely binds the Commonwealth"" to construct the direct line from north to south ?"" He replied, "" We are looking at it from a railway point of view only."" "" W o u l d the system you suggest be used for trucking starving stock in times of drought?"" He replied, ""Undoubtedly."" My own opinion is that starving stock would not be carried on th_at roundabout route. Then he was asked, "" In suggesting these eastern connexions, you are not looking at the development of the Territory as the prime reason for building railways?"" and his answer was a direct "" No . "" There we have direct evidence that this suggested railway, which is to go to BrokenH ill through Temora,through tlie far west of New South1 Wales, and on to the Territory, is not. meant to develop the Territory at all. Camooweal line. same line. Even if it were not, its result would be the same, because it would not develop the Territory. When I said that the possibilities of the Territory are immeasurable-a phrase whichwas referred to satirically by the honourable member for Lilley-I was not expressing my own opinion, because I have not seen tbe Territory; but I was expressing the opinion of those who are qualified to speak, and who do know the truth of what they say. If honourable memberswill read the evidence taken before the Royal Commission, they will make their voices heard, so that in the next Esti-. mates provision will be made for the actual development of the Northern Territory, instead of for merely playing with it. Other witnesses before the Commission testified that the only way in which to develop the Territory was to build me north-south railway. We find that the first route suggested by the Commission is "" A, South-east-Camooweal."" Seven witnesses subscribed to that line, and amongst them were two Railway Commissioners^-one, Mr Harper; and the other, Mr Pagan, Deputy Commissioner of Railways in Queensland. Tbe seconc! recommendation was "" B, North-south Central."" Thirty witnesses advocated this route, and twenty also favoured a branch to Camooweal-not to Newcastle Waters and thence to the Territory, allowing time itself to bridge the interval. The Commonwealth spent a large amount of money in endeavouring to ascertain from experts what was the best thing to do, and yet to-day we are still discussing what should be done. Last year the NorMr Combes asked him, thern Territory cost the Commonwealth about £470,000, of which between £80,000 and £90,000 represented the loss on the Oodnadatta line. Therefore, it is about time that steps were taken to make effective use of that portion of the Territory's railway system. It is an established fact that once the belt of country between Oodnadatta and Charlotte Waters is crossed, what is said to be splendid country in regard to both climate and productivity is entered.

281,Mr Yates,"It is practically thedoubt on the wheat-growing capability of the Territory. had lived in the Territory for any length of time, I should be prepared to accept their opinion on the subject, but they are persons who have not visited the Territory, or know scarcely anything of it . It is to be remembered, too, that thousands of acres in the southern parts of Australia, which it was once thought were useless for wheat-growing, are now wheat fields. Probably South Australia grows more wheat on country that at one time was held to be useless for wheat-growing than she grows on the land that was regarded from the first as good wheat country. on mallee country which was long thought to be useless. As to the capability of ths Northern Territory for the growing of wheat, let me quote the opinion of Mr Giles, the explorer, as stated in a letter written to MrJ . G. Knight, C.E., Chief Warden of Gold Fields in the Northern Territory, and published in the Northern Territory Times. The letter is dated l l t h May, 1880, and Mr Giles saysFrom the northern base of the Macdonnell Range to the west range (Hann), is a distance of 70 miles, the whole of which is magnificently grassed, although timbered thickly in places by mulga (acacia). At 25 miles from the Macdonnell Range are rolling downs, thickly grassed, and equal in richness of soil to any in South Australia, being inundated plains of rich black and red soils, fit for the .growth of wheat. The climatic advantages of this country are beyond dispute. does not refer to the country round about Darwin. sion of the railway from the south do not say that the Darwin country will do all that has been claimed for it , but it is to be expected that as settlement follows a line eroing northwards, stock and human beings will gradually become acclimatized, and when Darwin is reached, will be able to successfully contend with any disadvantage that may exist there. While the representatives of South Australia demand that the right thing shall be done so far as their State is concerned, they bave none the less the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. But the proposal of the right honourable member for Swan was to give to Queensland benefits which should go to South Australia. That is evident from the terms of bis letter, which I shall read. The right honWere they persons who orable gentleman saidThe Commonwealth would undertake to construct a railway from Camooweal through the Barclay Tableland, and thence up the Katherine River, which will, by that time be connected with Port Darwin. There is there no hint of tlie continuation of the line southwardsIn the construction of this work all the traffic of rails, machinery, and sleepers would be carried pver the Queensland lines; and I am informed wooden sleepers can be obtained in Queensland. That in itself during the time of construction would mean an immense advantage to Queensland. Then it would necessarily have the trade of the Northern Territory from Newcastle Waters and the Barclay Victoria, again, is growing wheat Tableland, which would all gravitate into Queensland. any circumstances, go to Adelaide. the production of the Barclay Tableland would go to South Australia, but the extension of the line northwards from Oodnadatta would give us the trade with the Macdonnell Range country. The right honourable member for Swan said further, regarding his proposalI t would be an outlet for the enterprising people of Queensland, and would encourage them to occupy and utilize the lands in tlie Northern Territory. Why should not the enterprising people of South Australia be encouraged by the extension of the line from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges? Have we not a special claim to that advantage? All the evidence of those who know the Northern Territory best points to the conclusion that it should be connected with the rest of Australia by a line going north from the existing line in South Australia. The proposal of the right honourable member for Swan would serve only part of the Territory. The honourable member for Lilley has argued that the right honourable member had in view an extension southwards from Newcastle Waters to Oodnadatta; but the concluding paragraph of the letter is against his contentionThe western portion, however, is impossible, unless we have communication with Queensland, and, if that is denied to us, we must turn our attention to connecting the Northern Territory from Oodnadatta, a policy to which we are already pledged.

I believe that at the present time a survey is being made from Kingbouya to Oodnadatta. do not object, nor should I object to any deviation from a direct route which would have the effect of serving better country than that on the direct route, so long as the line was extended northwards from Sitting suspended from G.SO to 7.^6 p.m. tion from Mr Giles' letterNorth of Hann Range the country continues good and splendidly grassed, but badly watered. Brackish water has been obtained at 80 feet in abundance. The country offers every facility for dam sinking. At 20 miles north of Hann Range the road touches the Wood Creek, and follows it a distance of 40 miles, the whole of its course heing through richly-grassed plains, with occasional patches of mulga timber, up to the base of Central Mount Stuart, under the foot of which runs tbe Hanson Creek, where permanent water exists a few inches under the sand, and by using a plough and scoop in the bed of the creek large reservoirs can be scooped out, yielding unlimited supplies of water. land along the course of the creek maintains its rich character for grass and herbage, improving as it approaches tbe Stirling Creek, and rendering it exceptional for agricultural or pastoral purposes. Water may be got at an exceedingly shallow depth. -We thus know beyond doubt what the country is like in the Macdonnell Eanges. However, I desire to deal with that phase with which we are more immediately concerned. A Commission of our own creation, which reported last year, gives ample evidence of what the Northern Territory really is, and affords sufficient information on which the Department of External Affairs could do more than simply try to conduct the affairs of this immense area by sending an Administrator on long and circuitous journeys, and, from time to time, receiving reports from him, only to learn from all sorts of sources that there is turmoil and domestic unrest in that quarter. I maintain, and it is the opinion of most people, that, if we could get into the Territory w i th more ease and expedition, things would begin to right themGovernment selves more quickly from an administrative point of view; and I feel positive that the desired end could be best attained by The,, carrying the proposed railway from north to south. Tlie leases in the Territory expire in 1944, but about one-half of them expire much earlier, and tliis gives us Oodnadatta ample opportunity to review our policyOne settler, in reply to a question put by the Commission in regard to railways,, To that I saidIn the event of a railway passing through the northwards country, I think that every pastoralist would be quite prepared to surrender portion of his land. The leases are of such magnitude, simply Oodnadatta. because of the lack of moans of communication. The report of the Commission To continue my quotasaysThe Northern Territory Land Act should be so framed as to allow for that. Wo can do nearly as much on 3,000 miles of country with a railway as on (i.OOp miles without a railway With compensation for improvements we would be quite prepared to surrender portion of our lease. Occupiers are forced to hold double the quantity of land under present conditions, but, w i th proper railway facilities, there would be two settlers where now there is one. Dealing with the matter as affecting the Barclay Tablelands, the report of the Commission saysThe Evidence goes to show that under more favorable conditions the stock-carrying capacity would be largely increased. One witness stated that on 0,000 square miles his firm at the present time carried 35,000 head, but that lie hoped to see the day when the run, with improvements, would carry 100,000 head. But there cannot be improvements u n t i l proper facilities are afforded, and those facilities, according to the evidence, must take the form of railway communicationIn other words, the carrying capacity is capable of bein<; almost trebjed. If that be so, it is evident that there is something in the country which ought to spur us on to attract population. Another witness, speaking of the Barclay Tablelands, saysOn one station on the Barclay Tablelands sheep have been raised for many years, the present number being 58,000. The industry is under great disabilities owing to insufficiency of water, cost of fencing material, high rate of freight, distance from markets, and scarcity of labour.",35,Department Of External Affairs
286,Mr Yates,"These difficulties would be obviated by the provision of a railway; in fact, the witness saysThose disabilities would be certainly minimixed with railway communication. curry railway? railway would assist the Barclay Tablelands more than would the straight-cut railway; but it does not follow that, because the railway is taken from north to south, branches cannot be made, as recommended in the report. There is good country on the west side of the Territory-in the Victoria Eiver and Ord River districts-whic h is highly spoken of by Mr L. A. Wells, of the South Australian Lands Department. Wells has explored that part of the country, and his brother lost his life in similar work; and he tells us that the country west of the telegraph line is some of the most wonderful he has seen. He admits that there are belts of desert, so to speak; but with a railway from the main track into the Victoria River district, there are immense possibilities of development. In conversation with myself he said that he never saw bigger-framed flocks, and never tasted better mutton in his life than he did there; and he is certainly a man who knows what he is talking about. A l though the line mentioned by the Postmaster-General might be the better one for the Barclay Tablelands, some of the richest country, from a metal-bearing point of view, is to be found in the centre of Australia; and this country, along with the pastoral country, would be best assisted and developed by means of a railway. Speaking of the Victoria River district, one witness before the Commission saidOn an area of about 11,000 square miles (7,040,000 acres) his company was carrying 107,000 bead of cattle and 900 head of horses. Ho believed that by providing water it would safely carry 30,000 head more. To provide water we must provide facilities for conveying the necessary machinery and labour, and there is no doubt that in this way the stocking capacity of the country could be nearly doubled -Another witness, an owner and manager, saidHe held 1,50.0 miles of country, carrying 5,000 head of cattle and 700 horses. In the event of a railway he would be willing, under certain conditions, to surrender part of his country. The block he would surrender would carry 10,000 head of cattle, and not be overstocked. This the settlers are prepared to do as soon as the Commonwealth is prepared to settle the country, instead of waiting for the Administrator to do it. Another paragraph in the report of the Commission isOne station owner and manager expressed the opinion that the whole of the Victoria River country, from the Kith parallel south, was, generally speaking, good sheep country. He estimated that with railway facilities that country would carry from 20,000,000 to30,000,000 sheep easily, and a great number of big stock as well. Then Mr Richard Murray, of the DeMr partment of Forestry, South Australia, told the CommissionTliere is country to the north of the Macdonnell Ranges wliere I have seen grass you could mow, and that country is unoccupied. Tliere is some fair country also in the vicinity of the Truer Ranges which is untouched at the present time. Another piece of evidence isAt the present time the two holdings carried about 10,500 head of cattle and 1,800 horses. On an average they sunt away about 1,500 head of fats per year; but in bad seasons they were obliged to hold them over, or sell as stores. With a railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges this country would carry more stock, because necessary improvements in providing water would be possible. According to people who know, tbe development of the Territory depends on railway communication; and this is what ought to first occupy the attention of the Government. My object in speaking is, if possible, to obtain a promise more definite than that given last week by the Prime Minister in Adelaide, namely, "" Leavei t with us, and we will see it is done."" I wish for some definite, specific promise, for which the report of the Commission affords ample justification. It is not only South Australia that asks for this railway. The motion on which the Prime Minister gave the assurance that I have just mentioned was submitted by delegates from Tasmania, who regarded it as imperative tliat the Territory be developed by carrying the railway from Oodnadatta north; and certainly Tasmanians cannot be charged with taking a local or prejudiced view of the situation.

288,Mr Yates,"No doubt the Cloncurryin his evidence before the Commission, saidThe country round Hergott did not look well; but from about the Coward northward, right to Arltunga, feed is luxuriant, and water abundant-that was when I was up in March. According to that gentleman, had the railway been in existence during the recent drought, it would have been possible to send stock to Charlotte Springs, where feed was very abundant. The same witness further saidWhen1 came down in December of the same year, the country was dry in parts, and had I -written my description then I might not have been so enthusiastic. It w ill be seen that this witness is unquestionably expressing his genuine opinion, for he does not depend on what he saw in March. He said furtherThe Macdonnell Ranges struck me as being a most wonderful place for horse breeding. It is to bridge that strip of what is called desert country that we ask for railway extension. Of course there is an extension from Pine Creek to Katherine River, but I doubt whether that railway w ill afford such facilities for the development of the Territory as would an extension from Oodnadatta. covered ? and 400 miles. Mr Henry Lewis, pastoralist, of Adelaide, said to the CommissionI have travelled across (north and south) six times, and I consider that every mile of country between Oodnadatta and the Katherine is good country for cattle and hordes. Anywhere north of Newcastle Waters would be too wet for sheep, but there is room for plenty south of that. Sir is there between Oodnadatta and the Macdonnell Ranges now? as a compendium of statistics. I am quoting the evidence of others, who know the country well. member admitted, after an interjection from the honourable member for Grey, that he did not go into the Northern Territory, but came in by the Alberga Riverf r o m the north-west coast of Australia. from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. stock there is. honourable gentleman has reached the time limit . confess a feeling of some surprise that the South Australian Government ever allowed this wonderful Territory to be taken over by the Commonwealth. I have been listening here night after night to speeches describing what a wonderful land it is the Commonwealth, but it has been misplaced. The South Australian Government must have been giving away something very great, according to the wonderful resources that have been described to us. Yet, after the lapse of all this time, and after the expenditure of so much money, we only see barren results. spent? Not in the way this Commission recommends. some change in the expenditure of money on the Northern Territory. I was one of those who, a few years ago, severely denounced the expenditure that was then taking place, and I hope we shall not have I think between 300 any repetition of that sort of thing. WhatI want to point out is that the arguments we have heard apply, not only to the Northern Territory, but to the whole of northern Australia. We have to realize that that area must be populated. The honourable member for Franklin pointed out to-night that if we wished to retain our hold on northern Australia we should have to populate it , and in order JOHN FORREST -Ho w much stock to do this the Administration should be sympathetic, and should show, not only a keen desire to induce people to go there, I do not hold myself up but a desire to treat them f a i r l y when they are there. It is absurd for us to bring forward a scheme of closer settlement at The right honourable present. If we realize the history of Victoria, of New South Wales, and of other portions of the continent, we see that the pastoralist came first, and opened up the country. He was followed by the farmer, and after that people began to talk about is 300 miles closer settlement. It must be the same in the Northern Territory. We must build up its pastoral and mineral resources first. Wben we get people going there like the Vestey Brothers, who w ill put for-",37,Department Of External Affairs

Although the pastoral industry should be developed, one cannot help realizing that the mining industry, if encouraged, is the industry that is most likely to attract population. The history of Victoria shows the wonderful growth of population, ancl the great development that took place after the discovery of gold. My own experience in connection with ""Western Australia showed that the same thing happened there. ""We had an enormous area, with great resources, and yet, unti l gold was discovered, there was very little development. After gold was found a large population came to Western Australia. ment, ancl at the present time we bave a very large agricultural industry in the State. I hope the Minister w ill do all he can to encourage mining in the Northern Territory, by seeing that the raining laws are sufficiently sympathetic to encourage capital. It is all very well for us to try to assist small holders, and endeavour to induce people to start mining, but-the only way in which mining can be built up successfully in that particular country is by having the mining laws so drawn up that the people who invest their money can secure a good title, and be assured that they w i ll get from the Government a f a i r deal and every protection. I am not advocating anything in the nature of a fee-simple so f a r as mining propositions are concerned. That, in my opinion, would be a very great mistake, but those who are prepared to spend money should be told by the mining Ordinances that they w ill be f a i r l y dealt with, ""whatever the results of their enterprise. It is only by the establishment of large companies that we can hope for anything in the nature of a big mineral production in tbe Northern Territory. In this respect the history of Western Australia should be a guide to the Minister. Western Australian fields and conditions, and should be able to frame mining Ordinances that w ill induce capital to come forward and help in the work of development. He has framed certain Ordinances in connection with exclusive prospecting licences. There is danger if the Minister allows any person who has obtained a licence to have the exclusive right of mining over an area of 5 square miles. This might be all right if it applied only to something in the nature of a rare metal the existence of which was problematical. I had an experience of this sort myself once, and the Minister will recognise the difficulty that would arise if any one person with an exclusive liceucs to prospect for gold were to discover an alluvial lead in his holding; or lie w ill , without doubt, imagine the trouble that would follow the discovery of alluvial t in . I would, therefore, strongly urge the Minister to exclude any of the royal metals from these mining Ordinances, or anything in the nature of alluvial t in . the holder to all minerals ? him the right to the mineral named upon the permit obtained from the Department, but I am sure gi'ave trouble would arise in the event of alluvial discoveries. I am quite in accord with a number of members in regard to railways. To develop the country railways must be built. A f t e r my experience in Western Australia, I do not think the railways should be built necessarily as the engineers desire, or be so heavily ballasted that trains can travel 30 or 40 miles an hour. Prospecting railways are required to carry goods, and admitting of travel at the rate of 14 or 15 miles an hour. If railways are to be built through Queensland, or from the south, they should be as light as possible, and constructed so that they can be made sufficiently strong to meet subsequent requirements. Water supply is also a subject of tremendous importance to that Territory, and, in my view, a large number of boring parties should be sent out with the object of locating subterranean water. In fact, I would advise the M i nister to get the map prepared by the Western Australian Government to see what was done in the back country there He has had a big knowledge of with the object of providing water for prospectors. I am quite satisfied that if tbe Minister spent £100,000 in the course of the next two or three years on a definite policy in this respect, even if it did not prove to be of material assistance in the discovery of minerals as well, the",38,Department Of External Affairs

I found one very good way was by putting down a 6-inch bore and a pipe with grating attachment at the bottom. else, and .that means was always sufficient to provide water for a prospecting party. If , afterwards, settlement took place, we could make a more permanent supply. Another matter upon which I would like to touch has reference to the establishment of treatment plants, and I want to say openly that no blame attaches to the present Minister for the large expenditure recently incurred under this head. He is merely following the late Administration. Treatment plants are established for the purpose of enabling a prospector to realize to some extent the value of the ore that he may produce. It had been decided to erect a plant for the treatment of t in at Maranboy, but I was rather astonished to discover that it was intended to erect a ten-head mill. I saw the Minister, and pointed out to him that we bad done the same class of work at Greenbushes, in Western Australia, and suggested to him that a five-head mill would be more than ample for the requirements of the district. I also pointed out to him that, in a district such as that the great cost to the prospector was that of getting his ore to tbe m ill, and that it would be f a r better to position they w ill be f u l l y protected under have two small plants in different spots than one large central m ill . mine, what would be the use of two plants ? of one mine; but here you have a tenhead plant involving an expenditure of something like £20,000. districts are discovered, how many plants of this sort is it proposed to erect? I am satisfied that the House would object to the heavy expenditure the frequent erection of large plants like this would involve, particularly as a much less expensive plant costing £9,000 or £10,000 would have done all that was necessary. I think there is only 1,600 tons of ore available now, and with that large plant it would be possible to crush the district out within a couple of months. Such a large mill is not necessary, and I hope that future action by the Ministeri n this respect will be more in the direction of erecting small treatment plants, which will be ample for all requirements. We have done a great deal of this kind of work in Western Australia. I advocated the erection of these plants as strongly as did any member of the In many instances we had nothing State Parliament, and yet, when I left office, I had serious misgivings as to the value of the work we had done. We had produced something over £4,000,000 worth of gold, the wholo of which went, not into big outside companies, but into the pockets of our own people. There was, nevertheless, a doubt as to whether the working of these plants was beneficial to the mining industry. In many districts where we had small parties working, all the rich ore was crushed by men who, having done this, neglected their holdings, -with the result that a very great number of them are now deserted. On the other hand, if small plants had been taken there to assist prospectors in ascertaining the value of their propositions, and in inducing others to come in w it h ample capital for the development of their properties, I feel sure that, instead of so many of these holdings being abandoned and the districts deserted, as they are today, we should have had big mines in f u l l operation. If the Minister w ill give in vestors an assurance of generous mining laws; if he w ill give them an assurance that if they put money into a mining prothe mining Ordinances; if he w ill see that a large sum is expended on water supyou had only one plies, and also enter upon a good system of light railway construction, he w ill do much to induce settlement and development in the Territory. The matter of the development of the north does not apply only to the Northern Territory. If other We have an immense coast-line, stretching from Western Australia round to Queensland, and every effort should be made by the Government of the day, not only to promote settlement, but to develop the industries we already have there.

306,Mr Gregory,"This is not the caseLabour party would sooner see that industry closed down than allow it to be carried on with alien coloured labour. The pearling industry, however, has done much to develop north-western Australia, and to open up the resources of Western Australia itself. I do not wish to discuss the merits or demerits of coloured labour in connection with the industry. A Royal Commission, of which I am a member, has been appointed to inquire into the matter, and I should not care tc make any statement regarding a subject which, so far as I am concerned, at least, should be treated at the present time as sub judice. The Commission does not intend to hold any meeting until the war is over, and the industry is once more being actively carried on. fice of human life been terrible in the pearling industry? we are not going to ask that our own people shall be employed in such an industry. statistics regarding the pearling industry are in respect of the year 1912. They show that in that year, in Western Australia alone, we had 401 pearling boats, of the value of £186,000, and that during the year they raised shell to the value of £421,000, in addition to pearls of the value of £100,000. These boats employ a large number of white people, as well as a large amount of alien coloured labour. I wish to point out, however, what the pearling industry did for the development of Western Australia. In the old days, before the pastoral industry of the State had been developed, many entered upon the pearling industry, made money out of it, and then opened up the pastoral industry in the north of Western Australia. A number of these, in turn, having made a good deal of money, settled in Perth, invested in several industries there, and also shell. The industry was then very prosinvested largely in land in the agricultural areas adjacent to the capital. They were very largely responsible for a good deal of the development of Western Australia. The pearling industry is a big one. Broome, until the outbreak of the war, had a larger white population than any other town in the north-west of Western Australia, and we desire to do all that we can to retain population there. Life in the north-west is no mere frolic. of Broome? white population was about 1,100, but I am afraid that it has dwindled away to something like 500. I am not asking that the Minister shall alter at present any of the existing regulations relating to the industry; but the honourable gentleman has recently given permits to a Targe firm, enabling it to employ some forty or fifty boats in the trade. I believe that at present twenty-five permits have been granted. benefit of Broome. ing that; but my keen desire is that no monopoly shall be created in connection with the pearling industry. If wo are to have such an industry, I desire that the boats employed in it shall be owned by individuals, and not by companies. I should like to see the industry controlled by people owning at the outside not more than seven or eight boats each, so that we may secure the largest white population possible in the north, and in order that the profits of the industry shall be distributed over as large a section of the community as possible. good idea, but the honourable member knows very well that the industry can be most profitably worked by a company that has a schooner to follow its fleet of boats. Minister should remember that the industry was never more profitable or better regulated than during the two or three years immediately preceding the outbreak of war. high price of shell. arrangements that had been made, they were getting about £220 per ton for their perous; a, remarkably large number of pearlers owned only one boat, each, and quite a number owned only two or three each. I am sure that the Minister, like all of us, desires that if we have such an industry it shall employ as many white people as possible, so that we may not only maintain but increase tbe white population of the north.

That statement continuedwhich will open up the country for agricultural and pastoral settlement. Without these main lines of transit it will be impossible to complete our defences or to adequately develop the resources of the Northern Territory. That was the policy of the late Government, and had we remained in ofiice we fully intended to carry it out. It has been said by honourable members representing South Australia, and I think it is understood by a good many people outside, that there is in existence an undertaking by the Commonwealth to build a railway to connect Port Darwin with South Australia vid the Macdonnell Ranges and Oodnadatta-the line which the late Government proposed to buildbut I submit that no undertaking of that kind was given by tliis Parliament or by anybody unti l the late Government placed that proposal in their platform. I will read the agreement into which the Commonwealth entered with South Australia when it took over the Northern Territory, and honourable members will be able to judge for themselves as to whether the Commonwealth had undertaken to' do that which tbe late Government proposed to do. The Commonwealth, by its agreement with South Australia, undertookto construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of .South Australia proper, which railway, with the railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect therewith, is hereinafter referred to ns the transcontinental railway. Alsoto construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. I know that at the time those words were used the Government were not sufficientlyinformed on the subject to know exactly the route the railway would follow from Port Darwin to join the railway from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta, and therefore that language was employed; but the Commonwealth was bound to build a railway to cross the northern boundary of South Australia somewhere. I only mention this fact to show that those who argue that the Commonwealth is committed to the construction of a railway direct southward along the telegraph line from Port Darwin, vid Alice Springs and the Macdonnell Ranges, to Oodnadatta have no foundation in this agreement for the statements they make. The only foundation they can claim is that the late Government, of which I was a member, did mention, as part of their policy, the construction of a line to connect Port Darwin, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, with Oodnadatta. That is the only pledge that has been given-a t any rate, in such definite words,-by any one. Reference was made in the House a few nights ago, and by the honourable member for Grey in the South Australian press, to a letter written by the then PrimeM in ister, at my suggestion, to the Premier of Queensland, in which it was advocated that a railway should be built by tbe Queensland Government to Camooweal from Cloncurry, a distance of about 150 miles, on condition that tbe Commonwealth carried its line on westward through the Barclay Tablelands to Newcastle Waters and thence northerly u n t i l it joined the railway coming south from Pine Creek and the Katherine River. the Commonwealth should build from Camooweal, which is in Queensland, to the border? was to carry our line to the Queensland border somewhere near Camooweal, which is very close to the border.

I set before myself the construction of that great national work, and I glory in the fact that my efforts were successful. I pledged ourselves to build this railway, the question of route between tlie Katherine River and Oodnadatta, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, had to be considered. knowledge to justify me in expressing an opinion, but 1 was guided by the opinion of D r . Gilruth, who had travelled over the country between Newcastle Waters and Alice Springs, and described it as being very poor. He did not advise that the railway should go in that direction, but thought that a detour should be made through the Barclay Tablelands, which is excellent country, to a place called Anthony's Lagoon; thence to Alroy Station; and thence southward for 339 miles to Alice Springs. The distance from Newcastle Waters to Alice Springs vid the telegraph line, is 470 miles, and a detour as proposed by Dr. Gilruth would increase the distance by about 100 miles. . One great advantage in that route which appealed to me was that it Would pass through good country all the way from Newcastle Waters to Anthony's Lagoon and Alroy Station, a distance of 238 miles, and Alroy Station is only 150 miles from Camooweal, on the ""Queensland border. that means we should have had a common line from Port Darwin for a distance of 688 miles to Alroy Station. point the two lines would diverge; one would go west of south to Alice Springs, a distance of 339 miles; and from Alice Springs through the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta, a distance of 297 miles; the other would go eastward to Camooweal, near the Queensland border, a distance of 150 miles. That seemed to nie to be an excellent idea. on a narrow-gauge railway. make any difference to my argument; the distance is the same, whether the gauge be narrow or wide. The only difficulty if the railway was constructed on the 4-ft. 8 i in. gauge would be the change of gauge at the Queensland border. In constructing the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, the sleepers could be made long enough to allow of the widening of the gauge, and then the gauge would be the same from Port Darwin to Port Augusta, and from Port Darwin through Queensland to Wallangarra, where the New South Wales gauge of 4 f t . 8J in . would be may explain that after we hail reached. vide for starting construction from Oodnadatta ? I had not sufficient personal reached the constructing stage. The bargain had been made, and it had to be kept. This is no small matter. The present war had not broken out at the time my letter was written, but the Government of which I was a member had the smallest of majorities, and many large obligations, and money was not too plentiful. To make a railwav from theKatherine to Oodnadatta, connecting with the Queensland border and the anchorage at the Pellew Islands, would probably cost £7,000,000, and would occupy several years, the distance being about 1,009 miles. longer than the construction of the eastwest railway.

But in the latter case you are going to a settled country, in which there is a considerable population, an immense trade, while in the By former youmust develop the country through which it passes in order to create traffic. from the Northern Territory go across the east-west railway?

I said to the Prime Minister ou the 30th June, and he endorsed the statement, that if the Northern Territory is to be opened up by railways, within a few years we must build from the Katherine southwards to Newcastle Waters, and from Camooweal Waters. That was to be a first instalment of the whole construction, and would mean the making of a railway for a distance of 838 miles from Camooweal to Port Darwin, 146 miles of the track being already laid, viz., from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. There would then remain 636 miles to connect Ahoy Station with Oodnadatta. am not now in office, I repeat that the route which I favour, from the information I have gained from those who know the country,.is from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, a distance of 146 miles, for which the railway is already constructed; from Pine Creek to the Katherine, a distance of 54 miles; and from the Katherine to Newcastle Waters, another 250 miles; thence to Anthony's Lagoon, which is win, which is 688 miles from Port Darwin -and it seems to me that no public man, From Anthony's Lagoon there would be a branch line to Peilew Islands anchorage near Booroloola, a distance of 236 miles.

Sir JOHN FORREST said so. The honourable and learned member for Angas and myself are in agreement as to route. The method of construction was never considered between us, except that I told him that I could not make provision on the Estimates of 1913-14 for the construction of these railways. We had not then sufficient information. All we could do was to determine a policy. surveys. The honourable member's time having expired, leave to continue granted.

My honourable and learned friend was desirous of constructing 300 miles of railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Range, but I held that such an extension of the present line by itself would not in AlthoughI any way develop the Northern Territory, because its terminus would be 1,000 miles from Port Darwin. I did not say that we should not make that extension, nor that I would not build from the south. There are many advantages in building from the south.

I am greatly indebted to honourable members on both sides for the manner in which they have dealt with this problem of the Northern Territory. The great issues involved have been dealt with in no sense from a party point of view; and it is only right that it should be so. Fori f ever there was a problem that will tax to the utmost the wisdom and patriotism of Australian public men it is that of the development of the Northern Territory. Therefore, it is an omen of good hope that honourable members on both sides look at the problem in a practical and business like way, and are offering suggestions not to embarrass the Minister or the Government, but to assist in arriving at a policy which will enable Australia to make the best of this great possession of ours. has been said about the route of the railway. honourable friend, the member for Grey, some time ago, because I expressed the idea that, if We did desire t.o le.t i m mediate daylight, into this northern portion of Australia, the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Swan that there should be a railway from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal was a good one. I am still of that opinion. But this does not affect tbe view that I hold, namely, that the rest of the railway should be pushed on from the south as well as from the north. HereI may say to my honourable friends, who have insinuated the possibility of a breach of f a it h , that, so f a r as this Government are concerned, they are determined to honour the agreement already arrived at, not merely in the letter, but also in the spirit. This declaration should satisfy honourable members from South Australia. But surely honourable members will reflect on the position in which Australia finds herself to-day] We are confronted with the greatest convulsion in history, and with tlie necessity for unparalleled expenditure in men, money, and munitions. In such a world-wide cataclysm, may we not be excused from immediately taking in hand great national projects, including this railway? have constructed the strategic railway if A f t e r all that has been they could have found support for it . honourable member did not introduce this question of the strategic railway. Wbil? the Northern Territory presents a very pressing problem, I take it that the safety of the whole of Australia is stui more important. If it were necessary, on the advice of the best experts, that the strategic railway should be built in order to safeguard this continent from attack, then it would become even more important than tbe Oodnadatta railway. perts ? ber may depend on it that the Prime Minister of Australia has not proposed this strategic railway without having good advice. Some comment has also been made upon tbe circumstance that we have devised no new policy for the development of this Territory. Well, the Government A good deal have been only a few months in office, 'and a problem so vast as this Territory I incurred the displeasure of my presents is not to be solved off-hand.

The Australian people require fresh fish, the islanders are in need of a means of livelihood, and it is only proper that the Government should do something to assist them. Another industry which has been neglected ia whaling. The islanders have to go for many miles in ordinary whale-boats in pursuit of a whale, and in some instances they have had to tow a whale behind an ordinary row-boat for two days, whereas if they were provided with a launch they could prosecute their industry with more vigour. encourage the industry of drying and smoking fish. The islanders know nothing of our requirements, and I think that some person of experience should be sent there to teach those people the fishcuring business, and to produce other articles which are much needed on the mainland. The Commonwealth grants a bounty of Jd. per lb. on dried and smoked fish. In 1912-13 there were only five establishments engaged in this industry, and the bounty amounted to only £103 for the 49,440 lbs. produced in the Commonwealth. dried and smoked fish in .1912 totalled 26,000 cwts., worth £76,327.

I protest, with all the warmth of which I am capable, against the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane to give the people of the Northern Territory local option on the drink question when, aa he himself has confessed, the result will be to establish the liquor trade there. Is he so recreant to his temperance principles' as to wish to entrap Parliament into consenting to a mock referendum which will benefit no one else but Bung? I hope that honourable members will no longer take as gospel everything they hear from these temperance gentlemen, but will do what they think best to bring about lasting reforms, discountenancing reforms which, though politi«ally expedient, must damage the temperance cause. able member suggest? does not wish me to outline a policy at this hour. No doubt the Temperance party throughout Australia deeply regrets the price which the honourable member for Barrier has had to pay for many of his most earnest convictions. The honourable member adorned tbe last Labour Ministry, in which he acted in many capacities-on e rapidly succeeding another, I might add. He is not now a member of the Cabinet, and there is no member of the Cabinet to whom we can look for guidance on this question. I ask him, therefore, to get into even closer touch with the honourable member for Brisbane, and to obtain from the honourable member an explanation of his interjection that if a referendum were taken in the Northern Territory the vote would go in favour of the drink traffic. We ought to be in earnest in regard to referendum proposals. If we think that we can achievesome good by means of a referendum, let us urge it ; but it would be to waste the public funds to hold a referendum merely for educational, purposes, if the result would show the people of the country how helpless we were in regard to the reform proposed. -^-It is fortunate for me that I have been present during part of the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth. If one could hear that honourable member without seeing him, one would think that he meant what be said, and it would not be evident that to-night he has tried to make a farce of so serious a matter as the sobriety of the people of the Northern Territory. It is most unsatisfactory that the honourable member, notwithstanding his high abilities, which have been developed by special training, should utilize his eloquence to cast ridicule on a good cause, and to make fun of what, at the present time, is for the nations of the world one of the most serious and perplexing questions that they have to face. The honourable member continually descends from tbe sublime to the ridiculous, and generally ends in making himself ridiculous.
