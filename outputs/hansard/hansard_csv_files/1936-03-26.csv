0,"Thursday, Tke Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Mr M C Ewen","In view of the widespread concern at the recent rise of interest rates, w ill the Prime Minister state whether the Cabinet w ill consider the advisability of asking the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems of Australia to suspend its present inquiries with a view to making a specific inquiry into the subject of interest rates, and furnishing an interim report to the Government? gestions are made to the Government with a view to the variation of the terms of reference to royal commissions. I have always regarded such variations as unwise, believing that commissions should be allowed to conduct their investigations in their own way. I consider that such a policy should be followed in this case. I have no doubt that the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems -will have its attention drawn to the particular subject of interest rates, and w i ll make some inquiry into it. I prefer to leave the matter in its hands. [2,34 j -by leave-In view of the present European situation, and of the importance of the attitude of the German Government to the proposals of the other Locarno Powers, published in London on the 20th March, I desire to make a short statement to the House. The substance of the note communicated by the German Government yesterday regarding the Locarno situation is as follows:"" The German Government, being convinced that by the Franco-Sovietm i l i tary alliance the legal and political assumptions on which the Locarno Treaty was based have been removed, has determined to restore its f u l l sovereignty over its entire territory. It considered that the entry of German troops into 26th March, 1936. the Rhineland zone was necessary to provide for Germany the conditions of complete equality under which alone it could become a party to a new agreement for a clear and reasonable organization of peace in Europe. There are differences in the legal values of treaties to victors and vanquished by reason of the inequality of the conditions under which they are negotiated, and Germany, by restoring its sovereignty in its own territory, has now created the necessary conditions for negotiations. Germany still abides by its own proposals, but considers the proposals of the Locarno Powers as being based on a new discrimination and, therefore, unacceptable. The German Government sets more value upon a peace guaranteed for a long period as one of the securest bases for the revival of prosperity of the nation than on any assistance or relief negotiated as a result of economic conferences. In order to comply with the suggestion of the Government of the United Kingdom, by presenting new proposals, the German Government hopes to contribute its solution in clue course, as soon as the elections in Germany are over. In the meantime, it has sent Herr von Ribbentrop again to Londonf o r verbal discussions. I ts f u l l proposals w ill be presented on the 31st March."" I may add that the f u l l text of the proposals placed before the German Government by the Locarno Powers is being (Corio Treasurer) laid on the table of the Library for the information of honourable members. for Defence state whether it is a fact thai the Government intends to proceed with the construction of sloops and destroyers as a part of its defence policy?

It continues. . . but embodied in the present regulations it gives the employers specially valuable control over the human agency necessary to the profitable carrying on of their enterprise. Mr Justice Evatt who is recognized that the honourable member is sufficiently familiar with the Standing Orders' governing the asking of questions to know that in asking a question he is not entitled to give information or offer opinions on the ability of a judge or any one else. sir, but I recognize that in this Parliament ber must ask his question without commenting upon my ruling. to the ability of one member of the H i g h Court Bench honourable member to resume his seat. The question is disallowed. The following papers were presented:Commonwealth Bonk Statement of combined accounts of Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth Savings Bank at 31st December, 1035, together with certificate of the Auditor General. Scat of Government Acceptance Act and Seat of Government (Administration) Act;-Polic e Amended. I move That, having regard to the fact that, by reason of the non-enactment of appropriate Commonwcath legislation, the Divorce Court of each State must deny relief to a petitioner who, though domiciled in Australia is not domiciled in that State, this House is of opinion that legislation should be forthwith introduced to provide for a Commonwealth matrimonial domicil. I trust that the unprepossessing and technical exterior of this motion w ill not deter honourable members from interest in it because, if they w ill bear w i th me, I think I can show them that it is not only The quotation is necesof great importance, but also of great human interest. Involvedi n it are questions of the validity of marriages of men and women and the legitimacy of children born of those marriages. A t the federal conventions, this matter was discussed in great detail, and it was generally felt that it was of the utmost importance that the Federal Parliament should have the power to pass laws relating to divorce and matrimonial causes. We live in a world to-day in which people move about f a i r l y f r e e l y ; at any rate, in what we call the western civilized communities, freedom of moveI bow to your ruling, ment is exercised more and more as time goes on. As married people, or people living together and claiming to be married, move from country to country, questions arise as to whether their marriages are real and should be recognized, and I was merely referring whether the children born of such marriages are legitimate or illegitimate. In order to settle this matter upon a more satisfactory basis which would have universal international recognition, the courts of the world have evolved the rule of the personal law. Each man and woman and each child has a personal law acquired from the community of which they are members. It is Acft-Treasurer' s not some territorial law which may change from time to time; it is a personal law which attaches to the individual either by b i r t h or by choice. The nations have adopted <this rule. Consequently if people are validly married Ordinance Regulations according to the personal law, their marriage is universally recognized. Conversely, if they are not validly married according to the personal law, their union w ill not be recognized in every country. Similarly, children born of a marriage valid under the personal law are recognized as legitimate, and those born of a marriage not so recognized w ill not be recognized everywhere as legitimate. Becausei t deals with the status of men, women and children all over the world, this matter, as I have said, is one of the utmost human importance. Having said that all nations agreed upon the final test of the personal law, I have to refer to the regrettable fact that all the nations do not apply the same personal law. The obvious natural personal law is the law of nationality. Countries in continental",11,Transport Workers Act

33,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [2.51],"Europe, such as France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and, I think, Russia, apply that rule. They say that the personal law of a man is the law of nationality, and that the personal law of a woman is the law of her husband's nationality. If that rule could be universally applied the existing difficulties could be simply overcome; but, unfortunately, special conditions in the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America make it impossible for those countries to apply that rule. wealth of Nations consists of a vast number of communities, some of which are self-governing, but all of which have different law districts; that is to say each has its own courts, divorce authority and marriage laws. In the British Isles alone there are, I think, seven law districtsScotland, England, Northern Ireland, the I r is h Free State, the Isle of Man. Jersey and Guernsey, each administering its own marriage laws. What is true of the British Isles is also true of Australia in which I think we have at least eight law districts-si x State and two territorial. and SouthA f r i ca constitutes a separate law district. Then we have the Crown Colonies and India. In the United States of America, every one of the separate States is a separate law district. Consequently, the British Commonwealth ot Nations and the United States of America cannot apply the test of nationality, but have to rely on the older test of what is called domicil, which continental nations have already abandoned. law, if a marriage is valid according to. the law of domicil of the husband, it is valid everywhere; if a divorce is valid by the law of the husband's domicil, it is valid everywhere; and the offspring of a marriage valid by the law of domicil is legitimate everywhere. ordinarily regarded by people as being somewhat the same as residence; but in the course of time it has come to mean something different, residence in most cases, residence, plus some other factor, in others, and not residence at all in some cases. Because everybody must have a personal law, the United States of America and British communities have had to evolve rules dealing with the matter. We start with the position that everybody in the world has a. domicil; every child born in the world has a domicil and every male and female child, acquires the domicil of its father and cannot change that domicil unti l the child becomes of f u l l age or, if a female child, until that child marries. That is called the domicil of origin. A person never actually loses his domicil of origin ; no matter where lie may go in the world he still retains it . The utmost that may be said is that domicil of origin may for The British Commonthe time being he suspended. It can be suspended if a person, leaving the couotry of his birth or original domicil, goes to another country and lives in that country in such a way as to show that he has chosen it as his permanent home; in short, if he has, of his own free w ill , made that country his permanent home. That is inferred, not only from the language he has used, or from what he has said but also from what he has said and done, and fro m the way in which he is living and the circumstances and conditions in which he is residing in that new country. If lie has satisfied the new conditions, he acquires a domicil of Each province of Canada choice in that new country. If he leaves it , his domicil of choice parts from him and his domicil of origin returns to him. Suppose that a man born in Scotland, and having a Scottish domicil of origin, comes to Australia and makes his permanent home in Victoria. He acquires a Victorian domicil of choice. He then leaves Victoria, and, as soon as he does Under that so, although he may intend to reside in another Australian State, his Scottish domicil of origin returns to him. The law of Scotland applies to him, to his marriage, to his wife, and to his children, and he w ill not acquire another domicil of choice u n t il be has evinced an intenDomicil is tion permanently to reside in another community, and does reside there. The result of this is the problem with which we are faced in Australia, and to which I have referred in the motion before the House. Domicil of origin is acquired at birth. It is never actually lost. When a person who has a domicil of origin has acquired a domicil of choice by voluntarily residing in another country with the intention of making that his permanent home, his domicil of origin goes to sleep until it is awakened by his leaving his domicil of choice. soon as he decides no longer to reside in his the domicil of origin is revived until he has acquired another domicil of choice. In a country like Australia, with the mobility of its population and the contiguity of the several States, there is often considerable doubt whether a person coming from Great Britain has acquired a domicil anywhere in this country, and whether a person leaving one State thereafter acquires a domicil anywhere in Australia. The position of a married woman is that she depends on her husband's status; she has the domicil of her husband. A man may come here from Scotland with a Scottish domicil of origin and may never acquire a domicil of choice in any Australian State, because although he may show an intention to live here, he may not show an intention to prefer one State to another. That man may marry in Australia, and yet his wife's rights artdetermined by Scottish law. She may not, apply to a Victorian court, or to another in Australia, for relief, because the statutory exception made in favour of deserted wives floes ""not apply. There is a statutory exception made in every State, by which a woman who is deserted in one State may sue there, being domiciled there at the time of the desertion; but this does not give any protection to a. woman who has married a man with a British domicil and is seeking to divorce him. Whether we believe in divorce or not, we have to remember that it is universally recognized. Practically every country in the world has divorce laws and courts administering them. Even in those countries where there are no divorce courts and divorce laws, marriages may be dissolved by the legislature. For example, the constitution of South Carolina forbids any court to dissolve a marriage. Yet marriages can be dissolved there, and often are, by the State legislature. In Northern Ireland there is no court which has power to dissolve marriages, but residents who are wealthy enough can have their marriages dissolved by the legislature. Although, in the Canadian province of Quebec, there are no divorce Mr Blackburn. courts and divorce laws, on looking As through the statutes of Canada last year, I noticed that 35 persons living in Quebec domicil of choice, had had their marriages dissolved by the Canadian Parliament. There is no doubt, of course, that the legislature of the Irish Free State could, if it desired, dissolve marriages. those few exceptions, every civilized country has divorce courts and divorce legislation. Consequently, divorce is a fact that we have to face. Marriages will be dissolved, and the persons whose marriages are dissolved are free to contract new marriages, and become the parents of children. Unless these new marriages and the children resulting from them are to be universally recognized, we have the scandal of marriages being recognized in one community and not in another, and of children being legitimate in one community and illegitimate in another. To the special conditions existing in Australia, I have already referred. Let me mention them again. This is a country inhabited by people of one language and of practically one race. Our people have similar institutions, and move about freely. Men may lea've a State in which their homes are situated without indicating preference for any other State, and without having chosen one State as their permanent home. Persons of the same race and language, and having similar institutions to those of ourselves, are attracted here from overseas. They may come to Australia and make it their permanent home, without having shown a distinct preference for one State over another. But, in these circumstances, there is no domicil acquired by choice. A person from overseas may retain his domicil of origin, and never acquire a. domicil anywhere in Australia. An Australian born in Victoria may find that in Queensland he is still regarded as having a domicil of origin in Victoria. This position we have power to remedy by legislation. I am not suggesting, at the present time, that there should be uniform divorce legislation throughout Australia, although I think that is desirable. It was to that end that power to pass laws with respect to divorce was",12,Divorce Laws Domicil
34,Mr Hughes,B y legislation?,14,Divorce Laws Domicil
35,Mr Blackburn,"Yes. Withjgivcii to tlic Commonwealth Parliament. T do not propose to go into details in dealing with this matter, because I should be trespassing upon a province that w ill be adequately developed by my seconder, who, I know, w ill tell the House of the considerations which moved the Federal Convention to place this power in the Constitution, and refer to the various comments made by the State courts and (he High Court upon the failure of the Commonwealth Parliament to act. The only time this Parliament legislated regarding this matter was in 1919, when it passed the Matrimonia l Causes (Expeditionary Forces) Act, in which it applied to Australia a British temporary act, which provided that where members of dominion forces had married in Britain, although they were domiciled in a dominion, their marriages could be dissolved in that part of B ritain in which they had been celebrated. We adopted that measure, but it was only of a temporary character, and expired at the end of one year. Other legislation has been introduced in this Parliament, but it h.i? never gone far. The South African Union introduced a divorce bill in 1911, hut abandoned the attempt to secure universal divorce laws. AlthoughI am not contending for a universal divorce law, I urge that this Parliament should exercise its power over divorce so f a r as to provide for Commonwealth domicil, and thus remove the difficulties to which 1 have referred. I propose that we should have an Auswere actually there, the British court tralian domicil and that a person who would have jurisdiction. That is not the comes to Australia and lives in any part of it and chooses Australia as his permanent, final and definite home, should be regarded as domiciled in Australia, and that this should be acceptable in any State by the Indian and Colonial Divorce Juriscourt. The present position is that a diction Act of 1926. Before 1921 the woman or a. man may petition in the Indian courts had been in the habit of Statei n which she or he has been divorcing persons merely resident in residing and find that, for some reason, India without paying regard to their the domicil is not in that State at all, domicil. In 1920, the Probate Division but may be in the Statei n which Court of England, decided that it could the husband was born many years not recognize as valid divorces granted ago, although he has long since lef t in India to persons domiciled in Great the place and ceased to reside there. Or, Britain. The British Parliament then again, the domicil may be in Great passed an act in 1921, giving retrospecB r it a in or Ireland. My proposal w ill tive validity to divorces granted in India remedy that, and the court would be cerand in Kenya Colony. In 1926 the tain that as the person concerned had voluntarily and definitely chosen Australia as his permanent home, Australia was his domicil. If a person made this choice it would not matter, under my proposal, in which State or territory of Australia he made his home. It might be that he had not made a definite home or had not definitely chosen any particular State or territory. The conditions of his life>might oblige him to travel fro m one part of the Commonwealth to anothei, but he would be part of the Australian community. As he had shown a definite choice for Australia, that would be regarded as his permanent home. But we could not altogether stop there for we should have to provide each State court with Home test of jurisdiction in each case, so that a man or a woman would not need be unfairly brought from one end of the continent to another to answer a petition. One possible test would be the place of celebration of the marriage, it might be provided that the parties must go to that part of Australia where the marriage was celebrated. A difficulty of that test would be in relation to marriages celebrated overseas. I think, therefore, that we shall have to reject that test. Another possible test is one that used to be applied before the doctrine of domicil had hardened into its present technical form. That test was provided in the case of Niboyet v. Niboyet, and was to the effect that if the parties were ordinarily resident in Great Britain, and not casually resident there, and if the husband law to-day. It has been discarded by all courts as the results of various decisions of the House of Lords and the P r i v y Council, but it offers a possible basis for a test. Another criterion is that provided Indian and Colonial Divorce Jurisdiction Act provided that tlic courts of India and other British dependencies to which it applied, but not including self-governing dominions, could, under the authority of the British Act, divorce persons domiciled in Great Britain but resident in India or the other dependencies affected. The conin mind the scandal that existed in dition was that in the case of Indian actions the petitioner must be resident in India at the time of the divorce proceedings, that India must be the last place of residence together, and that either the marriage must have been celebrated in India or the matrimonial offence involved must have taken place there. We thu3 have various tracks already laid down on which we could tread, and various tests, already used. point is that we must have some tests as to which State should exercise jurisdiction, but the test should not be domicil. a person should be settled once and for all by this Parliament, and the 'States, in order to determine jurisdiction, should, which the people as a. whole would not under Commonwealth law, adopt such a test of jurisdiction-probabl y that of the usual place of residence. It is of the greatest importance that, something shall be done in this matter. Although these laws aifect probably only a few persons in any one year, those few persons have their lives to live and their rights to be considered. There are to be considered, for example, the woman who marries a divorced man, and the divorced woman who marries again, and also the children born of such a marriage. The status of the woman and children should be put beyond doubt, and that can easily be done in this country. I believe that it was in order that such a matter could be put beyond doubt, that this Parliament was invested with-the power contained in paragraph xxii of section 51 of the Constitution. I wish to refer to one objection that I understand has been already raised by the Acting Attorney-General (Senator Brennan). of Australia might, under such a proposal as I have made, become the Reno of Australia and, by making special laws which the other States of the Commonwealth would probably reject, attract divorce seekers to it. The answer to Mr Blackburn. that contention is that such a procedure would be impossible within the Commonwealth. Reno became possible in the United States of America because there was no general control of marriage and divorce legislation in that country. The franters of our Constitution no doubt had America, where each State has its separate divorce laws, and where there was no possibility of federal control, aud determined that, in order that such a condition of affairs should not prevail in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament should have control of marriage and divorce laws. This power was given to the Commonwealth Parliament to make it impossible for any one State to imitate The North Dakota or Nevada. If one Australian State did make conditions of divorce so attractive that people might be expected to flock to it to obtain The domicil of divorces, this Parliament could effectively counteract such action; but in my opinion, it is not possible for any one State to provide conditions of divorce adopt. That is all I wish to say on that aspect of the subject. I hope that I have invested this difficult and technical subject with some of the human interest which really belongs to it. second this motion with a great deal of pleasure, not only because of its intrinsic merit, but also because it has behind it a great volume of legal authority and expert legal opinion, as I hope to show in the course of my remarks. I believe that I shall be able to indicate to honourable members that, for a long time, there has been strong and consistent advocacy of the principle underlying this proposal. Notwithstanding the very lucid exposition of the legal aspects of the subject by the mover of the motion ( Mr Blackburn), some honourable members may not have apprt crated many of the practical difficulties This is that one State which need to be overcome. I propose, therefore, to submit some illustrations to indicate the inconvenience experienced under the present system. I shall take hypothetical cases, although it would be possible to produce many actual cases that would conform to the various con-",14,Divorce Laws Domicil
36,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [3.28],"Iditions which. I shall outline. For purposes of illustration, let up suppose that a married couple is domiciled in Queensland; that is to say, they are living in Queensland and have their permanent home in that State. The husband leaves the wife under such circumstances that would give her grounds for divorce. Let us assume that Tic takes np his residence in Western Australia and lives there for a number of years. The wife, if she is in a position to produce evidence to show that she has grounds for a divorce, has to decide whether her husband has his permanent home in Western Australia, or whether he continues to retain his Queensland domicil. Her lawyer may advise that in his opinion the husband has a Western Australian domicil. In order to take divorce proceeding against him, the wife may then be obliged to proceed with her counsel and witnesses to Western Australia and endeavour to prove her case in the courts of that State. The judge who hears the action may find that the husband has never lost his Queensland domicil, and will refuse to hear the case of the grounds that the Western Australian court has no jurisdiction in the matter. If the wife is still desirous of proceeding against her husband, she is then obliged to return with her retinue of witnesses and legal advisers to Queensland and recommence proceedings in that State. I can quote honourable members a similar instance of this very occurrence; it is cited in the 1934 volume of the Law Institute Journal, page 1S5, under the heading of "" Uniform Divorce Law ""A case (Kith/tr v. Kither) recently tried before Mr Justice Henchman once again illustrates the desirability of having uniform divorce law throughout the Commonwealth, A wife sued for divorce on the ground of adultery with a. woman unknown. The husband appeared to contest the jurisdiction of the Queensland court to dissolve the marriage, and on the evidence supplied by the wife alone, the judge was forced to the conclusion that the domicil of the plaintiff and defendant was in South Australia and not in Queensland. The defendant was born in South Australia, the parties were married there and later had come to Brisbane to live. The defendant had deserted the plaintiff in Queensland and had returned to Adelaide where he had remained with his found the misconduct established, the petition was dismissed with the result that if the plaintiff desires to obtain a divorce she will have to have recourse to the courts of South Australia. The article proceedsHow much simpler and more convenient would it be if the Federal Parliament would exercise its right of establishing uniform divorce law through the length and breadth of Australia. There would be only one domicil for purposes of divorce and one set of grouuds for dissolution of marriage. It would be unnecessary for a plaintiff wife living in, say, Queensland, to have recourse to the courts of her husband's domicil, e.g. Western Australia. She. would be able to sue in the Federal court, set up by the act in Queensland and thus save herself much worry and needless expense. The peculiar part about the matter is that although most people favour the idea, the question is continually shelved, and looks like remaining shelved until there is a sullicieritly powerful agitation to force the Commonwealth's hand. All political parties seem afraid that by introducing a bill they will rend asunder their party; hut it is a matter which should not admit of a party vote, but on which each member should be allowed to vote as he chooses. Certain advantages of such legislation as is advocated will immediately suggest themselves to honourable members. In the first place, the law would obtain certainty; and, as I have had occasion to state earlier this week, certainty is an essential requirement of any legal system. But in matters of divorce, the present law of Australia lacks that desired element. If the omission were rectified, numbers of litigants would benefit by the saving of considerable expense and inconvenience, and many practical difficulties which now exist would be removed. It is inevitable that the rapid improvement in communications-the advance in the progress of which we see every day-create s difficulties of this kind, and may be expected to accentuate them in the future. The time has arrived for' this National Parliament to take cognizance of the fact that the fTamers of the federal Constitution gave the Commonwealth certain powers over matrimonial matters, recognizing that such difficulties would arise in the future and that there would be a need for the introduction of legislation to meet them. We should examine our obligations in this matter with a view to giving effect to these parents. Although His Honour powers. The general support which has been accorded to these suggestions, I shall endeavour to explain to the Housei n some short references t h a t I shall cite in the next f e w minutes. L a t e r, I propose to deal w it h some of the suggested objections w h i c h have been raised against the proposal of the honourable member for Bourke. w h i c h I shall quote to the House is t h a t of Mr Justice Isaacs, as he then was, in the case of F r e m l in and F r e m l in decided by the H i g h C o u r t of A u s t r a l i a in 1913. Sir Isaac Isaacs enjoys a reput a t i o n in this House, not o n l y as a a p o l it i c a l f i g u r e and as a p u b l i c m a n , but also as a j u r is t of a renown r a n k in g among the highest in the h is to r y of the C o m m o n w e a l t h . The r e for e , his remarks on this subject, in view of the f a c t t h a t he was closely connected w it h the f o u n d a t i o n of f e d e r a t i o n , must c a r r y considerable w e i g h t . On page 230 of volume 16 of the C o m m o n w e a l t h L a w Reports, M i . Justice Isaacs statesSince domicil is. as a general principle, essential to jurisdiction, at all events to jurisdiction that w ill be recognized elsewhere, and as that depends so largely on the view that any particular tribunal takes of the facts, it is in the highest degree desirable that the danger of a mistake should be obviated so far as possible. And further, provided a real and substantial cause for divorce exists, it will he conceded that preliminary, though vital, obstacles to redress, and the risk of multiplicity of litigation, ought to be lessened or removed so far as law will permit. Uncertainty in matrimonial relations is altogether to be deprecated, and it is a scandal, as Lord Penzance said in a passage approved by the Privy Council in Lc Mcsurier v. he Mesvrier. "" when a man and woman are held to be man and wife in one country, and strangers in another"". For the purposes of divorce jurisdiction, tlic Australian States arc still different countries. The difficulty must be faced where, as the Teamed lord said in the same passage, different communities have different views and laws respecting matrimonial obligations, ami a different estimate of the causes which should justify divorce. J£ut section 51, subsection (xxii) of the federal Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to ""divorce and matrimonial causes"", and I would wish to draw the. attention of the Commonwealth Parliament to the question in order that consideration may be given to the desirability of allowing the present state of things to continue in the Australian community. SirW ill i a m H a r r is o n M o o r e , o n page 45 of his classic w o r k , C o m m o n w e a l t h of A u s t r a l i a , points o u t There is a good deal of diversity in the divorce laws of the States; and it is quite Mr Holt. possible, so long as the States remain separate law districts, that parties may be married persons in the view of one State and single persons according to the law of another. The matter is complicated by the fact that the relation is principally governed by domicil, and in countries like Australia the conditions of life make it peculiarly difficult to ascertain The most l e n g t h y reference the domicil. He refers to disadvantages t h a t exist in A u s t r a l i a under the present system of h a v in g one people w it h a common t r a d it i o n , a homogeneous people, mixing f r e e l y w it h one another, and h a v in g a common code of morals.

SirJ o h n Q u i c k , in the Legislative Powers of the C o m m o n w e a l th a n d Stales of Aust r a l i a , page 502, w r it e s The necessity of a federal law relating to domicil has been frequently commented upon in divorce and matrimonial cases, both by the judges and counsel. Wynes, a recognized a u t h o r it y on the A u s t r a l i a n C o n s t it u t i o n , in the Legislati v e and E x e c u t i v e Powersi n A u s t r a l i a , page 160, also refers to this m a t t e r The desirability of action being taken to enact uniform legislation on the subjects of marriage and divorce in order to prevent the confusion attendant upon inconsistent rules in a number of contiguous communities, has often been the subject of comment. To o b t a in the general f e e l in g of the A u s t r a l i a n legal profession, we m a y f in a l l y consider the A u s t r a l i a n L a w J o u r n a l , volume 5, page 215, under the headinsr, "" D o m i c i l and a FederalD i v o r c e Law"" Out of the matrimonial discords of sailors have sprung many decisions on the law of domicil. In a. recent case before the Jfew South Wales Full Court {Scha.clte v. fiehacho), in which judgment was delivered on 30th October, not only was an important question of domicil decided, but the desirability of federal intervention in this field was urged. In concluding a judgment which was concurred in by Davidson and Halse Rogers, J.J., Street, G.J.. said:-""Before parting from' the ease I should like to say that I concur entirely with Pike. J., in expressing the hope that the Legislature of the Commonwealth may see its way to give consideration to the desirableness of allowing the present state of thing* as regards divorce jurisdiction, and domicil in that connection, to continue in Australia. Upwards of eighteen years ago in Fremlin v. Fremlin (1G CJJ.R. 212 at page 230), Isaacs, J., as he then was, pointedly drew the attenmarriage law as the motion contemplates tion of the Legislature to the matter, but up would inevitably have to be passed. In t ill the present time his suggestions have apparently remained unheeded."" From those authorities it is evident that there is a crying need for the legislation contemplated in this motion. I have been unable to find any opinion to the contrary expressed by any other legal authority in Australia. On this question, there is unanimity of opinion in legal circles and among those social workers who have had experience of the domestic tragedies which have resulted from the parties not being able to obtain the redress to which they were justly entitled. I now anticipate one or two objections have no chance of being divorced, may become which may be raised, and point out, first, that this legislation does not contemplate easier divorce, in the sense that the grounds for divorce are to be made easier. All that is contemplated is that, where the parties can establish that there are clear grounds for divorce, according to the law of their domicile, those parties should not be prevented from obtaining legal redress by reason of the fact that machinery difficulties stand in their way. It has been suggested that legislation of this kind would create an Australian Eeno. "" tourists"" would be attracted to Canberra were this city to become the Australian divorce centre. Any objection to the proposal on that score falls to the ground when we consider the power that resides in the Commonwealth Parliament. Tho Acting Attorney-General (Senator Breiman) cited the United States of America as a country in which a divorce is easier to obtain in some States than in others, and suggested that that might happen here. In my opinion, the honourable gentleman has overlooked the fact that in the United States of America there is not the same federal control over matrimonial causes that there is in the Commonwealth. If any Australian State made the securing of a divorce so easy that persons would be attracted to it from other States in order to take advantage of those conditions, the Commonwealth could step in and remedy the position by the exercise of the power which it possesses. It was clearly contemplated by the founders of the federation that some such universal their innocence and guilelessness, they thought that the matter would be attended to within a few months. That point was dealt with by the Honourable I i . E. O'Connor, whose opinion I quote from the official report of the debates of the Australasian Federal Convention, at page 1080I f there is one blot which stands out more than another in the American Constitution, it is that, by their Constitution, they are not able to deal with this question in a uniform way; and we all know that this has led to a condition of things socially of a most deplorable character. Persons who, according to the law of the State in which they reside, would domiciled in another State by living there a certain time, and then, according to the laws of that State, may obtain divorce for reasons which, in their own State, would have been ludicrous as a ground of divorce. He went on to say that such a state of affairs would be impossible were the divorce legislation uniform throughout the federation. I shall not detain the House longer, because I think that it has already been shown that the suggested objections to such a measure fall to the ground on the most cursory examination. It might even happen that There is undoubtedly need for some such legislation as this motion contemplates. The views expressed by the mover of the motion and myself are supported by the full force of legal opinion from the foundation of the federation to the present time. The Government would do well to give this subject serious and immediate consideration. adjourned. putThat the Standing and Sessional Orders he suspended to enable government business to take precedence over general business for the remainder of this sitting.

The ad valorem equivalent of the duties varies to such an extent owing to the fluctuation of copper prices and the variety of products covered by the item, that no general indication of the ad valorem equivalent can be made. However, the duty on actual importations on 24 lines represented from 8.4 per cent, to 29.5 per cent. British preferential tariff, and 87 per cent, to 113 per cent., general tariff. Members of the commercial community in Melbourne have complained to me of the complexity of this item, and I therefore ask the Minister to refer it back to the board for the purpose of having it simplified, if possible.

Surely it is possible to devise some simpler method of calculation so that those who import goods of this kind may know what the cost will be. The tariff should be made as simple as possible, not only in the interests of the commercial community, but also in the interests of customs officers.

Item agreed to. Item 151 agreed to. Item 152 (Iron and steel tubes or pipes). that the British duty has been increased from free to 10 per cent, and the foreign from 15 per cent, to 40 per cent. I am not sure whether the item covers water piping for irrigation and reticulation or not. explanation of the increase. deferred duty of 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, was provided under this item in the schedule of 1926. The Scullin Government, after inquiry, decided to make the duty operative in 1931, but was defeated just before the duty came into operation. from 1932 to 1934, the manufacture of the pipes was carried on with the protection afforded by exchange and primage. The present duty was imposed on the 7th December, 1934, as the result of an investigation by the Tariff Board. There are at present two companies in Australia engaged in the manufacture of these pipes. Concerning them. I wish to mention a few facts because certain members of the Country party claim that as soon as an Australian firm starts manufacture a substantial increase of the price to the conindustry, which gives direct employment sumer results. As with numerous other instances which I could mention, that has not been the result in this instance. The protectionist policy led to the establishment in this country of a branch of the English firm, Stewart and Lloyd; which formerly exploited the market by exporting from England the Australian requirements. That company decided that it had to get inside the tariff wall and it started works at Newcastle. Both of the companies now operating in Australia are turning out articles equal in quality to the British products. Each of the companies employs about, 400 persons, and, directly and indirectly, about 1,000 persons, making a total of 2.800 persons. When they started to produce in Australia, the overseas combine-that is the tube cartel-gav e a discount of users. When it encountered the competition of the local manufacturers, the discounts were increased to 55 per cent. The prices of the imported article were reduced suddenly, the exporters in Great Britain endeavouring by this means to wipe out the local industry. The pipes are used for gas, water, irrigation works of all kinds, for the pastoral and mining industries, and for steam. But for the local industry the prices of the imported product would not have been reduced. Comparing I should be glad to have an 1931 with 1934, the price of artesian casing, which is not made in Australia and is being supplied solely by the British combine, instead of dropping as did the prices of all the other pipes supplied by the combine, increased by 50 per cent., namely, from 3s. 3d. to 4s. 9d. That was because the Australian users were at the mercy of importers. Artesian Under very great difficulties, casing will eventually be made in Australia, and no doubt a similar reduction of price will follow. At the present time the English and Australian prices of pipes quoted to Australian users are the same, but the local manufacturers are able to hold the market because there is a feeling that their product is equal to the imported; accordingly, Australian buyers give preference to the local manufacturer. Any whittling away of the protection now enjoyed would be disastrous to this to 800 persons, and indirect employment to 2,000.",22,Customs Tariff Amendments Nos 3

63,Mr Nock (Riverina) [4.5],"I notice,",23,Customs Tariff Amendments Nos 3
64,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.6],"Aamendment will mean a slight increase of the duties on water pipes. pipes are utilized a great deal, particularly in Western Australia, where they are used to carry water supplies to the farmers. In that State settlement has taken place in areas where subterranean water is difficult to obtain, but providentially nature has provided granite outcrops which act as a huge catchment; these arc surrounded by cement guttering and dams from which the water is carried by pipes for from five to ten miles in varying directions. Anything, therefore, that would increase the cost_of these pipes would hinder the development of the country. I had hopes that the Government would grant a concession in respect of these pipes. I am wondering whether the Minister can, under any of the powers conferred upon him, admit duty free pipes of this description, which are so essential for protection which the Australian manuthe development of pastoral and agricultural areas. I do not care whether they are manufactured in Great Britain or foreign countries; my concern is to see that people who are engaged in the development of out-back country are notpenalized by a high tariff on essential requirements. at the inclusion of this sub-item imposing a duty on this class of goods. We must remember that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is largely interested in the firm which started tlie manufacture of these pipes in Australia. There is no reason why iron and steel tubes or pipes should not be manufactured in this country a.* cheaply as elsewhere, and there is no justification whatever for the duties levied under this sub-item. Primary producers in Western Australia are further handicapped through having to pay freight charges on the tubes and pipes from New South Wales. This increases substantially the cost of local irrigation schemes. industry affected by this item is an excellent example of efficiency. By economic production, Tulloch's Phoenix Iron Works, Sydney, was able, without very much assistance in the way of protection, to reduce the cost of iron and steel tubes to users, chiefly primary producers, to such an extent that overseas manufacThese turers were obliged eventually to expend approximately £1,000,000 in the establishment of works and plant in Australia to obtain their share of the local market. Prior to the establishment of the local industry, the requirements of Australian users of this class of goods were met by overseas importers. Following the establishment of the Australian industry, Stewart and Lloyd were obliged to offer 15 per cent, discount to purchasers. Later they increased the discount to 55 per cent., and even then were unable to capture the local market. Quite recently I was privileged to inspect Tulloch's Phoenix factory in Rhodes, and was impressed by its magnitude and efficiency. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has told the committee, a deferred duty was imposed, but it did not become operative, so the only facturers enjoyed was represented by 25 per cent, exchange and primage. Therefore, I contend that the Government is justified in increasing the duty, and I commend it for its action. I am very displeased Welded conduit pipes and tubes, and close-jointed iron or steel pipes and tubes, which are covered by sub-item it 1 were the subject of inquiry by the Tariff Board in 1933. The main case against the then existing duties was that under them British manufacturers were unable to compete, and the charge was made that Australian manufacturers were inefficient. Thi3 conduit is used for electric wiring-no t irrigation purposes. In regard to the claim for relief under the Ottawa agreement, it was contended by the Australian manufacturers that the provisions of the agreement were not relevant as all the raw material is drawn from British resources, and a reduction of duties would merely have effected the transfer of the actual manufacturing from Australia to Great Britain. It was further claimed, on behalf of Australian manufacturers, that protection by way of fixed duties was necessary because of the possibility-whic h has since become an actual fact-of the",23,Customs Tariff Amendments Nos 3

That the Australian manufacturers of welded and close-jointed conduit have ample plant and facilities to cater for the whole of the Australian requirements is undoubted, and internal and overseas competition has, at all times, ensured the maintenance of prices that are reasonable and fair to users. Since the removal of the fixed duties, British manufacturers have been quoting absurdly low prices-muc h lower, it is understood, than those at which they are prepared to supply for home consumption in Great Britain. At present, the strip steel for the making of the conduit has to be imported; but I understand that arrangements are being made for the production of this „ material locally. In the meantime, however, British suppliers, through their agents in Australia, are offering -J inch conduit at 5s. 3d. per 100 feeta price at which it is not possible for local manufacturers to compete, although every effort has been made to reduce costs, the two Australian companies having gone so far as to enter into a working arrangement under which one company manufactures the 3 inch conduit, the size most in demand, and the other company confines its operations to other sizes. Unless some protection greater than that provided for in the schedule is given to this industry it will, in a very short time, be forced to close down. Overseas manufacturers are concentrating on the size most callcd-for, -J inch, which, because of the greater output, is naturally the most profitable. While local manufacturers are admittedly making reasonable profits on other sizes, the finch conplaced before the committee. Its comstitutes such a large proportion of their trade that obviously they cannot indefinitely depend on the profits from the other sizes to cover the losses they are making on the -§inch if they attempt to meet overseas competition on its present basis. Letters from merchants, with whom the Sterling Tube Company has been doing business, indicate the position. The following letter was written by John Danks and Son Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, on the 12th March, 1936:Wo are very concerned with the present position in that it means we are distributing your products, in the main, at a very low margin of profit, and in instances it amounts to a loss. This has been brought about by one or two electrical houses importing tubing. As you know \vc have, right from the day your factory opened, supported you, and have not attempted, at any time, to import from overseas. It is incredible to us that these outside houses are able to sell tubing at such low figures and conduct what we consider is legitimate business. We do not think that any one can be considered trading legitimately unless a profit is ro'ade on the sale of their goods. Take as an instance § inch plain round tubing. This is being offered by our competitor at 5s. 3d. per 100 feet. We are informed-and you will be able to confirm this-that this size conduit cannot be landed from overseas under this price. Invariably the cost is higher. We feel that some steps should be taken by you whereby further tariff protection is obtained so that this unfair competition can be eliminated. Communications in somewhat similar terms were addressed to this company by W. G. Watson Company Limited, electrical engineers and merchants, Melbourne; Lawrence and Hanson Electrical Company Limited. Hobart; Noyes Brothers, Melbourne; and A. H . Gibson (Electrical) Company Proprietary Limited, Melbourne. I hope that the Minister will refer the matter to the Tariff Board for further investigation and report.

This amendment makes it apply only to the ad valorem rate. pleased to note that the Government has accepted the recommendation of the Tariff Board to make reductions of duties on British machines. I would inform honourable very little British agricultural machinery is in demand among Australian farmers. Whenever there has been competition it has como from cither Canada or the United States of America, and has tended to keep at a moderate figure the prices charged by zVustralian manufacturers. The Tariff Board inquired very f u l l y into these items, and made specific recommendations for a general reduction, not interonly of the British rate, but also of the foreign rate. I regret that the Government has not accepted its recommendations in regard to the foreign rate, and that Canada is now in the same category as the United States of Americai n regard to any manufactures in this class which it may desire to send to Australia. The latest price list issued by one of the biggest machinery manufacturers in Australia shows a rise of prices for several of the principal harvesting machines. Australian farmers, who have to compete in the world's markets with their wheat, should be able to secure their machinery on a competitive basis;.yet harvesters, each. interwhen the Tariff Board was inquiring into the relative prices of machines and products, it found that for the purchase of a binder nearly twice as many bushels of wheat were required in Australia as in Canada. A further investigation into costs of production revealed that those in Australia we're not in excess of those in Canada. The prices of pig iron, steel bars, coal and coke are less in Australia per cent.; than in Canada. The only material .1 per cent.; which is dearer in Australia is black sheets. In such circumstances, the Australian manufacturer is on an equal footing, but the Australian wheat-grower is at a disadvantage. The Government, might very well have had regard to the recommendation of the Tariff Board in relation to machinery imported from Canada. The whole tone of its report shows that, compared with those in Canada, costs of production in Australia are not excessive. Yet, so f a r as the binder is concerned, the prices of the relative articles are 22 per cent, higher in Australia than in Canada. The price of a horse rake is 32 per cent, higher, that of a mower, 60 per cent, higher, that of harrows, 8 per cent, higher, and that of cultivators, 6 per cent, members, however. that higher, even though we have reached the mass-production stage. It is obvious that these prices can be maintained only because there is excessive protection against overseas competition. The Tariff Board has stated that Australian prices are about equal to those at which imported machinery could be landed free of duty. The Australian manufacturer has a natural pro-",25,Customs Tariff Amendments Nos 3

Australian manufacturers lessened considerably during the years of the depression. It is certain that if the present price of wheat is maintained, or improves there will be a boom in the manufacture of farm machinery, because many of the machines now in use are obsolete and worn out. They have been kept in use during the last five years in order to maintain production, although their use has been uneconomic. The manufacture of machinery decreased to an average of £1,450,000 annually for the five years of the depression, compared with an average of over £3,000,000 for the preceding seven years. I think we can reasonably assume that a return to normal times and prices would be accompanied by a big increased demand for machinery, equivalent to a production of at least £3,000,000. If that should eventuate, the overhead costs of Australian manufacturers would be proportionately reduced, and obviously .they would have a better opportunity to compete with Canada. The makers have a natural protection of from 60 per cent, to 65 per cent.; therefore the farmer should be given some consideration. dary machinery to enable them to produce competitively with outside manufacturers, they are permitted to import free of duty under by-law. Wheat-growers have to produce in competition with those who can obtain their machinery at a cheaper rate, and yet they are not placed on this footing. They must buy in a protected market and sell at world parity. I ask the Government to give the assurance that the excessive rates upon imports are being maintained for the specific purpose of arranging a reciprocal treaty with Canada, or that it will review the matter and alter the schedule in conformity with the recommendations of the Tariff Board. propose to move an amendment that the duty on agricultural implements should be made to conform with the recommendations of the Tariff Board, unless the Government can advance solid reasons for not implementing those recommendations. If the assurance which I seek is not forthcoming, the Government The demands upon can expect no loyalty or assistance from me in .the future. I presented to the Tariff Board the case in connection with these duties, and was able to prove conclusively that the prices of the raw materials required were cheaper in Australia than in Canada. I also showed that Canada had to import most of its coal from Great Britain, its imports amounting to from 900,000 to 1,000,000 tons a year, whereas we have the coal right alongside the smelters, and that the raw iron deposits of Canada cannot be compared with those of Australia. Yet the price of this machinery in Australia is nearly double the price charged to the farmer in Canada and the United States of America. The statistics issued by the Commonwealth Statistician show that the rate of wages paid to the artisan in Canada is 8£d. an hour more than is paid in Australia. The report of the Tariff Board for 1925 stated that it was the duty of the Australian farmer to buy from the Australian manufacturer; even though one manufacturer was able to make profits equal to the whole of his capital within a period of two years. I knew the McKays when they were boys, If our seconand am proud of the fact that they were industries require expensive able to build up such a magnificent industry. But that they have done good work is no reason why they should exploit tEe community and amass a huge fortune. It is for that reason that we suggest that the duties should be reduced. I consider that they should be even lower than those recommended by the Tariff Board. Outside manufacturers have to meet the cost of exchange and also pay duty and primage on the casing. I have before me an invoice amounting to £5,617 18s. for imported harvester threshers, which, with the usual 10 per cent, or £561, makes a total of £6,179, while on the fixed rate imposed in 1914 the duty would have amounted to £420.

The Tariff Board now recommends duties ranging from 15 per cent, to 25 per cent., which, plus the natural protection in the form of insurance, freight and exchange, should surely be sufficient. Some time ago, the Government promised that the duty on casing would bo removed, but, because some manufacturers had, what the department termed the impertinence to pack tool boxes in the same cases as the machines, the impost was continued, and primage duty has also been charged. I do not know the attitude to be adopted by supporters of the Government, but I contend that the Australian Parliament should cease pandering to these big corporations, which are quite able to compete with -erscas manufacturers without the protection proposed. Why should this Parliament impose unnecessarily heavy duties upon imported agricultural machinery, and thus enable Australian manufacturers to become even more strongly entrenched, and to charge whatever prices they choose?

The Opposition cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan '( Mr Gregory) to reduce the intermediate and general tariff from 30 per cent, to 15 per cent. One becomes fired of the complaint made by the honourable member for Swan against the Australian agricultural implement makers, who he contends, are exploiting the primary producers. The honourable member made similar statements before the Tariff Board, when it was conducting a most searching inquiry into the agricultural implement industry. Evidence was also given by Mr Gates, the secretary of the Tariff Reform League, Mr Westmore, the secretary of the General Committee for Tariff Revision, the secretaries of chambers of commerce, and the representative of the Graziers' Association. They all complained of the manner in which the primary producers are being exploited by the Australian agricultural implement manufacturers. The honourable member for Swan supports the recommendations of the Tariff Board when reductions of recommendations when increases are proposed.

Australian agricultural implement industry, which pioneered secondary production in Australia, should have the support of every ardent protectionist, more particularly as about 142 factories are in operation producing goods to the value of £1,700,000 per annum. A study of the Tariff Board's report shows that agricultural implements manufactured in Australia are cheaper than those produced overseas. Imported implements are sold cheaper in Australia, where there is a protective tariff, than in Argentina, where no duty is imposed.

80,Mr Hawker,"I should be reluctantare various ways in which customs duties affect producers, particularly producers engaged in export, and if the tariff is mishandled duties may have a serious upon our trade with other countries. At the moment the countries from which conceivably machinery might be imported into Australia are not countries that we need to consider in that respect at all. To that extent I think the Government would receive support from the representatives of farming districts if it were able to show that the duties were kept at their present level for the purpose of improving our trade relations with some other countries. because no implements worthy of consideration come from countries other than those with which our trade position is a long way from being satisfactory. The other way in which the tariff, if it is not very carefully watched, may affect the great export industries, which really are the barometers of employment of the primary and secondary industries of Australia, is by increasing the cost of production, thus lowering the power of our export industries to compete against the products of other countries. It is in that respect that farmers generally are somewhat doubtful as to the motives which actuated the Government in not giving effect to the recommendation of the Tariff Board, because, when the Government's failure to do so was made known and the price was raised-the says it was slightly raised-it was just then that farming conditions were slightly better and more purchases of implements were taking place. Actually, there was just that improvement in turnover which should have made it possible for the implement-makers to manufacture, if not more cheaply, at any rate at a cost that would offset the improved wages and other conditions granted to their employees as the result of awards of the Arbitration Court. It is very important that this great industry should, as far as possible, take its recovery from the depression by increased turnover, and, to foster the use of its product, sell at the lowest possible price. and steel industry has done that to a very considerable extent. improved it has lowered the price of its Mr Hawker. product to the public, in that way still primary further improving its turnover. That has benefited all sections of the comin any way, munity, and has made for increased effect employment in the secondary industries because in turn they have also been able to increase their sales. When it is possible to manufacture at a reduced rate, it is very disconcerting to find in these cases even a small increase of price. After reading the Tariff Board's report, and considering the market which the industry has, the cheapness of our raw materials, and the saving in freight, I have no doubt that a slight lowering of the protection against foreign competitors, such But it cannot do that, as was recommended by the Tariff Board, would not have had the effect of reducing employment or of bringing about an increase of imports, but, on the contrary, would have led to an automatic check being imposed upon a rise of price. It would have automatically assured us that this great manufacturing industry, with its thousands of employees, would have taken its recovery in the form of low prices, better sales, more employment, and better service to all sections of the community. I hope that the Minister can give some very definite assurance that these matters will be fully considered, that the public will be protected against further rises of prices, that some improvement of our trade position and some benefit in the marketing of export products are in sight to justify the GoMinister vernment's departure from its election policy that it would follow the recommendations of the Tariff Board, and that the hopes which that policy held out, to producers will be realized.

The report continuesThe worse year of the depression in the implement industry was 1932, when the sales of the six manufacturers fell to approximately £1.000.000, and the loss was approximately £90,000. In 1933 the capital employed by the six manufacturers (including now the Massey Harris interests) was £2,700,000, hut the profit to its prices, is a great national asset to was less than £50,000 on sales aggregating £1,000,000. There is no need to stress the importance of this industry, but at this stage, a survey of it as a subsidiary of the great agricultural industries would not be out of place. In 1933-34 the manufacturing industry provided direct employment for 1,900 persons to whom £670,000 was paid in wages. materials to the value of £800,000, and its output was valued at £1,700,000. In addition it provided a considerable amount of indirect employment. Thef o llowing quotation in regard to prices from the Tariff Board's report w ill , I think, explain the Government's case. Tariff Board's report readsAfter making allowances for all circumstances that might affect the comparisons, the board has arrived at the conclusion that at the present time the Australian farmers arc obtaining their requirements of harvesting implements at prices which are lower than thoso paid iby farmers in New Zealand. No agricultural implement-making industry is established in New Zealand, and obviously the farmers of that dominion are paying more for agricultural implements than they should. Since 1923 retail prices have shown a consistently downward trend. a group of representative implements retail prices in 1935 were 21 per cent. in 1923. in 1935 of a stripper harvester was £109 10s. as against £136 in 1923. In 1923 a four-furrow mouldboard plough sold at £4S 10s., whereas the 1935 price was £40 10s. A similar variation has taken place in respect of the prices of other implements. On the other hand, prices are now rising slightly by reason of increased costs occasioned by wage increases. In March, 1935, wages advanced by 2s. a week, and from the 1st few primary March, 1936, the factory working period in Victoria was reduced from 48 hours I suggest that the honto 46 hours a week, thus further increasing production costs. Whilst these factors increased the factory cost of agricultural implements by almost 3 per cent., retail prices have been increased on the average by only 1 per cent. TheT a r i ff Board's report shows conclusively that this industry, if it can be criticized in some measure with regard Australia. The employees in the industry are the consumers of primary products which are sold here at higher prices than are obtained for them overseas. On pages 10 to 19 of its report, the board states. (Page 10)-The manufacture of agricultural implements is one of the pioneering It used Australian efforts of secondary industry in Australia and it now ranks as one of the major industries in the Commonwealth . . . .

My criticism applies of the representative parts:to the importers as well as to the local manufacturers. No honourable member on this side of the chamber contends that the industry in Australia ought to be severely treated by Parliament. My opinion is that the industry has acted fairly towards the farming community in many respects, but let us recognize that the factories have been paid good prices for their machines. Opposition ( Mr Forde) referred to the great wisdom and ingenuity of Australian agricultural engineers. that by far the largest percentage of acceptable inventions and innovations have come from the man on the land, and not from the engineers employed in the factories. increase of the prices of implements being only 1 per cent.

A 6-ft. reaper and binder has gone up since last year from £72 to £75, which represents an increase of about 4 per cent.

I have never heard the Minister state why the difference between the cost price of a header or harvester and that of a stripper is not great, although there is ail enormous difference between the quantity of material and the amount of work represented in these machines. Perhaps the explanation is that a stripper seldom, requires spare parts, whilst a header or harvester needs frequent replacements.

112,Mr Gregory (Swan) [5.28],"I to encourage the use of higher-powereduse a heavier tractor than is needed to draw his implements? It is significant that immediately the Government announced the new duties on agricultural implements, the Australian manufacturers increased their prices to the farmers of this country. The Tariff Board pointed out in its report that a mower which costs £19 18s. 9d. in America is subjected to duty and other charges totalling £7 18s., which would bring the price of that implement in Australia to £30 16s. 9d. Why should the Australian farmer be placed at a disadvantage compared with the American and Canadian farmer? If the duties recommended by the Tariff Board were applied, competition would soon force Australian manufacturers to sell their implements at lower prices. I realize, of course, that the cost of Australian iron and steel, and also our freight rates tend to make implements dearer in Australia than they need be; but a reduction of duties as recommended by the Tariff Board would undoubtedly help the position. The majority of the agricultural implements used in Australia are manufactured in Victoria, and the Western Australia farmers who buy them are obliged to pay anything from 9 per cent, to 12 per cent, more for them than do the Victorian farmers. This is represented by freight and other charges. manufacturing unit in Western Australia ? ment implement works in Western Australia, but it is not doing very well and never will; for no government enterprise of that description can succeed. It is quite unsatisfactory that the Western Australia farmers have to pay so much more for their implements than do the Victorian farmers. I shall call for a division on this item, and I trust that the support I receive will be so substantial that the duties recommended by the Tariff Board, after an exhaustive examination, will be approved. Trade and Customs) [5.34] -In reply to the request of the honourable member ance that the Government will take appropriate action if the price of Australian-made agricultural implements is unduly increased, I say definitely that the Government will watch the price variations most carefully. The figures given by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) of price increases of certain locally-manufactured implements do not contradict anything I said. Careful departmental investigation shows that the increase over the whole range of implements is only 1 per cent. implements. the average increase is 1 per cent. At the same time, there has been a rise of price in competing countries. In Canada, in the case of the MasseyHarris Company, the average increase has been 3.48 per cent.; in the United States of America, it has been 5.2 per cent. will not be required. must realize that increases have taken place in many imports.

About four weeks ago I accompanied a representative of that firm on a deputation to the Minister and reasons for now that they are faced with unemploya reversion to the original duties against ment it is obvious that the revision of the the imported article were submitted to him. As the result of that interview, 1 understand that the firm's claim was referred to the Tariff Board, which again submitted an adverse report. The firm manufactures appliances for use in connection with wood-working. Under Tariff Item 174-""Machines, machine tools and appliances for use in connection therewith as presented by the departmental by-laws "" machines peculiar to various trades second report of the board has not been are admitted at free British preferential and 15 per cent, general tariff.

When firms, capable cross-cut benches, swing saw, designed for of manufacturing machinery of this type cross-cutting in box and case-making; and 26, tenoning machines, double-ended, the manufacture of these machines, which has been undertaken in Australia on a commercial basis, will probably be discontinued. This firm, which has carried on the manufacture of woodworking machinery for many years in Australia, has proved a valuable asset to the building trade. The placing of these machines on the free list will increase imports to an extent that will keep the available market stocked for years hence, and thus partially close an avenue of emthe Australian Labour party, I stand for ployment According to evidence which Wolfenden Brothers submitted to the Tariff Board, the firm employed 35 hands at the close of work in February, 1935; but the deputation which waited on the Minister showed that for the first time in many years the firm was then without orders for new machinery. As the result of the reduction of the tariff on this item, the enterprise is being refixed at a time when the building trade stricted in its efforts to carry on. Comwas very slack. As the result of improved paratively few wood-working machines are required in Australia, and to have men skilled in the manufacture of them thrown out of work is a distinct and definite disadvantage. The Government should bear in mind this important consideration. The majority of the employees engaged in the manufacture of this machinery live in my electorate, and tariff on this item is detrimental to their interests and to the firm which employs them. As I have stated, a representative of this enterprise presented certain information to the Minister in support of a case for a return to the original duty; the Minister deemed it necessary to refer the facts to the Tariff Board which had already investigated' the claims of the industry for adequate protection. The published, but I understand that it is not favorable to the request. In my opinion, ihis industry is deserving of special consideration. I realize that the manufacture of any machines which displace manual labour is not to the advantage of workers, but it is inevitable that we on a commercial basis are established, they should have the support of honourable members in obtaining adequate protection. I do not propose to follow the course of suggesting that this item should be postponed in order that the circumstances may be reviewed, but I feel that the manufacturers have made out a sufficiently sound case to warrant this matter being delayed long enough for them to demonstrate that, with a measure of protection, they can compete successively with the British manufacturer. As a member of to Australian workmen. the adequate protection of industries of this kind. I feel that the Government, regardless of what its view on the tariff might be, is not desirous of putting out of existence an industry which gives employment to artisans and enables machinery of a special type to be manufactured in Australia. The unfortunate position in which this firm is placed is due to the fact that the present rate of tariff was conditions, for which the Government has claimed all the credit, Australia is now experiencing what may be termed a revival, if not a boom, in this trade in consequence of which all manner of timber Avork, which these machines would perform, is in demand. If the duties are restored to their previous basis Wolfenden Brothers may again find an increased market for their machines, and from that viewpoint the Minister could well give careful consideration to their request. Theirs is a specialized business; the machines they turn out do not sell by the thousand. When this matter was being considered by the Tariff Board it referred to the fact that the development of patterns and drawings added to the overhead costs. In view of the fact that it gives employment to skilled men. in the engineering trade, we should not take any action which may strangle the industry. According to information that I have received, quite a number of men have already been thrown out of work, in consequence of the new duties. If . therefore, concentrate on the making of machinery it can be definitely claimed by this firm that it can compete with imported machines, provided it receives adequate protection, I feel that it deserves sympathetic consideration from the Minister. Trade and Customs) [5.50] -Honor able members will agree that machinery for production purposes should be available at the cheapest rates possible, in order to keep down capital costs and allow Australian manufacturers to compete with one another, and also with overseas manufacturers. statement that, by taking away some of the fifild of manufacture from the makers of machinery, unemployment is created, ignores the fact that machinery gives employment, in other industries. The Tariff Board carefully eliminated certain types of machinery which the firm mentioned by the honourable member was unable to make economically. On the other lines which it manufactures, the rates of duty are satisfactory. Representatives of the firm interviewed me, and stated that certain evidence tendered before the Tariff Board in regard to imported machinery was incorrect. I undertook to have an investigation made in order to ascertain whether the duties were sufficiently protective. The Tariff Board has given a comprehensive reply which, however, I do not propose to read to the committee, because it concerns only one firm which, I imagine, does not desire the details of its business to be made public. In my opinion, the Tariff Board has supplied a satisfactory answer. It states that the evidence tendered before it has been proved to be correct, that the firm is sufficiently protected in regard to those lines which it can produce economically, and that it would be better for it to discontinue the manufacture of other lines. There is no scarcity of work for engineers in Australia. The firm in question can find employment for its engineers in the making of other classes of machinery. On one occasion it opposed the entry under by-law of certain wood-working machinery, which it stated it was able to make. Later, it found that it could not do so. It is better that these items be clarified and put in the schedule as free of duty, and that the firm should which it can produce at reasonable prices. in the particular class of machinery to which I have referred. investigated 321 types of machinery, and said that undoubtedly the firm in question had undertaken the manufacture of too many types. I shall forward the Tariff Board's report to the firm. If it had acted wisely the firm would not have undertaken the manufacture of machines which it could not produce on A general an economical basis. 174 By adding tlie following paragraph to snhitem (x) :(9.3) Engines, exceeding 100 horse-power designed for the use of coal or producer-gas, including first set of spars parts imported with and for use with such engines, .id valorem: British, free; intermediate, 15 per cent.; general. 15 per cent.

The Tariif Board inquired into this item in November, 1933, and since that inquiry wages have, in many instances, been increased in Australia and hours have been reduced. The capital invested in this industry is estimated at £300,000, the wages and salaries distributed directly being estimated at £83,000 per annum. The material, & c , by the industry is as follows: 4S per cent. Australian origin, £69,120; 44 per cent.

The quality and range of locally-made appliances are undisputed. The industry works closely with the supply companies and has developed many electrical appliances to suit the needs of the Australian people, one striking example of which is the electric jug, a quick and cheap electric, water-boiling utilit y which is not made in the United Kingdom. The sale of jugs in Australia is estimated at from 40,000 to 50,000 per annum. Again, the electric "" NightL o a d "" hotwater service is made by the industry, and the needs of Australia are f u l ly catered for. B y reason of their bulk, such heaters could not he imported economically. The industry also renders an essential service by the provision of servicing depots throughout Australia, where service in the nature of repairs and replacement parts is readily available, not only to their present and past products, but also in cases where overseas manufacturers have withdrawn their products from the market or, for other reasons, fail to provide adequate service facilities for the goods they have sold in Australia. Service is provided by the industry by the manufacture of special heating and cooking equipment for the commercial preparation of foodstuffs, specialized plant for other industries, electrical equipment for hospitals, scientific research, &c. Such service could not be effectively or economically heating and rendered by overseas manufacturers, as it is in most cases special and intimate to specific needs. The evidence submitted to the Tariff Board indicated that the difference in wages between Australia and the United Kingdomi n the trades affected was then 47 per cent., and the difference in the cost of basic materials from 75 to 80 per cent. The industry is well-established and well-managed, and is equipped with highly modern plant. As local competition has regularly and value of purchases of raw consistently reduced the prices of Australian-made appliances, and the extent and nature of the manufacturing activities of the industry are substantial, it can claim to be economically practicable. The industry, which The tariff does not preclude overseas manufacturers from, tendering for the Australian market requirements with a reasonable chance of success. The present tariff protection-3 0 per cent, ad valorem British-is moderate and represents only the difference between labour and material costs in Australia and those overseas. This is another industry which would be placed in jeopardy if any further reduction of duty were made, or if any trade treaty bearing on it were made with any foreign country, particularly with an Eastern country, where labour costs are lower and hours of labour longer than Ln Australia. It affords excellent opportunities for Australian boys to learn an interesting trade. Item agreed to. Item ISO. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. The Scullin Government incurred a lot of criticism because it imposed prohibitive duties, and even total prohibition in some cases, upon the importation of wireless receivers and accessories. Those prohibitive duties were imposed, however, because the Government believed that this industry could be developed satisfactorily in Australia, and, indeed, supply the total locail requirements. The growth of the number of persons employed in the industry within recent years demonstrates the effectiveness of the protection afforded. At the end of December, 1930, the average number of persons employed numbered 275, while the number engaged at the present time is 6,000.

For the year 1934-35, the wages paid in the industry, at an average of £150 per annum for each employee, number of receivers manufactured for the same period was approximately 170,000. and the average sale price was £30 each. Before the importation of wireless sets was prohibited, a six-valve set. of good quality sold in Australia at £50. To-day a good quality, six-valve receiver is priced at £20. 1 stress that fact, because the opinion is freely expressed by low-tariffists that, as soon as protection is afforded.to any Australian industry, the price of the commodity concerned must inevitably rise. The wireless receiver manufacturing industry affords a striking example of how the encouragement of local production may lead to a substantial reduction of prices. I remind the Minister that the manufacturers of wireless sets in Australia are apprehensive lest the projected negotiation of a trade treaty with Japan should result in the reduction of the import duty on foreign receivers to the detriment of the Australian industry. I should be pleased to learn from the Minister whether there is any likelihood of that occurring. Any downward revision of the foreign tariff would strike a serious blow at the Australian industry, in which so mn7iy persons are employed. I have always been a consistent supporter of Australian industries; recently I had a bitter experience of the operation of the Australian tariff. While I was in EnglandI purchased a wireless set for £3 17s. 6d., upon which I was asked to pay, when. I reached Australia, duty totalling £8 10s. I remonstrated with the authorities, and the best bargain I was able to strike was to have the duty reduced to £6. Unfortunately, during the voyage out. the set fell off a shelf in a rough sea, and was broken, so when T learned that I should have to pay £6 on it . I told the officials they could take instalmentsthe set away and play with it . In my opinion, the duty levied upon that set was altogether excessive. On the other side of the world one can buy wireless sets Quite an important for one-third of the price asked for them here. I favour reasonable protection, but I believe that the poorer members of the community should be able to purchase wireless seats at a moderate price,, especially as these are no longer totalled £3,900.000. The luxuries, but are practically necessaries. It is ridiculous that we should be required to pay £12 in Australia for what can be bought in England for £4. We might reasonably be required to pay twice as much here as in England, but no one can convince me that it is justifiable to charge three times as much. Trade and Customs) [8.9] -I think the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Perkins) has effectively answered the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). This is a thriving industry, the importance of which the Government f u l l y recognizes. Generally speaking, those engaged in the industry are satisfied with the present duties. There is a divergence of opinion between the manufacturers of Melbourne and those of Sydney, but the Melbourne manufacturers, at any rate, are quite content. The present duties have been carefully considered by the Tariff Board, and some of them represent reductions, as compared with those previously in operation. The honourable member for Eden Monaro has informed us that he bought a wireless set abroad for £3 17s. 6d. No doubt he used it for some months, but, had he used it for twelve months or more, it would have been admitted to this country free of duty. When comparing Australian prices with those overseas, the honbut orable member must take the exchange rate into consideration. The honourable member must realize that if , when he is abroad, he buys goods which are subject to protection in Australia, he must be prepared to pay duty on them.

Since the higher duties were imposed in 1929, importations of sparking plugs have steadily increased as follows:Year ciidetl .lime1032 .. .. 170,952 1933 1934 1935 It must be assumed that the effect of the reduction of duties will be a still more rapid increase of importations of sparking plugs. Information furnished by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, shows that imports of sparking plugs during the six months ended the 31st December, 1935, numbered 63,733 dozen, or 764,796 plugs-ove r four times as many as we imported for the year ended June, 1932. The lower duties did not commence until the 39th November, 1935, and the figures I have quoted indicate what increased importation may be ex|>ectod in the next twelve months. The local factories are able to supply the total Australian requirements, both as regards quantities and range, and at short notice. They have been declared by leading local and foreign competent judges to be amongst the first three of the most efficient Australian factories of high precision work, and to rank equal, except for size, with any similar factories outside Australia. The largest, keenest, and most critical purchasers of sparking plugs, -Genera l Motors and the Ford Motor Company of Australia Proprietary Limited-hav e been, for a number of years, using Australian sparking plugs exclusively as original equipment for all General Motors and Ford cars and commercial vehicles marketed in Australia, their purchases numbering over 300,000 plugs per annum. These firms are more competent to judge the quality of a plug than are the general public; they not only have greater facilities, knowledge, and experience in the testing of plugs, but they are also required to submit Australian equipment to their home factories for stringent test and approval. per cent; plus addiThose firms are under a very great responsibility when selecting a sparking plug as original equipment for the approximately 40,000 motor vehicles sold in Australia, per annum. They could not and would not jeopardize the performance of their cars and trucks for the sake of saving a few pence on each plug. Their choice of an Australian sparking plug is the highest possible testimony to the industry. .. .. 347,250 The Australian manufacturers have .. .. 007.008 been able to build up a growing export .. .. 050,892 to New Zealand. They have even exported plugs to South Africa, and have received the highest prices for the finished 4rtic!e. The industry can make the unusual claim that the retail price of the Australian plug in the Commonwealth is considerably below the retail price at which English plugs of similar quality are sold to the English public. There are some people so steeped in prejudice against the local article, however, that, unless the duties on the imported plugs are sufficient to keep them out of this country, they will continue to ask for them. Yet the same people will ask for £4,000,000 a year as a bounty for the wheat-growers, or some other primary producers. Australian plugs sell here at 4s. 6d. Australian currency. Similar English plugs sell in England at 5s., which is equal to 6s. 3d. Australian currency, [t will thus be seen that the establishment of the local industry has brought about a saving of thousands of pounds annually to the Australian motorist. It has provided employment to Australian workmen under ideal conditions, and indirect employment has been given by the use of Australian raw material such as steel, brass, mica, washers, cartons, &c. I think it is also important from a defence point of view that Australia should be self-contained with regard to sparking plug3 for motor cars, trucks and aeroplanes. A capital of £75,000 is invested in the industry, and there are 140 employees. About 2,000,000 sparking plugs per annum are required for the Australian market, and the local industry, provided the margin of preference were sufficiently high, could supply the trade without any difficulty. Five Australian firms are engaged in the manufacture of sparking plugs. The Tariff Board's summary of the evidence given in its report of the 20th March, 1935, is as follows:Australian manufacturers have not in the past availed themselves of the full margin of protection available, and the public can now purchase locally-made plugs for replacement purposes at prices which are much lower than were ever previously quoted for good quality plugs. Tho existing rates of duty, which have had the effect of diverting the bulk of the equipForde) made out too tough a case ment business to local manufacturers, are considerably in excess of what is required to protect the replacement business, and are slightly higher than is necessary for the adequate protection of the equipment trade.

141,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong ),"regard to the duty and stating that in the event of the duty being removed the firm would not be able to continue the manufacture of these washers. the 23rd September, 1932, the company was notified by the department that no application had been made for a reduction of the duties on iron washers and that a reduction was not being considered. Accordingly the plant was improved and the industry grew in size unti l about 30 persons, many of whom live in my electorate, were employed. Subsequently the company found that although a reduction of the duty on iron washers had not actually been sought, the Tariff Board had given consideration to it . I emphasize that the type of washer produced by Ebeling and Sons Proprietary Limited is not of the ordinary type, but is a special article. The company said that it would not be able to compete in the manufacture of ordinary washers, but the fact that the black iron washers were of special sizes warranted special protection. When the duty was reduced company realized that it would find difficulty in carrying on in face of strong overseas competition and appealed to the Minister; I understand that some consideration is being given to its desires. From a perusal of the Tariff Board's report I find that the representative of the British Association of Manufacturers did not ask for a reduction of the duties on iron washers, but asked for a reduction of the duties on certain other lines, which are included in the same tariff item. Nevertheless, the duty on washers was reduced and the company has been almost driven out of production. The Ottawa agreement was not intended to prevent an Australian manufacturer from carrying on, but merely to enable the British manufacturer to compete on even terms. Article 10 of the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement Act 1932 readsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that during the currency of this agreement the tariff shall be based on the principle that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as w ill give the United Kingdom producers f u l l opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production, provided that in the application of such principal special consideration may be given to the ease of industries not f u l ly established. The manufacturer of black iron washers falls within the category of "" industries not f u l l y established"". In On October, 1933, the Tariff Board refused to differentiate between the different products of the nut and bolt industry, and taking the item as a whole recommended that the duty be reduced. The duty operating in 1933, before the Government adopted the recommendation of the board was-British l is . , less one-fourth of the duty or one-eighth of the value for duty, whichever is the less per cwt., or 33$ per cent, net ad valorem, whichever rate returns the higher duty; and general, 16s. a cwt. or 65 per cent. A t the sitting of October, 1933, the Tariff Board refused to differentiate between the different products of the nut and bolt industry, and, taking the item as a whole, reduced the duty to ad valorem 35 per cent., less 3s. 6d. a cwt., or ad valorem 10 per cent, (whichever returns the higher d u t y ) . This finding may have been satisfactory to manufacturers the of nuts and bolts, but it is contended that it is unfair to the manufacturers of washers and heavy iron washers quoted at l is . f.o.b. London. B y adding 35 per cent, duty-3s . 10d., less 3s. 6d. a cwtit. is equal to a protection of 4d. per cwt.; or by adding 10 per cent., a protection of Is. I d . a cwt., plus exchange, primage and freight, bringing the landed cost to about 19s. a cwt., against the Australian price of 28s. lOd. a cwt. The Tariff Board, in its comments, explained that for examination it divided the components of the selling prices of bolts and nuts manufactured in the UnitedK in gdom or in Australia into three principal groups-(1 ) costs of steel; (2) costs of manufacturing and packing and'manufacturers' profits; (3) costs of delivery e.i.f. and e. at main Australian ports. In respect of group 1 the board found that the Australian manufacturer had an advantage of Is. 6d. a cwt. over the imported material, and, taking this into consideration and summarizing the three groups, recommended the duty I have mentioned. In the production of washers, the Australian manufacturers found it impossible to procure sufficient scrap plate for local requirements, and installed a m ill which rolls plate to any gauge required. Thism ill can produce plate ready for punching at the cost of 5s. 10-Jd. per cwt., which, it is claimed, is very reasonable. They are emphatic that it is impossible to manufacture enough washers for local demands without this mill, and the board, when compiling the costs of steel, group 1, did not take into consideration the washer manufacturers. To manufacture 1 cwt. of washers, 3 cwt. of plate is used, and 2 cwt. is waste. The details areCost of plate for I cwt. washers (ordinary plate, if available) 3 cwt., at 4s. per cwt.

Cost of plate Difference of coat if milled plate and sera]) plate, if procurable, 5s. Tid. per cwt. It is claimed that in the washer industry in Australia, the production of washer plate by a rolling mill is essential, and further, that the extra cost of producing that plate should have been taken into consideration by the board. With an added protection of 5s. 7-^d. per cwt., Australian manufacturing costs will be still above the landed costs of the British product, but the manufacturers feel it is possible to do business with some merchant's who would prefer to buy assorted sixes ex their stock with 30 days' credit, in lieu of having to import, say. 10-ton parcels and pay cash against documents. From inquiries made overseas, the firm is satisfied that its workmen, their methods and the washers manufactured, compare favourably with those of British manufacturers. details of cost of manufacturing 1 cwt. of washers have been supplied by Messrs.

I suggest to the Minister that a mistake has been made by including washers in this item with bolts and nuts. If this had not been done, this Australian firm would have been able to carry on. In confirmation of my earlier statement the Tariff Board's report indicates that Mr Ferguson, the representative of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers in Melbourne, did The following not ask for a reduction of the duty on nuts and bolts, and in its only reference to metal washers in five pages of comment on the evidence, the board stated that there were no special features d. s. d. connected with the production of these goods in Australia to warrant the im17 7 j position of duties different from the rate3 .. 2 0 suggested for bolts and nuts. In its 15 74 9 (i opinion, they should be similarly treated. . . 3 9 The board appears to have completely overlooked the fact that a reduction of 28 101 the duty on washers would put these people out of business.

At Uie present time the mill is closed down and only two machines are in operation.

In its report the Tariff Board stated that the industry being carried on by this firm was unecenomic.

If the assumed protective value of exchange were halved, being placed at 10 per cent, instead of 20 per cent., .and the rates of duty were increased accordingly, the position would not be so unsatisfactory as it is at present. The subsequent increase as exchange moved towards parity could then be .4 per cent, instead of .8 per cent, for every advance of £3, so that the same rate of duty would eventually be reached as under the 1935 proposal, and the Australian industry would be safeguarded in the process of the return to normal financial conditions. Under item 250 ( A ) free admission is now given to bottles, flasks, & c , from the United Kingdom, while only the nominal duty of 5 per cent, operates on lamps under item 206 ( A ) , glassware n.e.i., under 250 ( c ) , and glass dishes under 250 ( F ) . .Such drastic cuts into the duties are not counter-balanced by the protective value of exchange, and each line should be given some additional protection, in stead of the protection being left to exchange, as is the case at present. This would not involve any increase of the final duty upon the return oT exchange to parity. The Government's tariff policy -the reduction of duties-ha s given a good deal of concern to this industry. The attitude of the principal company and its associated companies towards that policy was stated before the T a r i ff Board at its inquiry in June, 1935. The representative of the company then pointed out that in twenty years it had grown from a comparatively small industry to one employing 4,000 workers and paying £700,000 a year in wages. It was also pointed out that because of the uncertainty of t a r if f policy and the frequent fluctuations of the rates of duty the company did not know where it stood for any length of time In determining the present ahead. It asked for reconsideration of the protection given. I know that the Minister has committed himself to the This assumption policy of referring all such matters to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, and w ill not accept the responsibility of increasing the duty to-night. I ask him to be good enough, therefore, to refer this, matter back to the Tariff Board, and to promise early consideration of the report when received, followed by parliamentary action in accordance with the board's recommendations. ringah-Minister for Defence) [S.4S] This item has had f u l ! consideration. The board's recommendations are based on present conditions, and are not worked out from the angle of exchange parity. If the contention in regard to the allowance for exchange is correct, then the board's rates for. par exchange should be reduced, not the present rates increased. In the circumstances, as an inquiry has already been held, the Government is unable to agree to the suggestion that the matter should be furthe r investigated. Item agreed to.

Under the heading "" Cost of production"", the supplementary report of the Tariff Board statesThe boiii'd is not primarily concerned with tlic difference between export and domestic prices in the United Kingdom, because it is satisfied that the local nuinufacturers are able, even under normal conditions the Austrawithout the assistance of any duty, to meet competition based, on current export prices, whether or not they be what might be regarded as dumping prices. That is to say, irrespective of the dumping prices at which cement might be landed in Australia, protection is not justified. That is an extreme doctrine. It is not the policy on which secondary industries have been established. If cement is being dumped in the absence of tariff protection, the local industry is vulnerable, and the consequences to the employees in it may be very serious. Should it be shown that the industry is in jeopardy as the result of the wiping out of the duty, the Minister may consider some compromise. opinion, the British preferential rate of Is. per cwt. is too high. If some honourable member who has made a careful study of the matter will move for the insertion of a lower rate, say, 6d. per cwt., the Opposition will support the move. What will happen to the 3,000 workers in the industry if there is absolute freedom of entry and there are large importations of cement while this Parliament is in recess? be applied. a year will elapse before it can be proved that dumping is taking place. The Tariff Board states that a gross profit of 10 per cent, is sufficient, but I am informed that out of that profit, taxation, which represents at least, 2 per cent., has (o be paid, and from the remaining 8 per cent, provision has to be made for amortization and reserves. Messrs. Smith and Johnson, accountants, of Sydney, have submitted a. report, to the Tariff Board to the effect that such a percentage is totally inadequate for the cement manufacturing industry. The Minister may have some information to the contrary, but the Tariff Board's reports have been submitted in such numbers and with such rapidity, that it is exceedingly difficult for honourable members to study them. About two-thirds of the cement produced in Australia is manufactured in New South Wales. I have already shown that lian cement companies could not make a gross profit of 10 per cent. The Tariff Board has stated that the manufacture of cement ought to be rationalized, and if that means that one or more of the works should be closed down, the effect upon employment throughout Australia would be serious. It has been proved to me that, under the suggested rationalization, there would be no reduction of the cost of manufacture. The Tariff Board has also reported that the largest works do not necessarily produce cement at the lowest cost. The board bases its recommendation on the landing of British cement in Australia at 54s. a ton c.i.f., Apparently, in his but evidence was given that it could be landed at 7s. a ton under that figure. Moreover, since the Tariff Board submitted its report, British cement has been landed in all ports of the Commonwealth at 5s. to 6s. a ton cheaper than the figures on which the Tariff Board based its recommendations, thus leaving very little profit for the Australian manufacturers. The Tariff Board further states that the capacity of cement works in Australia should be 900,000 tons, and, allowing for stoppages this would give an effective production of 720,000 tons. The Australian cement manufacturing companies stated that they had a capacity of 1,300,000 tons or, when allowance was made for stoppages, 1,000,000 tons. Seeing that at one period prior to the depression these companies sold about 750,000 tons, they were justified in providing for expansion. The increased consumption in New South Wales during one year was 100,000 tons, and for several years it was equivalent to an increase of 20 per cent. Prior to the depression there was nothing to indicate that the steady development of this industry would not be maintained.

155,Mr Eorde,"It is quite possible thatexcess plant, I may state that the modern kilns produce upwards of 50,000 tons a year, and with the number of companies operating, there should be a substantial reserve of plant capacity. There is every indication that, prior to the depression, the excess plant would have been utilized to meet the increasing demand. If the demand were for 10,000 tons annually and there were prospects of selling another 10,000 tons, kilns could not be installed to produce nearly the additional quantity for which a market could be found. Provision in building has to be made for future expansion, and to-day kilns are not erected with a capacity of less than 50,000 tons. A k i l n was recently erected in Victoria with a capacity for 80,000 tons. It would be extremely difficult to mention any old-established industry that is not overcapitalized. During the depression the building, baking, hosiery, clothing, wheat-growing and textile industries -were overcapitalized. In GreatB r it a in soft chalk and marl are used, and the works from which cement is exported are situated on the Thames or on the seaboard, where loading can be made direct into ships. In Great Britain, chalk, which is the principal ingredient, can be puddled and fed direct to the kilns, thus eliminating nearly 50 per cent, of the plant required by Australian cement-making firms. Moreover, British producers are able to purchase their power at cheap rates, and Australian manufacturers cannot possibly expect to produce cement at a price approaching that of their British competitors. cement in Australia at a little more than one-half of the price at which they dispose of it in Britaina clear case sent to other countries in which cement is not manufactured, are sold at prices much higher than those ruling in Australia. The British Board of Trade returns and information available to the Tariff Board support that statement. The freight on which the Tariff Board based its report, is probably 27s. a ton which, I understand, is the rate charged by the associated shipping lines; but as coal was recently shipped to Australia at 13s. a ton, it would be an easy matter for shippers to obtain a suhstantial reduction of freight on consignments of cement. Since the Tariff Board submitted its report shipments have arrived in all ports of Australia, principally in 100 and 200 ton lots; importers are awaiting a decision of Parliament in this matter before ordering larger consignments. Buyers are also hesitating before committing themselves unti l the duty has been definitely fixed by Parliament. Unless adequate protection be restored, there is every prospect of large quantities of British cement flooding the Australian market and seriously affecting the industria l position. I have heard that Australian steel manufacturers are closely associated with similar manufacturers in Great Britain, but I have yet to learn that the Australian cement companies are in any way connected with the British cement-making companies. If large quantities of British cement are landed in Australia, the production of the local factories w ill diminish substantially, overhead costs w ill increase, and large numbers of men will be thrown out of work. I should like the Government to take steps to ensure that the whole of this market w ill be available to Australian manufacturers. If the Minister conferred with the representatives of the companies, some arrangement could be reached under which the price of cement could be reduced without causing unemployment. I understand that some time ago there were consultations with the manufacturers in connection with the price of galvanized iron, and that the present Ministeri n charge of negotiations The latter are selling for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) was able to force a reduction of the price which was of great benefit to the Australian public. It should be possible to take of dumping-whil e supplies similar action in connection with cement, without jeopardizing the industry. .

156,Mr Pobde,"The Australian cementTaking the Tariff Board's cost of producing cement and allowing an average wage of £175 per annum to each man, possibly 12,000 men are directly and indirectly dependent on tbe industry. Even allowing part of the cost as transport charges and interest, at least 10,000 persons are dependent on the industry. The cement manufacturers claim that unreasonable profits have not been made, and that the profits made have been used largely in developing the industry. Tariff Board's report. infallible. I am not condoning profiteering, but the industry should not be made vulnerable to imports from other countries. If these companies are profiteering, the Government has a remedy at its disposal. If the cement producers can reduce prices without increasing hours or reducing wages, they should do so, but I am sure that they can not hold the market on the present free trade basis. The largest cement-making company in New South Wales has not paid more than 10 per cent, on its capital, and during the degreat national importance. I have read pression the dividend was reduced to 2J per cent., a portion of which was provided from reserves. I understand that a company conducting its operations jn Adelaide has been charged with profiteering, but the company has more than half its capital invested in other undertakings from which it is drawing profits. linked up. that. The United States of America found it necessary to increase the preference on cement used on government work to 50 per cent, in order to protect its cement industries. The fact that British cement was actually selling in America necessitated a substantial preference being provided in order to keep it off the American market. At the same time the Lyons Government deals the Australian industry a staggering blow. The members of the Opposition are particularly concerned in providing employment for Australians and in ensuring that only a reasonable price is charged. I should like the Minister to give an assurance that he will take definite steps to prevent the imbeen coming in at ' the rate of portation of cement from other countries, and thus increase local employment. We believe that the reduction from Is. per cwt. to free is too drastic, and that a graduated reduction would enable the Australian manufacturers to become accustomed to the new conditions. The whole of the Australian market should be available to our manufacturers but we have been assured that under the changed conditions this will not be so. This Parliament, after a short sitting following the Easter recess, will probably be closed down for some months. I ask honourable members to consider the position of those 2,000 workmen who are directly employed in the industry. If they lose their jobs sympathy will be of no use to them. What they want is employment; a chance to earn a decent livelihood for themselves and their families. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter carefully. The Government has the numbers, and has a responsibility to see that nothing is done that will jeopardize employment in this industry. Mi-. FRANCIS (Moreton) [9.17] Tho cement industry is obviously one of very carefully the report of tbe Tariff Board concerning it. After most careful examination, I can come to no other conclusion than that the report is extravagant and extreme; it is illogical, inconsistent, and based in several instances on the flimsiest data. In fact many of the passages in the report completely destroy companies are its value. Let us consider, for instance, the first page of the report in which the board, after paying tribute to the spirit of fairness of the cement companies, admits that its report was intended to have a drastic effect on the industry. One might almost infer from the manner in which the board has arranged the figures, so as to aggregate profits over five years, and make them seem unduly large, that it has intentionally misled the Parliament and the public. Should the board's recommendation be given effect, an Australian industry established in every State will be seriously affected, if not completely destroyed. Already there are large importations of cement. In Brisbane alone, during the last few weeks, importations have about 6,000 tons per annum. These",51,Division 7 Varnishes

160,Mr Forde,"I am not aware ofincreased importations will adversely affect employment in the cement and allied industries, and will have an adverse effect on the trade balance. At the present time, Australian funds in England are barely sufficient to pay for current imports and interest on external loans. The importation of cement will obviously reduce the Australian company's output, and tend to increase local production costs. The cement industry gives direct employment to 2,000 men, and to many thousands of others engaged in associated industries. In the manufacture of cement 200,000 tons of coal and 10,000,000 paper bags are used. Any reduction of the present output must increase unemployment, and Australian workmen will suffer for the benefit of workers in other countries. It is amazing to find the suggestion that this industry should be placed on a free-trade basis, though many thousands of men may be thrown out of work as a result. There is a possibility, which I hope will be ultimately realized, that in future it will not be possible to continue the present rate of imports. The ink on the Tariff Board's report is hardly dry, yet large quantities of cement are already pouring into the country. The cement manufacturers purchase large quantities of electricity in bulk, and any decrease of their output will result in a reduced consumption of power, which in turn will have a detrimental effect upon the coal industry. This will involve a reduction of interstate steamer earnings, and result in considerable loss of employment to waterside workers. All other industries will suffer' as the result of loss of purchasing power by all those workers in the cement industry and allied industries affected by this drastic decision. Reduced output by the cement companies will mean also a curtailment of purchases of manufacturing supplies; the railways of the various States will lose freights derived from the carriage of coal and materials. Taxes, both Federal and State, to the amount of about £1,000,000 per annum will be lost. This industry is a natural one, as all the raw materials required for the production of cement are obtained in Australia, and, as its product is essential for carried out with the full concurrence of defence purposes, it is a national industry [22] and a national necessity. Therefore, having regard to the disturbed world conditions to-day, it is unthinkable that we should jeopardize its success in Australia. One dominant fact disclosed by the Tariff Board report is that the British manufacturers did not avail themselves of the opportunity provided by article 13 of the United Kingdom-Australia trade agreement to give evidence before the board. The only request received from British manufacturers was for the free entry into Australia of special coloured cement, which was produced principally in Great Britain. The price of Australian cement has been gradually reduced, and I hope will continue to be. A reduction of 10s. a ton has been made by the Queensland company in the last twelve months, which has resulted in a voluntary loss of income to the company of £22,000. In 1934 and 1935, that company, after deducting taxation, made profits of only 6.2 per cent, and 8.9 per cent, respectively. In comparing the prices of cement in the various countries, the board conveniently omitted to draw a comparison between the prices charged in Australia and New Zealand. In that dominion, cement is quoted at approximately the same price as in Australia. After an inquiry under the Ottawa agreement, a duty of 8d. per cwt. was imposed by the Government of New Zealand. During the debate on agricultural implements in the committee this afternoon, the statement was made that New Zealand is a free trade country. Yet the Dominion Government saw fit to impose a duty of 8d. per cwt. on the importation of cement into New Zealand, in order to protect its own manufacturers. The board stated that the cement industry is over-capitalized. Having regard to the fact that until 1929 the industry was hard pressed to meet the demand, who could have foreseen the unfortunate depression and the sudden slump which overtook us in the following year. The statement has been made by the board that rationing of output has hindered free local competition. Actually, in New South Wales, rationing of output, which was referred to in the board's report as an evil, was the State Government, in order that the manufacture of cement might be spread throughout the State. The board has also contended that one company has made unduly high profits. None of the cement companies has paid a dividend of more than 10 per cent, in any one year, and the largest company in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company, which has been operating in Sydney for over seven years, has not paid a single penny in dividends. tain, the company to which the board referred has a comparatively small output-in fact, less than 5 per cent, of the Australian total-and has a large amount of its capital invested outside the cement industry. In dealing with the alleged unreasonably high prices, the board, in its supplementary report, aggregated the profits of the Australian companies. These profits are for five years, and are based on a capital of £5,000,000, as certified by Smith, Johnson and Company, a leading firm of accountants in Sydney. Let us analyse the board's figures. In its original report the Australian factories will be left with the board said that the total production for the five-year period was 2,363,115 tons. It said that there had been an enortransportation. The board stated that the mous profit of £2,250,000. Taxation on that income would amount to £450,000. A further deduction, on the board's own allowance, of 6s. a ton for depreciation would amount to £708,000, making a total deduction of £1,158,000. leave a balance of £1,100,000 for five years, or an average annual net profit of £220,000, which on acapital of £5,000,000 represents approximately only 4 per cent. Mr E. J. HABKISON -'Would the honourable member refer to page 4 of the supplementary report? both reports. This does not take into consideration any deduction for reserves and contingencies, which would be made by a prudent company. The board pointed out that the five years in which £2,200,000 profit was made covered the depression period, but it failed to state that it also embraced two peak years. Is that fair? pany made profits all through the depression. position of that company. Some members of this committee do not wish Australian companies to make any profits. Will any honourable member suggest that 4 per cent, is an excessive profit for an industry of national importance such as the cement industry? On page 4 of its report, the board admitted So far as I can ascerthat its original report was so badly worded that it was difficult for the industry to understand what was intended, and equally difficult for it to reply to the charges made against it. The board still maintained that an allowance of 20s. a ton to cover all overhead costs, including selling, was sufficient, but made no allowance whatever for the technical organizations supported by the industry for the purpose of supplying free technical service and advice to all users of cement in the Commonwealth. If the importation of cement continues at the present rate, British firms will get all the plums, and only the inland business which is most costly to carry on because of the long industry could carry on commercially with a profit of only 4 per cent., because that is the interest rate on Commonwealth bonds. of the board to judge what the profit of the industry should be? should merely determine ' the duties properly applicable to the industry. It is unfair to compare the cement industry with many others. It is subject to seasonal demands and to frequent interruptions through the failure of machinery, strikes, and trouble in the transport of its commodity. If Australia is to be developed it must have new industries, and the cement industry is one that should receive every encouragement. Those who are prepared to help in its development, and are prepared to invest their money, are entitled to the prospect of a reasonable return; but the confidence of the investing public would be shattered by the acceptance of the proposed reduction of duty.",52,Division 7 Varnishes

165,Mr Francis,"In my opinion itThe subject of over-capitalization was dealt with by the board on page 4 of its report. It stated that the present plant has a capacity of 1,313,000 tons a year, but that is the rated capacity. The productive capacity is actually 1,000,000 tons, after allowing for usual and unusual stoppages. The board considered that any capacity over 900,000 tons was excessive. be modern unit has a capacity of from 60,000 to 85,000 tons a year, the -excess amounts to only about one unit throughout the Commonwealth. In 1924-25 Australia produced 578,000 tons of cement, and in the next three years the output was incrceased by 30 per cent, to 753,000 tons a year. Had that increase been steadily maintained for a further three years, the production would ""have reached 977,000 tons, which is more than the actual tonnage that the board said ought to be produced in this country. Therefore, on the board's ownfigures,the industry is not over-capitalized. The commercial supplement of the Japan Weekly Chronicle of the 13th February last remarkedIt is necessary to have a 20 to 30 per cent, leeway in production capacity in order to ensure harmony between demand and consumption. If there is to be continuity of supplies, and the industry is to be in a position to meet emergencies, it should have this -capacity for expansion. On page 5 of its report, the board made special reference to local freights. I challenge the statement that the freight paid by local manufacturers would, if averaged over the whole industry, be lower than that charged in the metropolitan market. The freight from Darra to Brisbane is 5s. 8d. a ton, whilst the average freight paid by the Queensland company in 1935 was 16s. 5d. at ton. The board said that the industry is most exposed to overseas competition in its piincipal markets; but, if these markets were handed over, wholly or in part, tomanufacturers in the United Kingdom, the Australian factories would be expected to supply the inland markets, and that would result in increased prices to purchasers in the back country. The Minister may say that it costs 19s. a ton in Queensland to get raw material from the quarries to the factory at Darra, but I point out that, when the company was established in 1914, the rail freights were only half those ruling to-day. Referring to shipments from Queensland to northern ports, the board, in its supplementary report, statedI t is worth mentioning in this connection that other locally-manufactured produots, such Assuming this to as pig iron, steel, fencing wire, k r a f t paper, correct, and seeing that a meet overseas competition in North Queensland -when sold at prices which include portion or the whole of the extra freight costs. It is apparently expected by the board that this industry should be able to compete on equal terms in the northern parts of Queensland, because pig iron, steel, fencing wire and kraft paper are sold at competitive prices there; but all other charges involved in sending goods to North Queensland will be regulated by free trade conditions. The board omitted to mention that the duties on the respective items to which it alluded are as follows:British. General. Per ton. Per ton. s. d. . s. d. Pig iron 20 0 40 0 Steel 70 0 .. 120 0 Fencing wire .. 44 0 .. 80 0 K r a f t paper 180 0 220 0 The cement industry returns a considerable amount of revenue to both Federal and State governments, and particularly to the railways. Its contribution to the revenue in a normal year is over £1,000,000. Railway revenue benefits to the amount of about £600,000, and £450,000 is contributed in taxes. In its supplementary report, the board pointed out that it is satisfied that efficientlyconducted factories in New Southo""Wales could meet the competition of free impor tation from the United Kingdom. Vet the board, when conducting its investigation of the position of the industry, did not inspect any cement factory in Australia. As I consider that the board's recommendations are of too drastic a nature, I intend to submit an amendment. The board stated that the object of its recommendation was not to prohibit the importation of cement from overseas, but to force a reduction of local prices. I contend that that result could be obtained in many ways other than that adopted by the Minister. A reduction of prices tas already taken place. In Queensland it amounts to £22,000. presented. tion occurred in March of last year; the schedule was tabled in November. Other reductions were made this year. Instead of the drastic action recommended by the board, it would be safer, in the interests of Australian industry, to take the middle course. Cement and galvanized iron are the only items used in the building trade whose prices have been reduced in prices of most other items, except sand, have been substantially Because of the practical certainty of wholesale unemployment resulting from the Government's proposals, I move That the item be postponed, to indicate "" that, in the opinion of this committee, the following rates should be substituted:-British, 6d. per cwt.; interOperating costs in Australia are higher mediate, Is. 3d. per cwt.; general, Is. 6d. per cwt.; subject to existing exchange adjustments being maintained."" I do not support profiteering. This industry may not have done what everybody desires; but I think that I have shown that the report of the Tariff Board is too academic and extreme. This reducdution of duty will bring about untold employment, and I , therefore, urge every honourable member to take the safe and middle course by supporting my amendment. the first occasion on which I have spoken during the debate on this tariff schedule. o I had decided to remain silent throughout the discussion of the various items; but the reduction of the duty on cement is likely to have such a disastrous effect upon an important industry of this country that I feel I must support the effort being made to secure a reconsideration of it. The cement industry of Australia has developed steadily in many centres throughout the Commonwealth over a long period of years, but if the reduced duty continues in operation. I am afraid that passed. parochially. Although some cement works are operating in my electorate very much more extensive works are to be found in other electorates. The industry provides direct employment for 12,000 persons throughout the Commonwealth, and an additional 6,000 are employed in subsidiary enterprises, which depend, to some extent at least, upon the cement industry. Roughly about 80,000 men, women and children depend, directly and indirectly, on this industry, and if the men actually manufacturing cement are dismissed from their employment the dole bill of the States will be increased enormously. British ships arriving at the main ports tbe last twenty years. The of Australia to-day are landing cement at a price based on approximately £1 3s. increased. a ton, f.o.b., against the British home consumption price of £1 18s. a ton, and it is suggested that even this dumping price may be still further reduced! Approximately 80 per cent, of the cost of manufacturing cement is represented by wages. Very little imported material is used in producing the Australian cement. than in Great Britain and some other countries where chalk and marl are available, which can be crushed for considerably less than the material used in Australia. The total annual output of Australian cement is 700,000 tons and the annual wages bill is about £2,000,000. Towns like Kandos, with a population of about 2,500; Portland, with a population of 3,000; Berrima, Cockle Creek and Geeling depend largely on cement manufacturing. I have had some experience of towns practica "" 1 dying through the depression of the main industry on which they depend.

168,Mr James (Hunter) [9.46],"This isrehabilitating the industry are largely responsible for what has happened. Do honourable members propose to allow a similar policy to be adopted in respect of the cement manufacturing industry simply because the Imperial authorities are claiming, under the terms of the Ottawa agreement, the right to export large quantities of cement to Australia? Merely because the Government wishes to honour an agreement that it should never have entered into, and which is unfair to many Australian industries, overseas manufacturers have been encouraged to send representatives to Australia to dictate to the Tariff Board what they consider to be fair and reasonTariff Board. The report of the board, able conditions of competition. But to determine such a matter the board should compare the wages paid overseas with those paid in Australia. Japan is seeking to send cement to Australia. The wages in Japan are approximately Is. 6d. a day. The average wage paid in the United Kingdom is about 50 per cent, below the average Australian wage, and the Tariff Board should regard this as a paramount consideration when making any recommendation. Honourable members of all parties in this Parliament claim to take pride in our Australian standards of living. Honourable members opposite certainly have a great deal to say on this subject on the hustings, but it is a different matter when the protection of Australian industries is at stake in this chamber. If the reduced duties now applicable to cement are allowed to remain in force for very long, this industry will undoubtedly suffer serious injury. In considering such a matter as this I remember all the time that I am an Australian. I love Australia and intend to do all in my power to protect its industries. I am not concerned with what the Imperial authorities desire, for they do not care a continental about us except when a war is on and they want our citizens to help them fight their battles. We ought to protect our Australian industries right up to the hilt. This country should work out its own destiny, manufacture from its own raw materials, and do its best to become self-contained. Our people should not be made "" wood and water joeys"" for the manufacturers of Great Britain. We should work up our own products and sen cue manufactured articles on the markets of the world. We ought no longer to be content to be simply a primary-producing nation. Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties) [9.56] I have been more than ordinarily surprised at the opposition expressed to the new duties on cement, and particularly at the action of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) in moving this amendment, the object of which is to increase the duties. I remind the committee that the reduced rates are those recommended by the on which the Government acted in this instance, is one of the clearest and most convincing ever submitted to Parliament. I suggest to honourable members who may feel tempted to support the amendment that no Australian industry has suffered in consequence of any reduced duties brought into operation on the recommendation of the Tariff Board. In fact, I challenge any honourable member to name a single industry that has suffered in consequence of any reduced rate of duty introduced since the present Government has been in office. Hundreds of tariff items have been affected by these reductions, but no industry has suffered through them. engine industry has gone right out of 6X1S t GUCG not so.

In view of the record of the board, I venture to assert that the odds are one thousand to one that its report on this matter is correct. The board has a record in recent years of expanding industry, of creating employment, at a rate and to a measure that, I think, none of us anticipated two or three years ago. always right in its recommendations, why has not the Government always acted on them? its recommendations for reductions of the tariff that have been accepted by the Government, the board has been right. That is my claim. Of course, the Government has the power to set aside a recommendation if it has good reason for so doing; other governments besides this have done so, and I have no doubt that they will conone. The duty was referred back to the tinue to do so in the future. So much for the general merit of a reduction recommended by the Tariff Board. I come now to the matter of the reduction of the duty on cement, which is under consideration by the committee. The board has stated in plain language, that the manufacturers of this article are making excessive profits. That is the case; and I marvel that honourable members of the Opposition, in view of the tenor of their speeches last night, should speak in support of an industry which the Tariff Board has charged with profiteering and with the abuse of a monopoly. cement manufacturers; I speak of them through the report, of the Tariff Board, and I am merely repeating to the committee what is conveyed by that report, which states that the manufacturers am making excessive profits. At the expense of whom ? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has stated that this industry directly employs 2,000 hands, and then by one of his marvellous piece of multiplication, he makes the figure 10,000 men. I ask the committee to pause to consider who are the victims of these excessive charges. Surely they are the occupiers of homes throughout Australia! to assert that every occupier of a home in this country is a user of cement. There is not a cottage so small or so mean in the industrial areas that it does not use cement, and has not suffered from these excessive charges; there is not a farm in the electorate of Moreton which will not be affected if this amendment is carried. Round about any homestead in Australia one cannot put together two or three bricks, lay a few square feet of concrete, floor a dairy, build a silo, or carry out any of the thousand and one operations so necessary about a farm without making use of cement. The Tariff Board does not threaten to strangle or in any way do harm to this industry, but it makes the direct charge that the industry is, at the expense of every household, making excessive profits. I point out for the information of honourable members, that this report is more than an original board for further consideration, and this is actually a second supplementary report which confirms its predecessor and sets out that the board, having again carefully considered the situation, is as decisive in its opinion as it was in its first statement of the case. I do not desire to delay the committee; I wish, merely, to bring under the notice of honourable members the simple facts. The first is that this industry has been found guilty of making excessive charges which affect, as I say, every home on the continent. In those circumstances, what alternative has the committee but to agree to I do not speak harshly of the the proposed duty? Ifa.i l to understand how honourable members, particularly those represeting the smaller householders of this country, can vote against this proposed reduction. I realize that the honourable member for Moreton is being loyal to the industry in his electorate, but he is being anything but loyal to the overwhelming majority of the people of Queensland who pay for this cement and will continue to pay excessively for it if the amendment is",57,Division 7 Varnishes

188,Mr Curtin,"It must be clear, thereaLone. We have also to consider that this industry uses exclusively raw materials of Australian origin, and that therefore it is, in many respects, an essential seconis the remedy to expose it absolutely to dary industry, in that it makes the best possible use of Australia's raw materials and natural resources. It is in a different category altogether from those manufacturing industries which are more or less dependent on overseas supplies. Customs duties on the raw materials which must be imported must result in higher cost of production. But in regard to cement, there is no question of customs duties on raw materials adding to the cost of production, because they are entirely of Australian origin. Furthermore-and I that this should be a consideration in Australia at the present timethe power which the industry uses, whether generated from coal and transmitted to the works as electric current, or used directly as coal for roasting, and for other purposes, is a matter of some importance to another valuable Australian industry. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has told us how the coal-mining industry has suffered grievously during the last five years. Large numbers of men have been out of work and huge sums of capital have lain idle, and (therefore it would be unwise to set up conditions in the cement-making industry, which would diminish the demand for Australian coal. However, the demand for Australian raw materials directly, and for other Australian raw materials indirectly, and for Australian labour specifically, is more or less threatened by the fact that this item invites us to accept definitely, in respect of this induspay increased prices of the things try, the principle, not of protection in some degree, but of free trade, absolutely naked and unashamed. I put it to the committee that the argument of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties in reference to the attitude of the Opposition, as stated in the committee at an earlier stage, is not relevant at all. What we did urge was that, where protection is being abused, there should be some limit to the protection afforded. the Tariff Board reported? Mr Curtin. said that there is a good deal of profiteering in the cement-making industry. But free trade? Should not the remedy be a reduction of the duty? ber say that the exchange is not protective? 25 per cent., which has been stable for mora than three years, ceases to yield 25 per cent, protection. No economistof any reputation at all would suggest for a moment that an exchange rate of 25 per cent., which has been stable over venture to submit a period of three years, is not reflected definitely in internal price levels. I shall quote from page 84 of Professor Brigden's work the Purchasing Power and the Australian Pound. I hope that the Minister will take cognizance of the following statement by Professor Brigden:If and when prices rise in Australia through inflation, and if the exchange does not move, or is not allowed to move, with them, imports may be expected to revive. and when "". the Australian internal economy. manufacturers were exporting, they would get the benefit of the 25 per cent, exchange; but instead of being exporters they are buyers of labour and raw materials. To the extent that Australia's price levels have been raised as the result of the exchange rate, to that extent manufacturers lhave to they buy, or the goods they use, or the labour they employ, because those things have to conform to Australian internal price levels. The Minister should know that. Professor Giblin's thesis, which was discussed in this chamber in connection with the sales tax on flour, set out that the price of flour would be advanced, as a result of that tax, and showed that., whilst the tax would be of benefit to the exporters of wheat, because of enhanced prices, a very substantial portion of tbe tax would ultimately fall upon the wheathas growers themselves, because their costs would be inflated.

If that is not true, everything that we liavslearned, from the beginning of our study of political economy until now, has taught us nothing. The Minister is like the Bourbons; he forgets nothing, and ho learns nothing. On the same page, 'Professor Brigden saysWhile progressive inflation is taking effect the exporters benefit. Their costs do not rise as rapidly as the rate of exchange they receive, a monopoly to command import distribubut when the process stops the benefits virtually disappear. The argument that the Australian cement industry gets the benefit of a 25 per cent, exchange rate is wholly untenable. I agree that it gets the benefit of a portion of that rate, and under legislation passed by this Parliament the theory is accepted that only a portion of the exchange rate should be taken into account in the assessment of the appropriate automatic adjustment for customs purposes.

Minister's argument that the exchange rate affords sufficient protection to the Australian cement industry against imports from the United Kingdom is not valid. Mr ""WHITE -The honourable member is ignoring the fact that the Tariff Board assessed all these items of costs in the industry. I am of the opinion that the Tariff Board has erred very grievously in its assessment of costs in respect of this industry, and also in relation to quite a number of other factors which should be taken into account. The board has had to investigate a veritable network of complicated and exceedingly difficult industries, and I doubt very much whether it has been able to do the volume of work it has accomplished in respect of all the reports it has submitted to this Parliament in the last year without committing some errors or mistakes, even though these may not have been very serious. When the cement industry was established in Western Australia the price of cement to the Western Australian user was 25s. a cask, or £7 10s. a ton. Its establishment, which was accomplished under great difficulties and with initial loss, has resulted in very substantial reductions in the price of cement to the Western Australian public. Thus, whilst it may be true that a monopoly over manufactures in Australia can exploit the public, it is equally true that the absence of internal competition, enabling tion, can also result in the ruthless and gross exploitation of the Australian public. prefers the former? monopoly in itself is not an inherent quality of either free trade or protection. For instance, if all cement had to be imported into Australia as from tomorrow could an ordinary builder place an order in the United Kingdom? He couM not. The chief manufacturers in the United Kingdom would establish half a dozen agencies in Australia, and the only source of supply to the Australian user would be through the The medium of those agencies with the result that there would be just as much monopolistic control over the distribution of cement, having regard to the workings of the economic system, as could conceivably be the case in connection with the manufacture of cement in Australia. As I have already said, when there was no local supply of cement in Western Australia, the price in that State was 25s. a cask or £7 10s. a ton. The Western Australian company, simply because it existed, forced those then supplying the Western Australian market to reduce their prices immediately. Thus the loss which the pioneering company in cement manufacture in Western Australia suffered is not the only thing to be taken into account. The benefit to the public resulting from the reduction of the price through the establishment of the company also has to be considered.",60,Honourable Membees No

201,Mr Curtin,"I submit that aThis was definitely the immediate outcome of the development of competition in ""Western Australian production which freed users of cement from their dependence on supplies from elsewhere. The Western Australian company states that, whereas the Tariff Board's average estimate of costs a ton included 7s. 6d. for raw material, and 8s. Id. for coal and power, its actual cost for raw material was 12s. Mr ""WHITE -""Why did not the company give those estimates to the Tariff Board? read the supplementary report of the board he would know that it did so. Mr ""WHITE -Not at the first inquiry; it did on the second occasion. turing companies operating in Western Australia, I point out that they are far removed from the eastern States, and that the Tariff Board visits that State infrequently. Furthermore, the Western Australian cement company, for instance, is not associated with the cement manufacturers of Australia; it is a separate, independent and exclusive company. It is not even a member of the Australian Cement Manufacturers' Association. In this case it really believed that the communication addressed to it was one that would be dealt with adequately by the manufacturers in the eastern States. If the Minister will make allowances for the company on these grounds, he will admit that when the Western Australian company, by reason of its detachment from the eastern States, receives a communication of this nature, it does not regard it as seriously as it probably should. In this ease it probably did not do so, because it relied upon the facts, that the duty of £1 a ton had been in operation for years, and that the industry had been established by the Parliament which had given it protection. It thought no great damage could be done by adopting that attitude. It made that mistake, but when the second inquiry was made by the Tariff Board, it furnished all the evidence it could. It now makes the challenge that the Tariff Board took as the standard for cement costs, not the actual costs incurred in the industry at all, but those applying to the treatment works at Mount Lyell, in Tasmania. The board apparently thought that cement works were analogous to those works at Mount Lyell, whereas the conditions under which cement is produced vary as between State and State, and as between establishment and establishment. The majority of cement works in Australia are situated in country districts, whilst the majority of the users of cement are situated in the capital cities, and it costs almost as much to haul cement by rail from the centres of production to the cities as it does to ship it from the Thames to Melbourne or Sydney. Thus the fact should be taken into account that cement users in Australia pay substantial amounts by way of rail haulage to Australian governments, whereas cement imported from British manufacturers can be brought here in ships not under an Australian register, and under advantages for which the Tariff Board has not made allowance. The board quotes £3 19s. 6d. a ton as the cost of imported cement at Fremantle, excluding duty, but my information is that at least one order has been placed at Fremantle at the following rate:-ne t cost c.i.f., £2 13s. 6d., exchange 13s. 8d., landing charges 8s. 3d., and primage (estimated) Is. 7d., making a total of £3 17s. a ton. This shows that the Tariff Board's estimate of the cost of imported cement, landed free of duty at Fremantle at £3 19s. 6d. a ton is considerably in excess of the price which is now being quoted. can take action. was informed that a recent order had been placed, and that these were the figures. I am not in a position to say whether the figures are accurate. I am somewhat fearful that the board has made a mistake, and has not been furnished with adequate data. I was led to that belief, as I pointed out before, by the fact that the board used as a starting point, the figures furnished by the Mount Lyell works in Tasmania.

205,Mr Curtin,"I have said that Iorable member will receive his support at the next election. I do not ask for it. This industry, which has been developed under the shelter of substantial tariff protection, is now to be bereft of protection of any kind. That is too drastic. If protection is to be reduced, it should be 'tapered off gradually, so as to give the industry an opportunity to adapt itself to competitive conditions. To cease protection too suddenly, is likely to endanger employment, and to make it probable that the amount of cement produced in Australia will fall short of our requirements. There will he a tendency for oversea suppliers to flood the Australian market to such an extent that the Australian industry will be swamped. It is always difficult, and sometimes dangerous, suddenly to reverse a fiscal policy once it has been initiated. I think it would be unwise of the committee, even if it accepts the report of the Tariff Board, to abolish this duty. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties said that the board had recommended a reduction of duty. We might be prepared to accept that recommendation, but we cannot accept the abolition of all protection. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Moreton, and if that amendment is defeated, I shall vote against the item. support the amendment. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), blew hot and cold in regard to this item, and treated us to a dissertation upon the merits and demerits of the Tariff Board. It is my belief that the board has, from time to time, furnished some admirable reports to this House, but I do not agree that we should swallow holus bolus every recommendation the board places before ns. After all, Parliament is supreme. We are always glad rto receive the report, of the Tariff Board on any item, but, on this occasion, I think the board has made a mistake. On many previous occasions, Parliament has declined to be guided by the recommendations of the board, so that if we decline on this occasion we shall be doing nothing new. Some of the evidence placed before the board cannot, upon analysis, be accepted. For instance, Mr Green, in giving evidence, made the following statement:The disparity between British or Canadian f.o.b. prices and Australian manufacturers' selling prices is greater than any disparity between the general level of costs in the three countries. With that I disagree. The British manufacturers refused to supply the board with any information as to costs, and no doubt the witness would be ignorant of Australian costs. In making a comparison, it should be remembered that Australian costs, selling prices, &c, are given in an inflated currency. Mr Green goes on to sayCement is manufactured in every State of the Commonwealth, and interstate freight would not offset any appreciable proportion of the natural protection of ocean freight. That assertion will not stand close examination. Nominally, steamer freight on cement from Great Britain to Australian main ports is 27s. 6d. a ton, but there are reasons for believing that this rate is subject to rebate for consistent shipping by conference steamship companies' vessels, and there may be other grounds for making concessions. tjhe honourable member's authority for that statement? people who understand the cement industry in all its phases. It is well known that a few years ago sailing ships were anxious to get cement as stiffening, thus saving the cost of purchasing and disposing of sand or shingle ballast. Consequently such cement was carried at very low freight rates, in some cases for the mere cost of stowing and discharging from the ship. At the present time the freight on cement from Melbourne to Port Adelaide is £1 a ton; from Tasmania to Port Adelaide, £1 Is. a ton; from Sydney to Port Adelaide, £1 5s. a ton; and from Port Adelaide to Fremantle, £1 7s. 6d. a ton. These figures indicate that, except for the shortest distances between Australian ports, freights on the Australian coast are, perhaps, higher than freights from Great Britain to Australian ports. member is presenting a good case against the Navigation Act.",62,Honourable Membees No

He was referring to the position in New South Wales. Some years ago the Government of that State made a long period contract to encourage the establishment of a new cement works. not happen. sored by the Government. This was considered necessary, because the demand for cement was not being adequately met by the existing companies, and as a result, a large number of developmental works in different parts of Australia could not be carried out. As regards South Australia, the price of cement to the Government during the period 1929-34 was reduced from £5 6s. 6d. to £4 13s. a ton, a reduction of 13s. 6d., equal to 12.67 per cent. In 1935 and 1936, there were further reductions, the price receding to £4 Is. 6d. a ton, a reduction of 25s., or 23.47 per cent, other countries. I feel very strongly on as compared with prices in 1929. For several years immediately following 1915, British cement could be purchased in Australia at competitive prices, and there is now the fear that, owing to the substantial reduction of the duties, the Australian industry is in danger. This industry is of national importance, vote against tariff reductions that threaten its existence. From a defence point of view it is an essential industry. The lowering of the duties to permit of the importation of British and Japanese cement is not in the best interests of Australia. We should do all that lies in our power to encourage its expansion. orable member should deal in facts, not suppositions. the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Parkhill) cannot deny is that, as the result of the lower duties, there will be much keener competition by overseas manufacturers in the Australian market. may be more reasonable. might not be more reasonable. The dumping into Australia of cement from overseas may give users a temporary advantage, but once the local industry is put out of business the price of imported cement will rise, probably above the present level. Large buyers will take advantage of the removal of the duty to place orders abroad. The increase of importations will adversely affect the Australian trade balance. Surely that must cause concern to the Government! At the present time Australian funds in England are barely sufficient to pay for current imports and interest on external loans. Importations of cement will obviously reduce the output of the Australian companies. Such a reduction will tend to increase the costs of production. There are certain fixed charges which do not vary with production, and the most advantageous terms for the purchase of many materials depend on the quantity ordered. Any reduction of the present output must mean an increase of unemployment. Australian workmen will suffer for the benefit of employees in this aspect of the matter. Our first duty is to the workers of this country. If we allow cement, from Japan and other countries to be dumped in Australia, more and more of our men will lose their employment. It has been said that there are too many cement-making plants in Australia. I do not hold that view. The cement companies are large users of coal. and I am prepared to Any decrease of their output will curtail coal consumption, and thus detrimentally affect the coal-mining industry. Many other industries also must be adversely affected. A reduced output of cement will mean a curtailment of the purchases",63,Honourable Membees No

There will also be a restriction of purchases from other manufacturers, engineering companies, ironfounders, bagmakers, &c. The paper bags which are used for the transport of local cement are made in New South Wales. creased purchases of bags will injure the paper-making industry. The largest proportion of the machinery used in cement works is made in Australia, the balance being imported from Great Britain. States will lose the freights that are derived from the carriage of coal and other materials and very heavy losses will be experienced because of the reduction of the quantity of cement carried from the manufacturer's works to capital cities or shipping ports. Other reductions of government revenue will include wharfage on materials royalties on minerals, charges for water consumed, and Federal and State income tax covering companies and individuals. I hope that the Government will agree to the postponement of the item. [10.57] -Parliamen t has adopted as a general principle the giving of preference to industries that are economical and are assured of reasonable opportunities for success. I believe that the Tariff Board has been desirous of extending preference in such cases. Many honourable members also use that as a basis in deciding whether to give or withhold ' their support of industries. we have a great industry which, because of the success it has achieved, is opposed by the Tariff Board and by certain honourable members. The Tariff Board has gone so far as to draw attention to the excessive profits made by the industry, in a report which the Minister in charge of negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) has described as the clearest and most convincing report yet presented to this Parliament. It appears to me that the board has endeavoured by every means in its power to show that the industry should not be protected, and that the British cement manufacturers should have free access to the Australian market. But no evidence has been furnished in regard to the profits made by British manufacturers, nor have the Australian manufacturers any means of ascertaining what those profits are. considered those who use this product. think that the board has given the Deslightest consideration to the Australian public; it has made its recommendation merely because it contends that excessive profits are being made by some cement manufacturers-a n aspect it ignored when dealing with the tobacco The railways of the various combine. Perhaps unknowingly, it has misrepresented the position in stating that some manufacturers are making a profit of 10 per cent.; but I do not think that they have received, over the years, more than 4 per cent, on the capital they have invested. In supporting the recommendation of the Tariff Board, the Minister and fuel in charge of trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) challenged honorable members to cite one case in which an Australian industry had been closed down in consequence of the adoption of a recommendation of that board. I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that, when Minister for Trade and Customs, he definitely informed Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, that, if they established a factory for the construction of large diesel engines, the necessary tariff protection would be afforded. In view of that promise, the firm sent artisans to be trained in Great Britain, and after they Here had completed their training, patternswere obtained, and arrangements completed to enable construction to commence in Queensland. A short time later, the Ottawa agreement was reached in which the Government's decision was reversed -becaus e that agreement provided that tariffs against Britain should not be higher than those recommended by the Tariff Board-and as production could not be conducted profitably in Australia without protection, the whole project had to be abandoned. produced; I have seen them in operation. ferring to the larger deisel engines; I know that the smaller type are-",64,Honourable Membees No

Stress has been laid upon the statement contained in the Tariff Board report that this industry has been making excessive profits; but no mention has been made of the profits made in other secondary industries. Wages represent fully 80 per cent, of the expenditure incurred in cement making, and in view of the Government's policy to reduce unemployment, this factor should receive the fullest consideration. Moreover, the wages paid in Australia are 100 per cent, higher than those paid in Great Britain, and as the conditions of labour generally in this country are infinitely better, the Australian manufacis before taking into account selling and turers should receive some protection. British manufacturers also have the advantage of obtaining the commodities required for the manufacture of cement at a lower cost than is possible in Australia, and of controlling extensive manuresearch. The suggested limit of 10s. a facturing plants on the Thames, from which point shipments can be made direct to Australia. As this industry is established firmly, not only in the eastern States, but also in ""Western Australia, it is of benefit to the whole community. Prom a defence view-point local manufacture is of vital importance to Australia. In the event of war, shipping might be interfered with; we should not have to depend upon supplies from Great Britain. Cement is used extensively by almost every section of the comQueensland factory costs of production munity, and it is difficult to understand why the Tariff Board should recommend that it be admitted to Australia free of duty. The Tariff Board had apparently not correctly viewed the situation, and taken into concement can now be manufactured from sideration all the facts when it said that the profit made by the cement manuI facturers was as high as 10 per cent. That statement is not only criticized by those engaged in the industry, but is also so ridiculous and unfair that honourable members should ascertain the facts for themselves before they condemn the industry on, what the Minister directing negotions for trade treaties would term, a charge of profiteering. In addition to imposing limits on the industry's capacity, it is suggested that gross profits should be limited to 10s. a ton. On last year's production of 481,148 tons, this would yield £240,574, which, after deducting income tax amounting to £48,115, would be reduced to £192,459. On a capital of £5,000,000-the companies' valuation of the industry's assets after making adequate allowance for depreciationa return of £192,459 would represent 3.8 per cent. Even on the board's valuation of £3,600,000 arrived at to suit the board's own purposes, that return would represent only 5.34 per cent. If the trade recovered to the pre-depression peak year production of 776,186 tons, a gross return of 10s. a ton after deducting income tax would yield 6.21 per cent, on a valuation of £5,000,000 and 8.62 per cent, on the lower estimate of £3,600,000. This administrative costs and contingencies. The aggregate expenses of administration, head offices, research and advertising average 5s. a ton. The industry has already expended £6,000 on ton gross profit has been declared after a careful accountancy analysis to be commercially impossible. The Darra Cement Company in Queensland, following a decision of the State Coal Board, has now to pay 9d. a ton more for its coal purchases and has had to pay increased wages due to recent arbitration court awards. The Darra Cement Company estimates that wages account for 80 per cent of the total cost of production. The board in its original findings of the did not include the amount of 19s., representing railway freight on limestone from the quarries at Gore to the Darra works.

As in the case of other companies, administration and overhead costs were omitted from the board's calculations when arriving at the costs of production at the Darra works. Big concessions to governments and municipalities have been granted in the prices charged by the Darra company to help them in the construction of Government utilities, roads, dams and weirs. I sincerely hope that no undue concern will be exhibited for the British manufacturers to the detriment of the Australian industry, because the British manufacturers did not approach the Tariff Board for a reduction of the duties. £1 4s. l i d . , or £678,000. This means that No case has been made out by .the board against the Australian industry, except that it is over-efficient. The industry is it. capably conducted and economically sound, and supplies a good article against which no complaint can be made. In the interests of country and city users, honourable members will appreciate the value of the industry to Australia, and what its successful establishment means in the building up of this young nation by the provision of employment for our workers at Australian wages under Australian conditions. No honourable member on either side of the chamber wishes to see an Australian industry such as the cement industry shut, down by foreign importations, but we do want to ensure that this big Australia-wide decentralized industry does not take excessive toll of the employing capacity of other industries in the Commonwealth. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties has pointed out that it is on the home builder that any excessive costs of building material falls. This is also true of the home occupier, because rents are governed largely by the cost of building. The quesand plant, or a very high profit indeed. tion before the committee is not whether imports shall be permitted to come into Australia, but whether the industry is giving the home-building public a fair go. Although the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) and the honourable members for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). Boothby( Mr Price), and Moreton( Mr Erancis) quoted voluminous figures conThe cerning the costs of handling the raw materials, all ignored the figures concerning profits and allowance for depreciation for the year following that upon which the first report of the Tariff Board was presented, which have since been submitted to it. The allowance made by the companies on 543,000 tons of cement amounted to £1 10s. l i d . a ton; or a total of £814,000 in an industry employing 2,000 workers. Thus, for every worker employed in the industry, £8 a week is absorbed in overhead costs, depreciation charges and profit. The Tariff Board considered that a fair allowance for depreciation was 6s. a ton. If that is deducted from the £1 10s. l i d . , it leaves the figures for profit, only at the industry is obtaining about £6 10s. a week for every workman employed in able member arrive at that figure? ance for depreciation amount to £1 10s. l i d . a ton on 543,000 tons of cement sold and the number of workers employed in the industry is 2,000. The allowance for depreciation which the board considers is beyond reason, is about 14s. l i d . a ton, or just about the amount of duty which the board recommends should be removed. I do not say that all the profit is going into the pockets of the shareholders. The industry is over capitalized. The general manager of the Portland Cement Company stated in evidenceI contend that half the works ought to be shut down. There are too many of them for economic production. It is quite plain, from a dispassionate study of the figures given, that this industry is too good a thing. For every £1 that the workers get, 30s. or more goes into either over-capitalized equipment It is with great regret that I say that I cannot support the continuation of such a happy state of affairs for the shareholders, among whom are excellent supporters of the United Australia party, and even prominent Country party supporters.

229,Mr Hawker,"The profit and allowdischarge to the workers of Australia. This investigation has been duplicated. Assurance has been made doubly sure with regard to the figures. The companies have had a second opportunity to correct any mistakes in evidence given at the first inquiry, and still the figures are more emphatic than before. extra balance-sheets for the year that has been completed since the first report was made further emphasize the enormous proportion of the cost of cement, which is going to maintain very high profits on a small turnover. I hope that the Government will not be shaken from its decision, that it will have the support of the committee. We can trust it to see that the industry is not overwhelmed by the dumping of cement from Japan or any other country. If there .were such a danger, I am sure that many honourable members, including Ministers, would revise their opinion. I cannot understand honourable members who profess to speak on behalf of those who occupy small homes supporting a state of affairs which means that for every worker employed in the industry the companies are receiving a profit on the average, of over £6 10s. a week. That is not my idea of a fair division of the fruits of protected labour. I am usually considered fairly conservative, but this is a little more than I can tolerate, even from people who are close personal friends of mine. Progress reported.
