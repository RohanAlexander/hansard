If That Is So; But, In Any Case, What Has Occurred Is Due To No Fault Of The Com","monwealth Government. At the last Conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers, a definite understanding was come to about the financing of future soldier settlements, and there the matter rests, so far as I know. Tbere has been no recalcitrancy on the part of this Government. know if Professor Gilruth, Judge Bevan, and Mr Carey, who were found by a Royal Commission guilty of maladministration, are still drawing their salaries? Has the Government taken, or does it propose to take, any action in regard to them? not correct so far as Professor Gilruth is concerned; but it is correct in regard to the other two.' The matter has been before the Crown Law authorities, whose recommendation I saw this morning for the'first time. That recommendation will be placed before the Cabinet. to the continued pollution of Sydney Harbor with oil and debris of various kinds.

49,Mr Charlton,"That ought not toproportion to all traders.. I appeal to the Minister to put the supply of sugar on a more satisfactory basis. [2.52] -The other day I moved the adjournment of the House to deal with the unsatisfactory distribution of sugar. I can assure the Government that I did not do so merely for the purpose of obstructing business, but because there is among a lot of traders considerable difficulty in obtaining supplies. course, I realize that a Minister cannot be expected to go into all the details of everything connected with his Department, but he is supposed to have some officers under him on whom he can rely for information concerning those details; and when it is said that the disput forward, and the Minister ought also tribution of sugar is unfair, I think he ought to take steps to discover what is the^real position. It is useless for him simply to say, "" I have received such and such information from my officers,"" that being an end of the matter as far as he is concerned. The case I mentioned the other day was that of a man who, as is well known by those associated with him and others trading in the district, has not been getting his fair share of sugar. When the House was dealing with the sugar agreement the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) assured us that all purchasers of half a ton of sugar could secure the full rebate. the Front for years, and proved themmise. He said that purchasers could go straight to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and get their sugar, and that they would get a full rebate according to the quantity they bought. The rebate is not the same for half a ton as it is for 100 tons. half a ton was fixed as the (minimum cn which the f u l l rebate would be given, and that quantities beyond half a ton had to be secured through some wholesale house. matter last week, I have received numerous letters emphatically asserting that the writers have not got their full rebates, . although they have purchased half would appear that although they have offered to purchase half a ton at a time, they could only get a few bags, and although in the aggregate their purchases amounted to half a ton, the full rebate was not allowed to them. Honourable members opposite must have heard of the difficulties which traders are suffering iD the matter of securing supplies of sugar. If they have not heard complaints in this direction they are indeed very fortunate. Possibly, the traders know that it is useless to approach them', because, being under the thumb of the Government, they may not care about kicking over the traces. HowOf ever, this is not a party question. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) did not raise the matter as such, and. I have not done so. Surely on a matter of this kind honourable members on both sides of the House ought to be able to add to the information already to be pleased to get it. Thousands of our soldiers who went overseas have not been repatriated from Great Britain; they are missing; but, unfortunately, many of them left dependants in Australia who are now quite unprovided for. I quite realize the difficulty of the Department in having to support persons who have been found guilty of some crime or misdemeanour, but it is unfair to penalize the dependants of those men. Some of the cases which have been brought under my notice relate to men who were at selves to be good soldiers. Their meritorious conduct was brought under the notice of their superiors. However, after distinguishing themselves in this way, through some cause brought about by the stress of war conditions, they committed offences, not only military, but also civil, and, in order to evade punishment, they deserted. Their dependants here were, of course, maintained by the Defence Department until the information was cabled out that the breadwinners had deserted, when naturally the However, since I raised this separation and allotment payments were suspended until the men were found again. The payments were restored then, and continued until the offenders were punished and discharged, after which the a ton of sugar. It dependants received no further support from the Defence Department. These dependants were guilty of no offence. The action-of the husband or son in deserting is no more the fault of the wife, or children, or parents dependent on him",24,Salaries Wa R Precautions Ship

When there was to be a "" hopoveT"" the men in the ""booby hatch"" were taken out and put into the line, where they were willing enough to go.

At any rate, the fault was not theirs, and when they make application to the Defence Department for consideration of their peculiar situation, I hope the usual stereotyped reply will not be given to them. I am sure that the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Eyrie) sympathizes with these women and children; but the time has come when the Ministry as a whole must recognise that we owe something to them, and should provide for them, irrespective of whether the men did or did not desert. It is unfair that the women and children should suffer for any offence committed by the men. had the matter under consideration for some time; but in the light of information now in its possession, that thousands of men who went overseas have been reported as having deserted, and have never returned, something should be done for these people. These missing men may not have deserted in the ordinary sense of the word, and many of them may not be alive to-day. Had they deserted their families here, proceedings could have been taken against them in the Law Courts; but the Government, having taken these men away for service overseas, should do something for their wives and children, who have been left without means of support. June last, a general order was issued that the men of His Majesty's Australian Fleet in Sydney Harbor were not to don their jerseys, and were to be deprived of the extra blanket usually issued to eaoh of them during the winter months. I brought the matter before the Naval Board, and the only excuse offered to me was that a similar order had been issued to the sailors on the Renown. Surely the"" health of the men, rather than any mere desire for uniformity, should be the first consideration; and I hope that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) will see that the order is immediately cancelled. A few days after its issue, a number of the men were found to be suffering from colds, and other complaints usually due to insufficient clothing. I do not think many members of the Naval Board are familiar with Australian conditions. The blood of a man who has been on an Australian Naval Station for some time is not as thick as that of a man who has only recently arrived from the Old Country, and therefore our Naval Forces need to be amply clothed. I do not think the present Minister had anything to do with the issue of this order. have heard of it. present Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) held oflice as Minister for the Navy.

There is another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Ministry. A regulation was issued last June setting forth that when the Naval Board approached a warship in harbour a salute of fifteen guns should be fired. I could understand the firing of such a salute on the arrival of the Minister for the Navy, because his appearance on board a warship would be something in the nature of a curiosity. for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) is laughing, but this is not a laughing matter.

Those gentlemen who compose the Board are, after all, only civil servants, just as Under-Secretaries are, and do not call for this special recognition. I know that when I approach, or write, to them on any naval matter, I am told to apply to the captain of the ship concerned; but this I refuse to do, preferring to communicate with the Department direct. As a representative man, I refuse to be snubbed; and as the men of the Navy are in my electorate I intend to let them see that their member is a "" live "" one. The firing of this salute represents an unjustipresent Lockyer and his wife have one room at fiable expenditure of ammunition and labour. Why is it necessary to announce the arrival of the Naval Board in this way? Is it to insure that the officers and men are in their places, or is it to awaken the officers in order that they may show themselves about the ship? The only excuse for such a salute seems to be that a similar one is accorded to the from the Crimea and earlier wars, and Lords of the Admiralty at Home, but those Lords of the Admiralty have some distance to go in the English Channel before reaching the vessels, and an announcement of their approach may be necessary. case in Sydney Harbor. If the idea on the part of the Naval Board is to inspect the ships, the better way would be to arrive unannounced. alarming sometimes, I am told, that children playing in the Domain run homo Mr West. and tell their parents a foreign foe is arriving. My relations with the members of the Naval Board are quite friendly, but it is my public duty to draw attention to this unwarrantable expenditure, and, if possible, see that these fireworks cease. I see that the regulation to which I refer was issued over the signature of the Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith), on 13th May, this year. It describes the flag of the Naval Board, and directs that it is to be saluted ""by firing fifteen guns, within the waters of the Commonwealth of Australia, on the The Minister same occasions as those on which the Admiralty flag is saluted."" I hope that the Minister for the Navy will see the wisdom I think the present Treasurer of revoking this regulation, so that our expenditure on the Navy may not be unnecessarily increased, and the whole administration conducted on the lines. of I should now like to refer to the position of our blind and otherwise hopelessly disabled returned soldiers, who have made some very strong appeals to me. Some of these men have lost both arms and legs, and they ask, and, I think, should have, special attention. One case, a very bard one, is described in the following letter:We have in our association two membersMr W. Lockyer, of Leichhardt, and Mr A. B. Turner, of Rozelle-wh o have had each two legs and an arm amputated. These men should be given a home of their own. Mr Lockyer's mother and wife told our association that at his mother's residence. To get about from room to room he rolls along the floor, as invalid chairs are' too big to get through the doorways. This shows the necessity of building a house to suit such terrible cases. The house need not be big, but the doors could be made wider, and other little conveniences introduced, to make their'lot at any rate a little easier than it is now. I can remember as a lad seeing the men realizing acutely the cruel treatment and hardships they suffered. We do not wish to see such, cripples begging in the public streets of Australia. That, however, is not the our own soldiers here? Sydney and other places. I will read This firing is so a statement about the matter which has been sent to meThe street bands, which consist mostly of able-bodied, returned men, make a practice of",26,Salaries Wa R Precautions Ship
60,Mr Poynton,Are you referring to,27,Salaries Wa R Precautions Ship
61,Mr West,"Yes, in the streets ofengaging as collectors returned soldiers who have had a leg or an arm amputated. These men do not wear their artificial limbs even if they have one, and they rattle their collection boxes under the noses of the public, and as there are generally three or four of them out to each band the public are being exploited to an unjust extent. If the limbless men got the money themselves it would not be so bad, although begging would be deplorable, but the present position is that the able-bodied returned soldier "" battens"" bn the limbless men. That is a thing which we should try to stop. I do not know if the Minister can contradict the statements with which I have heen supplied, but I would point out that they are the statements of the secretary to the Limbless and Maimed Soldiers Association. He saysA man who has an arm or a leg amputated receives his pension of 31s. 6d. per week, and 10s. 6d. from the Repatriation Department while undergoing vocational training. A married man receives only £2 15s., out of which must be deducted pension of 31s. 6d. for himself and 13s. 6d. for his wife, in all a pension statement, of 45s., so he only receives from the Repatriame rather strongly. I do not think that tion Department 10s. The present system of vocational training means that the man who receives £1 or £1 10s. per week from a private employer is better off financially with his pension added to prior to the asking of questions he that sum than if he went to the Repatriation Department and went through vocational training. It is useless to put questions on the notice paper, because very often the official replies do not accord with, the views of the Minister who gives them, and I have known cases in which Ministers have been very inuch annoyed with the replies with Which they have been furnished. I think that I am justified in drawing attention to these matters on the day devoted to the discussion of grievances, and I hope that something may be done to give relief. I hope, too, that the popgun business with the Naval Board will be discontinued. It is a pity that we have not a Gilbert and Sullivan in Australia to take advantage of the burlesque situations which so often arise here, and would furnish out an opera or two which would be funnier than any of their famous series. ber will give me a proof of the report of his remarks, I shall have the matters to which he has referred inquired into.

Before dealing with the Prime Minister's remarks, let me say that it is time that the new Tariff schedule, which was laid on the table about four months ago, was discussed by Parliament, and the duties definitely fixed. Parliament approved of a new Tariff in 1908, and in 1914 an amending schedule was brought in, which was never considered; but, at the end of a session extending over two or three years, was validated by means of a short Bill. Then, this session, another amending schedule, still further increasing the duties, has been introduced; but we have not been told when it will be dealt with. I understand that the Customs authorities are imposing duties according to the schedules of 1908, 1914, or 1920, whichever may contain the highest rate. Department is collecting duties on three different, schedules? each, case the highest .rate applicable to that case in any of the three schedules.

68,Mr Gregory,"It is applying incorrespondence I had had with the Department, regarding the embargo on scrap steel and scrap iron, I complained in the House on Friday last of the treatment that I had received. As I have said before, I do not know whether there was a justification for this embargo. I have a great objection to embargoes of the kind, and would not give to a. Minister the. power to impose them. When an embargo on exportation is necessary for the building up of any industry, it should be imposed by Parliament, and those in this country owning the product affected should be protected, and should receive a fair price from those who purchase from them. I asked what action the Grovernment had taken, by regulation or otherwise, to provide that the owners of scrap steel and scrap iron would receive a fair price for their metal, and I have never had an answer to that question. In his long statement the Prime Minister carefully ignores it. evaded the point? has done so both in correspondence and in his statement. He says that my recollection of the facts is not accurate. Not having been dealing with this matter I am not able to form a judgment as to whether or not the embargo is necessary, but the Government, having seen fit to impose an embargo, it is their duty to see that the owner of the scrap is protected. I asked the Government whether there is a buyer of tin scrap in Western Australia, and, if so, what action the Government are taking to insure that the buyer pays a fair price to the owner? Surely that is fair. The Prime Minister was rather offensive in his reply to my question. He saidInstead of permitting dealers to export metals to the East to be worked up * y cheap Asiatic labour, the Government insist upon the scrap being utilized locally, provided the users are prepared to pay a reasonable price. A ll I am asking is that the owners shall be paid a. reasonable price; but the Government are taking no action to insure that that is done. The Prime Minister continuedThe export dustry cheap -tThere is no necessity for the sneer contained in that statement or to endeavour to obtain cheap clap-trap popularity; but there is a necessity to see that the owners of the 6crap get a fair deal. If the Prime Minister wishes to hit hard I will do likewise. We have had quite enough scandal in connection with the formation, of the Zinc Producers Association. I have previously described in the House how the BrokenH ill Oompany and the Mount Lyell Company, and other big concerns, were coerced into forming themselves into a combination to give to the Zinc Producers Association, comprising only a few persons, absolute control of the zinc industry, and the right to not only make contracts for the companies, but to also fix their prices for the next fifty years. Honourable members will recollect that about a couple of years ago there was a large accumulation of tin scrap in the hands of jam-makers and others. I remember the Red Cross Societyi n Melbourne circularizing people with a request that they should save their jam tins and blacking tins, and send them to the Society. In this way the Society accumulated about 3,500 tons of tin scrap, for which it could obtain only 5s. to 7s. per ton locally. A request was made for permission to export the scrap to Japan, where buyers were offering up to £4 15s. per ton. I produced in the chamber a sale note from Dalgety and 'Company to a Japanese firm for 500 tons of tin scrap, f.o.b. Melbourne, at £4 15s. per ton. the same time as permission to export was refused the Red Cross Society? afterwards. Gross Society wanting to build up u J apan! talking that nonsense? Instead of £30,000 or £40,000 coming into the country through sales overseas, the scrap was sent to the rubbish heap. Mi. HECTOB LAMOND.'-That is better than building up Japan.

The Prime Minister's lengthy port; they must take their material to a local factory. The first charge to be met would be the cost of treatment; the second charge would be a certain rate of interest on the capital invested in the plant, and then the owners of the scrap would get 75 per cent, of the profit, if any, and the owners of the plant 25 per cent. There was no guarantee that the owners of the scrap would receive any return at all, although they were to be wholly responsible for the cost of treatnoticed, might be construed into a rement, which up to that time had not been very successful, and would have to guarantee the interest on the capital; the Prime Minister had been allowed to make result was that thousands of pounds worth of scrap t in was thrown on to the rubbish tips. If an embargo on any of these articles is to continue, the Government should, by regulation or otherwise, see that the owners receive a fixed price equal to what they could obtain elsewhere; but so far as Western Australia, at any rate, is concerned, no action has been taken to see that the owners get a fair price.

And later on, seeing that on this side of the House there are as many honourable members interested in this particular matter as there are on the other side, and especially as it concerns country districts, we had a deputation to the Postmaster-General. consideration of an instruction issued fro m his Department that all the mail contractors who' had entered into contracts from 1st January of this year should not receive a drought allowance, and he promised that he would go into the matter. In view of the fact that some of these tenders had been submitted as fa r back as August and September last, he said that it was only fair that f u l l consideration should be given to the matter. He seemed to be entirely sympathetic. he was Postmaster-General, he frequently displayed his sympathy towards the mail contractors, but I am inclined to think that he is not a free agent in the matter, and that he has had shackles imposed upon him either by the Treasurer or by the Government, and is thus not able to carry out what he would desire to do. the statement that he can get all the money he requires. that what the Treasurer said was that all the money required for the settlement of soldiers on the land would be provided, but I do not think that such an assurance can be relied on any more than the statement that the Postal Department can secure all the money it needs. It is not only in regard to mail contractors that I condemn the Postal Department. I think its administration is wrong fro m beginSome ning to end. I am glad to note that the Minister( Mr Wise) in control of the Post Office is now in the chamber. If he has a free hand in this matter, I cannot utterly useless. He must accept the f u l l responsibility for the attitude adopted by this his Department towards these unfortunate mail contractors who, as the circular issued to them informs them, can get no I underrelief in the case of contracts dating back to the 1st January last, because the Department says they must have known at the time whether their tenders were payable or not. The man who has lived all his life in the post-office probably cannot be blamed for taking up such an attitude, but the Minister ought to know that the excuse offered is most trivial. The price of fodder in January last was only about half what it was last month. uary last, the price of fodder was from £ 7 10s. to £.9 per ton. w it h me a letter in which the writer states that he purchased chaff in January last at £ 7 10s. per ton, and that it cost him £ 1 6 10s. to £ 1 8 per ton last month. the price of chaff in South Australia was £ 8 per ton, and to that price must be added the cost of removing it to New South Wales. could be purchased in New South Wales in January last at £ 8 to £ 9 per ton, and this mail contractor informs me in his letter that he was able to get it at £ 7 10s. per ton, whilst last month he was obliged to pay £ 1 6 10s. to £ 1 8 per ton. All these facts indicate that the statement that the mail contractors in January last were in a position to know whether their tender would be payable or not was entirely erroneous, and one the Minister should not have sanctioned. ought to be given for an extraordinary drought year; otherwise tenders w ill a l l be double what they have been previously.",30,Salaries Wa R Precautions Ship

It is useless to wink at this matter. Postmaster-General answered my question yesterday by saying that he acquiesced in the policy set out in this circular, but I am at a loss to know his reason for doing so. My interpretation of his attitude is that he does not really acquiesce in this policy, but that he is unable to do anything in the matter, because the Treasurer will not give him the money he requires.

In my young days I set out, as Postmaster-General, to do away with all the sweating on mail routes, and I gave the old contractors advantages of one kind or another that I thought were fair. But immediately I began to do so, every individual contractor or would be contractor who had sent in a tender got his member of Parliament to ask what favouritism was being displayed, and declared that if he bad known these favours were to be conferred' he would have been prepared to submit, a lower tender. Of course, I had immediately to drop all my altruistic notions, arid fall back on public tendering. That is what I mean. Treasurer's explanation is all very fine, but it does not touch this matter at all. The right honourable gentleman was referring to ordinary times. I was speaking about a drought allowance. This is a matter which must be considered on The its merits. If"" there had been no drought there would have been no request for a revision of tenders. It is because there has been an extraordinary drought, which has affected not only New South Wales, but the whole Commonwealth, that tenders have been affected, and the contractors are askin? for some allowance. threatened the tenderer added to his price accordingly, but if another man did I am not blaming the not do so, relying on action in Parliament in order to get equal, where are we? be the case, why, was an allowance made last year on account of the drought?

I am pleased to hear the Minister make such a statement. It is just this one point I wish to see threshed out. The Department says that, in January of this year, the contractor ought to have known whether his tender was likely to pay him; whereas I contend that it was impossible for him to know it. As a matter of fact, the drought did not end in January, bub me explain. continued for six months afterwards.

The honourable gentleman said, in the course of the speech to which I have already referredThe second Pisher Government reduced that guarantee The guarantee required of applicants for telephone lines in country districts that they would provide the whole of any deficiencyto one of 50-per cent, of the deficiency, which was a very great oonsideratonj and I have never failed to give credit to this Government for having made that reduction. not even give it credit for that. the honourable gentleman just now condemned that Government's administration of the Postal Department. post-offices. My experience' as the representative of a country electorate is typical of that of all representatives of rural districts. There is in my constituency a district the residents of which nearly two years ago supplied the poles for a telephone line, p u t up the necessary money, and asked for the work to be carried out. The Department, however, has not yet taken action. It tells these people that there is a shortage of material. The Department is shirking its responsibility. ferring to a request for a line from Cootamundra to a district some miles distant, the name of which I have already supplied to . the honourable gentleman. These people have fulfilled their obligaI t is, at all events, very tions, and yet no consideration is extended to them. I do not wish to labour this question. I shall be content to quote We are the view expressed by the honourable gentleman when he was a private And I like to compare it member. I have never believed that the Postal Department should be a concern r u n for making profits. It ducted in the interests of the people. Those who have to battle in the back country districts are surely entitled to some consideration. When they ask for a telephone line, why should they be required to guarantee to such an unreasonable extent to make good any deficiency on its working? Surely they are entitled to reasonable facilities. If people were not prepared to go into the back country Yes. the Commonwealth would never progress. Dealing with this particular question, the present Postmaster-General said in this House on 15th July, 19151 I desire that it shall be clearly understood that, in my opinion, the Postal Department is not a Department that ought to be run for the purpose of being made to pay. when are we to have an announcement that applicants for country telephone lines will not be required to make good any deficiency, as under present conditions? that we had decided to ask them to pay only 25 per cent, of any deficiency. orable gentleman, in this speech, went on to say\ In respect of allowance The Department was established for the purpose of furthering the social and commercial intercourse of the people, and the places where the services of the Post Office are mostly required, and are of most .valae to the individual, are in those country districts where the Post Office does not pay, and where it probably will not pay for very many years. The large surpluses made in the cities could not be better expended than in giving better postal communication to country districts, and I hope that we shall soon reach the time when, wherever there is a reasonable settlement, the people tliere will not only have a decent mail service, but decent telephonic communication as well, without their being called upon to contribute anything by way of a guarantee.

When he was shown by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) how he could take effective action, he apparently had no desire to hurt the Government; but I do not content myself with adopting such an attitude. I now wish to refer to a postal matter which affects all the country from Sydney southwards to Albury, and I do so because it is a concrete example of the hardships inflicted on country residents. Country mails close in Sydney at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and a letter posted at, say, five minutes to 5 o'clock on the Tuesday is delivered at, for example, Wagga, next morning; but if a letter be posted at five minutes past that hour, it is not delivered at the latter place until the following Thursday. honourable member if he were representing the postal employees in Sydney! bhat the blame is put on to the unions, but I am going to suggest a remedy for the anomaly which involves no union trouble at all. A fast mail train leaves Sydney at five minutes past 10 o'clock at night, but it is not utilized for carrying the mails, which are sent on by a slow newspaper and goods train at five minutes past 2 o'clock in the morning. Sir reason for that? It is in order to give the men an hour off. that the responsibility is put on to the shoulders of the men, but no private company in any part of the world would conduct its business on such lines. The goods train in the morning takes about twelve hours longer to do the journey than does the fast mail train. The Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) tells us that this delay is caused in order to give the men an hour off-that if they were kept on duty u n t i l 7.30 p.m. they would kick up a row. But the present arrangement does an in j u r y to thousands of people, I have who have to wait twenty-four hours longer for their mails; and if the staff at the present time would raise any complaint about being kept at work, and allowed f u l l overtime rates, could the staff not be increased? economy ? economy to cause injury to thousands of people.

169,Mr Lavelle (Calare) [ 4 . 3 0 ],"Ithose mail contractors in the droughtstricken areas whose contracts commenced prior to 1st January this year. This decision had been arrived at after three or four months' consideration, and after the Department had received scores of letters from, members of the House-in fact, after the Department had been flogged into action by the members of this side. The Postmaster-General informed the deputation that an allowance having been decided upon, he would see that payment was expeditiously made; but, so far as I have been able to ascertain from the mail contractors in my electorate, not one, after two months have gone over, has received any drought allowance this year. The Postmaster-General decided that the cases of mail contractors whose contracts started from the 1st January. would be considered on their merits, adding that, if any contractor put in a contract, say, five or six months before the end of the year, he probably would not be in a position to know what the conditions were likely to be at the beginning of this year and onwards, and, no doubt, an allowance would be granted. But, as a result of letters sent to me, I find no instance in which any consideration has been given to men whose contracts started at the beginning of the year, irrespective of what time they put in their tenders. Here is the reply from Mr Young, Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, dated 20th August, this yearW it h reference to the communication presented by you from MrW . Carbary, mail conhonorable gentleman will run his own Detractor, G/oolma, asking for further assistance partment. The Treasurer stated to-day, as owing to the cost of fodder, I have to intimate on half-a-dozen other occasions, that he has that, as lie must have. been in a position to never yet refused the Postmaster-General's know whether or not the price at which hetendered for the service from 1st January, Department money required by the head of 1920, would pay, lie is not entitled to any that Department. I hope, therefore, that drought allowance. His request cannot, tlierethe Postmaster-General will see that an adefore, be acceded to. When this man put in his tender he could and that the payments are expedited. buy chaff at less than £10 a ton, whereas, to-day, although the drought has been broken in the district for about two munication is a crying grievance in every months, he has to pay over £20. It is part of Australia, and I hope that the only reasonable to assume that his tender Department will give earnest considerawas put in at the least a couple of months tion to the needs of the people in this before the end of the year, but even supmatter. If any section of the community posing it was delivered in the last week deserves more consideration than another of December, it was then reasonable to in the supplying of telephones, it is that assume that chaff would not go higher in section which lives' in the inland districts price, or that the drought would soon be of Australia, where the conditions of life broken. I am of opinion that the Deputy are far from pleasant. More brightness, Postmaster-General in Sydney has dehappiness, and contentment might be liberately set his mind against granting given to these people if the Department auy allowance where contracts commenced would provide them with adequate postal from the beginning of this year, although there is no doubt that in the case to which I have referred, and all similar cases, an allowance should be granted. There is another section of mail contractors who happen to live in parts of the State which have not suffered from drought, but where they have to pay an additional price for chaff, owing to the fact that practically all the rest of the State was suffering. It is impossible to run mails with grass-fed horses; they must have chaff and grain; and even if it should happen that there is an ample supply of grass to keep ordinary stock alive, it does not follow that there is sufficient suitable fodder for mail purposes. As the result of the drought which prevails over practically the whole of the remaining portion of the' State, these men are penalized, also. The -Postmaster-General, I repeat, promised to give the mail contractors consideration, but, so far as I have ascertained, none has yet been shown to them. The Department should realize its debt, and that of the settlers, to the mail contractors. In a great many instances, persons living in outlying parts are subsidizing them to enable (.hem to keep going, notwithstanding that they themselves have been so hard hit. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see that his .Deputy for New South Wales gives mote consideration to the request made to him. I might say that I hope that the quate allowance is paid in every instance, The lack of adequate telephone comand telephone communication. On the eve of an election, some persons term the men and women of the country the backbone of Australia, but, after the election, they leave these people in isolation and loneliness, without adequate means of communication. I hope f i a t the Department will get to work immediately, and see that the grievances to which I have called attention are rectified [4.39] I am sorry that the amendment has been moved, because it prevents us from discussing a number of matters affected by the administration of Ministers other than the Postmaster-General. sion now. be a division when the amendment has 1 been discussed, but the discussion of it may not conclude until the small hours of the morning. The action taken is a selfish one, and, if for no otber reason, I shall vote against the amendment. The affairs of the Postmaster-General's Department are admittedly in a deplorable state. Some of the defects are due to the war, and, as I and many other members have said, Australia will not enjoy the services that she should have until, the funds at the disposal of the Postmaster General have been enormously increased. Another thing needed is the abolition of tbe centralized administration of Melbourne. CouldI control the actions of the Postmaster-General, I would insist on his spending half his time in States other than Victoria. I have before me some startling figures indicating the advantages that Victoria derives through Melbourne being the temporaryseat of government. These figures were given in another place in reply to a question, and have to do with the applications for the instalment of telephones that are awaiting attention. Let me quote the figures for two States only. closedKew South WalesSydney ... 517 Suburban ... Country districts ... Totals VictoriaMelbourne Suburban Country districts Totals So that in Victoria the number of applications awaiting attention is less than half the number in New South Wales. Melbourne is not so large, nor so important, a city as Sydney, but the difference in size does not justify the facts to which I have just drawn attention. provinciality of your observations. dence of provinciality is in the figures themselves. The honorable member is one of those who is trying to prevent New South Wales from having the Federal compact carried out, and the Seat of Government removed to .the Pederal City, so that this Parliament may not continue to be shackled by Victorian influences. The return from which I have quoted demands the serious attention of all members representing New South Wales constituencies. Excuses founded on the war, the shortage of material, droughts, and the like, do not avail to explain the facte. The figures show that when material is available it is used in Victoria, and that New South Wales applications do not receive the same treatment as applications made in this much-favoured State. The position of affairs would be bad enough if the two States contributed equally to the revenue of the Post Office; but between 40 and 50 per cent, of the money that is expended is contributed by New South Wales, and considerably more than 50 per cent, of the available money must be spent in Victoria. A trip through Queensland would open the eyes of the Postmaster-General to the real difficulties of Australia. Victoria is a small State, which one could almost walk across in a couple of days, but the Department has to provide means of communication for States as big as Queensland, where the honourable member for Grampians has his far-flung domains; and I am surprised that, deriving so much This is the state of affairs disfrom that State, he should take up the cudgels in defence of the parochial administration which favours Victoria. ... 879 against any State in Australia. ... 5,166 ing administration that discriminates against New South Wales and in favour ... 347 of Victoria, in the way I have shown, ... 1,104 the honourable member is practically con... 740 demning the State of Queensland.

When the exnearest to the job, and know most about it, should have the right to decide when a work is necessary in the interests of the Department. As to the subsidy for telephone services, I think the present Postmaster-General is deserving of thanks for what he has done. I was surprised to hear some of the criticisms of him to-day upon that score, because it must be admitted that one of the first things he did on assuming office was to endeavour to make easier the conditions of people living in the remote districts where the telephone services were unprofitable. When one criticises a Department it is only fair to try to look at it from the point of view of the man in charge. the proposition that the people who go into the remoter parts of the country to develop the land and produce those things which are necessary to our financial stability, should be considered, little reflection is needed to convince one that there must be some discrimination as to the extent to which these benefits can be given ia the different localito take the larger and broader vision ties. man chooses to go 500 miles away from the bigger country centres the Commonwealth must immediately spend £500 cr £1,000 in giving him the same facilities as he would have had had he settled nearer a town. There must be some line of demarcation between the things that can be done and those that ought to be done. But ,when all this is admitted, the policy introduced into the Department a few years ago of attempting to make the post-office a commercial concern was entirely detrimental to the settlement of the country. If we are to ask people to go into the remoter districts we must provide them with facilities, and the proper course is to charge more for the facilities given in populous centres, and apply the profits therefrom to the extension of telephonic and telegraphic services in the districts further out. That is the policy upon which the Post Office should be operated, and if there still remained a claim upon the general revenue for postal facilities, Parliament should be anxious to see that the Postmaster-General had . sufficient money to enable him to carry the benefits of civilization to the remoter districts. rise to support the amendment in favour of giving increased mail and telephonic facilities in country districts and the granting of greater concessions to mail contractors, who have been placed in a most unfortunate position owing to their contracts having covered a period of severe drought, which could not 'have been anticipated by them when the contracts were made. First of all, I desire to express my regret that' an entirely foreign matter has been imported into the discussion in the shape of an unprovoked and unjustifiable attack upon the State of Victoria and its people. The professed justification for this attack is some statistics which show that there are more applications for telephones which have not been supplied in New South Wales Whilst everybody will endorse than there are in Victoria. The explanation of this state of affairs given by the honourable member ior Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) is, apparently, partly . that the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) is a Victorian, and also that practically everything in the 'Central Department of the Post Oflice is seen solely through Victorian eyes, and that there is no one We cannot say that because one which the honourable member for Hia-. warra always has taken, andj no doubt, always will take. AlthoughI have not been a member of the House as long as has the honourable member, I have some recollection of past Postmasters-General, and it will be interesting to refresh the memories of honourable members as to the States from which these Ministers came. Of course, it is obvious that a large number of the telephone applications which have not been met were overdue before the present Postmaster-General assumed office. It will be remembered that up till December last the PostmasteTGeneral, an exceedingly able and efficient Minister, was Mr Webster, the then member for Gwydir, in New South Wales, and practically the whole of these overdue applications accumulated while he held oflice. It therefore seems unreasonable to blame the present Victorian Postmaster-General for the present overdue accumulations. And as regard the past, I find from the Tear-Book that the Postmaster-General in the first Federal Administration was the late'Lord Forrest, of Western Australia, who was succeeded by the Hon. J. G. Drake, who came from Queensland, and later, Sir Philip Fysh, who was a Tasmanian re-",38,Joseph Cook D O You Know The Have Much Pleasure I N Seconding The

They were men of wide vision and mighty capacity, who were able to handle these Australian and almost Imperial problems in a way which the honourable memibar for Illawarra apparently thinks that no Victorian could do. In Mr Deakin's first Administration the Postmaster-General was again Sir Philip Eysh. When Mr Watson formed his first Ministry the Honourable Hugh Maihon, from Western Australia, took control of the Postal Department. He was not one of those narrow-minded and short-visioned Victorians. In the fourth Eederal Administration the Postmaster General was the Honourable Sydney Smith, who came from the State of New South Wales.

The Postmaster General in the first Fisher Administration was the Honourable Josiah Thomas, yet again a representative of the great State of New South Wales. I regret that that gentleman is no longer a member of this Chamber, but he graces the proceedings in another place.

Of course, the present Postmaster-General is a Victorian, as we all know, but I have shown conclusively that there is not the remotest justification for the narrow minded charge, the most absurdly ridiculous and trumped-up implication that the destinies of the Post Office have suffered in the past or are suffering at present by being placed in the hands of Postmasters-General representing Victorian constituencies. Now, having shown that the omissions of the Department are not in the remotest degree due to the fact that its administration has been in the hands of honourable members representing any particular State, I approach the question raised by the honourable member for Hume, that of giving relief -to mail contractors who took up their contracts as from 1st January of this year. said in defence of the attitude of the Department that when the contracts were entered upon, the tenderers knew that the drought was in progress, and no doubt took into consideration the cost of feedinc their horses. I maintain, however, that it was impossible for any one working stock in the interior of Australia on 1st January last to take a contract based on the existing cost of fodder in the belief that, if the drought continued, he could carry it on profitably, and I doubt very much whether a contractor would make any profit on a contract for five years to cover the losses sustained during the last six months. Robertson ( Mr Fleming) knows well that the people living in the interior of Australia are a sanguine, optimistic race, and that they would not have taken on the confracts unless they believed that the drought would break up almost immediately, or that they would be able to continue to buy fodder at the price ruling in January when their tenders were submitted; but we did not get the summer rains we expected, and the price.of fodder, instead of decreasing, went up bo a figure never previously known in the history of Australia. Lucerne hay fetched as much as. £20 a ton.

A few months ago I met two farmers returning from South Australia to the Darling Downs district in Queensland. The people there were paying £17 or £18 a ton for lucerne hay, and it was almost unprocurable; but hearing that fodder was cheaper in South Australia, It is they had sent these two gentlemen to that State to make purchases on their behalf. When the delegation got to Adelaide they found that they could buy chaff at a much lower price than was ruling in Queensland, but they found also that it was absolutely impossible for them to get freight to take it to their State. The position may have been the same in Tasmania. Fodder might have been cheap and abundant in that State, but there was not sumcient freight available to enable it to be shipped to the mainland, where it was so badly needed to keep stock alive.

It covers, I take it, improved telephone and postal facilities for country districts, and also the payment of allowance omcers. As I have no wish to weary honourable members, I do not propose to exhaust all the subjects that have been touched on during this debate; but I would impress upon the House the fact that any money expended on granting improved telephone and postal facilities in country districts, must be a very profitable investment. Ifi t is. not profitable, then there is something ab fault, and action should be taken to remedy it. Residents of country districts, as well as of our cities, are crying out for better telephone facilities, and are quite prepared to pay for them at remunerative rates. Wise), new as he is to office, is ripe in experience of this subject, as has been evidenced by the quotations made this afternoon from his magnificent speeches. I shall simply conclude by inpressing upon the Postmaster-General in the strongest terms that there is every justification for expending, as an investment outlay, very largely increased sums on telephone services for country districts. were to address a few words on the same point to the Treasurer, it might be helpful. Pilate of old, has alreadv washed his hands of "" this just man,"" the Postmaster-General. member surely does not suggest that the Postmaster-General is to be crucified ? whether the process of nailing his fingers to the political cross has not already compeople. This is not the way in which menced this afternoon, and I therefore shall not add to his tribulations. simply implore him to give the fullest and most sympathetic consideration to the terms of the amendment, which I intend to support. no desire to ""stone-wall"" this amendment. therefore, I shall not enter upon a discussion of the genealogies of past Postmasters-General. Having regard to the important work which the people in the out-back districts of Australia are doing for the nation, I feel that more attention should be given to their postal requirements, and to the provision of other facilities for them. Mr Knibbs, the Government! Statistician, tells us-1917-191 8 -that the Australian primary producers contribute 76 per cent, of the wealth of the Commonwealth, and the secondary industries 24 per cent. In that State, to which an honourable member has just referred as one of '' sin, sand, and sorrow'' eyes!"" honourable member interjects, of "" sin, sand, sorrow,"" and "" sore eyes,"" from which I come, the primary producers are responsible for 86 per cent, of the wealth The Postmaster-General( Mr of the State, and the secondary industries for 14 per cent.; in other words, throughout the Commonwealth the wealth created by the primary producers is £56 7s. 6d. per head, and in little Western Australia £56 10s. per head. If we go into city factories we find three or four telephones, one in each room, so that there may not be the inconvenience of running from one part to another, whereas those who produce 86 per cent, of the wealth have to drive 20 miles to. a railway station to see whether their goods have arrived; and, on many occasions, only to be disappointed, and faced with a long, wet, and cold drive home, when a telephone would have saved this valuable time. At the same time, a surplus of £500,000 resulted last year from the working of the Postal Department of general revenue, and is devoted to other purposes than postal extension, although the Department should be conducted solely as a service in the service of the real statesmanship should apply the I money; and the present ""cheeseparing"" must cease. I am not saying anything against the present .Postmaster-General( Mr Wise); indeed, conditions have been somewhat liberalized since he assumed office, though they are still cramped.

235,Mr Prowse,"In that land, as thethe provision of facilities for those people who are the most likely to l if t the burden of debt from our shoulders. I suppose I have written 150 applications to the Department for telephones for the homes in the back blocks of Western Australia, and of these about 2 per cent, have been granted. My communications have been answered courteously, and, in explanation of the lack of telephonic communication, it has been explained that there are not sumcient people in the localities concerned. But do the Government desire to have cities in these country places? Are we to wait for a congested population before a modern time-saving invention is applied to enable us to compete with other countries? It would be infinitely better to add another halfpenny to the cost of our postage stamp in order to provide these postal facilities, which undoubtedly would prove reproductive. No longer ought a profit to be made by means of a Department which should be administered solely in the service of the people. -Some mail contractors are placed at such a disadvantage at present that they cannot fulfil their contracts, and they should be given some consideration. Fortunately the land they speak of as one of ""sin, sand, and sorrow"" is so fertile that we have not suffered from drought; indeed, we could supply the droughtstricken eastern States with fodder. I support the amendment, not in the interests of my own State, but because it is right and reasonable that consideration should be given to the conditions under which these mail contractors work, and that the rural postal services should be rendered efficient. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) is an authority on all Australian matters, but when he says that he has never known two and a half years of good seasons in Australia, he makes a statement capable of doing more damage to our financial institutions than any that could be made. to tell lies? lies, as the honourable member knows. There' is not the slightest doubt that every derogatory statement of that kind will be cabled to London, and Australia [162] will be again represented as a droughtstricken country, whereas it is one of the finest in the world. As a matter of fact, Australia at the present time is suffering from too much water. In South Australia some £2,500,000 is being spent in drainage work which, when finished, will render the State one of the most fertile in the Commonwealth, if not in the Empire. A t a time like this, when we require money, statements such as that made by the honourable member for Grampians ought'not to be allowed to go forth and reach the ears of those who lend money. The Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) has duties of the greatest importance, and I think he is one on whom we can rely to perform them. As pointed out already, all our previous Postmasters-General came from New South Wales, and there is no doubt we had a very good one in the person of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman). Now we have the present Postmaster General, who is alive to the fact that we must have postal facilities, and all he requires to provide them is money. Previous Postmasters-General did very good work indeed; so good, indeed, in my constituency, that, when we get telephonic communication between Mt. Gambier and Adelaide, our system will be about complete. Apparently, whenever it is thought fit to economize, the Postal Department is selected as that in which to begin, though it is the very last place where there should be any lack of expenditure. People must have telephonic and telegraphic communication and general postal facilities in the cheapest form; and until these are provided we cannot blame r>eople for electing to remain in the big cities. Given good roads, schools, good mail services, with telegraphic and telephonic communication, and other conveniences, we should find our young men and others quite willing to settle in the country. It is to that end we should work, instead of wasting so much time in idle talk here. We have been sitting now for three months and have practically done nothing, and, under the present system, I am afraid we should do no more if we were to remain here for three years. If I had my way I would put a stiff time limit to speeches, so that we might get on with the work of the country.

I am glad to hear the honourable member for Barker( Mr Livingston) advocate elective Ministries, with the object of obtaining some ' ' t a l e n t ' ' from this side of because the revenue from them is not the House; and the protest made by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) shows the necessity for the adoption of some such suggestion, or, f a i l i ng that, turning the Labour minority into a majority . The amendment is very appropriate in view of the many protests and applications sent by mail contractors in the district I represent to the Postal Department. In a number of cases the Department has recognised the disadvantages under which these mail contractors suffer and has afforded some sort of relief. The telephonic and telegraphic facilities in my electorate are by no means what they should be, or what they were. They have been reduced to such an extent that protests are continuously being made, but, from what I hear, from other honourable members, that is characteristic of the postal service throughout the country. ston), who is a Government supporter, is better off. why that constituency should happen to be a postal paradise. The Postmaster General( Mr Wise) knows that prior to his taking office I several times emphasized the necessity .for the extension of postal and telephonic facilities in the country; indeed, ab various times during the life of the last Parliament, even Government supporters threatened the Government because of their lack of such facilities. The promises of the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ), when Acting Prime Minister, in this regard have not been carried out, for the curtailment of services still goes on, while there has been a reduction i i i the remuneration paid to post-office attendants. off. easily f a l l off if , as in my own electorate, between Wentworth and BrokenH ill , a stretch of country of about 55 miles, is left w it h no facilities for the carriage of correspondence. Prom time to time, members representing country constituencies are informed by the Postmaster General's Department that, unless the residents within a certain area are prepared to subsidize the existing postal facilities, these will be cut off or reduced, sufficient to carry them on. Thus country residents are asked to pay out of their own pockets for conveniences that are part of the ordinary requirements of civilization. There is no sense in thus penalizing those who earn their living in the back-blocks. Such action discourages them from remaining there, and others from going there. As I have pointed out in other speeches, the Department took upon itself to reduce postal services at a time when, above all others, the people were interested in obtaining news speedily, that is, during the war, when most radical alterations were made. While on my feet, I wish to draw attention to the fact that information respecting weather conditions is not posted on the postal premises at BrokenH i U . That city is the centre of a fairly big pastoral district, West Darling, which contains quite a large number of graziers and others engaged in pastoral pursuits. These persons are unable to obtain at the BrokenH ill post-office information regarding weather variations, which have a I do not know profound effect on their industry, because they govern operations like the shifting of stock. In a letter, a copy of which has been sent to the Department, a correspondent saysFor many years past when rain does fall in this dry area, the fact bas been made known to the pastoralists, the stock agents, and the public at the local telegraph office. The registrations at tbe telegraph and telephone stations have been freely issued. These records have been of important value and equal interest to all concerned in the pastoral industry in the far west. They have facilitated business, and have helped to assist pastoralists to move stock from place to place to meet the changes of weather. These movings were, and are, not of individual importance only, but concern the whole of the West Darling pastoral industry, a vital factor in not only the State's, but Australia's economic welfare.",44,Smith Th E Honourable Australia That Money Goes Into The

255,Mr Wise,"This is not "" the followingI do not consider that the Department of the Postmaster-General is to be regarded as an ordinary commercial undertaking. Not long after I assumed office I -was waited upon by a large deputation of members representing country constituencies and of honourable senators, to which I quoted the remarks made by Mr Deakin, when Prime Minuteri n 1908, in reply to an attack made on the Post Office. I heard his speech, and it expressed my own views on the subject of Post Office management and the reasons which should govern its administration. Mr Deakin said in effect that the Post Office was not lutely impossible. established to produce a money return for the Government as an ordinary revenueearning Department; that its object was to promote social and commercial intercourse among the people. Prom that it naturally followed that country districts would be given services quite disproportionate to the amount of revenue they contributed. I myself have given credit both here and in reply to deputations, to Ministers and Governments that have made concessions to country districts. I have said that it was the first Pisher Government that made the original concession regarding country trun k telephone lines. Previously the people of a district had to guarantee a certain revenue from such 1 a line, and to u,p the whole of any deficiency between the required and the actual receipts. That Government at first undertook to pay 25 per cent, of that deficiency, the people in the country to contribute on the 75 per cent, basis. Just prior to the 1910 election, the Government reduced the country people's contribution to 50 per cent., which remained u n t i l this year, when, in order to carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) at the last general election, that every possible facility would be extended to country districts, special concessions weTe made. There is no excuse for any honourable member saying that he did not know of them, because every honourable member was furnished with a copy of the concessions that have been granted in regard to both mail and telephone services. adequate. to render every service for nothing, I do not think they can be regarded as in adequate.

Distance does not trouble us much in this State. If we had to deal with only Victorian distances, we would not have much trouble in making the country lines; but we cannot grant fifty or sixty people in a Victorian district telephone communication, and deny it to 200 or 300 people in remote districts of the larger States like Queensland and Western Australia, where the erection of 200 or 300 miles of line may be involved. We can only have make one policy for the whole of Australia, and that is to lay down all lines upon the same conditions. These are the concessions that we have made in regard to telephone services1. In the case of lines which are estimated to yield within eight years an annual minimum revenue covering an amount sufficient to provide for the cost of operating the line, plus 10 per cent, of the cost of constructing the line, and supplying the instruments, or where the estimated cost of a line does not exceed £100, no guarantee or contribution will be required from those concerned. 2. In the case of lines which are estimated to be unfinancial on erection, but which are estimated to earn the minimum revenue, i.e., an amount which will cover the cost of operating the line, plus 10 per cent, of the cost of construction and supplying the instruments, within a period of seven years, the Department will bear 75 per cent, of the difference between the estimated revenue and the minimum revenue if those concerned pay down an amount equal to 25 per cent, of the deficiency for the first two years and enter into a bond guaranteeing to make good a like proportion of the loss for a further period of five years if necessary.",46,Smith Th E Honourable Australia That Money Goes Into The

263,Mr Wise,"No. I tell the House,3. Lines which are not likely to be financial on erection and which are not estimated to earn the minimum revenue within a period of seven years will be erected by the Department on those interested making a contribution in cash, labour, and/or material to the extent of 25 per cent, of the estimated annual deficiency capitalized at 10 per cent., the Department bearing 75 per cent, of the deficiency. 4. In cases where these lines prove financial after three years' experience, refunds will be made to those interested, who will also get credit for surpluses under certain conditions. Where lines prove financial at the end of the agreement period, the amount contributed, 'together with interest accruing thereon, is refunded to the persons concerned. 5. Steps are being taken to obtain as quickly as possible the necessary material, and when this has been obtained preference will be given to lines which have already been approved, but which the Department has been unable to erect owing to lack of funds. Some time must be allowed in which to obtain the necessary material. A copy of that notification was supplied to every member of .the deputation, and to every other honourable member who desired it . In regard to mai l services, honourable members w ill recollect that, at the beginning of this year, we received protests from many districts to which circulars had been sent, stating that the tender for the following three years would be so much, and that unless the people were prepared to contribute a certain amount, the service would be discontinued. ThatI regarded as a very .great hardship, and we overcame it by introducing the following conditions, as from 1st July lastNEW MAIL SERVICES. When the frequency of the service is once a week, or less, and the distance does not exceed 75 miles, and five residences or ten adults permanently benefit, the Department will bear all the cost, if the amount is reasonable. If, however, the lowest offer is unreasonable, the Department will call on the residents, to provide a service at a reasonable cost, 'or pay the difference. Twice a week. When the cost exceeds the revenue, the Department will bear the whole cost, if the difference between the cost and the revenue does not exceed 50 per cent, of the revenue. If the loss exceeds 50 per cent, of the revenue, the Department to bear 75 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion of the deficiency which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater; the residents to contribute the balance providing such contribution exceeds £10, but if under £10, the Department to bear the whole of the loss. Three times a week. When the cost exceeds the revenue, the Department will bear the whole of the cost if the deficiency does not exceed 50 per cent, of the revenue. Ifi t exceeds 50 per cent, of the revenue, the Department to bear 65 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion thereof which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater; the residents to contribute the balance with a similar provisio as in the case'of the twice-aweek frequency. More than three times a week. Same conditions as for a three times a week frequency, with the exception that the Department will bear 55 per cent instead of 65 per cent, of the deficiency, or that proportion thereof which equals 50 per cent, of the revenue, whichever is the greater. Cost of receiving-offices not to be debited against the service. Intermediate receiving-offices not to be established on non-paying services, where fhe residents to be served can be given reasonable facilities by means of a free bag, delivery into roadside boxes, or by private bag. If a tender reasonable for the service to be performed, taking local conditions into consideration, no contribution to be required. If the tender is unreasonable, a contribution to be asked for. Those conditions are a great improvement upon those obtaining before 1st July last, and I think ib is unfair to say that f a c i l i -' ties to the country districts have not been extended by the present Government. Much of the trouble in connection w i th telephone services, both trunk lines and private services in the cities, is due to the circumstances arising out of the war. .During the last two or three years we have been handicapped, not only by the shortness of money, but also by the cost of material and the difficulty of getting it at all. Even at the present time, for t ordinary galvanized wire, when we are able to get it , we pay £ 6 5 per ton, as against the pre-war price of £12 per ton. Honourable members will see, from that one item alone, that the cost of installing and extending services has increased enormously, and the expenditure of the Department has grown accordingly. H y predecessor in the last financial year had the misfortune to experience one of the worse years since the outbreak of war. The Government were unable to spare money for the Postal Department as they wished, just as they were unable to find money for expenditure in other Departments. There was, necessarily, a general cutting-down of the Estimates in aU directions. This year I have been more fortunate; at the very earliest opportunity the Treasurer gave me authority to call for tenders involving a very large amount of money. If I had been prepared for this debate, I could have told honourable members the exact amount represented by the tenders which we have already accepted. Of course, it will take some time ior the material to be supplied. dred people in Sydney are waiting for telephones. orable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) quoted figures which show that on 1st July over 9,000 people throughout Australia had applied for telephone services and were still waiting to be supplied. Many of them will have to wait a considerable time longer. Those who are seeking connection with the North Sydney exchange will have to wait, from the time the new switchboard was ordered^ about fourteen montohs before they get any remedy at all. The tender has been .placed abroad, and foreign contractors for this class of material will not bind themselves to deliver within any specified time. getting material in Australia? orable members may have read in the press recently that after a tremendous amount of work, the United States of America is just overtaking telephonic and telegraphic arrears which accumulated during the war. They will understand that until those arrears are overtaken American manufacturers will not be sending , any material to other countries. We anticipate getting the switchboard for North Sydney within about ten months, and a further three or four months will be occupied in installing it . All the applications for telephones which have not been met are held up for one of three reasons: Either the switchboards in their districts are full and we have to wait for other switchboards, or they are in localities where the telephone line is carried in cables which are full and we have to wait for a fresh supply of cables, or they are in districts where the telephone lines are carried by wires on poles and we have to wait for a further supply of wires. Orders have been placed for considerable quantities of these various materials, and until they come to hand, we can do nothing at all. So far as the Treasurer is concerned, the only question he has asked, when I have requested monev, has been as to whether the amount can be expended within the financial year. He has pointed out that it is useless to load the Estimates with votes for works if there is no possibility of the requisite material earning to hand within the financial period. That is the only limitation placed apon the Department in regard to the extension of telephonic and telegraphic services. Tenders are being called or nave been accepted for all requirements, and we are endeavouring to obtain the material as quickly as possible. Both honourable members and the public will have to possess themselves in patience, because no matter what is said or done, we cannot move more quickly than we are doing at the present time. material apply also to wireless? gree, but wireless is a very big question. I shall make only a passing reference to the miserable parochial remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra. is no possible reply to them. orable member thinks that everything a man does is coloured by the State in which he resides.

I maintain, emphatically, that the three Victorian Postmasters General who have preceded me in the office, including Mr Mauger. who was in control of the Department for a few months, and whose name was not mentioned by the honourable member for Grampians, did not care whether applications came from the east, west,or north', from Tasmania, Western Australia, or any other State.

If one State is more progressive than another, and has a greater population, we would naturally expect it to have a larger number of applications than would be received in a smaller State. therefore is that New South Wales is two and a half times more progressive than Victoria. means to imply that. ber claim that New South Wales is not two and a half times more progressive than Victoria? No; he will not answer that question. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, complaints have been made by honourable members about the allowance paid to postmasters and postmistresses who are in charge of receiving and allowance offices. Every Postmaster-General finds that it is a most difficult matter to deal with these people. posed to live on the allowance they re' ceive ? sible to pay a living allowance in all these whatever for the risk of contingencies, offices. The idea has always been that they should be attached to shops, and premises occupied by people with other means of earning a livelihood, and who thus may get a fair remuneration for the work they do for the Post and Telegraph Department, which is merely an adjunct to their other work. Unfortunately, however, in many cases these offices have fallen intothe hands of women who have no other means of obtaining a livelihood, and it is on their behalf that representations are made by honourable members,, who, however, are not prepared to recommend that for these small post-offices an adequate living allowance should be paid. There is hardly one of these officers who is not being paid more than the amount of revenue derived from the office. not be some increase in the allowance because of the increased cost of living? fortnight ago, the Government have agreed to increase the allowance paid to these offices by £67,000, based upon the principle of making some recompense for light and accommodation. It is certainly a small increase, but in many cases it will be a welcome one. age will that increase represent? memory; but it is based on a certain amount per week, according to the size of the office. General of opinion that fifty or sixty residents in a certain district should be deprived of postal facilities if there is not I do not think the Minister sufficient revenue from the allowance office? be paid to do the work in that office. done is quite different from the payment of a living allowance. The drought allowance for mail contracts is another matter of considerable difficulty. We must remember that contracts are entered into as the .result of tenders. As the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) interjected, one man puts in a tender at a price which he thinks will cover all possible contingencies, whereas another man puts in a much lower price, making no allowance believing that he can rely on the Government to make up to him any loss that he can show. One has to be careful in giving assistance in such circumstances, because it is a matter that strikes at the very root of the system of tendering. If a man knows that he can get his loss made up to him by the Government, he submits a tender at a lower price, and secures a contract over a man submitting a price to cover contingencies. Consequent upon the severe drought which prevailed in New South' Wales and Queensland last year, the sum of £25,000 was made available by Cabinet for the purpose of assisting mail contractors in those States. The maximum increase of subsidy in any case was not to exceed 25 per cent., and the period for which the increases operated was from the 1st January, 1919, to the 31st December, 1919.

287,Mr Wise,"But payment for workamount paid to those mail contractors was approximately £18,000. However, since these payments were made, drought, conditions have, to a large extent, continued in New South Wales and Queensland, and, in the circumstances, it has been decided to afford further assistance to mail contractors in the drought-stricken areas whose contracts were entered into prior< to the 1st July, 1919, and where it is shown that such assistance is warranted. The assistance will cover the period from the 1st January, ,1920, to the 30th September, 1920, and it is estimated that the amount required will be about £14,450. Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) asked why the. allowances should not be granted to those contractors whose contracts commenced on the 1st January of the present year, and the answer given was that the man who took up a contract on the 1st January of this year had a pretty fair idea-h e was in the middle of the drought then-that he must look forward to drought conditions prevailing, and was not entitled to the same consideration which was extended to a.man who had entered into a contract commencing in the middle of last year. pectedly met 'by a drought. son why the allowance was limited. However, it is for the Treasurer to consider whether there are specially hard cases in which an exception might be made.

I have pointed out that the last concession to country districts in regard to the guarantee required in connection with the construction of telephone lines was made ten The honourable member for years ago, and that we have made a further concession of 50 per cent, in the then existing conditions. I represent a country constituency which, with the exception of part of the electorate of Indi, has fewer railway facilities, and is, perhaps, more inaccessible than any other division in Victoria, and my constituents appreciate very much indeed the concessions that have been made. So far as I can remember, all the applications for telephone services which were held up because of the large contributions which the people concerned were informed they would have to make are now being taken up under the recent concessions. In every case the new conditions laid down by us have been readily accepted, and the people concerned have undertaken to supply the cash, labour, or material required of them by the Department. As the result of these new concessions I do not think that in any one case the contributions which the people were originally told they would have to make have been required. As I said at the outset of my remarks, telephone trunk lines, or town or city services. I can only say in reply that the same conditions apply all round. If a",50,Existing Mails

I do not agreed with the statement once made in a rural district by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), that telephones are a luxury. When he made that statement no doubt he had in mind telephone services in our large cities; but in country districts they are not luxuries, but absolute necessities. One of the difficulties in the way of our complying with applications for new lines at the present time is the heavy cost of material. W it h wire, for instance, costing us £ 6 5 per ton, as against £ 1 2 per ton prior to the war, and the cost of other material having gone up proportionately, it will be readily recognised that we have not the opportunities for extending the service that were offering before the war. Then there is the further trouble that great delay is experienced in obtaining supplies of material. The Department, however, is doing its very best to meet the applications for telephone services now in hand. It is the policy of the Government to assist the country districts in so far as these matters are concerned in every possible way, and honourable members will discover later that that policy applies also in other directions. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Oook) has placed no difficulty in the way of the Department so far as money is concerned. When he is asked to supply funds to enlarge the activities of my Department, his only inquiry is, "" Can you spend the amount for which you ask within the financial year ? If you can, you can have the money."", Honourable members know perfectly well that, although provision is ( made for a large expenditure on the purchase of material, that expenditure is often unlikely' to take place in the .year for which it is provided, because of the difficulty in securing prompt delivery of ma-terial. Some of the material which wasordered as a result of the grant made to the Postal Department in February of last In my own year is only now coming to hand. In the 4 miles beginning of the present year the Treasurer gave me authority to call for tenders for the supply of material to the value of £500,000, but the great bulk of that material will not come to hand u n t i l the the requirebeginning of next year. I repeat that we are doing all that we .can to meet bhe requirements of country districts, and that there is no hesitation on the part of No doubt it does. I the Treasurer in supplying the necessary funds. The real difficulty lies in the fact that we have to wait some time for material to come to hand. . In that respect, we are not singular. Like the rest of the world, we are trying to overtake the arrears which accumulated during the war. anything in regard to the demand for city telephone services? ferred to the difficulty we experience in obtaining supplies. One trouble in connection with the Sydney telephone service, for instance, is the delay in obtaining the large switchboard required for the City North exchange. The contractor whose tender was accepted for the suppiy of that switchboard would not bind himself to deliver it within any specified time. We expect it to arrive, however, within the next ten or twelve months, and an additional three or four months will be spent in putting it in position. We are doing everything within our power to overtake arrears, and to bring all our work up to date. The Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) has said that the reason for the delay in proceeding with the erection of country telephone lines is the shortage of material. If there is an absolute shortage of material, we cannot expect these lines to be b u i l t ; but not one of the many applications for telephone lines in my electorate has been turned down by the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales on the score of lack of material. Such applications have met with the objections that the lines would be too costly; that they would involve too great a loss; or that if they are to be built a proportion of the cost of construction musb be borne",51,Existing Mails

A t the beginning of this session the Postmaster General promised a liberal policy of teleGeneral( Mr Wise) for the splendid phone extensions, and I am disappointed at the failure of the Department to carry out that policy. Many of my constituents are 20 or 30 miles away from the nearest railway station , and, owing to the lack of 1 telephone services, are practically cut off from civilization. Sickness, as we know, enters every home, and when any of these people need the services of a doctor, a ride or drive of 30 or 40 miles has to be undertaken to obtain one. I cannot square my experience with the statement of the Postmaster-General that shortage of material is the main reason why telephone lines are not being constructed, as requested, in. country districts. I wish now to refer briefly to the quescepted by my constituents away back as tion of mail contractors and the drought allowance. I endorse everything that has been said by honourable members of my party in regard to that matter. It is about are dependent upon materials which are time that the Postal Department realized the serious disability under which mail contractors' are suffering. If they do not receive reasonable treatment, and are unable to make their contracts pay, many of those who now have a mail delivered to them once, twice, or three times a week will soon be deprived of such a service. It tralia are greatly indebted to the Deputy is an absolute negation of the policy of the public Departments of the Commonwealth' to say that these men are not entitled to an increased allowance. We have tribunals which fix the price of various commodities, and Courts which make awards as to wages. As the economic position becomes more aggravated, prices are increased and new awards are made. Following up that policy, mail contractors, having regard' to the adverse conditions with which they aTe confronted, should be granted an increase. It seems to me that the Postal Department is a sweating institution. I have had brought under my notice to-day the case of a postmaster in a small country town, who is a returned soldier, with a wife and family, and receives the princely salary of £130 per year. The whole service needs to be looked into. The Government is not doing the fair thing in any branch of the Postal Department. I strongly support the amendment, and hope that it will be carried. Mr Lazzarini. [8.14] I wish to thank the Postmasterstatement he has made to the House.

323,Mr Gabb,"What about the mail serservices, the Government is giving its best to the country at the present anoment; but even those services cannot be reorganized in a moment. Conditions of drought have prevailed in the country, and there are all sorts of hindrances even to the establishment and organization of the vast mail routes of the Commonwealth; but re-organization is proceeding even there, and we are doing our very best to overtake the arrears. It is our purpose and intention to give better and more frequent services in the back country districts. I have all my life been an advocate of good treatment for the back country districts. These instrumentalities are -the very essence of decency, and even livelihood, .to say nothing of comfort and luxury, out there, and any man who thinks rightly of his country, and sees things in their proper setting and focus, must admit that everything that can be done for the country should be done. is a good slogan for you. I affi' afraid I cannot call these things down in a moment. I cannot "" d o it now."" I can only promise that the Postmaster-General will do it as quickly as it can be done. He will do it irrespective of cost and irrespective of anything hut a fair and reasonable consideration for the conditions of the people in the interior. That is the attitude of the Government generally. The rest is a matter of organization, spending money, obtaining materials, organizing those materials, and establishing and re-adjusting the whole of the services asfar as that may be done. I assure honourable members that, so far as the Treasury is concerned, there will be no stint of funds, and our efforts will be limited only by the reasonableness of the matters with which we have to deal, and by the service which we can obtain from overseas. That is the fundamental trouble which is keeping everything back now. One honourable member is concerned about the mail contractors. drought allowance. not free of difficulty. It is of no use to say that there is nothing to be said on the other side, because there is. A t the beginning of this year fresh' tenders were called, in every case, I believe, for a short correct. There is only one thing to do, period, owing to the abnormal conditions obtaining. When these contracts were called, drought conditions obtained, and all the difficulties were thoroughly in sight and well understood. the difference in fodder prices between then and now. I shall not burke anything, but the point I wish to put is this: Here are two contractors at the beginning of the year facing this abnormal condition, of things. One puts in a tender for £100, and the otherj looking at all the conditions surrounding the situation, puts in a tender for £120. He is ruled out, and the man who puts in the lowest tender gets the contract. What is the position to-day ? If we say to the successful tenderer, "" We will give you another £30 on your £100,"" will not the other man who was ruled out because he was sane and wise enough to look at all the conditions, and put in what he bboup-ht a reasonable price, have a right to complain when he finds the other man being paid £130, after his tender for £120 has been rejected? The first thing to do in that case, as a matter of equity, would be to give the contractor the right to surrender his contract, and for us to go on the market again. ""sane and wise"" to accept the £120 tender, and not the lowest tender ? Does not the advertisement say, "" The lowest tender not necessarily accepted?"" 1 been, if there had been some arbitrary being in control of the Post Office, and if there had been no critics in Parliament to trouble him. In those circumstances, he might very well have taken that course; but as surely as he accepted a tender which was higher than a rejected tender, there would have been a storm. the week by sensible men. I have been through this trouble many times.

The Treasurer says he has the money to pay for instruments, and we know that we have the timber and metals and the necessary mechanics here. It shows a lack of organization on the part of the Government that steps are not taken in this direction. I do not blame the Postmaster-General so much, but he should instruct his mechanical engineers to see to the manufacture of instruments. It is a very sim ple matter to take a screw( driver and look at a telephone instrument; but then we are bold about patent rights. We must let patent rights go, if it be necessary, and see that the people of this country are supplied with business facilities. No Government is worth its salt unless it sees that local requirements are met. think America would recognise patent rights here? gow, who has invented an improvement in connection with motor cars, recently visited America in order to patent it. There he was asked where he intended to undertake the work of manufacture, and when he replied '' In Australia'' he was told that if he was going to patent his invention in America he must also undertake the work of manufacture there. The same principle should be applied to patentees in this country. I know, but that is not I should like to know how the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) can justify the removal of letter boxes from thickly populated areas around Sydney-lette r boxes which have been in position for the past twenty years? No excuse can be urged for such We can pay arbitrary action. A motor car passes the sites upon which these boxes were located, and could easily pick up correspondence placed in them. Isi t the policy of the Government to cut down postal facilities? This debate has not been initiated one day too soon. I hope that the Government will see that the letter boxes of which I speak are speedily restored to their original positions. I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney). I have not the time to We were all pleased to hear from the Treasurer that, he is not withholding financial assistance from the Postmaster General. I trust that the latter will avail himself of that assistance to the full, in order that he may provide the residents of country districts with adequate mail facilities, if only for the purpose of compensating them for the lack of telephonic communication which obtains there. The position has became very acute-so acute, indeed, that a previous Postmaster General lost his seat in this Chamber in consequence of it. I am very much afraid that his successor will lose his seat unless a vast improvement is effected in this great arm of the Commonwealth service which so vitally affects our country interests. The position is worse than a scandal. Mail facilities which existed thirty years ago have either disappeared entirely or have been curtailed to such an extent that to-day they are not recognisable. The buildings of the Department are entirely inadequate. I want to draw attenyou tion to one of these at Narrabri, in my own electorate, which was erected with a view to accommodating eight employees, but which to-day houses no fewer than twenty-eight officers.

These were withdrawn by a previous Administration, and thus the delivery of mails has been rendered slower than it otherwise would be. Repeated applications to the Postmaster General only elicit the reply that he cannot see his way to restore these facilPostmaster-General claimed that he had ities. In view of the enormous shortage of telephones which exists ab present, the best thing that the Government can do is to increase our country mail service, in him, and that, as a result, he was order that rural residents may be able to deal with correspondence more expeditiously, and thus secure quicker communication with our towns and cities. The argument adduced by the Treasurer in regard to madl contracts is scarcely a sound one. He stated that one contractor may have contracted to provide a service for £100 a year, whilst another contractor has tendered for it at £120, and that if the successful tenderer were now granted a fodder allowance, his unsuccessful competitor would have cause for complaint. contractors whose tenders were not accepted during the recent drought period have reason to thank their stars for it. The attitude which has been taken up by Ministers to-night, when the numbers are against them, is in vivid contrast with that of the Postmaster General, who, yesterdey, stated that he entirely concurred in the view of this matter which had been expressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General. I do not think the contention thab we cannot manufacture telephones in Australia is a correct one. TheTe are hundreds of returned soldiers undergoing vocational training here, and there is nothing very intricate in the manufacture of a telephone. orable member know that? read the evidence which was given in the Arbitration Court upon that matter. His statement is a libel upon telephone employees. for the Navy can bring forward evidence of a certain character, and twist it to suit himself, but the fact remains that no effort has been made to manufacture telephones in Australia. If we never attempt anything, we shall never achieve anything. So long as Ministers are permitted to retain their positions, and to do nothing, so long will residents in the country be deprived of necessary telephonic facilities. Members of the Government are prepared to go to any length in order to build up surpluses in the Postal Department, and we know that the late made a profit of £500,000. He affirmed that this amount had been paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and kept from prevented from effecting improvements in the service owing to lack of funds. He blamed the Cabinet for having placed him in a false position. He did not admit that he had allowed himself to be placed in that position. But when he knew that country residents were not getting a square deal, he should have resigned his position. That would have brought matters to a head. The position that we are in to-day is the result of funds having been withheld when they were urgently required for the May I say that those development of this particular arm of the Commonwealth Service. I may perhaps be permitted to mention one or two instances of the way in which country residents are suffering. In the electorate of New England, there is a town which thirty-five years ago had a daily mail service from Tamworth, but which to-day has a service upon only three days a week. Take the town of Bingara, in my own electorate. In the municipality there are 1,400 inhabitants, and of this number about 700 live in the town itself. Eor many years there was a letter-carrier in the township, but owing to' the enforcement of a policy of economy, he has been withdrawn. Another ease which may be mentioned is that of Longueville, in the TreaHe should surer's electorate of Parramatta. Thirty years ago there were two mail deliveries there daily, but to-day there is only one delivery. Repeated requests for an additional delivery 'have met with a blank refusal. Notwithstanding that these districts have grown considerably during the period I have indicated, the people were better off thirty years ago than they are now.

To-night the Postmaster-General made a statement, but there was nothing very definite in it. When he approaches the Cabinet upon these matters, we have no assurance that his proposals will not be turned down.

The Postmaster-General was not present when I was referring to the question of travelling post-offices. In view of the fact that the Treasurer has stated that ample funds are available. I would like to know whether he will restore to country residents the facilities which they formerly enjoyed in the shape of travelling post-offices upon mail trains? There was a travelling post-office on the north-west mail from Sydney to Moree which proved a wonderful convenience to the population all along the line. That service was abolished by the last Postmaster General, and thereby the back country districts were made to suffer great inconvenience. Droughts or shortage of material cannot be urged as excuses for the cutting off of this service. That action was taken in pursuance of a policy which must be recognised as false economy. I should like the present Postmaster-General to say that he will re-establish the travelling post-offices. arrange for the conveyance of correspondence between railway stations, and if the means provided are not satisfactory, something else will be done. I am determined that this convenience shall be reOnly a few stored. that the travelling post-offices will be restored ? sary; but if the other means are successful, they will not be necessary. know what other means are contemplated, but I am"" prepared to await the honourable gentleman's scheme, to see if it will redress OUT grievance. If it does not, I hope that he will give, immediately, consideration to the reasonable request of fhe people of the north-western districts of New South Wales, that the travelling post-offices may be restored in order to improve their mail service. I could deal at length with the treatment of the employees of the Postmaster General's Department, but the motion to-night complains of the lack of postal facilities, and the conditions of the postal employees is a proper subject for a separate .discussion, which, on another occasion, might well engage honourable members to the exclusion of all other subjects. The conditions of the employees of this Department are deplorable, and until they have been improved, and the employees are satisfied, efficient service is not to be looked for. The employees are underpaid and overworked. I have already spoken of the application of the third degree at the General Post Office, Sydney, in connection with the employment of telephone attendants. It has come to such a pass that on one occasion a girl was questioned and crossrquestioned for over an hour, until she fell hysterical to the ground, and six other girls had to be carried out of the room, work on the-",59,Moloney Th E Postorders F O R Instruments I N America And

Monaro) [9.5] -We are having a field day in the discussion of grievances, grievance day being, I think, a peculiarly Victorian institution. The Government cannot complain of any backwardness on. the part of honourable members in speaking their minds. There are a number of .grievances which I wish to have redressed, and I propose to speak frankly regarding them. Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) personally, because, having had experience in the oflice that he holds, I know that he does not lie on a bed of roses. He has special difficulties to face, because the war has made it very hard to obtain supplies; but there is a good deal in the complaints which have come from all sides of the House. I resent the statement of two or three prominent members of the Labour party about a deputation from that side of the House. They forgot to say that that deputation followed a general deputation. I had no invitation from them to attend on their deputation.

In many of the offices where the revenue is comparatively small, a great deal of work has to be done, and sometimes at great inconvenience. In some country centres the .persons employed, who are sometimes women, have to get up in the middle' of the night to hand out a bag; and such work should not be paid for on the basis of the revenue received.

I have never been able to understand the policy of carrying mails past the station for which they were intended to the terminus, and then sending them back next day.

The honourable member for South Sydhas made a really solid effort at reform ney ( Mr Riley) has complained of the removal of pillar-boxes and the reduction of other facilities in urban areas. What are those disabilities compared with the curtailment of the facilities in country districts-the closing of post-offices at inconvenient hours and the reduction of mail services? What disabilities are city people suffering compared with those that have been imposed upon country residents ? In any case, there is no comparison between the country and the cities so far as the solid prosperity of the nation is concerned. Where would all the dwellers in the cities be but for the country industries?' About 75 per cent, of the wealth of Australia is derived from honourable member for South Sydney to look at this matter as .a business man, and if he does so, he will see that we cannot afford to dry up the main sources of our national income. The country interests must be fostered and increased by all possible means.

Very often fatalities do occur, which might have been avoided had it been possible to quick time. Hitherto when the extension of telephone facilities to the back country has been asked for, a guarantee has been required by the Department. Now no guarantee is asked, and I am glad that the Postmaster-General is making an honest attempt to Teform the methods of the Department.

They have gone into the back country and wrestled with the forest primeval. parts of my own electorate, where forests stood a few years ago, beautiful farms and smiling homesteads are to be seen today. When the settlers first went there they could not see ten yards ahead of them because of the density of the forest. People who have had the pluck to carve homes out of the wilds in this fashion are entitled to decent facilities, and I am glad that at last the Government are realizing that fact. In regard to allowance and semi-official post-offices, the people who conduct them confer a great benefit upon the settlers. I know that in many instances, although the volume of business is not very large, the people in charge are tied to the offices all day. able member expects them to live on sympathy. in this matter has been effected recently. We know the record of the Postmaster General in this House, and that, as a private member, he advocated the granting of better postal and telephonic facilities to country districts. Deputations have waited upon him in the hope that he would make the best possible effort to carry out the policy he advocated as a private member of this House. I say that the honourable gentleman has honestly attempted to do that. The proof of that is that he has achieved something, and has taken steps in the right direction, which is more than can be said for any Postmaster-General Services have who preceded him. I agree with the honourable member who moved the amendment, that telephone facilities should be extended in the country districts,'and that a drought allowance should be paid to mail contractors. But I point out that the Postmaster-General has taken steps to do those things which he is being blamed to-night for neglecting to do. He gave an assurance some days ago that a drought allowance would be made to mail contractors, and that the money to enable that to be done would shortly be available. When a request is made to the People in the country are not Postmaster-General in this public way to do these things, people outside will not But they do feel that they are unnaturally come to the conclusion that he has been remiss, whilst, as a matter of fact, he deserves our thanks for what he has achieved in the direction desired.

I should like the Government also to give serious consideration to the proposals that have been made for the purpose of carrying mails by aeroplane around the north-west and north-east coasts of this country. The Government should do aU that they possibly can in the interests of the people to make a business proposition of commercial aviation. A big proposal of this sort has been placed before the Postmaster-General and the Defence Department. We have only to look at the maps in Queen's Hall to see the necessity for developing the northern portion of Australia. We cannot expect people to go to those parts unless we give them facilities for readily communicating with other parts of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied with the assurance given by the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise), so strongly endorsed by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), who promises that all funds, in reason, will be supplied. That ought to carry out the definite and liberal policy of the Postmaster-General. If he does not live up to it , we shall have an opportunity of dealing with him' in a little while. that sort of stuff. M. Chanter) I have several times called for order, and honourable members have taken no notice of the call. I ask them to desist from interjecting. That all the words in the amendment after "" the"" first occurring 'be left out with a view to inserting in lieu ""thereof the words:""House approves of the proposals of the Postmaster-General to further liberalize the postal and telephonic facilities in country districts."" I feel sure that the promises made by Ministers to-night will be kept, and tha£ every effort will be put forth to provide the facilities which we have been demanding for country districts. I should think that the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) would accept my amendment. something definite. the amendiment moved by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory). There is no Department under the control of the Commonwealth Government that comes in for more criticism than does the Post and Telegraph Department. It has been held up to ridicule and discussed, both inside and outside this House, ever since Federation was brought about. Quite recently, in another place, a senator described the Sydney post-office and telephone exchange as the worse in the world; but if the discription he applied to it is a correct one, it is the fault of this Par-, liament, and not of the officials of hheDepartment When the magneto exchange was in operation in Sydney, the Government of the day decided to change it to a common battery system, and the officials proposed to install a 3,000-section board, but as the Treasurer of the day cut down the vote by one-half, they were not able to install more than a 1,500-section board, to which it was intended to transfer 1,500 subscribers. But before the work was completed there were 1,500 new subscribers for whom accommodation had to be provided. The Government thereupon voted the money to install a second 1,500section board, but before that was ready there were another 1,500 new subscribers to be accommodated. This piecemeal system was followed until there was absolutely no room in the exchange in which to establish another section board, and it became necessary to put up a second exchange ; but the fault was entirely due to the fact that the Department had been starved for funds ever since the Commonwealth assumed control of it . The present Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) has not been long enough in office to accept any of the blame, and his immediate predecessors are not particularly responsible. The blame is attachable to all the Prime Ministers and Treasurers of the past. According to the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), it is possible to build telephones and telephone exchanges in Australia, and the honourable member would be correct in his assertion",67,Moloney Th E Postorders F O R Instruments I N America And

The honourable member for Dampier( Mr to the war. Before they went, they had Gregory) has referred to the question of wireless telegraphy. I think honourable members are agreed that the Postal Department has quite enough to do without taking over the control of wireless, and that the progress of wireless would be retarded by its transfer to that Department. Wireless to-day comes into touch with four different Departments of the Commonwealth. Department, the Department of the Navy, the Navigation Department, and the Postal Department. It is time that we had a distinct Department for its control. The accountancy work relating to it might be carried out by one of the existing Departments, but if wireless is to be exploited in Australia to the extent that it ought to be, it must be made a dispected to see that proper treatment is tinct branch of the Service. Wireless telephony is rapidly coming into prominence, and by means of it the back blocks of Australia could be linked up. should have a wireless department with a well-equipped laboratory for the carrying out of experiments, and tests designed to further this science. There is no science which is likely to be so applicable to the industrial and general life of Australia as wireless telegraphy and telephony, but the Postmaster-General's Department ought not to be saddled with this new branch when it cannot properly attend to all the business already under its control. It has been stated that the Commonwealth Government paid the life insurance premiums of officers who went to the war, and that they have now been called upon to make a refund. I understand that that demand for -a refund applies only to officers in the Permanent Forces. was made will be kept. monwealth Public Service generally who joined the Australian Imperial Force have not been called upon to make a refund of the amounts paid on their behalf in respect of life insurance premiums. In 1912, there were in the Defence Department in New South Wales four honourable warrant officers-som e of them with over thirt y years' service-wh o were in receipt of a salary of £26 0 a year. The Defence Department offered them commissioned rank, provided that they would accept the minimum rate of pay of £25 0 per annum. The majority of these men went risen to the rank of captain, ""but were still receiving only £250 per annum. One of them returned with several decorations; another, who retired quite recently, had reached the rank of lieutenantcolonel, but was still receiving only the pay of a lieutenant. Still another came back with the rank of major. I refer to Major Lynch, than whom there is no It affects the Defence better instructional officer in Australia. The Department made him a substantive major on the staff, but he is still receiving the paltry salary of £250 a year, which he was drawing in 1912. I have brought his case before the Department, but have received no satisfaction. I make no complaint against the Minister, b u t I hold that the Department might fairly be exmeted out to these men. Major Lynch is to retire in September next, and in reply to an inquiry as to why he has not We received an increase under the new scale of payments, he has been told that, after bwo years' further service, he will receive an additional £ 2 5 per annum.

I congratulate the Government, and I congratulate the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) on the success of the engineering that has taken place in the House this afternoon. I offer these congratulations in all sincerity, because he has succeeded in placing some of those who will support the honourable member for Dampier's amendment in an absolutely ridiculous position, and he will have demonstrated to the electors of Australia that those who support it and do not belong to the direct Ministerial party are dragged at the heels of the Government in the manner depicted by a cartoon published in a certain Sydney newspaper not so long ago.

Another promise which we have made is that we shall do our best to improve the telephonic services in country areas. anywhere that we can get them, and if honorable members opposite know where telephone material can be obtained, I invite them to give us the information. 1 invite the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), who has said that he is an engineer, and who has made asseverations as to the qualities of steel that can be produced here, to come along with that steel, and we will try and use it in the manufacture of telephones. Does he think that we are doing what we can to prevent these services being extended to the people? Why should we? Does a Government invite adverse criticism if that criticism can be honestly avoided ? The supposition underlying all the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite is that the Government are a set of fools who court adverse criticism. I challenge the honourable member for Hindmarsh to bring along the materials of which he has spoken. He says that they are here. Let him' bring them along, and the Government, if it can use them, will buy them at a reasonable price. The Government wish to purchase materials and to install telephones. want them for my electorate, and every other honourable member wants them for his electorate. We have the money with which to purchase them, and if honourable members can furnish these materials they are acting a faithless part to this country if they do nat bring them along. the Postal Department to make these arrangements ? ments? are provided. It is the duty of the Government to get telephones out of the ground. Only we cannot do it. I am sure that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) can do it. But we cannot do it. We shall do our best to get this telephonic material, and to see that the benefit of it is extended to the interior of this country. We shall do all that we have promised to-night as far as that is humanly possible. DoI make myself clear? We shall get telephones content myself with making this statement to my own side of the House, the members of whom are intelligent enough to understand it. gratulate the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) upon having submitted his amendment. During the early stage of the debate upon it , the attitude of Ministers was to turn up their noses and to say in effect, "" Do as you like."" But as the discussion proceeded, their airiness disappeared, so that I am convinced that the time that has been devoted to this matter has not been wasted. In Tegard to allowance postmasters, I do hope that a larger sum than £76,000 will be provided. There are thousands of allowance offices in Australia, and the amount I have mentioned will not go very far when it is distributed amongst so'many officials. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) spoke of the Bulls of Bashan. But whilst there may have been a roar which reminded one of the Bulls of Bashan, there was also I the shriek of the Australian parrot, and there was a bleat from the lambs over there. Like the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), I wish that the electors of Australia could hjave been here to see what was taking place in the chamber to-day. Since the din er -hour, the two Government Whips and another special pleader have been in company with members of the Country party, pleading with them. I have great respect for some members of the Country party, as much respect for them as for any other members of the House, but I must believe my own eyes. I saw the Government Whips and the Treasurer in company with several members of the Country party. As the evening wore on, there was a group of five country members talking together in the corner.

539,Mr Gabb (Angas) [10.54],"I conwere pulled up, and went out, and a meeting of some kind was held outside. In fact, every member of the Country party left the chamber. Then they returned to the chamber, and one of them seems now to be inclined to reverse his attitude. Originally he supported the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), and now he is voting with the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Livingston), the honourable member for Gregory), a complete change of front. When the Treasurer talked of underground engineering and political trickery, he forgot the proverb that "" those who Live in glass houses must Dot throw -stones."" On a recent occasion we, on. this side, were told that if we wished the Country party toassist us in ousting the Government, we should be less rough in our methods. Last time we attacked the Government many members on this side hit the Country party harder than I thought they need have done, but that has not happened to-day. attack the Country party to-day until we saw how they had decided to go. They cannot accuse us of having driven them into the arms of the Government. member allow me? not prepared to allow the honourable member anything. I know how he spoke on the amendment of the honourable member for Hume, and if he does not support the amendment .by his vote, I shall know that my surmise in regard to the Caucus meeting of his party is correct. If , oc the contrary, he stands by what he has said, I shall think him worthy to put interjections to me in the funue, should he wish to do so. Whatever may be said about shortage of materials in excuse for the delays in providing telephone communication, that shortage has had nothing to do with the 1 reduction of the country mail services. To show how the country districts are treated, let me read a letter which I received from a constituent to-day. It was written from South. Australia on the 23rd of this month, and is as follows:I am writing to you for information on beJowpt't. K. half of the Point Pass Vigilance Association on the matter of increased postal facilities, which I hope are not all reserved for the disMahonv, \V. 0. tricts of the members on the other side. liefore the advent of the train we had a daily [163] mail by road. A t first we had a daily train and mail. Since the train only goes alternate days we only get a mail on those days. The most we have been able to get is that the bags go as f a r as Eudunda, on the other days, and we may send in for them and the papers. We suppose that-the postal authorities are keeping the telephone and telegraph revenue in mind. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster), and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) seem to be thoroughly satisfied that they have been able to get from the Postal Department all that they have asked for. puty Postmaster-General of South Australia a gentleman to deal with, but I have not had 50 per cent, of my requests granted. he has got all that he asked for. for Barker said that there was only one thing more that he wanted. That is nob my experience. To send from Point Pass to Eudunda for mails and. papers means to send a distance of about seven miles. If the Country party think that that is proper treatment for our hamlets and villages, I do not agree with them, and if they keep in power the Government that is responsible for this treatment of country residents, they will find that the people who sent them here are disappointed in them.
