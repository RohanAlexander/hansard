For instance, of his second reading speech, say that marriage in one country a marriage between close relatives was a fundamental and enduring institution, and might be recognised but under Australian law such a union would be invalid.

It is for that reason students and lawyers have been kept awake at that the Opposition supports this proposed night grappling with these difficult principles and amendment to the law as a holding operation. rules of international law. The Hague Convention The reason for the need to clarify their status, has adopted a sensible and practical solution to as we have been told by the Attorney-General in this problem. The outcome of the Convention his second reading speech, is that some doubts was, in substance, an acceptance that so far as have arisen as to whether Part VI of the Marriage possible there should be uniform rules throughout Act might leave no room for the State laws to the world. Those rules will be, in effect, codified have a valid operation. The result might be that into Australian law by this Bill.

We are therefore in this unions that are repugnant to our society, the law Parliament legislating to the effect that the State of the place where the marriage was entered into laws remain valid. will govern the validity of the marriage. If a marThere is no doubt that the law should be clear riage was validly celebrated under the law of the and there is no doubt that to make the law clear place of celebration, it will be recognised as valid we have to declare that the validity of the State in Australia. This will mean that in future all laws is not to be compromised or brought into questions relating to the validity of marriages doubt. As I say, the Opposition will support this entered into in Australia, whether by Australian provision for that reason, and support it as a holdresidents or aliens, will be determined by Ausing measure. But what a scandalous situation it is tralian law. At the same time this Bill will give that the law on such a subject can differ from effect to the Convention by requiring Australian State to State. It is obvious from the Bill that in courts to accept as valid any marriage performed some States a child born as the result of these proin another country which conforms with the laws cedures is treated as the child of the woman conof that country. There are some exceptions which cerned, as she is described in the Bill.

For instance, bigamous the woman concerned, but as the child of the marriages will not be recognised. These proposals woman and a particular man. Under other State are sound and the Opposition gives them its laws the child is treated as the child of a particular support. man. These discrepancies in the various State laws I turn now to the provisions of the Bill which are, I suggest, quite ludicrous. There is an obvious deal with a unique situation concerning the legitneed for uniform law on this subject so that the imacy of children. Clause 26 of the Bill deals with status of the children concerned is clear and so State laws affecting children born as a result of arthat their status does not change from State to tificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation.
