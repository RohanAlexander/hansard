8,Mr Fadden,"B y way of preface tois being taken for granted that the commission will control the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. Will you give to the House an undertaking that its rights and privileges shall be adequately protected, if the broadcasting of speeches in Parliament is to be taken over by an outside authority; alternatively, will you investigate the possibility of keeping the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings completely within the control of the Parliament itself, even to the extent of controlling the special station that would have to be built, thus retaining the broadcasting in the hands of trusted officers who are directly responsible to Parliament, just as the reporting staff of Hansard is responsible to it? Will you investigate the question as to the degree to which parliamentary privilege would be affected, if at all, by allowing an authority which is not a part of Parliament itself to broadcast direct to the public all statements made in Parliament? In other words, would these broadcasts be privileged? Will you, if necessary, call together the Standing Orders Committee, with a view to considering amendments to 'Standing Orders in the light of new circumstances which might arise? -The' matters raised by the honourable member are of great importance, and I give the House an assurance that if its rights and privileges are likely to be affected by any broadcasting arrangements honourable members will be informed. It will then be for the House itself to take action to protect its rights. another 5,000 will be discharged out of Whether broadcasts from. Parliament House will be privileged I am not competent to state. It may be"" that the matter would ultimately have to be determined by the courts. In the meantime, I assure honourable members that neither the Australian Broadcasting Commission nor any other body of the kind will take charge of the proceedings of this House. -OCCUPATIONA L LEAVE. please say how many soldiers have been discharged from the Army between the 1st October, 1943, and the 30th June, 1945, and what number and percentage of them have been released to rural indutrics and to other occupations? How many routine discharges because of normal wastage have taken place in the same period? What is the estimated number of discharges for rural workers out. of 54,000 men to be discharged up to the 31st December next, and what other provision has been made for additional discharges on occupational grounds? How many of these will be discharged for rural industries? 1943, to the 30th June, 1945, provision was made for the release of 65,000 men from the armed forces on occupational grounds, and of that number 26,675, or 41 per cent., were released to rural industries. During approximately the same period, routine discharges through norma] wastage from the services have included 12,568 rural workers. It is expected that ; 5.4,000 men to be released from the services during the current half year on long service and other special grounds will include 5,000 rural workers. It is expected that considerable numbers of rural workers will be included among the large numbers of men who will be demobilized during the next few months. Among 10,000 releases from the services now being recommended on occupational grounds are 3,000 men for rural industries. It will thus be seen that 39,243 have already been discharged for rural industries, and it is estimated that the 54,000 by the 31st December next, and an additional 3,000 out of the special 10,000 releases on occupational grounds, making a total of 47,243 for rural industries up to the 31st December next. This does not include a considerable number of rural workers who will be included among the large numbers of men to be demobilized during the next few months, commencing from the 1st October, 1945. demobilization plans has consideration heen given to those university students and members of teachers' training colleges whose studies were interrupted by man-power requirements, and will",17,Broadcasting Sensational Plats Pabliamentakv

Post-war Reconstruction been correctly reported as saying that discharges of service personnel are likely to be retarded because of the shortage of doctors? If so, will the Minister give consideration to the granting of occupational leave to service personnel until final discharges can be effected? made some reference to the shortage'of doctors, which I believe will be a factor limiting the rate at which men will be discharged from the fighting services. The question of whether this difficulty can be overcome by the adoption of a plan for the release of servicemen upon an occupational basis will be considered. who is a soldier on leave has sent me a telegram in which he explains that he has been refused further leave by his commanding officer to carry out urgent agricultural work. This man has had four years service, and I believe that he is classified as B class because of defective eyesight. If I supply evidence to the Minister for the Army that some of the military "" brass-hats "" are sabotaging his direction to grant occupational leave will he deal drastically with such gentlemen? Army on occupational grounds are made only on the recommendation of the manpower authorities, whilst discharges on compassionate grounds are made without reference to the man-power authorities. If the honourable gentleman will furnish the name and particulars of the person he has in mind, I shall give the matter my immediate personal attention. statement just made by the Minister for the Army that, under certain conditions, members of the services are being released to engage in rural activities, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service wheiher it is a fact that the Man Power Directorate has stated that it will not recommend the discharge of any serviceman to engage.in rural activities except in cases of extreme hardship? Is not this direction from the Man Power Directorate at variance with the statement just made by the Minister for the Army? Minister for Labour and National Service, I inform the honourable member that the instruction to which he refers is out of date.

Attorney-General a question regarding the operation of the war-time moratorium regulations insofar as they affect tenancy arrangements. It is said that members .of the forces who 'return from service outside Australia find that the regulations are operating to prevent them from obtaining possession of their own homes if the tenants themselves happen to be servicemen, although they have not been outside Australia, or even away from their own capital cities. Has the Acting Attorney-General any knowledge of this, and is any action being taken to overhaul the regulations so as to ensure that justice is done to men who have served overseas ? cidents of that nature which happened before the war concluded.

Minister for Air expressed tbe hope that these men would be brought back to Australia soon; the first advice received was that they would arrive earlier than is now likely. The explanation is that the Commonwealth Government does not control shipping, hut can only press strongly that vessels be made available. The disposition of ships is controlled by other authorities who decide what requirements are most urgent. As has been intimated by the Minister for Ai r previously, the Government is prepared to do all possible to expedite the repatriation of the men referred to, as well as the wives of Australians abroad.

If he had to depend on me for his livelihood, he would be out of business as a cartoonist. I am not aware that Molnar has done any work for the War Loans Committee. As a member of the artists' colony he imay but have rendered some assistance in that regard, but I shall make inquiries and endeavour to supply a complete answer.

The GovernThat is a brief picture of our war effort Details of actual revenue and expenoatimivtes are given in Statement No. 1, mid details of the year's loan transactions are given in Statement No. 5. Total expenditure was £009,462,000 of which £459,996,000 was for war, compared with £686,532,000 and £544,416,000 respectively in the previous year. War expenditure overseas was £35,600,000. Excluding taxation collections of £33,432,000 reimbursed to the States, taxation yielded £304,487,000, and other revenue £38,935,000, making a total of £343,422,000. After meeting civil expenditure, revenue available for war was £193,956,000, leaving a balance of £266,040,000 which was financed by £234,040,000 of borrowings from the public and by £32,000,000 of Treasury balances. Last year the treasury-hill issue was not increased. With the satisfactory progress of the war, the strain on the Australian economy during the year showed some easing. The number of men in the forces fell from 660,000 to 600,000 and the value of Australian output used for war purposes also declined. However, this decrease of the war demand on man-power and other resources did no more than establish a firm basis for the prolonged offensive effort which then seemed certain to be required and made no substantial contribution to the problem of excess spending power. This problem of a high level of private The Secondary Industries Commission is incomes accompanied by a great defiassisting manufacturers to prepare plans ciency of supplies has not disappeared for with the cessation of hostilities. the present time aggregate incomes are plant and equipment. running in excess of supplies almost as strongly as at any time during the war, and the existence of excess spending power be done to increase civilian production, will be a dominant feature of the whole some time must inevitably elapse before transition period.

Also it will take considerable time to restore to civil production resources no longer needed for continuing war expenditure. Labour needs retraining and factories require new machines. I need not recite the difficulties, but I should mention particularly one largely outside our control. There may be delay in procuring imports needed for reconstruction, either because they are not available or because of foreign exchange difficulties. There are many things-and in particular houses-whic b the community badly needs, but it will be impossible in any short period completely to' satisfy these needs. All these considerations combine to present a problem of potential inflation. In meeting this danger the Government will be guided ,by two principles. On the one hand, everything possible must be done to restore peace-time production as quickly as possible and to raise it to its maximum. Progress in increasing civilian production depends upon the wholehearted efforts of all sections of the community-wage-earners , primary producers and businessmen. As an essential aid the Government has already removed a large number of controls over production and consumption originally designed to divert resources to war purof service personnel are also in operation. reconversion and special arrangements have been made to link the termination At of war contracts with the conversion of On tlie other hand, despite all that can Ministers held in Canberra recently £258,000,000.

There will be no reduction in the expenditure for pay and allowances during the year despite a rapid reduction in the strength of the forces. On discharge, members will receive deferred pay, all undrawn active pay, war service leave of fifteen days for each year overseas, and re-establishment leave of 30 days. Deferred pay alone will probably cost £54,000,000 this year, leaving a liability as at the 30th -J une, 1946, of approximately £30,000,000. Parliament has also approved the payment of war gratuities for which the accumulated total liability is estimated at approximately £75,000,000. Cash payments this year will be small as, except in special cases, payment of the gratuities will not be made until five and one-half years after the termination of hostilities. Urgent steps have been.taken to reduce expenditure on supplies for the forces and .to cancel unnecessary orders pending complete demobilization. The Australian Government willingly acceded to the request of the British Government to provide supplies and. undertake constructional works for the Royal Navy, although it was realized that this would be a severe strain on our economy and would retard the housing programme. The great bulk of this expenditure will be recoverable. Disposal of War Assets. With the sudden termination of .the war the activities 'of the Disposals Commission, set up some twelve months ago, in arranging the disposal of the large volume of assets no longer required by the services have been intensified. This very difficult and large scale task is made more complicated by the diverse nature of the assets and their wide distribution throughout Australia and the Pacific islands. A target figure for disposals amounting to £40,000,000 has been set for the current year. The proceeds will be applied in reduction of loan expenditure for war purposes. Interest and Sinking Fund. Interest and sinking fund on loans raised for war purposes continues to rise steadily. In the current year it is estimated that £41,632,000 will be required, us compared with £34,139,000 last year. Mr Ohifley. Price Stabilization. The price ceiling has been maintained since its introduction in April, 1943, and tbe present average retail price index remains at the April, 1943, level which was approximately 22J per cent, above the figure for the September quarter of 1939. Subsidies required this year are estimated to cost £12,500,000 as compared with £10,809,000 last year. Details are given in Statement No. 7. Primary Production. The demand for Australia's primary products was continued during the financial year 1944-45, and there is yet no sign of any easing of the acute world shortages of such products as wheat, meat, dairy produce and other foodstuffs. The recent drought in Australia adversely affected production and special relief was provided by the Commonwealth to the industries concerned. Details of expenditure on subsidies this year in rasped of primary production are included in Statements Nos. 7 and 8. WAS ) , 1945-46. Expenditure for purposes other than war and repatriation and taxation reimbursement grants is estimated at £132,390,000. Details are included in Statement No. 3. Special Grants to States. In accordance with the twelfth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission special grants of £1,400,000 will be paid to South Australia, £950,000 to Western Australia, and £646,000 to Tasmania, a total increase of £150,000 as compared with last year. Appropriate legislation will be introduced shortly. State Tax Reimbursement Grants. After allowing for collection of £639,000 arrears of State Income Taxes, £32,850,000 will be paid to the States as Income Tax Reimbursement Grants and £765,787 as Entertainments Tax Reimbursement Grant. In addition, payment of £553,000 has already been made to South Australia as an increase in its Income Tax Reimbursement Grant in respect of the financial year 1944-4.5.

Necessary legislation will new financial approach. Moreover, now be brought before Parliament within the that hostilities have ceased and the next few days. budget will be concerned more and more with peace-time revenue and expenditure, the time is appropriate to reconsider the problem of social security finance. As honourable' members are have had to meet a heavy burden of war aware, a number of social services is taxation and sympathizes with the feeling to Consolidated Eevenue. The Government now proposes . to charge all health and social services Fund Act will provide £15,000,000 for the first six months, social services contribution £20,000,000 for the second six In 1946-47, income of the fund is estition is set out in detail in Statement No. 6. 1 believe that the changes I have outlined will give honourable members a clearer picture of the scope, significance The Government realizes that people of taxpayers that, now hostilities have ceased, some immediate relief should be given. expenditure commitments for war needs in the transitional period and for permanent peace-time requirements are very large. On the arithmetic of finance there appears to be little scope for a reduction in taxation revenues at the present time. After careful consideration of all aspects, however, tbe Government has decided to make special provision to meet the cost of social services by introducing a social services contribution entirely separate from the ordinary income tax and, at the same time, to reduce the rates of income tax so that the combined charge on individuals, including members of the forces, for income tax and social services contribution will, on the average, be about 12$ per cent, lower in a full year than the present charge for income tax alone. The change will not come into effect until the 1st January next, but the proportion of 1.2$ per cent, is based on a full year. fact, be graduated. is really an average reduction. In some cases the reduction will be more than that, and sometimes it will be a little income tax exemption for taxpayers less. It would be impossible to make a flat reduction of 12$ per cent, and still maintain the taxation curve. We aim to keep as closely as possible to the proportion of 12$ per cent. I do not say that the percentage reduction might not amount to as much as 20 per cent, on some of the lower incomes. to aa low as 5 per cent, on some incomes. be so low as that. It is not proposed to alter the incidence of taxation on public companies, but the effect of reducing the rate of tax on individuals will be to reduce the tax on private companies. The new arrangements will be brought into operation on the earliest practicable date, namely, the 1st January next. Social Services Contribution. The social services contribution will be Including social services contribution, the levied on individuals at a graduated rate maximum rate will be 16s. 8d. in the £1. rising to a maximum of Is. 6d. in the £1 on taxable incomes as at present However, the Government's defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act.

The social services contribution levied on any income will not be greater than 87$ per cent, of the present income tax on that income. Income Tax. Although exemptions from social services contribution will be those which now apply for income tax purposes, the without dependants will be raised from £104 to £200. The effective income tax exemptions for taxpayers with dependants will be as follows:£ Taxpayer with dependent wife .. 260 Taxpayer with dependent wife and one child .. .. .. 318 Taxpayer with dependent wife and two children .. .. 347 Taxpayer with dependent wife. and three children . . .. .. 380 Taxpayer with dependent wife and four children .. .. .. 413 The levels of these exemptions will be raised by the amount of concessional allowances for items such as medical expenses, life assurance and superannuation. The new rates of income tax will commence at 3d. in the £1 and will rise gradually to a maximum of 15s. 2d. in the £1 on that part of the taxpayer's income which is in excess of £5,000.",21,Budget 1945 46

Schedules showing the amounts of social services contribution and income tax payable on typical incomes in a full year are being distributed to honourable members. The reduction in total charge for all taxpayers for the current year will therefore be half that shown in the schedules. will be reduced by the full amount from the 1st January next. It is estimated that the social services contribution will yield £51,000,000 in a full year and income tax on individuals £89,000,000, a total of £140,000,000 as compared with the yield at the present rates of income tax of £160,000,000, that is, a reduction of £20,000,000. For the current year it is estimated that the loss of revenue will be about half this amount. Full details of the proposals will be given when the relevant taxation legislation is brought before the House. Sales Tax. It is also proposed to make certain additional sales tax concessions which will involve a loss of revenue of approximately £2,800,000 in a full year and £1,900,000 in the current year. The detailed terms of these concessions which have been worked out will be incorporated in a bill to be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible. I want it to be clearly understood that it will be of no use for people to waste their time sending telegrams and making representations urging the reduction of sales tax on this item and that. The concessions already decided upon will not be altered. I have received representations on every aspect of sales tax, and I do not want to receive any more between now and next Wednesday. After making allowance for the effect in the current year of these taxation reductions it is estimated that revenue will amount to £340,284,000, a decrease of 3,138,000 compared with the receipts of last year. Details are set out in statements in this country and will be enabled ment No. 2. It is expected that customs and excise revenue will, with increasing civil imports, yield £4,823,000 more than last year. It is also expected that some arrears of income tax will be collected in the current year. During the war years it was not possible for the Taxation Department to keep up with the work associated with assessments and other matters connected with the collection of taxes, Pay-as-you-earn deductions but it is hoped that with the return of staff the arrears will be overtaken. The budget position for this year may be summarized as follows:£ War expenditure .. 300,000,000 Non-war expenditure .. 132,000,000 Total .. .. 492,000,000 Eevenue 840,000,000 Deficiency 152,000,000 It will be necessary to finance the deficiency of £152,000,000 from public loans if we are to avoid any further addition to the excess spending power in the hands of the public while goods are in short supply. In conclusion I would say that the Government, and, I believe, members generally, are fully mindful of the splendid service and sacrifice of the members of the fighting forces and are determined to do everything possible speedily to re-establish them in civil life. I would also emphasize that self-discipline is still necessary, for no financial policy or system of controls can achieve an orderly and early change-over to a prosperous peace-time economy without the full co-operation of every citizen. The Government's policy of full employment and social security will contribute towards a happy and healthy community. If we as a people can maintain, in the difficult years that lie immediately ahead, the courage and resolution which we displayed during the six long years of war, we can look forward to great developto make our proper contribution towards the maintenance of peace amongst the nations of the world.

Earlier this year, a delegation was sent to Estimated England to confer w i th representatives of the Expenditure United Kingdom, New Zealand and South 1945-46. £ African Governments on the problem of dispos2,433,492 . 2,500,000 ing of the accumulated stocks of wool and 2,188,292 , 2,200,000 future clips. As a result of this conference an 1,785,946 . 2,600,000 agreement was reached by the representatives .of the four governments concerned. The terms 801,891 600,000 of this agreement have been accepted by the 3,599,803 . 4,700,000 Commonwealth Government and by the ether governments concerned and legislation to give 10,809,424 . . 12,500,000 effect to its terms w ill be introduced at an early date. Under the agreement, the war-time system of appraisement and acquisition w ill continue for the 1D45-4G season, the acquisition price to the. Australian grower remaining at I5.45d. per lb. Arrangements are being made for the machinery provided for in the agreement to be brought into operation. The effect of the agreement w ill be that the partner governments will underwrite the income of dominion wool producers during the period required for the disposal of the accumulated wool stocks. The United Kingdom Government at present holds about 10,000,000 bales or tlie equivalent of two years' consumption ; and the agreement enables the disposal of these accumulated stocks to be spread, if necessary, over as long a period as fourteen years. Each year the average reserve price below which wool will not be sold at auction will be determined by the governments concerned in consultation.' On the basis of the average reserve price decided by the governments, the reserve price of each lot of wool will be determined by the joint organization set up by the four governments to manage the scheme. All wool from new clips will be offered at auction and, should the price bid by commercial buyers at auction exceed the reserve price, the benefit will go to the grower. If , however, the price offered at auction by commercial buyers falls short of the' reserve price, the joint organization will itself purchase at the reserve price the quantities involved. Thus, from the grower's point of view, the sale of each new clip will be assured during the currency of the plan. Further, the grower will be guaranteed a minimum price at the beginning of each season, and will be free, if he so chooses, to set liIB own reserve price on the wool he sends to auction. A t a cost of approximately £40,000,000 sterling spread over four years, the Commonwealth Government w ill assume half-ownership of the Australian-grown wool at present owned by the United Kingdom Government; and these two governments will share equally the cost of all further purchases of Australian wool by the joint organization during the operation of the plan. Also equally shared by the two governments w ill be the profits or losses on realization bushels as against previous acquisitions of of Australian-grown wool. Joint organization's expenses in regard to Australian wool wil l be met half by the industry and half by the Commonwealth and United partners. industry's share of the expenses is to be met will be set up by legislation providing for a contributory charge on new clip wool. W i th sound administration, the scheme w ill introduce a most important element of stability into the national economy. During the past financial year, arrangements were made with the United Kingdom for the purchase of Australia's surplus meat u n t i l the 30th September, 1948, dairy products unti l the 30th June, 1948, and eggs until the 30th June, 1947. These contracts will have an important stabilizing influence on these major primary industries. (184] For a period of two years from the 1st A p r i l , 1944, the Commonwealth Government guaranteed the dairying industry a rate of subsidy on commercial butter estimated to return to the producer Is. 7.3d. per lb. During the last financial year, £5,153,000 was expended in assistance on processed dairy products and for the financial year 1945-46 it is estimated that assistance will amount to £5,250,000. These figures make allowance for amounts in respect of butter and cheese exported to the United Kingdom which are recoverable in each financial year mentioned. They also include the following special subsidies which were recently granted on processed dairy products to meet difficulties arising out of drought conditions:1st May to 31st August, 1945-2d . per lb. on commercial butter basis. 1st September to 31st October, 1945-Id. per lb. on butterfat basis. The special subsidies are estimated to cost £750,000, In addition to these subsidies on processed dairy products, the Commonwealth is payingsubstantial subsidies on wholemilk production. Because of severe drought conditions, these payments are greater than would normally have been expected. For the 1945-46 financial year it is expected that whole-milk subsidies will absorb £2,600,000. Further, an amount of £250,000 has been provided for drought relief assistance to dairy farmers in special cases not covered by the production subsidies referred to above. This assistance will be granted through the State Government; but before it is granted in any particular State, the State Government concerned must establish the need for the assistance and contribute £l for £1 with the Commonwealth Government. The worse drought for a generation very severely reduced the 1944-45 cereal crops, the total quantity of wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board being only 38,000,000 94,000,000 bushels in 1943-44 and 142.000.000 bushels in 1942-43. Assistance to wheat and other cereal growers under the States Grants (Drought Relief) Act involved the Commonwealth in an appropriation of £1,855.000 for Kingdom Governments as equal the year ended the 30th June, 1945, the assistThe machinery by which the ance being on a £l-for-£l basis with the States. Because of the effect of the drought on supplies of other grains, assistance to stockfeeders in the last financial year has been concentrated mainly on wheat. The cost of subsidies under this heading amounted to £4,624,000. In addition, the Commonwealth has met considerable charges in freighting hay and chaff to the States in which supplies were short. W i th prices to growers guaranteed and a good season in prospect, it is expected that the next crop will yield increased supplies of oats, barley and grain sorghum and so reduce the use of heavily subsidized wheat for feed purposes. Assistance to stock-feeders, mostly in the form of payments to the Australian Wheat Board, is estimated to cost £3,000,000 during the current financial year. JUTE. Provision has of the subsidies branbags which year to require The 1044-45 crop of potatoes is a record, being estimated at 800,000 tons valued at over £10,000.000. The price stabilization subsidy on potato sales is estimated at £2,500,000 for the financial year 1945-40. Generally dry and unfavorable conditions reduced f r u it crops in all States during the 1944-45 season. Apple and pear production acquired by the Commonwealth in Western Australia and Tasmania aggregated about 7,500,000 bushels. The sum of £150,000 is provided largely to meet the balance of the loss of about £830,000 on the 1944 crop. The continuance of the policy of stabilizing at 1942-43 levels the price of superphosphate for primary producers will require in the current financial year a subsidy estimated at £3,250,000 as compared with £2,21-1,00(1 lust year, f t is expected that the quantity of rock imported wil l be almost back to its pre-war level.

48,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim eS of the bill amend the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act, the Widows' Pensions Act and the Child Endowment Act so that expenditure under them becomes a charge on the fund. Payments into the fund will continue until the 31st December, 1945, on the existing basis. I have calculated that the maximum contribution of £30,000,000 under the existing provisions of the act would have been paid out of Consolidated Revenue into the fund for the year 1945-46 if these provisions had continued throughout the year. Accordingly, proposed new section 5 (1) of this bill provides for of that sum, i.e., £15,000,000, for the fir3t six months of the year 1945-46. In addition, in this and following years, there will be paid into the fund the equivalent of the collections of the pay-roll tax and of the new social services contribution. The social services contribution and income tax will be assessed separately, but to avoid inconvenience to employers by requiring separate instalment deductions and returns, and elaborate accounting in the Taxation Office, it has been decided that the two taxes will be received in one payment. Accordingly, it is necessary to find « practicable means of determining the amount to be paid into the National Welfare Fund in respect of the new social services contribution. The formula which has been devised is based upon the relative value of assessments of the social service contribution and income tax. It is set out in proposed new section 5 (2) (l>) of the bill and will be applicable to years subsequent to 1945-46. In the last six months of the present, year, however, this formula obviously cannot be applied as assessments of the social services contribution will not be made until after the 1st July, 1946. I estimate that £20,000,000 will cover the amount which will be collected from instalments in respect of the social services contribution for this six months, and proposed new section 5 (2) (a) provides for that amount to be paid into the fund. On the amended basis, payments into the fund this year will be £15,000,000 for the first six months, £20,000,000 from the social services contribution for the second six months, and £11,000,000 from pay-roll tax for the whole year, giving the fund an income of £46,000,000 in all for the year. Expenditure from the fund, covering the total social and health services programmes for the present year, is estimated at £65,000,000. Details of this expenditure are given in Table6 attached to the budget speech. For the full year 1946-47 the social services contribution is expected to yield £5.1,000,000. Thus, including pay-roll tax, the total payments into the fund will reach £62,000,000 in that year. On existing commitments, expenditure from the appropriation of one-half the fund is estimated at approximately £77,000,000. These figures show that it will be necessary eventually to supplement the income of the fund. However, as the fund had a balance of £53,000,000 on the 1st July, 1945, it will be adequate to meet expenditure on existing commitments for this and next year. I commend the bill. adjourned. Debate resumed from the 6 th September (vide page 5200), on motion by Dr. That the bill be now read a second time. for the Navy, Minister for Munitions and Minister for Aircraft Production) [11.59],-In moving the second reading of this bill to approve the Charter of the United Nations, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) stated that "" the Charter does not, or at least, should not, raise any questions of party politics and it should be approved "". I am glad to say that during this debate the House has followed the example of the Parliament; of the United Kingdom and the Congress of the United States of America and discussed the Charter on its merits, with very little suggestion of "" party politics "". I think we all can agree that this debate, with the exception of one or two speeches, has been a good one, and has demonstrated a great interest in the new organization.",33,Second Readin G

50,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh,"MinisterTlie Leader of the Opposition ( Mr These criticisms were made objectively Menzies) made certain criticisms, most -of which were on the theme that, in -his own words, "" a document cannot keep -the peace "". With many of his criticisms we are in full agreement, and it is clear that he did not offer any of them as an argument that the Charter should not be ratified. They were his own expressions of opinion, given to this House as an indication of the dangers which are ahead and which must be met. With some of his criticisms I cannot agree. For example, the undertaking in the Charter to make a further, contract regarding the contribution each member must make in terms of armed forces is not the weak and vague obligation which he would suggest. It would not have been appropriate for a constitutional convention of the kind held at San Francisco to discuss terms of military agreements to be made between each member and the Security Council. This was obviously a matter for subsequent bilateral discussion between the Security Council and each member government. Nevertheless, it was thought appropriate to include a specific and binding obligation to make these agreements. It is true that no enforcement .measures can be used to ensure that agreements shall be made, but it is equally true that the making of an agreement with the Security Council is one of the obligations of membership, and one which must be observed before a member can take an effective part in the world'organization or any of its organs. Another criticism offered by the right honourable gentleman was to the effect that the Charter was attempting too much. In this respect, he criticized the Australian delegation, and the Minister for External Affairs in particular, for believing that careful drafting aud observance of detail would contribute to successful world organization and peace. He asserted that the spirit that motivated governments was the important thing, and that the "" perfectionist"" attitude was misplaced. Similarly, the right honourable member suggested that though the Minister was right in theory in attempting to . remove the power of veto in respect of peaceful settlement of disputes, in practice he was not being realistic. Mr Makin. and were an expression of opinion. Nevertheless, it would be wrong for me to ignore them, and to allow it to be thought that they were opinions which the Australian delegation or the Australian Government shared. The opposite of "" perfectionism "" is "" imperfectionism "". Detail in drafting, the specification of obligations, and clear statements of the principles, purposes, and functions of each organ are vital to the success of any institution. A glance at the amendments made to the Dumbarton Oaks text, will demonstrate how greatly that text was improved. Similarly, with respect to the veto issue, it was most important to point out to all what was in fact ideal or "" right in t h e o r y a n d what, was in fact pure expediency or "" realism "". The great value of the Australian criticism at San Francisco of the veto on peaceful settlement was that the issue is now clearly understood by all member governments, and that, the Great Powers have given an undertaking that their special privileges will be used sparingly and in the interests of all the United Nations. The Leader of the Opposition also criticized the allegedly negative character of the references of the Minister for External Affairs in his second-reading speech to the use of atomic energy. What the Minister actually said was that "" the destructive potential of atomic energy is too great to be entrustedto one Great Power"" and that for this reason the atomic bomb should be placed under the control of the Security Council. He was concerned, in his speech, only with the security aspects of atomic energy, illustrated by the recent use of the atomic bomb. The Security Council has the duty to arrange for its military preparedness to deal with any would be aggressor. Obviously, it will be unable to defend the United Nations against possible aggression if certain nations are able to withhold from the council a weapon of such shattering power as the atomic bomb. It follows that unless thebomb, and any other similar weapons, are brought under the control of the Security Council there cannot be full confidence and understanding between the Great Powers upon whose close cooperation and leadership the peace of the world depends. The Leader of the Opposition asserted that there is no advantage in having secured the insertion in the Charter of -""full employment"", in the form of an obligation resting upon each member: IHis point was, in effect, that the pledge is a mere form of words, which could have no real effect on policies that governcisco could have hoped for. I believe ments will adopt. 'What actually happened at San Francisco contradicts that --view altogether. Many governments-vjome governments of great powers-felt at first extreme reluctance to commit -themselves to "" full employment"" as an -objective of domestic policy. The measure of their reluctance is the measure also of the importance of the commitment. Both the British and the Soviet delegations joined with the delegations of Australia and New Zealand in pressing -for the adoption of the pledge in what is known as Article 56 of the Charter. They, at any rate had no doubt that the -pledge was more than a mere form of words. The right honourable member seemed to .argue that the development of the Economic and Social Council which the Australian delegation obtained was in some way incompatible with the development of relations with the United Kingdom in the economic field. l i e referred to lend-lease problems and the assistance -Great Britain must have in order that it may make up for the great losses which it sustained during the war in the Allied cause. There is no incompatibility. On the contrary, Britain, like Australia, is a dependent economy, and, like Australia, is vitally interested in the domestic economies of other countries, and in particular, the United States of America. The British delegation, and in particular, Mr Tomlinson, supported -every amendment that the Australian -delegation suggested in relation to the Economic and Social Council. Perhaps one of the greatest contributions that Australia could make to the welfare oi the people of Britain was to obtain the undertaking by each nation regarding ""living standards and full employment. The standards of living of the people of the United Kingdom will depend, once they have full employment in their own -country, very greatly upon the levels of employment and the standards of living of peoples throughout the rest of the world. The right honourable'member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) said that the Charter was, in the end, better than many governments attending San Franthat this is so. The emphasis which he placed on public opinion and on frequent meetings of the Assembly is fully shared by the Australian Government. Indeed, it was an Australian amendment which assured frequent meetings of the Assembly as required; it was an Australian amendment which assured that, the Economic and Social Council could be convened at any time; and it was very largely due to Australian support that a resolution was adopted providing that, as a general rule, the General Assembly should be open to the press of the world. It will be recalled that the Minister for External Affairs, in hi< assessment of the value of the 'Charter and its possibilities, made special mention of the importance of public opinion. The House listened with great interesi and warm appreciation to the wellinformed and clear statements of thr member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). His emphasis on our obligations in respect to our own. territories is relevant and important. As has already been stated, the Australian Government has taken two steps in fulfilment of the obligations implied in the Charter. It has set up a Civil Affairs School for the training of administrators, and the development of this school is something which is being watched with interest by many governments overseas. It has' also decided to set up a research council, through which agency it will be possible to obtain the statistical and other material which the Charter obliges the Government to furnish in respect of its dependent territories. The honorahle member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) raised certain difficulties as to the interpretation and contents of the' Charter which I should like to elucidate briefly. He first suggested f i a t the Charter did not make effective provisions for the inclusion of collective defence arrangements, such as the South-West Pacific regional defence pact suggested in the Australian-New Zealand Agreement of 1944. He understood the regional arrangements referred to in the Charter itself as being concerned primarily with pacific settlement of disputes among the parties themselves. This, however, is only a part of the provision that the Charter makes. Articles 52 and 53 contemplate the use of regional arrangements or agencies for any matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security which are appropriate for regional action. This certainly includes the pacific settlement of local disputes. As Article 53 shows, it also includes enforcement action under the authority of the Security Council. But[ think that the provision which meets the difficulty that the honourable member had in mind is to be found in Article 51. This Article declares that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. I emphasize rhe words "" collective self-defence "". If the world security system breaks down, either because of the voting procedure in the Security Council or for any other reason, this Article 51 makes clear that every member is fully entitled to fall back on any independent. defensive arrangements it may have made, or may make. This is the provision which the Deputy Prime Minister referred to in his second-reading speech. It makes possible exactly the kind of comprehensive defence plan for the South-Western Pacific that the honourable member for Warringah mentioned as desirable. I may, perhaps, add that Article 51 was uot placed under the heading of "" regional arrangements "" because the arrangements provided for in Article 51 need not necessarily be of a regional or local character. Reciprocal arrangements among members of the British Commonwealth, for example, might very well not fall under a purely regional heading. The honourable member for Warringah also suggested that the Charter had a fundamental defect because it lacked provision for the control of international patents and scientific inventions. However, the plain intention of the Charter is to prevent the possible use of aggressive Mr Makin. means in whatever form for the settlement of disputes between nations. The Charter gives the General Assembly power both to consider any matter such as this which clearly affects the maintenance of international peace and security and to make recommendationsconcerning it. The Charter also enablesthe Assembly to consider and make recommendations concerning disarmament', and the regulation of armaments. If such precautionary measures should fail and a threat to the peace occurred, then the Security Council may take all necessary steps, including the application of economic and military measures, to maintain peace and security. The Minister for External Affairs, in. his second-reading speech, drew attention to the fact that partly because the chemical industry after the last war was under private control, and arrangements niad* for tie-ups between private chemical monopolies throughout the world, international peace was undermined long before 1939. He emphasized that the whole question would have to be considered and proper action taken to prevent any recurrence of such international monopoly control as soon as the Charter comes into force. The honourable member for Warringah complained that the pledge to promote "" full employment "" is undefined. Therewas no need for definition. The phrase is in general use, and its meaning is generally understood. More precisely stated, it means "" high and stable levels of employment""; that phrase has a rather stiff and academic ring, and the conference decided emphatically to use the popular equivalent. The methods by which nations achieve full employment are, of course, for them to .determine. Their policies, however, will clearly be subject to discussion, not only in the Economic and Social Council but also in the General Assembly. the objective of governments to provide full employment for their people? has not been, and very grievous conditions have been inflicted upon people throughout the world because their government? have not sought to provide, as they should have done, f u l l employment.",34,Evatt
51,Mr Holt,Has it not always been,37,Evatt
52,Mr Makin,"I am afraid that itI deprecate strongly tbe suggestion auado by the honourable member for Warringah that some legislative safeguard is necessary or proper in approving ""the Charter, with regard to the "" economic pledge "". The ultimate question is simply -one of constitutional power. On the legal question, I do not desire to add -anything to what the Minister for Exter-nal Affairs said in opening this debate. Nothing that, this Parliament can do by legislative act. can either increase or diminish the power that the Constitution confers upon it. or. for that matter, bind any future Parliament. Talk of legislative ""safeguards"" is misconceived. If the Constitution, operating on th<; Charter as it stands, gives to this Parliament the legislative authority in employment matters that the honorahle member asserts, nothing that the Parliament can do can alter that fact. The question that remains is whether, and how, the power is to be exercised. In any exercise of such a power, the Parliament would be accountable to the Australian people. To repeat, the ultimate question is one of constitutional interpretation, which is a matter not for this Parliament but for the High Court of Australia. The honourable member for Warringah disked for clarification of the relation between the two paragraphs of Article 80. This Article i*= a part, of Chapter XII . dealing with the international trusteeship system. The system applies only to certain types of dependent territories; and wen to territories in those categories, it applies only by virtue of individual trusteeship agreements. Until an agreement is made in respect of any territory, paragraph 1 of Article 80 expressly preserves unaltered the existing rights of any state under any existing international instruments. Tbe intention of the second paragraph is to make additionally clear that this preservation of existing rights is not to be interpreted as itself requiring, the course of it. The special relation in or even employing, their indefinite continuance. The future of the territories concerned, should, in effect, be decided on the merits in each case. The honourable member also asked vernment would desire. This throws a whether Article 83 of the Charter gives special responsibility on the other memto the Security Council the power to debers of the British Commonwealth for fine strategic areas, without the consent advocating policies based on sound of Australia, in any Australian territories, and whether it gives to the Security Council authority over any portion of those territories without Australia's consent. The answer is that the Charter does not do so. Strategic areas are to be designated in the trusteeship agreements. The consent of the trustee state is, therefore, required in every case. This is made clear by Article 82 of the Charter. The point is simply that the functions of the United Nations with regard to trust territories in general are to be exercised by the Trusteeship Council, operating under the authority of the General Assembly. With regard to strategic areas, however, the functions of receiving and considering reports and so forth are to lie exercised by the Security Council, which, however, may avail itself of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council on the political and economic side. I yield to no honourable member in my desire for close and constant co-operation between members of the British Commonwealth. But the claim of the honorahle member for Warringah that it is wrong and even deplorable for a dominion government to express publicly any difference of opinion which it has with the British Government, goes much too far. It is inconsistent with the basic principle on which the British Commonwealth is organized. Not a single dominion has observed any such rule. The common purposes that members of the British Commonwealth share, and the ties that bind them, are not impaired by the sincere expression of divergent points of view on matters of principle. Nowhere is that more true than in the working out of a general constitution as at the San Francisco conference. On this matter, I remind the House of the point made by the Minister for External Affairs in opening this debate, and again by the Deputy Prime Minister in which Great Britain now stands to the rest of the "" Big Five"" may often make it impossible for Great Britain itself to pursue the policies which its own Godemocratic principles. It can fairly be said that as a result of this kind of action degree of detail in the plans of those who at San Francisco the Charter of the United Nations, in its finished form, is closer than it was before to what the British Government and people would themselves, if voting arrangements had made it possible, have desired to advocate. WhatI have just said is applicable also, iu part, to the remarks of the right honourable member for Cowper, who spoke of the importance of Empire consultation and the need to speak with a ""single voice "". On the need for close and constant consultation, there is no room for difference of opinion. Empire consultation played a large part in the framing of the Charter. It took place before the conference at a special meeting in London, and during the conference also, as circumstances required. But the Government of the United Kingdom itself emphasized that the purpose of these talks was not to lay down an agreed binding common policy, and that each government must reserve its full right to pursue in the conference the policy for which it was responsible to its own parliament and people. As I reflected on what has been said during this debate, the thought occurred to me that we must continually remind ourselves of the new position in the . world in which the members of the British find themselves to-day. Our experience in World War II . has shown clearly that neither for purposes of defence nor for purposes of prosperity can the members of the British Commonwealth regard that body as a self-sufficient unit. For them, both singly and as a group, collective security and collective capacity. There were only two Ausprosperity must be organized on a wider basis than the British Commonwealth alone. An effectively functioning United Nations should be realized as a necessary object of policy for every member nation of the British Commonwealth. At the same time, there is no disagreement with the view that co-operation with the United Nations should be based on the closest co-operation in the British Commonwealth. We come now to the remarks made by tbe honourable member .for Indi( Mr know that the Minister for the Army McEwen). He commented that he would Sfr. Makin. have expected evidence of a greater had been considering matters of post-war reconstruction during the past years. It should be pointed out that the purpose of San Francisco was to draft a constitution and that detailed post-war planning was not a subject for discussion. The specialized organizations to be brought into relationship with the United Nations will be responsible for actual planning, and much of this work is already being carried out. There are, for example, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the monetary plans, and various other commercial proposals not yet made public. The second criticism was that the Trusteeship Council is of little value as it is representative very largely of small power? with no trusteeship responsibilities. Absence of responsibility does not mean ignorance, but, in any case, the future administration of mandates in certain colonies is of great international interest and as much the concern of powers without responsibilities as of those who have administrative responsibility. I greatly regret that at this stage the honourable member for Indi introduced M note which was, up to this stage, absent from the debatea note of "" party polities "". He complained that the consultants and advisers of the Australian delegation were not made use of as much Commonwealth of Nations as were those of other delegations. He cited as an example the United 'States delegation. If the honourable member had been in close touch with the proceedings of the conference he would be aware that those whom he named were appointed by President Roosevelt as full delegates and acted in that tralian delegates, and each of those acted in the same way as the delegatesof other delegations. In point of fact Australian consultants frequently acted as delegate? -thi s never happened in the United States delegation. He went on to suggest that there were not frequent opportunities for discussion and advice, and his remarks about meetings at 10.30 p.m. may have left the impression that this hour showed disregard for the consultants. The House should and the Minister for External Affairs devoted each Monday night to a delegation meeting in spite of the fact that they were attending three sessions a day, including an evening session which usually lasted pa3t 11 p.m. This was a grossly unfair suggestion to make. At those meetings every opportunity was given for comment and advice, and, in fact, advice was sought as the honourable member well knows. Admittedly the time when advice and consultation were most needed was during the last two weeks of i lie conference, but the honourable member had already left San Francisco. Another implication which I cannot ;illow to pass is that there was an -'entourage"" and ""numerous officials"" while the consultants numbered twelve. The officials or advisers who took part in i lie' conference numbered five, one of whom was drawn from the Washington Legation. One other officer of the Depuriment of External Affairs, who acted .is secretary to the delegation, spent the greater part of his time looking after the <:xtra-conference needs of several of the --onsultants,. for the'honourable member for Indi. !>y those taking part that whilst a few of delegation may not have been representthe consultants complained that they were not being used, they were frequently nbseut on so many occasions that it was not possible.for them to follow the procedings and be asked to take an active part. There were exceptions, and I mention one in particular, the honourable member for Ballarat, who conscientiously throughout the whole conference attended meetings of all the four committees to which he had been assigned. The honourable member for Indi complained that the amendments were decided before he had an opportunity to make suggestions. That is largely so. Principles of the policy of the Australian Government were decided in 1944 and were given to this House on the 30th September. 1944, aud on the 30t!:i November, U)44. They were laid down early in November. 1944 at an Australian-New Zealand conference at Wellington. They were fully discussed by the Government, :ind the suggestion that they represented ihe views of the Minister for External Affaire alone are, on the facts, wholly [185] unfounded. It must be quite clear to all members of this House that the greatest burden would fall on the delegates and the departmental officei'3 who had been studying the proposals since early 1944 in the greatest of detail and who had alscr attended the valuable discussions held in London prior to the conference. Thequestion is whether the honourable member regards the organization of the Australian delegation from the point of view"" of efficiency in pursuing Australian' interests, or from the point of view of building up and preserving the prestige of each member of the delegation. The Australian delegation, under the direction of the two delegates, was more concerned with pursuing Australian interest. I do not wish to answer the honourable member further, as the honourable member for Ballarat has already done that very effectively. j wish to make one comment only and that is that it does not follow thai differences of opinion, which may have arisen between the Australian and the United Kingdom delegations reflect an anti-British attitude. Subsequent events gave good grounds for believing that in certain respects the UnitedKingdom ing the British people. In fact, there was the closest co-operation between members of the British delegation, who are now members of the United Kingdom Government, and members of the Australian delegation. Nor do I wish to reply to the honourable member for Eichmond, who obviously does not grasp the significance of.great power unity and the significance of the development of the independence of small powers. One of the. great hopes of the. United Nations rests in the progressive and independent line followed by the many small nations, a line which the United Kingdom would probably follow in many instances if free to do so. As to the challenge which the honourable member issued to the Deputy Prime Minister regarding the calling of a conference of British press representatives, 3 have only to say that whether this did or did uot happen, it is a fact that the British press includes the Australian press, and in any case I see no harm whatsover in keeping the British press informed, as, in fact, Lord",37,Evatt

The New York Times and The Times of London were unstinting of their praise for the Minister for External Affairs, and both papers were following a policy of support of their own national delegations. 1 am glad that the honourable member for Ifenty and the honourable member for Flinders brought the debate back to the high level at which it started, and I would like to congratulate both these honourable members for the sane and well balanced estimate they made of the Charter and the possibilities of its success. With respect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders that a senior Minister of each government should be appointed to the centre of the new World Organization, that is what is intended. Already the former Secretary of State. Mr Stettinius has been appointed as the United States representative to the United Nations. No doubt as soon as the centre of the world organization is determined other governand self-reliant units within the British ments will appoint their representatives. In conclusion I wish to thank all the representatives of Australia at the conAustralia had distinctive and urgent ference. I expressly congratulate and thank the right honourable the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Forde), who was the leader of the delegation, for the capable and distinguished way in which he handled his duties. Australia's part was greatly enhanced by the clear and logical way in which its views were expressed, and to Mr Forde great credit is due. Also, we must have a great admiration for the brilliant part taken by the Minister for External Affairs in Mr Makin. helping to influence and determine the course of that conference in many of its deliberations. With all the criticisms which have been levelled against himand I should say for reasons which are not reasons of national interest-h e still remains supreme in the field of foreign a if airs, not only as the greatest Minister has possessed, but also as one of the greatest figures in international affairs in the history of the British Commonwealth of Nations. All men in the field of international affairs in the British Commonwealth, and a great, number in foreign countries, listened with respect to his counsel. His hard, tenacious struggle to obtain reinforcements and supplies during Australia's most critical days by means of obtaining an effective voice in tlie War Councils of the United Nations will be regarded in the future as a remarkable achievement. Australia obtained a hearing and obtained the necessary attention to Pacific affairs. His success at San Francisco was the logical outcome, as already Australia's place in world affairs was coming to be recognized, and a leading part was not only expected of it but also hoped for by the many middle and small powers having interests similar to those of Australia. In carrying out this work, the Minister has made a very great contribution to the British Commonwealth as a whole. For example, the purposes for which he fought-the liberalization of the world organization, the recognition of welfare as an ultimate basis of security, and the recognition of the dominions as strong Commonwealth-ar e the purposes of each member of the British Commonwealth. national interests in what was done at San Francisco. The Charter safeguards all of these. This could not have been achieved without the standing and authority which the M'inister had won for himself and for Australia by his energy and ability in the work of the conference as a whole. What he did built up the prestige-, not only of Australia, but also of the British Commonwealth as a whole. This was the view of tInPrime Minister of New Zealand and of al] others who observed objectively the great achievements of the Australian delegation at San Francisco.

I believe that world security depends in large measure on the provision of full employment. There cannot be peace otherwise. One of the causes of the war which has just ended was the existence of large numhers of unemployed workers in most of the leading countries of the world.

I agree with those who say that the white race has been given one more opportunity to justify its supremacy in the world. The United Nations have the power to give to the peoples of the world all that is necessary for a contented life. Contented people are not likely to make wars, but if the peoples of the world be denied their unMr Chambers. doubted rights the maintenance of peace will become impossible. The atomic bomb has given rise to fear, distrust and great hopes. Its use certainly hastened the end of the war, but there are many who There has been some believe that what has already been achieved will fade into insignificance in the light of future developments. Today, we stand in awe at the destruction of life and property caused by one atomic bomb, but other and more terrible instruments of destruction will be invented. The Lord has been merciful to the world: He has given to mankind one indebted to the Ausmore opportunity. The Charter may not of itself prevent wars in the future, but I am confident that if the representatives of the people in the parliaments of the nations adhere to its spirit they will do much to ensure peace and prosperity in the years that lie ahead. Mi-. ARCHIE CAMERON (Barker) [2.34] I have listened with patience to many of the speeches on this bill. It was inevitable that there should have been some criticism of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt). When a reveals that he is something in the nature of an international atomic bomb it i . 1 only natural that the people of his own endeavour to devise means for exercising some control over him. himself is uncontrollable. greatest power that a man can exercise is the power of self-control, but that is a the make-up of the Minister for External Affairs. Now that the Minister is again in the United Kingdom, where he may remain for an indefinite period, it is only right that the world should know that some of the things that he has said regarding imperial relations and international affairs do not represent the views of the majority of the people of Australia. I do not think they even represent the opinion of a good many members of the party which supports the Government. I should have more to say on this point if the right honourable gentleman were here.

59,Mr Archie Cameron,"Th eliis presence we may have something to ray to him in person on these topics, and we shall ask for replies. We come now to the consideration of rhe United Nations Charter itself. I am one of those who never believed in the League of Nations, and I have said so more than once from my place in this House. The League of Nations Covenant was not worth the paper it was written on. It represented no more than a pious hope. The United Nations Charter is practically the Covenant over again with fi few frills on it. involved. true. One of the things I should like to jee cleared up is whether Australia ic -till contributing £65,000 a year towards the upkeep of the League of Nations -Secretariat. believe we are still paying that amount, i should be interested to know on. what grounds the Government can justify t.hi3 expenditure seeing that, for all practical purposes, the League of Nations has ceased to be an effective instrument. Asf have said, there is very little different:*: between the League of Nations set-up and the world organization which was established at San Erancisco. In place of the Council of the League of Nations there is to be a Security Council consisting powers. The membership is to be different, also. In the old league Italy and Japan were both represented, while Russia and the United States of America were not. In the new council Russia and the United States of America are represented, but Italy and Japan are off the iist. The General Assembly in both cases iv very much the same. Under both Charters, provision is made for the setting up of an International Court of Justice. In this connection. Article9 of the Statute «f the International Court of Justice is very interesting. It is as follows:At every election, the electors shall bear in mind not only tlmt the persons to IK? elected should individually possess the qnalilications requiTPil. hut also that in the body s« n whole the representation of the main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world should be assured. How in the name of common sense cau any international court of justice function if it has to consider more than one legal system? In the event of a dispute between ourselves and, say, a South American, republic, is the cause to be tried according to the law of China or Persia, or is it to be tried by our law, or the law of the other fellow in the dispute? To be effective, the court must operate under a system of law that is known in advance, not according to some system to. which it may take a fancy for the time being. As for the trusteeships, there is nothing essentially different between the proposed system and the mandate system set up under the League of Nations. However, the Minister for External Affairs seemed to think that he had some special authority, derived from I know not whai source, to care for backward peoples, and to do so without any regard to the military and economic needs of the countries on which those peoples are dependent. The regional agreements may b»regarded as something new in form, although they are not new in principle. The most illuminating comment on tlii? part of the Charter fell from the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), who said that in any conflict Australia and New Zealand, under the ANZAC Pact, woulri stand on their own regional feet. For all practical purposes, he might as well have said that they would .stand on their own of Allied and associated regional heads. One of the prime jokes in international circles must be the ANZAC Pact. It was described by an honourable senator some time ago as a very amateurish effort, something that might be forgiven by those who have an interest in us, and forgotten by those who have not. That is (he kindest thing that could have been said about it. if peace is to be preserved after thir war certain essential eonditions must be observed. At. all times iu the world's? history peace has been desired by certain peoples, and war has b<+cu desired by certain peoples.

63,Mr Archie Cameron,"Yes, Iare tlie masters of their own rulers. It is not true that the members of the Upper Ten-the silver-tails or flic tall poppiesare always the warmongers. Some of the worse acts of aggression have represented the deliberate will of a whole people. Those who set. out to preserve the peace of the world must regard three things as necessary-tw o of them military, one economic. In the first place, there must he an absolute prohibition on traffic in arms, and this means that there shall be an absolute prohibition on the construction of weapons of war, warships, aircraft, & c , by every signatory nation for supply to any other nation.'even another signatory nation. effect in the Charter. there is uot.. , In each of the two recent world wars it has been the fate of our soldiers to capiure in the hands of our enemies weapons which have been manufactured in British arsenals, and sold overseas. From a short-sighted economic point of view that may be all right, but from the point of view of preserving the peace of the world it is entirely wrong. This war has shown that there are only two navies in the world that, count, those of the Dniied States of America and Great Britain. I can see no justification whatever for the possession of a naval force by any other power than the United States of America and Great Britain. It would be a good thing if one of the conditions of the adoption of the Uncio agreement were the complete disarmament, in the naval sense, of all the seagoing powers except the United States uf America and Great Britain, which have shown, not only in this war, but also in the first world war, that they have no wish to control the territories of ->ther nations. The American bases in the Pacific are designed merely for the protection of the sea-going trade of the world at large, and for the protection nf the bigg<>3t commercial interests in the Pacific, namely, those of the United States of America, with which I hope we -hull not find ourselves in conflict. The third essential if we are to have international peace, is that envisaged in ArticleS of the Atlantic Charter, which deals with the loosening-up of the barriers to international trade. A good deai has been written about f u l l employment, practising tolerance and living together as good neighbours. It almost remind? one of the wedding ceremony. If these ideals are to be attained, there must, be a considerable alteration of the attitude of the Australian Labour party towards international trade. What attitude, for instance, will the Australian Government, and the Australian Labour party in particular, adopt towards the policy of immigration, which is necessary if we are t<> populate the empty parts of this country'. Those matters will have to be pondered over by the Australian Labour party in the not far distant, future, provided it sincerely desires the electors to renew il:term of office. culty about that. be better informed on that matter twelve months hence. I do not believe one word that is heard about f u l l employment. I do not believe that the Australian Labour party would be a party to any instrument which would give an international authority the right to say what industrial conditions shall be imposed in this country in order to secure f u l l employment. These matters will be entirely foi local consideration and decision. So the Charter, when we get down t«> bedrock, is only a pious resolution Everything will depend upon the will of Australia to get down to work. In tinlast six years there has been an increasing tendency on the part of the people to believe that we shall be able to get on very well with much less work and much more leisure, and a good old jubilee of strikes and stop-work meetings. The capacity of a country to ensure a risin,s standard of living depends entirely on the capacity and will of its people to work. We cannot, pay high wages and have a good standard of living in am country, unless there be fir=t a high standard of production.

67,Mr Archie Cameron,"We shalloil as a source of power. The history of coal-mining in this country throughout the war is one of the chapters of which the Australian public, and the coal-miners in particular, need not be very proud. There has been a deliberate policy, 1 believe, on the part of the coal-miners that there shall not be any reserves of coal for the Government or private industry or anybody else. Having exercised that privilege in time of war, it is only reasonable to expect that they will attempt to exercise it even more vigorously in time of peace. So there can be no guarantee that we shall be able to maintain the present standard of existence. The more we study the Charter the more necessary it becomes to realize that all the talk about reaffirming our faith in fundamental human rights depends, in the first analysis, on the willingness of the people who have chosen a particular occupation as their own to carry on with that occupation and produce the goods, or else make way for rhose who will. r In considering international relationothers are threatened.

When we consider the future chances of peace, we cannot be oblivious to the fate of certain countries which have come into conflict with Russia. I refer to Finland, Esthonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Roumania. SoI have some misgivings as to the prospects of peace and harmony between nations in future. Things have been done in this war, the Atlantic Charter notwithstanding, under which whole peoples have been completely obliterated from the map of Europe, under which whole territories have reverted to Russian rule, under which other territories have found themselves under Russian rule for the first time in history. tened. that unavoidable fact.

69,Mr Archie Cameron,"Yes, andtell The only thing that stands out, clearly in my mind in the present-day situation is the one that the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) referred to, that is, that there must be, if Australia, New Zealand, and certain other British countries are to survive in any future conflict, the very greatest possible degree of cohesion, understanding, and co-operation, political, economic, and military, between ourselves and every other English-speaking unit of the British Empire. Unless we are prepared to come to those conclusions, ANZAC pacts, regional jpaets, Uncio or "" nuncio"" or anything -else you like, will not make very much -difference to the results. No ma'ter -whether the Minister for Externa! Affairs -or any other person or authority in this country is responsible, anything said or done that is like\y to make itappear that we and the other English-speaking countries of the British Empire arc drifting apart is a great disservice to the true interests and, I think, the true future of the people of the Commonwealth of Australia. not intend to take part in this debate, but, in view of the statement? and insinuations of various Opposition members against certain members of the Australian delegation, notably the Minister forExternal Affairs (Dr. Evatt), I consider that, in common with a number of other honourable members on this side, I should place before this Parliament what I ihink of the deliberations and the attitude adopted by the. right honourable gentleman. J believe, that this Charter, which was drawn up by the representatives of about 50 nations, is one that, though we may all doubt to some degree whether it can be carried into effect, sets out the objective the delegation that added to its deliberaof ensuring a better world in which friendly relations between nations would be encouraged, developed, and cemented, and peace would reign. It is at least a noble ideal, and whether we disagree or not that it will have practical results, it is possibly the best approach that we can make to ensuring world peace. The Charter possesses ""many notable features, particularly that referred to by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr the results, it achieved. Chambers) pledging the United Nations to a policy of lull employment for the peoples of the world. I'ndeniabJy, if we are to have contented nations with wars a thing of the past, it is essential to ensure, in the first place, that the peoples of the nations shall have full employment and the necessaries of life so that they shall be content with the state of affairs within their own boundaries. The Australian delegation did a fine job in ensuring the inclusion in the Charter of the provision relating to full employment. 1 say, honestly, that the delegation was a fairly "" mixed grill "". HadI had the choosing of it a number of members would not have been included, notably the honSeveral other members of the delegation, not representative of this party, it was uot much use sending, but, as they were sent to take a part in the deliberations, they were at. least under the obligation lo present on their return, impartially and nationally, their views of the issues raised at the conference. 1 believe that we should have been letter represented at the conference had we sent a delegation representing the Government, because, if any body of men represents the great mass of the Australian people, it is the 4P members on our side of the House. What is more, as the principal members of the delegation showed at San Francisco, we have an Australian outlook and are not prepared to sit in the background and let other nations trample our point of view and efforts underfoot. We are prepared to stand up for the things we think Australia is entitled to. T pay tribute to the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), who led the Australian delegation, and to the members of tions in no small measure, notably the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), who, gave ns the benefit of his views yesterday, and Senator Nash. It has always been my view that, Opposition members, when they go to international conferences, do not take a national stand. Confirmation of that is provided by the vicious attempts by the honorahle member for Indi to undermine the delegation and",46,Evatt

71,Orable Member For Indi ( Mr Mcewen).,"It is more than a coincidence that one -ot the members of the Australian delegation, the Minister for External Affairs, .should have been viciously attacked yesterday in this chamber. It is significant that just as he was arriving in London on one of the most important missions that this Government could send him on, press cables were sent from this country reporting the statements of the honourable member for Lndi, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and other honourable members that the Minister for External Affairs is anti-British. That was a deliberate attempt to undermine his mission. The attack was made -for political purposes. I strongly disagree with their point of view. Indeed, I -think they did a disservice to the nation in making their statements at a time like this, particularly when they are -untrue. Honourable members opposite seem to think that to be an Australian .and to put this nation's point of view ocfore the peoples of other countries is to be anti-British. [ thank heaven that this Government has produced men who are capable of putting Australia's viewpoint effectively in any company. ""We are fortunate that the Minister for the Army and the Minister for External Affairs placed very frankly before the San Francisco conference what we as a nation think. Surely, as a nation which has suffered 90,000 casualties, including 22.000 fatal casualties, in this war, which has over 900,000 of its people in the fightpolicy, and has achieved for us a high ing services, including many women, and which has played its part during the war in a manner second to none of the United Nations-surely , with our records of achievements in this war and the war of 1914-1S, revealing our national growth .and advancement, we are entitled to an Australian point of view, and our representatives abroad should be allowed to -press that point of view when they consider that it is not receiving proper attention. Just because our viewpoint in respect of a few fundamentals may differ from that, of the British delegation it does not mean that we are anti-British. We can be certain that the British delegation put Great Britain's views frankly and forcibly before the conference. In doing so. they teach us to do likewise. The British delegates believe that they should protect Great Britain at home and abroad. They put the British viewpoint at San Francisco, and they are to be admired for doing so. Similarly, our delegation abroad should put our case: and we are not to blame should it happen to offend some nations. AH the talk by honourable members opposite about the Labour party being anti-British is designed to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people. If any political party in this country is anti-British it is Ihe .Opposition party. The whole policy of the Labour party has been designed to enable Australia to play an important part in the advancement and preservation of the Empire. If any government failed in its duty to the people of this country, and the people of the Empire, by neglect to defend Australia' against aggression it was the government formed by the Opposition parties. To that degree they can be said to be anti-British. 1 support other honourable members who have defended the work of our delegation at San Francisco. It is significant that until the Curtin Government assumed office we heard very little about our foreign policy. Governments up to that time generally followed the iead given by other countries which coincided with their party politics. The Minister for External Affairs, with the co-operation of his colleagues in this Government, has developed an Australian foreign standing in the international sphere. He has won an outstanding reputation in foreign affairs to-day. Dr. Evatt has won the admiration of the leaders of other nations for his perseverance, and the manner in which he has put Australia's case, as well as for his sound knowledge of international affairs generally. The honorahle member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) quoted from an article published in the magazine Life dealing with the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs at the San Francisco conference. It ill becomes honourable members of the Opposition to introduce party politics into a debate of this kind, with the result that the Minister for External Affairs, after winning the fame, admiration and acclaim of the peoples and leaders of other countries, returns to his homeland to find that he is attacked in this Parliament and alleged to be anti-British just because he advocated a point of view which does not coincide with the party politics of honourable members opposite. I commend to honourable members opposite the special editions of the New York Times dealing with the San Francisco conference. These editions are available in the library and honourable members generally would find it instructive to read them. For instance, the second last edition reports that the meeting of the Steering Committee stood for the honour of the medium-sized anil appreciation of the work of ""the great champion of the smaller nations, the Australian Foreign Minister, Dr. Herbert Vcre Evatt"". That journal gives credit to the Minister for many improvements in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. In reply to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) who said that the spirit and not the words of the Charter was the important thing, and criticized the Mi""i*ter for paying too much attention to drafting, I quote from the New York Tiinfts'a report of what the Minister said at mi open sessionKvery one must t h r ill at the thought ot the opportunity that this Charter will provide for men of good will if they are suffieiently darin;; and courageous. If we really mean to carry into effect the great objectives nf the Atlantic Charter, if we really mean t<i do that we shall succeed. These words will not matter: the spirit will give life. They are very commendable from the Minister for External It is also interesting to note the acclaim that he has won in various countries by his efforts on behalf of this nation and the smaller nations, and because of his stand generally on foreign affairs. Parliament is indebted to all members of the Australian delegation for the manner in which they put forward views at San Francisco. agree with some of the provisions of the Charter and doubt whether some of them will actually effect, the Charter represents practical attempt peace. Our delegates and their advisers did a notable job for this country in placing our views so forcibly and fearlessly before the nations represented at Mr Only. the conference, as well as points of view which they sincerely believed would benefit the peoples of the world in the years to come. Provided the Minister for the Army and the Minister for External Affairs adhere strongly to the points of view they expressed at San Francisco they will retain the admiration of the people of this country. It is unfortunate that honourable members of the Opposition have introduced party political issues into this debate. final This is purely an international matter, and should be considered strictly as such. We in this Parliament must show a -mailer countries, and showed special greater appreciation of that fact, and forget petty party isms, if we are to have effective discussion on these important issues. 1 support the ratification of the Charter, and hope that all of us w ill live to see it fulfilled-the achievement of lasting peace and security throughout the world.

As Australian troops that the relief of Australian troops in that area shall be completed by the end of October, 1945, in view of the programme it has laid down for the demobilization of the services. It also desires that responsibility for civil affairs shall be taken over by British and Dutch .authorities with the least avoidable delay, and not later than the end of October, 1945. Tn Dutch New Guinea, Australia has a special interest in Hollandia and Biak as air force staging areas, and we are prepared to maintain initial control in Dutch New Guinea although it will, for all practical purposes, be confined to these staging areas. This is on the understanding that the Dutch shall remain responsible for civil affairs administration; that the acceptance of the surrender of Japanese troops in Dutch New Guinea shall have a low priority; and that the general occupation of the territory shall be left until British or Dutch troops are available. As the head-quarters of the Second -Japanese Army are at Pinrang; in the Celebes, the Government has agreed that Australian troops shall accept the surrender of the head-quarters and that, for this purpose, a limited force shall I)-? placed m Pinrang. Some Allied prisoners of war are believed to be in tbe ""Macassar area, and only a minor operation will be necessary for their recovery. forces will assist in this operation. Australia has accepted initial responsibility for Morotai, in the Halmaheras group, as a large Australian staging base is located on this island, and the surrender of tbe Japanese forces there will be taken by Australian troops. Arrangements have been made for the acceptance by Australian forces of the surrender in Dutch Timor. Arrangements for the ncceptance, by Australian forces, of the .surrender in Portuguese Timor will be undertaken in concert with the Portuguese Government. The surrender in Ambon and adjacent Islands will be taken by Australian forces. As announced by the Prime Minister on the 29th August, the Government offered to provide an Australian force to accept the surrender of the Japanese Mr Heaxley. in Nauru and Ocean Island. Negotiations with the British and United States governments have been completed, and an Australian force has been despatched to those islands to take the surrender. Nauru and Ocean Islands are within the United States sphere of responsibility, and the Australian commander will accept the surrender as the representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Nimitz, and as the representative of Australia, for Nauru, and as the representative of Britain, for Ocean Island. Australia will continue to retain full responsibility for Papua and the Australian Mandated Territories and, as honourable members are doubtless aware, the surrender of the Japanese forces in the Australian Mandated Territories has been accepted by the general officer commanding the First Army, LieutenantGen eral Sturdee. Local surrenders in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands will be taken by Australian forces located in those areas. As the Prime Minister stated on the 29th August, the general principle adopted by the Government in regard to civil affairs is that, except in Papua and Australian Mandated Territories, Australia shall refrain from any extension of its present responsibilities for civil affairs in re-occupied territories. Such responsibility as is accepted initially during If practicable, Australian the military phase will pass to the South East Asia Command simultaneously with the relief of the Australian command in the respective areas. We look to governments having sovereign rights in those areas to assume full responsibility for them after the initial period. On the basis that, during the initial period of military administration, military responsibility for the restoration of the economic life in the re-occupied territories is broadly restricted to action necessary to prevent disease and unrest; the Government will accept responsibility for civil affairs administration to this limited extent. The Government understands that, it is the intention that civil governments shall assume responsibility for economic restoration as soon as it is possible, and with that end in view, close co-operation is being maintained between military and civil authorities. A further statement will be made to the House when finality has been reached on the matters which are at present under discussion. formation regarding the position in Java? the South Eastern Asia Command under Admiral Mountbatten.

According to my advice, the Dutch forces are uot yet well enough organized in these places to undertake this responsibility, and. it seems that the British forces will have to carry the major burden for a little while longer. I have been asked by the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) to reply to allegations made by tlie Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) on the motion for the adjournment of the House last night, regarding the activities of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission.

The only refrigerator sold, to date, by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in Queensland, was onecontained in a building at the Stuart-holme Convent. The Convent was taken over by the United States forces in the early days of the war, for use as a hospital, and was later returned to the Conventauthorities. The refrigerator was sold as part of the general adjustment with the Convent authorities for £78, which is the maximum price allowed by the Prices Commissioner for a second-hand refrigerator of the particular model and size concerned. The only other surplus government-owned refrigerators that have been sold of late in Queensland were some out of repair machines which were sold by public auction by the Allied Works Council to the highest bidder. The details are as follows:-The auction was held at Enoggera and five refrigerators were sold at £52 10s. each', which is the ceiling price. ' Two machines were sold at £47 10s. and £32 10s. respectively, Before the Australian but both were in need of repairs. At an auction at Virginia, Queensland, five refrigerators were sold at £52 10s. each, which again is the ceiling price, and two iu need of repair were sold at £47 10s. and £32 10s. respectively. Two were sold in North Queensland at £67 to the agents for the refrigerators. There have been no sales of refrigerators, as alleged by the Leader of tbe Australian Country party, to friends or officers of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. All transactions conducted by the commission are open to public inquiry, and I challenge the right honourable gentleman to furnish any definite information in substantiation of his charge. I agree with him. that the allegations are most serious, and, in fairness to the officials of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, I agree also that they should now call upon the right honourable gentleman to furnish' to me, or to this House, the information on which he based his allegations. , The second '.allegation refers to the disposal of motor cycles in the Cairns",49,Adjournment South West Pacif Ic Area Re Organi Zation Commonwealt H Disposals Commission Canberra House Tenan Cy Of Soldier S Wife Aus Tralian Prisoners Of War Publica

79,Mr Beasley,"If the withdrawalarea. Al l motor cycles sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to the trade are examined by the commission's technical officers, and the prices at which they are sold to the trade are determined, first, on the maximum ceiling price approved by the Prices Commissioner and, secondly, on the basis of the repairs necessary to put the machines in good condition. Up to date, the vast, majority of motor cycles released by. the Army to the Commonwealth Disposals Cominisskm have either been wrecked machines or cycles in need of major repairs. Hundreds of motor cycles have been without wheels and. tyres, which were removed during the difficult days of the New Guinea campaign for use on jungle carts to transport wounded from forward areas. Many of the machines have had no engines in them, and the prices at which they have been sold, on many occasions, have had direct relationship to their condition. In the resale of motor cycles, the agents and distributors arc restricted to the margins of profits and the ceiling prices determined missioner. Up to date, 7,779 motor cycles have been released to the commission for sale throughout the Commonwealth. Of these, 5,478 have been sold. Of the remaining 2,301 cycles, no fewer than 438 are beyond repair. It is interesting to note that the commission in the fortnight ended the 4th September sold no fewer than 866 motor cycles, which would disprove any charge that the commission is not repeatedly liquidating its surplus stock. I should like to make it perfectly clear that under the conditions laid down by the commission for the liquidation of stocks of motor cycles, it is impossible for a sale to take place in the manner indicated by the Leader of the Australian -Country party. The right honourable member's next charge, in regard to the disposal of motor vehicles, is equally unfounded. Let me make it quite clear that, whilst it is the policy of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to market motor vehicles through the original vendor company, the commission's plan covers the utilization -of every representative of everymake of vehicle marketed in Australia. 3fr. Beasley. includes not only the major motor companies, but also all metropolitan and country dealers, and agents for every make of motor vehicle. In this way, the commission links up with its distribution every garage in every town which has held any agency for any make of vehicle. As at the 18th August, 11,047 motor vehicles, not including motor cycles, had been declared to the Commonwealth Disposal? Commission. Of these, 7,117 had been sold. Of the remaining 3,930, no fewer than 1,130 were wrecked vehicles, or portions of vehicles, lying in isolated areas throughout Australia, including the Northern Territory and other almost inaccessible spots. The commission is endeavouring to salvage any parts of value from these wrecked vehicles, and the balance will be written off as being of no commercial value. As at the 18th August, therefore, the commission had only 2,S00 vehicles to sell in the whole of the Commonwealth, and during the month of August it sold no fewer than 1,798. This entirely disproves the right honourable member's statement that the comby the Prices Commission is not handling the vehicles as quickly as they become available. The commission plans during September to market no fewer than 3,000 vehicles, provided that these are made available, and there is every indication that they will he made available, and it plans to increase this total, if possible, to 4,000 vehicles to be marketed during the month of October. The commission will continue to liquidate surplus vehicles at the maximum rate until the absorptive capacity of the Australian market has been reached. Whilst the commission's plan provides for the reconditioning of vehicles before they are sold to the public, the private buyers, if they so desire, purchase the vehicles in an unrepaired condition from the trade at a corresponding reduction of the purchase price. The prices at which motor vehicles are sold and the margins allowed to the trade have been determined by the Prices Commissioner, and, where repairs are effected, the Commonwealth Disposals Commission ensures that they are faithfully carried out. The right honourable member's next. . charge relates to the disposal of 13,600 This motor tyres. Every tyre made available to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission is marketed as quickly as it is received, but, unfortunately, the vast majority of releases at the moment, including the 13,600 referred to by the right honourable gentleman, consist of non-commercial types of tyres, suitable only for use on service vehicles. The only avenues for the use of these tyres are on such vehicles which are now being sold by the commission, and every opportunity is being .given to purchasers of these vehicles to buy additional tyres. In view of the right honourable member's concern in regard to country distribution, I wish to announce that, up to date, no less than TO per cent, of the motor vehicles sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission have gone to country areas. This is a result of special instructions issued by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to the trade, and by arrangement with the Department of Land Transport. The right honourable member was equally incorrect in the charges which he made against the Commonwealth Disposals Commission with regard to food, and T should like him to bring forward any concrete evidence in substantiation of his charges. It is entirely incorrect to or, if of a non-commercial type, by public say that any private individual in Queensauction. land has bought stocks of Army surplus food from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The only service foodstuffs which have been marketed in Queensland have been cereals returned to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission from the United States Army. Such stocks of these cereals as were fit for human consumption were sold back to the original vendors of the food, i.e., Kellogg (Australia) Proprietary Limited and the Sanitarium Health Food Company, and these two companies have re-marketed the cereals through normal trade distribution channels. The prices at which the food was sold back to these two based upon actual original purchase cost. En addition, the United States Army banded back certain quantities of food unfit for human consumption. This food has heen sold to the Poultry Farmers Cooperative Society in Queensland for .poultry users, under conditions which would not permit of it being marketed for human consumption. I ask the right honourable member to substantiate his statement that any person in Queensland has purchased foodstuffs from the commission in the circumstances indicated by him. He referred to foodstuffs in other States. Apart from certain cereals in New South Wales and Victoria, which were sold in the same manner as those in Queensland, the only other stocks sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission were in Western Australia, where they were, in the main, sold in bulk to Unrra for immediate shipment overseas for relief purposes. The small quantity marketed in Perth for local consumption has been sold through the ordinary trade channels at standard trade prices. The commission is at the moment dealing with certain goods returned by the' United States base exchanges, and it might be of interest to honourable members to know that 1,000,000 lb. of sweets returned by the United States authorities are being released to Unrra. Additional items from these American stocks are being handled by Food Control, as agent for the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, hut they will be sold only through trade channels in consultation with industry, From the outset, the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) and 'the Commonwealth Disposals Commission have determined that the liquidation of surplus war stocks in Australia shall follow what the Americans describe as the "" Goldfish Bowl policy "", i.e., that every sale and every method of sale will always be open to the fullest public scrutiny. The commission has gathered behind it, in its liquidation problem, the full forces of the Australian trading community. In addition, it is utilizing to the maximum the assistance of Commonwealth agencies which originally devoted manufacturing companies was their time to the procurement of the goods which they are now assisting the commission to sell. At the moment, the-commission has in course of publication a booklet covering every aspect of the liquidation of certain surplus stocks, which lays down in black and white for the information of all the procedure adopted in the sale of surplus goods. I shall be happy to arrange for the commission to furnish honourable members at the earliest moment with copies of this publication, and I am sure that they will then be better informed regarding the policy and practice of the commission than some appear to be at present. The business community ' of Australia, through the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Manufactures has, on many occasions, expressed the utmost admiration for the way in which the Commonwealth Disposals Commission is handling this most difficult task of liquidation of surplus war stocks, and the Government also has complete confidence in the integrity of its officers and in the commission's activities up to date. If the right honourable member will, in the light c' my reply, furnish any concrete evidence of any misdemeanour on the part of any officer of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, investigations will be immediately made, but I believe that my reply will clearly indicate that he has apparently been listening to whispers which have no basis. I hope that the right honourable member garage proprietors were not being given will have an opportunity to read over an opportunity to recondition secondthe statement prepared by the commission hand vehicles, which were being made which I have just read to the House, available to city interests. I should like and a copy of which I shall give to him. to have a conference with the Minister If he can help mo in any way by showing in that regard, because I am sure that that there has been any departure from he will recognize that it is a very bad the practices which I have outlined or thing to centralize even the repair of that any persons have been involved in motor vehicles when that service can be questionable practices, I shall be grateful. performed in country garages.

81,Mr Pollard,"What right has themade which were published in the press of Australia, and conveyed the impression to those who read them, particularly to Mrs. Pedvin, that grave reflections had been cast upon the character of this woman. .So moved was she by what she had read in the newspapers of the statements that had been made by the Minister under the cover of the privilege of this House, that she wrote to him a letter, a copy of which she has forwarded to every member of this House. This morning, I asked the Minister whether he had received that letter, and to substantiate his statements in order that Mrs. Pedvin might have an opportunity to clear any reflection that might have been made upon her. The Minister not only treated my question with contempt, but also, and again by the inference and innuendo which have characterized his handling of the case, implied that I was the author of the letter, and pretended to be confused as to whether it had come from me or from Mrs. Pedvin. Eventually, he took refuge in the statement that he would pass the letter on to the Committee of Inquiry that was appointed by the late Mr Curtin as Prime Minister. The question that I asked this morning dealt with a matter with which that committee is not in the slightest degree concerned. It was directed to a statement, made in this House only a few days ago, for which the Minister was personally responsible. I had nothing whatever to do with the letter sent to the Minister by Mrs. Pedvin. I have not been in correspondence with her, nor have I had any meeting with her since I questioned the Minister last Friday, and had no knowledge of what action she proposed to take. so much trouble on my hands from certain AlthoughI have been vilified whenever I have raised the matter, I have met the woman only once, and throughout have acted entirely at the request of ex-servicemen in Canberra, who consider that the woman has been treated very harshly, particularly in view of the fact that her husband is a"" prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese. It is not yet known whether Pedvin is still alive, or will return. In view of all the circumstances, the handling of the matter by the Government constitutes nothing but a [186] disgrace to the Parliament. This is the letter which Mrs. Pedvin sent to the MinisterFlinders Way, Griffith, Canberra. 6th September, 1945. The Honourable J. A. Beasley, M.P., Parliament House, Canberra. Sir, You arc reported by various newspapers aB having made the following statement on the 31st August in the House of Representatives:It might be a good thing if Corporal Pedvin were back in Australia. I am particularly anxious that he should return at an early date. Another prisoner of war involved in similar circumstances has already returned, and his comments when invited to discuss domestic matters which had arisen during his absence were very interesting to the department, which gladly dealt with his case . . . The interests of some persons might not be well served if certain matters of a strictly domestic character were ventilated. able member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) who interjected earlier, whether he would not regard that as a reflection if it were said in relation to anybody who was near and dear to him? upon anybody. tinuedThis statement appears to have been made in reply to a question as to when the report by a committee appointed by the late Prime Minister on the 6th March last would be made. You have gone out of your way to reflect by insinuation upon my conduct and character the inference from your statement being that if and when my husband returns I will have matters of a strictly domestic character that an issue such as eviction will be of minor importance. Coming from a senior Minister of State, who is also the Chairman of the Committee appointed to investigate and report on my case, the members of the House and the people who read the press reports must believe that you are in possession of information of some disgraceful conduct on my part, for only such information could be claimed to justif y an attack, under cover of parliamentary privileges, on the character of a woman whose husband, because of his absence in the defence of his country, is unable to defend his wife from calumny.

While I am anxious to nurse his mind and body back to health you apparently are anxious to try to show him that his wife has "" let him down "". It would not be the first time that the crucified has been offered a crown of thorns. My first reaction, apart from indignation, to your unwarranted insinuations against me was that even if there existed the slightest evidence of domestic troubles due to any misi*onduet of mine, such matters would be the concern neither of your committee nor of the Department of the Interior. There is only one issue, and I quote it from the announcement of the late Prime Minister:-The circumstances surrounding the issue of a notice to Mrs. M. E. Pedvin to quit premises. I have assumed that the committee appointed by the late Mr Curtin was judicial in its character, and I will, therefore, while way that sets an example to every the matter remains sub judice, refrain from comment on the issue beyond drawing attention to it. I would point out, however, that from your remarks it would appear that it is your intention to avoid that issue by placing me on trial, and if this your intention succeeds you have already constituted yourself as the judge and also the prosecutor. The terms of your insinuation are capable of any interpretation that anybody cares to place upon them, and you therefore cannot . leave the matter as it stands. I invite you, under cover of privilege, to give definite details and to make perfectly clear .what your insinuations amount to. Then, and not till 1 then, can I take steps to clear my character. It is my intention to post a copy of this letter to-morrow to each member of the House of Representatives. Yours very truly, MABY E. PEDVIN. Thia morning I asked the Minister committee as chairman, or he would whether he had received the letter, appoint a senior Minister to do so.

It i * a poor reflection on this Parliament that as scon as a citizen seeks to assert her rights, and in doing so embarrasses .» Minister because of administrative acts by a government, they should be subject to calumny under parliamentary privilege, supported frequently by some member* of the back benches. I have only met Mrs. Pedvin on one occasion, but I have been informed of her by Canherra returned soldiers of high standing. I am told that she is a woman of high character, has outstanding qualities, and has conducted her home in a wife whose husband is ahsent on service. She has clothed, cared for, and educated her son on the small pittance which she has received from the Army, and has endeavoured to maintain a home for her husband just as it was when he left Australia three or four years ago. This is the woman who, because she has stood up for what she regards as her rights, has been subjected to reflections of the vilest character. I mentioned this case as far back aa March last. I believe that the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, was deeply touched by it, and immediately I raised it in the House he undertook to appoint a committee to investigate it . He said that, if he could, he would serve on the Certain properly investigated. The committee Australia. The honourable member has now been back for some time, and my courteous question last Friday, asking when the committee would meet and complete its report, was answered by the most scathing insinuations against the character of the woman concerned. It is now high time that this case was settled. Irrespective of any abuse which may be levelled at me from the opposite side of the House, I shall not be silenced on the matter until the report is presented. for the Army) [4.2],-This morning the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) asked me certain questions with regard to the reason why the names of prisoners of war who returned to Australia yesterday were not made available to the next of kin, and also whether the Director^General of Public Relations was still exercising censorship over press releases. I now inform the honourable member that next of kin of prisoners of war in process of repatriation were advised that the men were returning shortly after the ship on which they were travelling left the port of embarkation. Next of kin were also ""notified that they would receive advice a short time before the ship was due to arrive, and that advice would include the time and place at which they could meet the repatriated men. In accordance with that undertaking, next of kin were notified approxiin the areas under the United States commately 48 hours before the arrival of the ship of the time and place where they could meet the soldiers concerned. This procedure was adopted for security reasons, including preservation of the safety of the ship in which the soldiers were travelling. Advice has been received from the Navy that a number of Japanese submarines have not yet surrendered. With regard to the censorship of press correspondents' messages, it is advised that if articles written by any correspontransmitted direct from the point of dents in areas occupied by Allied forces are being held up, the responsibility does not rest with any Australian military authority, but with the head-quarters commanding the area concerned. There has been a regular flow of correspondents' stories from the area which is an exclusive Australian responsibility, and to facilitate the receipt of these stories Army signals channels are made available for their transmission. No rigid censorship has been exercised by the Director-General of Public Relations over news emanating from any areas of Allied occupation. Insofar as stories concerning prisoners of war are concerned, the following are the censorship directions issued with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces, already announced in general terms by myself in the House on the 30th August last:(a) Correspondents may send the names of recovered prisoners irrespective of whether advice of their recovery hag been sent to Australia officially but subject to the observance of any general procedure laid down by the Theatre Commander. (b) Correspondents are at liberty to interview recovered prisoners. (c) Correspondents may not refer by name to any prisoner believed to be dead or missing. It will he noted that the first of these instructions is made subject to the observance of whatever procedure may be prescribed by the commander of the theatre concerned. In the United States theatre, for instance, a procedure has been prescribed that names of recovered prisoners shall be withheld from publication for 24 hours subsequent to the despatch of the official communication of the essential casualty data to the adjutant-general. It would appear probable, therefore, that mand this procedure has been made uniform in its application to all national forces in these areas. On the other hand, the South-East Asia Command, apparently, is following the Australian procedure set out above, because lists of names of Australian prisoners have already been telegraphed from Singapore, and published in Australian newspapers. In the area of the Australian command the only correspondents, with the exception of a few Dutch representatives, are Australians, and their despatches are origin to the employing newspapers, &c., subject to no greater delay than that caused by atmospheric interference with radio transmission. Similarly, there does not appear to have been any delay in the transmission of the stories of Australian correspondents at Singapore, and",56,Adjournment South West Pacif Ic Area Re Organi Zation Commonwealt H Disposals Commission Canberra House Tenan Cy Of Soldier S Wife Aus Tralian Prisoners Of War Publica
