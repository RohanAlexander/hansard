The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to alleviate the inequity of the application of the GST back in 2001 and to compensate country people for the iniquitous application of the GST. I will just give a very brief example. In some country towns the price of fuel would have been about 90c a litre and in some cities the price of fuel would have been around 70c a litre, so obviously a 10 per cent application of the GST would make a discrepancy of 2c a litre. At that time the government quite rightly put into place a grants scheme which removed that inequity. A number of comments were made at the time which, just for the record, I would like put into Hansard. The President of the National Farmers Federation at the time, Ian Donges, who is a friend of mine-and I am very disappointed to hear that the National Farmers Federation are actually supporting the removal of this scheme at the moment; I cannot believe that an organisation such as that would be in favour of higher prices of fuel for country people, as they have recently suggested-said: The effect of high fuel excise taxes has long been an impediment to rural businesses and rural communities, so the new grants schemethat is, the Fuel Sales Grants Schemewill be a significant commitment by the government. He said it: … will help reduce the unfair price differential between metropolitan and rural prices. The Treasurer, Peter Costello, was interviewed at the time by John Laws. Mr Laws asked: Do you still believe that there are limits to compensating country people for the GST hike in fuel? The Treasurer said: No, no. What I’ve said in this, the Government policy is, the excise will be reduced so that with the application of GST the price is the same. And that has to be done according to the Constitution, that’s what I said. That has to be done according to the Constitution. But I’m pretty confident that we have now got a Constitutional scheme which will accomplish that. What he is referring to is the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme.

189,Mr Windsor (New England) (9.40 A.m.),"I rise on a very important matter, not only toAgriculture: Fire Blight Disease Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.43 a.m.)-This is not the first time that I have spoken in parliament about the consequences of a bacterial disease called apple and pear fire blight, which we do not have in this country. It is a devastating problem. Once a country has this disease, it cannot be eradicated. It makes the growing of apples extraordinarily high cost and environmentally damaging because you must use antibiotic sprays such as streptomycin. We are not even fully aware of what the extent of the environmental damage would be if we had to start using those sorts of sprays in our orchards, which still depend on insect and bee pollination, for example. In the case of pears, you do not have the disease apple and pear fire blight and a viable pear industry. Pears are simply wiped out. Pears are the fundamental building block of our fruit manufacturing industry in Australia. Over 80 per cent of Australia’s pears are grown in my electorate of Murray, and without those healthy pear orchards SPC Ardmona would not be able to do the sort of job that they are internationally renowned for in canning some of the best fruit cocktails and fruit juices, because pear is the fundamental ingredient. As well, in regard to the current requests from New Zealand to have us import their fresh apples, there are other free riders-a number of pest species which not only infect apples and other pome fruit but can get loose on other commercial crops and into our own indigenous flora. Of course, the Rosaceae family includes indigenous Rosaceae species in Australia, and we are not fully aware of what apple and pear fire blight would do if it infected these indigenous Rosaceae family specimens. All up, this is extraordinarily bad news should our country get this disease. We have been mercifully protected so far. Biosecurity Australia have to respond to requests from a country to review the quarantine status of its product, and just recently they have had to reinvestigate the issue of exports from New Zealand in the form of fresh apples. Biosecurity Australia have brought out a draft interim risk assessment. They have just, mercifully, extended the time for community and stakeholder feedback, based on science and technology, challenging the protocol they have proposed be put in place. I commend the industry, which is working very hard in a very limited time to demonstrate that Biosecurity Australia has not put up a sufficiently strong protocol as a proposal at this point in time. There is a great deal of information and evidence still out there in the international and local scientific community which says that this is a disease you cannot avoid with simple measures like chlorine dipping of apples, visual inspections and cool storage for six weeks. Of course, we may only argue on the science; this is not a trade issue. I know my colleagues on the other side of the chamber share the concern about this disease, and we certainly do support the work of Biosecurity Australia. Their reputation is strong-they are a good agency-but in this case we want to make sure that the science is right.

The provision and roll-out of broadband Internet services by Telstra is a farce, particularly in our older suburbs.

190,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (9.46 A.m.),"I rise this morning to speak about the appalling lack ofyear, Telstra spent $14.8 million on broadband advertising, which is beyond belief, given that it cannot even provide the service to a majority of its customers. Just last week, a constituent of mine from the Perth inner city suburb of Wilson contacted me out of pure frustration. This constituent is covered by Telstra’s Cannington exchange. However, his street is serviced by a remote integrated multiplexer-an RIM-exchange service which does not allow ADSL access. The Cannington exchange was ADSL enabled in October 2000, yet 3½ years later residents cannot access ADSL in these RIM areas. I decided to follow up my constituent’s complaint with Telstra, and their response was staggering. Telstra says: ‘For commercial reasons, upgrades are demand driven, so customers wanting ADSL in the RIM areas serviced by the Cannington exchange need to register their interest on the ADSL demand register.’ But guess what? When you ring to register your interest, you are told that the Cannington exchange is already ADSL enabled. It is a contradiction. These people are being misled, and I am sure they feel as though they are banging their heads against a brick wall. The broadband delivery farce was also highlighted to me by another constituent in East Cannington. The four streets that form a border around his street all have ADSL access but, for the 40 or so residents of Groundlark Close, ADSL is a dream. A simple customer multiplexer-a CMUX-joint is needed in the exchange box about 500 metres from Groundlark Close, but again Telstra just will not respond to customers’ demands. The reality is that Telstra has an ageing network. Executive members of Telstra have openly said this, but they have still gone ahead and spent millions and millions of dollars advertising broadband. These funds should have been directed into fixing infrastructure so that people in metropolitan and regional areas do not have to put up with a patchy ADSL network or, in some cases, no access at all. We have heard much of the Howard government’s pork-barrelling in these last few weeks, and here is just another example of that pig being fattened up again. The government are desperate to privatise Telstra. They want to wash their hands of a vital telecommunications service that the people of Australia need. Telstra deserves to be treated as a national asset. It needs government majority ownership and control to ensure regulation. These commercial reasons for lack of service provision just do not cut it. We need the network to be maintained and ageing infrastructure to be replaced so that customers receive access to reliable services. Cost cutting so that bottom line operational figures look good for potential buyers shows the government’s utter disrespect for Telstra customers. I hope that the government will come to their senses and realise that the full sale of Telstra is against the wishes and the needs of ordinary Australians. Health: Services Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.49 a.m.)-I commend the House on the passage of the MedicarePlus bill, the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2004. I know it is going to be of incredible benefit to people in my electorate. In particular, the mums at home with numerous kids, who are always given responsibility for collecting the rebates from Medicare, are really going to enjoy HIC Online, whereby all rebates can take place at the point of sale. We are all used to the EFTPOS system and now getting that EFTPOS system to flow through to our medical expenses as well is going to be a great boon, especially for mums in my area who have to get on a bus to get to a MAIN COMMITTEE Medicare office, which is open only from nine to four on Monday to Friday. It is not the most convenient time, especially if you have young children and have to use public transport. I would also like to see private health companies offering a card which, in conjunction with the cards that they currently offer, perhaps could include your Medicare card. It could be a real smartcard that has all your health information on it, including your kids’ immunisationswhich stage of immunisation they are at-and any X-rays that have been taken of your family. It could also include things like the date of your last Pap smear test and any prescriptions you are on, so that you would always have that information with you. I, for one, would be quite happy to pay for something like that, but if the private health insurance companies develop the product and roll it out with their current infrastructure they could include it as a benefit within their private health insurance, which would be a great innovation in terms of their technological delivery of health services. Another part of the health package is a number of medical places. The member for Parramatta and the member for Macarthur support me in the push for a medical school at US where all the places are bonded to the Greater Western Sydney region. I suggested 80 places, but I have had discussions with Janice Reid, the Vice-Chancellor of US, and it appears that she is pushing for 100 places, and a larger medical school would be more viable. No doubt, over time, we will need that many and more to cater for the GP need in the Greater Western region. Fifty-nine per cent of the Nepean division of general practitioners live outside the Nepean region and, as they grow old and retire, we are not seeing any younger doctors coming in. So we need to develop our excellent students within our area and allow them to go to medical school in our area and then practice in our area. If they have never left our area, it is not really a problem to get them to come. I think a Western Sydney medical school, with places in Nepean and Liverpool hospitals for clinical training, must happen. I urge Bob Carr to match our funding. (Time expired) Howard Government: Policies philosopher, wrote, ‘There is nothing more despicable than success based on fear,’ yet we know that so much of the Prime Minister’s rhetoric is based on exactly that: the wedge, the divide, the manufactured fear-asylum seekers, gay marriages, sex discrimination, MedicarePlus, public and private schools, Telstra, and weapons of mass destruction. You name it and he will find it. As certain as night follows day, prior to the 2004 federal election the government will find some more. But the question to ask is: will they work or will the national focus be somewhere else? No-one in Australia should accept that poverty, isolation or disability can deny access to a good school or a good health facility, yet that is exactly the situation that faces an increasing number of Australians every day of their lives. Under this government the unacceptable has become the accepted. To have a vibrant social democracy, a vision must be present and agreed upon, a route must be set and the delivery of the vision must take place. For increasingly more Australians, the Howard government has forgotten this trinity and its purpose for being in power.

You only have to look at question time throughout this week to see evidence of that. Certainly government needs to control the economy. However, that simply means keeping a handle on interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Though some would have us believe otherwise, it is not exactly rocket science. The great disappointment about this government is the dearth of ideas, other than basing success on fear. Although controlling the economy for the past eight years, that discipline is also being heavily eroded as election day comes nearer and nearer. Francis Bacon once wrote that money is like muck-not much good unless you spread it. It is a quote the government ought to remember. I conclude by using two other quotes, one from that great conservative, Lady Astor. She said that the main dangers in this life are people who want to change everything or nothing. Lady Astor certainly knew what conservative governments were all about. And we know into which category the Howard government is falling and failing. But Mark Twain gives those of us in opposition some anticipation of change. He said: ‘Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could not succeed.’ The Prime Minister is a fox. We all know that. But he is looking like a very old fox. Of course, old foxes do not take any advice. That is why they run into cars and trucks. And we know who the car or truck is! (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Sugar Industry a full appreciation of the work performed by the Australian government funded Rural Financial Counselling Service, and in particular the work of Steve Medley, its counsellor in Bundaberg over recent times. Throughout his 12 months in this role, Mr Medley, a former regional area banking manager, has dealt with dozens of local canefarmers needing help with financial matters, debt management and streamlining farm operations. The Bundaberg RFC operation is acknowledged as being efficiently run and responsibility managed. It is also on the record that Mr Medley is fulfilling-and fulfilling well-the requirements of his position’s description. However, the Bundaberg RFC position was only ever funded for 12 months and was in fact granted a three-month extension, involving an extra $15,000, because of the delay in launching the service. So, at the end of this month, just a few days away, we will see the conclusion of the program. Local authorities and sections of the sugar industry are prepared to support Mr Medley in the interim, and I thank them for their collaborative attitude. However, the cessation of the RFC position will leave something of a gap in support services for cane farmers in the Bundaberg, Isis and Kolan districts. As I have let relevant ministers know, one of my personal priorities in crafting the revamped sugar industry assistance package is the creation of fully funded positions in sugar-growing areas. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries gave an assurance that it would place its own counsellor in the Bundaberg district. While I do not question the ability or dedication of the DPI counsellors, I maintain that our sugar growers deserve a dedicated resident professional to strengthen support services available to them. I believe such a program would need to run for one, if not two, years. I have made that point clear to the various ministers involved. MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Statements By Members

BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 March, on motion by Mrs Vale: That this bill be now read a second time. Delivery) Bill 2004 provides for the electronic receipt of many communications with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Veterans’ Review Board, the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council. The bill gives those electronic communications legal status. At the same time, the bill regularises and standardises the form, language and processes of those communications. Until this bill, all communications with respect to claims and lodgement of documents with DVA and its agencies had been exempted from the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act. This act required the electronic communications with the Commonwealth to be given legal status. In making the provisions needed to bring veterans’ matters in line, the opportunity has been taken to standardise processes, form and language in the principal act. These changes affect claims for most benefits, advice, applications for reviews, change of circumstances, withdrawals and most other communications between veterans and DVAs. The bill is therefore purely technical with significant housekeeping by way of simplification and standardisation. It is therefore supported. As we know, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act is a very complex piece of legislation. It has many unique characteristics which have evolved over 85 years of operation. Needless to say providing for electronic communication in an act designed only for pen and paper is a dramatic change. However, it is not only the act which needs to be changed. Changes such as this dramatically affect internal departmental processes. It assumes that all electronic systems have the capacity to handle electronic communication-which some do not. It assumes that record keeping of electronic communications is also possible. It assumes that the veteran clients also want to do business this way-which some do. Certainly, in the modern world, this type of communication is very efficient. In the future we can expect the majority of business to be transacted in this way. So to that extent this bill is an inevitable sign of that process. It is also a sign that veterans’ business is not going to diminish. While ever we have defence forces we will have conditions of service providing for those unfortunate enough to be injured or to require treatment as a result of their service. It is important that they be delivered as efficiently as possible. MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Statements By Members

As the member opposite discussed in the early part of his speech, many veterans do avail themselves of access to the Internet. I have quite a few people in my electorate who do thatfor example, Don and Ronda Herrmann. Ronda, in particular, has some illnesses that make it very difficult for her to go outside. This is the case for many vets too. If that is the case, how do you then go in and complete all these forms, get all this paperwork done and access the services of the department? Ronda is not a veteran, but she is an older member of the community who likes to be involved in community activities. She is able to use the Internet to contribute to the community and be practically as active as she has ever been in her life, and the veterans community is able to do that too under this bill. The idea that you should have to pick up a piece of paper and scribble your name, your submission and everything on it in order to access government services is really an outmoded view, I think. We now have a situation where plenty of people can do it simply by tapping on a couple of keys and that submission goes immediately into the system. You do not have to hop into your car or, if you are disabled, call up your neighbour, get in their car, go all the way into town and make your submission; you can do it instantly. One of the immediate advantages that flows out of that is that your form is lodged straight away. The time that it takes you to get into town or post the letter is not part of the issue. Through this, you get immediate lodgement. This is, of course, a much improved situation.

220,Mr Cameron Thompson,"As I said, I do want to speak specifically in relation toment’s modernising and updating of the system to make it as convenient and practicable as possible for Australians. It is the next step in upgrading technological delivery of government services. I welcome this application of technology. The Veterans’ Entitlements Act may be 85 years young, but it can be improved all the time. This is another way in which we do it. In my community of Ipswich, Dr Hilda des Arts, who has unfortunately passed on, really pioneered the application of IT and its benefits in the seniors context. She was a pioneer of the group known as SeniorNetA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.13 a.m. to 10.24 a.m. step in a process where we are providing greater technological delivery of government services. It is an important opportunity not only to communicate better with the community but to ensure that government is provided in a more efficient way. The efficiencies that are created when, for example, we move to electronic lodgement are quite significant. It is something that we must keep very closely focused on. Every time we move from all this paper shuffling to an electronic document that is able to be filed directly, we create an opportunity for savings in effort by the public servants whom we employ to carry out these duties. I think it is important that we continually review, review and review to ensure that the benefits of that are then passed on. As the member for Cowan said, there are people who seek to lodge documents electronically, but there are also people who do not. We do not want those people to be disadvantaged by the fact that they are still tied to paper documents. Perhaps they are in a more remote location or are on a tougher wicket. WhatI am saying here today is that by making savings through the use of electronic lodgement we can then redirect those savings to provide better services to the ones who need it. They are the ones who are more disadvantaged. They are the ones who do not have a computer and probably will never own one. They probably would not want one if we went and gave it to them. That is a fact. We need to continually review and take those savings. It is not just a matter of having a bureaucracy that remains constant or continues to grow in size and continually taking away work from it by providing for electronic lodgement and improved technology. We have to look at it and say, ‘Do we need such a big bureaucracy? Can we reduce or can we redirect that to provide a better service?’ Veterans definitely demand good service. They have provided services to our country and they expect services in return. I think that, by engaging in this good practice, the government is providing that improved service. The services, the range of opportunities that veterans are able to access through the government, are getting larger all the time. We have seen another example of that in the new entitlements that have just been provided by the government in response to the Clarke report. They will be accessible through electronic lodgement. The government is now moving to index above the general rate component of the disability pension by MTAWE-that is, male total average weekly earnings-or CPI, whichever is the greater. There are 45,000 beneficiaries of that. Half of them, about 28,000, are TPI veterans. The rest include 14,500 veterans on the extremely disabled adjustment rate and 1,000 on the intermediate rate. So there you are. I think it would be difficult to say that increased efficiencies are totally responsible for providing the money that is available to the TPI people in those categories, but they are a factor. By MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
221,Mr Cameron Thompson,"I was saying before the suspension that really this is aproviding increased efficiencies we are improving the capacity of the government, of the taxpayers, to make things better for veterans. It is likewise with rent assistance. Recommendation 83 of the Clarke report stated that rent assistance should be provided in addition to the existing war widows pension and income support supplement. The number of widows affected by that is 11,500. Some of them will be able to access that through the use of electronic forms on the Internet, and that will make it much easier for them. By engaging in that process and realising the savings, there will be more opportunities down the track to extend benefits such as rent assistance to a wider number of people. Similarly, in recommendation 91 of the Clarke report, it says that the maximum funeral benefit should be increased to $1,000. The government has moved on that and it has moved on rent assistance. All of these things will be able to be accessed by people using the electronic measures that I have spoken about. This is not inconsequential. The member opposite might laughthe ability of people, through electronic lodgement now, to access a wider range of government services. Why is there a wider range of government services? Because we have achieved greater efficiencies by providing things such as electronic lodgement. I welcome this. I think that it is significant. I am pleased that the government are providing that increased range of services and it is important that we continue to do so. So, by being more efficient, we are able to provide a better range of services. One thing that concerns me is whether or not we are able to continue doing that. It is most important that the government remain focused on the needs of veterans. As I said before, these are people who have made their contribution to Australian society. They have helped to make Australia a much better place and, for that, all Australians are greatly appreciative. It is important that the government maintain the focus and I am pleased that I am part of a government that does that. Long may that be so and long may we keep that focus. This bill will allow veterans the flexibility that comes with the technology of online lodgement. The government is expanding the options available to our veterans and making the processes as simple as possible. It allows for the better delivery of repatriation services. It allows our veterans to have online access to information and services. This is particularly important in regional areas such as those that I represent. It breaks down the distances and gives people immediate access to information and services. As I said, by providing savings, it also creates the opportunity for us to improve services to those who are unable, unwilling or whatever to get involved in the electronic age. It does mean that we can reach out to everyone by using these devices. Applications, claims and other documents can be lodged electronically or by mail or in person. The bill builds on a successful trial held in Tasmania, which I know will be very much of interest to the member for Franklin. That trial conducted by the government demonstrated the efficacy of electronic lodgments. So, even in Tasmania and every other rural part of Australia, we are able to take advantage of this change. It is an important one. Our repatriation system is keeping pace with online technology. It is another example of the government’s commitment MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery

223,Mr Cameron Thompson,"No, it is not a wide-ranging debate-I am talking aboutto improving service delivery and technology. As I said, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act has been in operation for 85 years. The government is focused on the need for continuous reform in this area and for providing improved benefits and improved means of delivery. For that I am very appreciative. I commend the bill to the House and urge members and those within the veteran community to maintain their focus on improving the process of service delivery to our veterans. tlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 but I had a father who was an original ANZAC and a mum who was a war widow, who passed away recently. Also, I have a few veterans having a few hassles. SoI thought I would take this opportunity firstly to congratulate the government on this initiative. As the honourable member for Blair said, it is the result of a successful trial in Tasmania with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. As representatives of that state, the honourable Deputy Speaker Adams and I are always of the mind that lots of things should be trialled in Tasmania. We have a population of 470,000 and it has been a pretty sedentary population up until recent times. Things can be trialled rather successfully down there because of the networks. SoI congratulate the Tasmanian Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I would also like to compliment the department on the level of service they provide to the many veterans and war widows in Tasmania. They do an excellent job. Occasionally there are a few concerns about communication, which I hope to raise in this brief speech today. The second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs stated: This bill marks the next step in the government’s ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community. It builds on the commitment to the use of new technologies in veteran service delivery ... It goes on about lodging information electronically. I would be interested to hear from the minister what percentage of information is lodged electronically currently and what percentage is expected as a norm and average once this has been up and running for a few years. As we journey through life we will see veterans age and pass away. I would like to know whether there is an expectation on the part of DVA that total communication with veterans will be done electronically. The young veterans who served in the gulf wars of 1991 and 2003 are used to having computers at home and at work. Will this be the modern trend? I ask this question because, as I said, my father was an ANZAC veteran and amongst my collection of memorabilia is his very first RSL badge. He told me of the hassles and trials and tribulations of veterans when they came back from the First World War and how that built up to the successful and wonderful movement that we all acknowledge today, the RSL. Those were a couple of questions that immediately came to my mind. Talking of communication, which is mentioned in great detail in the act, one of the things that does worry me about the service for veterans, especially in remote rural and regional areas such as the ones that the member for Lyons and I represent, is that quite often communication with government departments is through 13 numbers and 1800 numbers. I know that my late mother, who lived over 300 kilometres from Melbourne, had to communicate with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in Melbourne. I am interested to know how all this is going to change. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
224,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.33 A.m.),"I was not intending to speak on the Veterans’ EntiSenators and members have a way of bypassing that by having the direct numbers of state managers of various departments. If we come across blockages in the system or see inequities or injustices, we can pick up the phone and ring the state manager of DVA, Centrelink or the Child Support Agency, and we can weave our way through the bureaucracy. But many of our veterans from the Second World War are now in their 90s and I know that people of that age have a fear of administration and bureaucracy and they are reluctant to push themselves forward. They have come from a different generation. I am thinking of a couple of 91-year-old veterans who are very close to me-almost second fathers-who have had hassles with DVA about getting taxis, changes to payments, access to the gold card and those sorts of things. Rather than pursuing things with DVA, they will say: ‘Okay, that’s life. I have been used to hardship. I won’t really push it any further.’ We have a couple of groups-we have the old diggers from the Second World War, as I said, in their late 80s and early 90s; we have the Korean, Malaysian and Vietnam veterans, and now we have the Gulf War veterans. WhatI am trying to say is that, if there is going to be a simplification of information one way and information the other way, I think it is a wonderful idea. As I said-and I am not sure whether the departmental people heard me before-for lots of people the 13 and the 1800 numbers are a bit of a turn-off. Communication is a two-way thing, and veterans expect nothing less, and I think they deserve nothing less, than the best. I want to raise a couple of issues that relate to this whole communication thing. Just recently I congratulated the government for their recent announcement, when they sorted out the mess over the Clarke report, that the 13 Korean POWs, or their widows, have got their $25,000 ex gratia payment. I congratulate the government for that initiative. But I would also like to raise the issue of those World War II veterans who were in the European theatre, who were POWs and who still have not got anything. The 91-year-old I have been talking about today is a real person who spent 4½ years in absolutely appalling conditions in German POW camps. As someone with a wife whose family is Lithuanian, I have heard first-hand about the conditions that even the local people experienced in the latter part of the war, with German and Russian involvement in those critical areas. I know for a fact, having spoken to Jack Shepherd and his cobber, that they did experience things-not as bad as the Japanese POWs but, I can assure you, just as bad and horrific as the Korean POWs. They are not going to be with us much longer, and I think they deserve the $25,000 ex gratia payment. Finally, in relation to this idea of communication and the introduction of electronic disclosure and consolidation of information, I would like to talk about the Smith family who were overpaid. I have spoken to the minister personally about it, but there was nothing she could do. The Smith’s failure to notify of an overpayment was a genuine mistake on their part, but they did the right thing when the DVA came to them and said, ‘You owe us a whole lot of money.’ They sat down with the DVA and said: ‘We can’t pay it; we’re pensioners. I’m a veteran; my wife doesn’t work. We’ve got medical conditions. Take some money out of our pension. That’s the only way we can repay you.’ The DVA said, ‘Yes, fine.’ So they signed an agreement and it was put into the system. The Smiths were able to relax and think: ‘We’re going to live off less. We’ve made a genuine mistake. There has been a failure to notify on our part, but we feel happy that the matter has been resolved.’ Then, out of the blue, the DPP sent them a notice to appear at the Magistrate’s Court, and they are going to be sentenced next week. God knows what is going to happen. As I said, their health is poor. I went to the minisMAIN COMMITTEE ter and the minister said, ‘I can’t intervene,’ and I can understand that. But, if there has been a genuine mistake-and, following an arrangement, a communication, between the department and the recipient of the DVA benefit, money is being taken out to repay the debt-why in the name of creation are we going to punish a veteran and his wife by dragging them through a court in Hobart and potentially jailing them? Communication is a wonderful thing. If we get it right, everybody benefits. The communication trial in Tasmania worked wonderfully well. I compliment the minister on the initiative. This is a simple bill but, as I said at the outset, it is part of this progression. We are now moving on to information stored on wonderful computers. I hope that the DVA does not experience some of the things we experienced a couple of weeks ago in this place when the whole system fell apart and we could not communicate with our offices, nor our offices with us, and we could not access speeches and documentation or recall information; the whole world fell apart. I am delighted to speak on this bill. I congratulate the minister and the government on the next step in the process. If the few queries I have raised today have been noted by departmental officials and can be addressed, I would be delighted. I commend the bill to the House. important piece of legislation as the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004. I have the home of the 10th Light Horse Brigade in my electorate. The brigade has a wonderful history and those wonderful people are keeping those traditions alive. It is always a great privilege for me to be able to stand and speak in the chamber on any bill to do with veterans. The debate on this bill comes very soon after the government’s response to the Clarke report. I notice that my honourable friend the member for Franklin referred to the good outcome of that-finally. It was a good outcome. I know that the veterans in my electorate are very pleased with the response of an additional funding of $267 million and with the acceptance of many of the 109 recommendations in the report. I particularly welcome the decision to link the portion of the TPI and disability benefits of the general rate to the male average weekly earnings in a similar fashion as for the service pension. I suppose that has to do with the bill in that these new programs-the electronic transaction programs-can deliver services to veterans much more efficiently online. That applies to lodgments and assessment, and people will have plenty of access via these services. The member for Blair mentioned a point that relates to me as well. I have an electorate of 25,000 square kilometres or so, much of which is in rural, regional and certainly outer metropolitan areas. Being able to use online services is a great boon for many veterans. While I acknowledge that some of them are still a little uncertain about this new method of accessing services, many of them are embracing it in increasing numbers. It reminds me of my dear late father who passed away last August. He embraced the new technology in his 80s with great enthusiasm. He could do everything and he could teach us lots about how to access services online. My dad passed away last year. He was 89. He had just the most wonderful time. He could not stay away from the computer. He was doing absolutely everything on it. I think lots of people in the community are getting involved and, through the Minister for Ageing, I know that we have federal programs to help older people learn to use the new computer technology. In that respect, this bill is very timely. People in the rural, regional and outer metropolitan MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
225,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (10.45 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak in the debate on such anareas of Pearce will have a much easier form of access. Being able to transact by email and perform other functions on the computer is a boon, especially to some of the older veterans or those who have mobility problems, of whom there are quite a few. It is a great thing. To return momentarily to the government’s response to the Clarke report, Clarke recognises those veterans who can no longer work because of service disabilities. As I said, some of those with service related disabilities have mobility problems and this bill goes to the heart of making access to services much easier. There is an economic loss component in disability pensions. Because of the disability, there is loss of potential earnings and so on. The Clarke report recognised this when it decided to change the way the pensions were indexed for the TPIs and people with a disability. In addition, 11,000 war widows and widowers will receive increases in their income support payments as well. Now they will be able to manage this on line. There are many benefits arising from the response to the Clarke report. I must say they are very welcome changes. Over the summer break I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr Bill Gaynor, the President of the RSL in Western Australia, and Mr Ross O’Connor, the Vice-President of the RSL in WA. They contacted me with regard to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003, which I think is currently in the Senate. We discussed that, the Clarke report and matters of general concern to the veteran community. I greatly value the kind of representations that were made. They were constructive and they went to the heart of matters, and there were many sensible suggestions made to improve the outcome of both the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill and the Clarke report. We have a very active veteran community in Pearce. In fact, on Australia Day this year the 10th Light Horse Brigade put on a fantastic display in one of my little country towns, which is basically a one-pub town, called Spencers Brook. They keep that tradition alive. It is really fantastic. They have a museum, which they tour around country shows so that some of our young people can gain a greater appreciation of our history and of what happened in those times. An enormous effort goes into liaising with schools and local communities to ensure that the tradition of ANZAC Day is observed. I very much value and appreciate my relationship with our veterans and those who are leading the veterans in Western Australia. In our contemporary world, we now operate substantially, both commercially and socially, via electronic media. People of all ages, from all parts of the globe, now communicate socially or for business via the Internet. Many of us are resistant-and I have to confess I was one of them-to making the changes. I suppose it is through fear. Our children and grandchildren now grow up around computers. It is nothing for them. My six-year-old and my eightyear-old can teach me a thing or two on the computer, I can tell you! But, although there are those who have resisted the change, especially those from the older generation, because they do not understand the technology, there are still a lot in the older generation who have embraced this new technology and who feel quite liberated being able to communicate widely. I have quite a few people in my electorate who belong to the University of the Third Age. I know they use the computer to study, to shop, to do their banking and so on. So they are pretty up with it. Many have recognised the great benefits that come from electronic communication. In 1997 our Prime Minister released a policy statement called ‘Investing in growth’, which outlined the Australian government’s commitment to putting all appropriate services online. This MAIN COMMITTEE gave rise to the parliament passing the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. The Electronic Transactions Act removed legal impediments that may have prevented people from using electronic communications in conducting business with the Commonwealth. It essentially gave validity to transactions that took place via electronic communication. There did, however, remain a number of exemptions. In 2001, the Repatriation Commission advised the minister that certain provisions of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act would require exemption from the effects of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. The exemptions entitled the Department of Veterans’ Affairs not to accept claims delivered to the department electronically. As with any major technological change, it really is important to ensure a smooth transition and have adequate time to make necessary changes so that the electronic claims and documents can be developed appropriately. There are good legal reasons for it, but also it is important that the community have time to adjust to a new system. Under this legislation, a unified system is designed to allow both electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I think it is very important that we allow time for people to become accustomed to electronic transactions and allow both systems to operate together for the foreseeable future at least. So those people who are not comfortable with electronic communications are still able to lodge their documents personally. As with most transactions, there is a need to have clarity as to what makes lodgement effective. Subsection 5T(3), for example, provides that a claim, application, request or other document that has been approved for electronic lodgement will be taken to have been lodged at the office of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs if it is transmitted electronically in the approved manner. The document received at the electronic address will be taken to have been lodged on the day that it has been received. These are the kinds of technical aspects to this bill that are important in a legal sense. The amendments will apply to the lodgement of claims, applications, requests and other documents under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and will not apply to any other information that is received by the department. The successful trial has already been talked about. It happened in Tasmania, the home state of our colleague the member for Franklin. This bill is another step forward in implementing the government’s program of improving service delivery and ensures the repatriation system keeps up with electronic services. The member for Franklin asked whether the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs was able to provide any figures on how many people make electronic lodgments to the department. Of course, that has not been possible in the past because they have not been offered electronic transactions. This bill will give effect to an ability to do electronic transactions, but I understand from the department that, during the voluntary trial, 22 per cent of people volunteered to use electronic transactions. I think that is a very positive number for a first-off trial of electronic transactions within the veteran community. I am sure we will see that number grow. As I said, I know that our Minister for Ageing has programs operating to provide funds to train and teach older people how to use computers to transact business electronically. As those kinds of programs become more available and older people take advantage of them, they will be much more comfortable in using the service. The delivery of services to the veteran community is enormously important. I think that whatever can be done to improve the ease with which veterans can lodge documents and conduct their affairs with the department will be MAIN COMMITTEE very welcome by veterans whether or not they wish to take advantage of the electronic service. In Western Australia, we deal quite a lot with the WA Department of Veterans’ Affairs, because we have quite a big veteran community within the electorate. I have to say that, in all the time. I have been there, which is now just over 11 years, we have had nothing but the best of service from the staff. I think they work very hard to provide a really good service. You get the odd hiccup but, by and large, it operates pretty smoothly. SoI am very grateful to those people in the WA department. As I said, we have come a very long way in ensuring a high standard of care for veterans over the years. Some papers that Bill Gaynor gave me contain a quote from Sir George Pearce, after whom my electorate was named. Former senator George Pearce was once the Minister for Defence, and I have Pearce air base in my electorate. His quote takes us back and shows us how far we have come. At the turn of the century, probably just after the First World War, he said: One of the saddest spectacles in the past has been to seen men who have been willing to risk their lives in the defence of the country left destitute and the dependants of men who have laid down their lives for the country having to live on charity. ... It would be an eternal disgrace to this young and rich Commonwealth if any of the relatives of those who are going to war had to beg for a living. We desire in this Billhe was talking about the first bill that was ever passedto make such modest provision as will keep the wolf from the door of those who are unfortunately bereaved of their breadwinners. ... This Bill also provides for a Pension for any man who is disabled or incapacitated so that he cannot earn his living or a living for his wife and family or others dependent on him. It is good to read that, because it shows us how far we have come and how important it is to discharge our obligations to people who are prepared to lay down their lives for their country. They are people who, in the course of their duty, may become injured or incapacitated in some way or may lose their lives. I am proud that we have dealt with these benefits in a bipartisan way and that we are all committed to ensuring that our veterans and their families can live their lives with considerable dignity. leave, because I think he would have appreciated the comments that I am going to make. But Deputy Speaker Adams, the member for Lyons-another fine member from Tasmania-is present. I am pleased to see the success of the trial that the Department of Veterans’ Affairs undertook in Tasmania. I am pleased because I would like to announce that I am about to become an honorary Tasmanian. On 12 June, my daughter Kylie is going to marry a very fine Tasmanian architect, Hobart’s leading up-and-coming architect, Chris Jacobson. On the occasion of their marriage, as Chris’s father-in-law, I will become an honorary Tasmanian. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I am looking forward to that. Back in Townsville, which is my home city, there is no doubt that the veterans’ community is electronically literate. Over the past several months veterans have had their voices heard through electronic communication with their federal member of parliament and indeed with members of parliament and governments right across the country. They are no strangers to the use of electronic technology. They are very good at talking among themselves. They have web MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
226,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.01 A.m.),"I am sorry that the member for Franklin had tosites and chat rooms. They have their own groups in which they talk to each other. They are very comfortable with using computer equipment, computer technology and electronic means of communication. It is therefore fortuitous and proper that the government is now moving to enable electronic communication between our veterans around the country and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Because of the provisions in the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 wherever veterans might be throughout the world they will have access to the DVA in a timely manner. I would like to pay tribute to Kevin Bycroft, the local manager of the DVA in Townsville. I appreciate the assistance that Kevin gives me, my office and my staff with respect to difficult matters that arise. The advice he gives is particularly important. Kevin is able to clear away some of the bureaucratic red tape that sometimes exists when veterans-who, understandably, sometimes do not understand the rules, regulations and procedures-lodge claims with the DVA. Kevin and his people at the DVA in Townsville are just magnificent in their can-do attitude to dealing with problems that arise. Nothing is a problem; there is always a solution. I can say very confidently that my office and the veterans who we all serve and look after very much appreciate the help from that office. This bill achieves two purposes. It is good to see that it has the support of all the parliament. It is going to unify all the existing lodgement provisions within the VEA, and that can only be a good thing. It is going to allow for both electronic and physical delivery of documents to the DVA. The member for Pearce outlined the importance of maintaining physical delivery of documents, but also the importance of now allowing electronic delivery of documents. The existing provisions require that for a claim, application or other document to be lodged, it must have been sent to the department at an approved address or delivered to a designated person. These amendments will include provisions for such documents to be lodged electronically at an approved address. In my view, the date of lodgement of the document is a very important point. The date that the electronic communication is received is virtually instantaneous from when it was sent, and the date that is recorded in DVA records forms the basis for calculation of benefits once a claim is accepted. Information provided to the department by telephone will not be subject to these amendments-that is also understandable. The VEA contains a number of provisions that refer to oral communication of information in response to a notice issued by the department. Other provisions will allow for the oral withdrawal of various written applications, and these are unchanged. This bill marks the next step in the government’s ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community. It builds on the commitment to use new technologies in veterans’ service delivery and the successful trial in Tasmania to allow veterans to lodge information electronically. I certainly have put a lot of effort into making sure that we get the best deal for veterans in Townsville and Thuringowa. In the last several months there has been significant interest in changes to entitlements and the way the VEA works. I certainly have had a strong part in all of that and played my role in standing up for veterans in the community. I give a commitment to Townsville veterans that I will continue to stand up for them in the Australian parliament. the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 and to follow the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay, who does a great job for his constituents in that part of the MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery

This is an important bill that aims to further develop the delivery of repatriation services to the Australian veteran community. We are in the age of information technology and it is important that we acknowledge and participate in this era. This bill provides for the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Under these amendments, claimants will now have greater options when lodging forms with the DVA. Instead of using existing methods such as normal mail, telephone, fax or lodgement in person, claimants may now choose to email claims, applications and other documents to an approved electronic address. Veterans will be able to submit forms at any time from their own home or anywhere else where they can access the Internet. Veterans will be able to apply online for services such as a disability pension or a war widows or widowers pension. In addition, veterans may apply for an increase in the disability pension and notify DVA of changes to their circumstances that may affect their pension. For the purpose of calculating benefits once a claim is accepted, the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, the VEA, relies on the date of lodgement of a document, which is why the amendments are vital. Through online submission, the delivery time of claims will be decreased. Both the electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans’ Affairs will be provided for by the amendments inserting a new general lodgement provision. The general lodgement provision grants that a document will be regarded as having been lodged on the date that it was received at an approved place or delivered to an approved person. The electronic communication of all claims, applications and other documents will be possible due to the inclusion in this bill of amendments to all of the lodgement and delivery provisions of the VEA. Through the amendments, the government is building on the success of the NOVEL program-the networked online veterans electronic lodgement program. The trial pilot offered online services to Tasmanian veterans from September 2002 and was then extended beyond the original four-month period due to the excellent way in which it was received. This bill is consistent with the Australian government’s commitment to putting all appropriate government services online and improving the access of all Australians to government information and services at all levels. By providing this online service to the veteran community, we are increasing the availability of online access to information and services, and this will assist in removing the constraints of distance and mobility experienced by regional and rural communities, older Australians, the disabled and the home-bound. The Howard government is committed to providing for Australian veterans, and this will allow the DVA to better meet the needs of the veterans’ community as a whole. Veterans will be able to access a service on a scale previously unimagined. This is not about removing a veteran’s right of choice to lodge documents with the DVA using conventional methods such as normal mail, telephone, fax or delivery in person; it is about providing more options to make that choice. The service of online delivery will complement, rather than replace, the traditional means of delivery services. Importantly, the security risks of providing the service have been addressed. The DVA has developed a secure online communications system which will allow the DVA’s service providers and the veteran community to communicate with the department via secure email. VetMAIN COMMITTEE erans will now have access to a service which is provided outside normal hours-whether it be in the evening, at the weekend or on public holidays-and this will result in many claims, applications or other documents being lodged on and therefore benefits being calculated from an earlier date than if the lodger had waited for office hours to physically deliver the papers, telephone or send them by conventional snail mail. I also want to take the opportunity today to talk about this government’s proud record in relation to veterans affairs. This is just the latest example among many of how the government is committed to addressing the needs of veterans. Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has increased spending on veterans affairs from $6.4 billion to more than $10 billion in the federal budget for 2003-04. By increasing spending on veterans affairs, the Australian government is acknowledging that as Australian veterans, war widows and widowers become older so their needs change and grow. The Howard government is certainly demonstrating this recognition of the ageing veteran community through the increase in spending in veterans health, where funding has risen from $1.7 billion in 1996 to a record $4.1 billion this year; the extension of the gold card to Australian veterans over 70 years old with qualifying service; and the introduction of veteran partnering contracts with private hospitals to broaden the availability of hospital care. Through programs such as HomeFront and Veterans Home Care, we are helping veterans and war widows to continue living at home. The government’s recent response to the Clarke report gave an additional $267 million over five years for veterans and war widows or widowers. The main aspects of the government’s response to the Clarke report included the exemption of recipients of a DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink, at a cost of just under $100 million. This benefits 19,000 veterans and can mean up to an additional $257 per fortnight for a single TPI recipient. It also ensures equity amongst veterans, regardless of whether they receive their income support from DVA or Centrelink. Forty-five thousand veterans will benefit from the indexation of above general rate, in the same way as service pensions, at a cost of $66 million. This ensures that the most disabled, those who cannot work or who can work only part-time, receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation. We have also granted to war widows and widowers rent assistance of up to $94.40 per fortnight in addition to the income support supplement at a cost of $73 million. This government has also provided at a cost of $27 million the funeral benefit, which will increase from $572 to $1,000 and will benefit 14,500 people each year. The Howard government has done more for war widows and war widowers in eight years than Labor ever managed. In addition to the recent announcement following the Clarke report, we have also indexed the war widows and widowers pension to male total average weekly earnings, or MTAWE, in 1998-99 at a cost of $163.7 million. In 2001-02 we restored benefits to widows and widowers who remarried prior to May 1984 at a cost of $86.6 million. We removed the freeze, initiated by Labor in 1986, on the ceiling rate of the income support supplement for war widows and widowers in 2002-03 at a cost of $84.7 million. The new Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat was also a beneficiary of government funding, receiving a grant of $50,000 in 1999 at the launch of the public fund-raising appeal and an additional grant of $150,000 in 2002 as part of the government’s commemorations program. Veteran and Community Grants announced in February delivered Australian government funding for organisations which provide care and support to the veteran community: in my MAIN COMMITTEE own state of Queensland, over $125,000; in Victoria, over $386,000; in New South Wales, over $265,000; in South Australia, almost $153,000; in Tasmania, $86,000; and in Western Australia a touch over $24,000. Veteran and Community Grants offer important assistance to projects that aim to improve the quality of life for veterans, war widows and their dependants. Organisations such as the Pine Rivers RSL sub-branch in my own election of Dickson have been worthy recipients of the grants. Projects have received Veteran and Community Grants for health education, lifestyle enhancement, community activities and support for carers and independent living at home. Veteran and Community Grants will assist projects across Australia with more than $2.7 million of funding during 2003-04. In our government’s response to the Vietnam Veterans’ Health Study we have also recognised the health needs of younger veterans and their families. One of the great aspects of my job is that I remain in constant communication with the veterans and their ex-service organisations and will continue to work hard to deliver to those who served the defence of our nation so well. Labor’s silence and lack of policies on veterans’ issues has not been left unnoticed by the veteran community. This bill will allow the veteran community to participate in the electronic age. Information technology is the way of the future and it is important to provide the services which are associated with this age. The amendments proposed in this bill are relatively minor; however, they are vitally important in relation to keeping pace with the electronic age. The changes made by this bill will improve the delivery of repatriation services to the Australian veteran community and therefore I commend the bill to the House. see that at last the Department of Veterans’ Affairs will be authorised to accept information from its customers and clients via the Internet. We have a very real obligation to do our utmost to help our veterans’ community and this bill does serve that. It is very pleasing to note that it has bipartisan support for bringing the DVA into the electronic age. The bill is designed to assist veterans and their families by providing better access to government services through the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the department. At present, the law requires documents lodged with the department to be physically sent to the department at an approved address or physically delivered to a designated person. Modern communications have now overtaken the need for what are at present anachronistic provisions in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The amendments proposed in this bill will help to bring veterans’ dealings with the department into the modern era-and it is a modern era that veterans are, by and large, astonishingly well equipped to move into. My colleagues have mentioned some of the advances in the utilisation by veterans of contemporary computer technology. The bill provides for the Repatriation Commission to determine the methods by which information is to be delivered to the department. It specifically includes for the first time the power for the commission to approve that a claim, application, request or other document may be lodged electronically. Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, the date on which a document is lodged with the department in many cases assumes a critical importance. It often forms the basis for the calculation of entitlements and can make a significant difference to the enjoyment of life for a veteran and their family. The bill therefore provides that, in the new section 5T of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, to be regarded as having been lodged, a docuMAIN COMMITTEE",136,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
228,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (11.19 A.m.),"I wish to support this bill and I am pleased toment that is approved by the Repatriation Commission for electronic lodgement not only must be sent to an approved electronic address but also must be received at that address. Under section 5T the document which is lodged electronically will be taken to have been lodged on the day on which it is received at that approved address. A document that has been sent electronically to the department but has not been received at the approved address will not be regarded as having been lodged. These may seem to be pedantic points but, as I said, the date of lodgement and receipt are of fundamental importance in a number of cases to the ability to get the full measure of veterans’ entitlements. The Repatriation Commission will be able to determine which claims, applications, requests or other documents will be approved for electronic lodgement under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Claims, applications, requests or other documents which are not approved by the commission for electronic lodgement must continue to be lodged at a place or delivered to a person approved by the commission for this purpose. It is worthwhile noting that the commission has a degree of discretion over what it will accept and not accept, but I do believe that the commission will use its power to the maximum extent possible to facilitate electronic lodgement. There are 127 items in the schedule to this bill. All of them relate to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and are about facilitating electronic communication. As just one example of the improvements made by the legislation, I would like to focus on items 4 and 5 of the schedule to the bill. Items4 and 5 amend a particular paragraph of sections 14 and 15 respectively of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Section 14 deals with the requirement for a claim for a disability pension. Section 15 deals with the requirement for a claim for an increase in the disability pension. Under the old sections 14(3) or 15(3), a claim for a disability pension or for an increase in that pension was required by paragraph (a) to be in writing and by paragraph (b) to be accompanied by such evidence as is available and relevant. Under paragraph (c) the claim was required to be made by forwarding it and any accompanying evidence to, or delivering it at, the office of the department. Paragraph (c) has been amended, and the new paragraph (c) in each of these sections provides only that a claim is to be lodged in an office of DVA in Australia in accordance with section 5T and will be taken to have been made on a day determined under that section. This will mean that, once the commission gives approval for electronic lodgement of such a claim, a person wishing to claim a disability pension or an increase in such a pension under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act will have the additional option of lodging the claim by email at an approved departmental email address and the date of lodgement will be the day on which that email is received at the address. Any evidence required to be lodged in support of a claim may also be lodged by email if it lends itself to that process. This will clearly be to the benefit of disabled veterans and will be welcomed by those concerned with veterans’ well-being. The bill will not change the existing arrangements covering the provision of information to the department by telephone, such as information provided orally in response to a notice or the oral withdrawal of various types of written applications. These amendments are in line with the government’s commitment to putting all appropriate government services online. Until now, the DVA has had an exemption from this general trend. This bill will bring the department into line with the bulk of the public service. I wish to conclude by saying that I believe some very important steps have been taken in terms of the MAIN COMMITTEE government’s response to the Clarke review to improve the situation of our veterans. I think that an important aspect of that was that the cabinet was willing to review the matters that had arisen under the response to the Clarke committee and to adopt a very effective response to the issues raised by that report. I commend the bill to the House. Delivery) Bill 2004 brings together two very important themes. Firstly, it addresses the questions of care, attention, concern and simplification of life for our veterans. Secondly, it does that by bringing to pass some of the government’s initiatives in relation to electronic delivery of services. It is a very simple combination and it is the latest in a series of different initiatives to help the veteran community. In particular, this initiative will help veterans from RSLs such as Hastings, Crib Point, Dromana, Rosebud, Rye, Sorrento and Cowes within my electorate, all of whom play not just a social role but also an important role in ministering to the pastoral and personal needs of many of the veterans who suffer and have significant problems with which they need to deal. In looking at that, I want to deal with three things. Firstly, I want to deal with the background of Australia’s response in relation to veterans’ affairs and the needs of our veterans. Secondly, I want to deal with the importance of these changes, specifically in relation to the electronic delivery of services. Thirdly and very briefly, I want to deal with some of the provisions. Under existing provisions for a claim, an application or other document must be properly lodged by having been sent to the department at an approved address or delivered to a designated person. In other words, it has to go physically to the right person. People need greater access to essential government services. The physical barriers for some veterans mean that it is more difficult to access these services where it involves postal or personal delivery. It is just a fact of life that, for veterans with real, severe physical challenges, sometimes it is simply not possible to take those steps. These amendments seek to ensure that there will be electronic lodgement of claims, applications and other relevant documents to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. It is about making life simpler and easier. It does not cut off any options; it simply opens up a new electronic delivery channel which is a way for veterans to communicate with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and access their entitlements. Not all veterans are in a position yet to be able to do that-that is absolutely the case. But there are many who can do that. One of the things that we should be doing is trying to educate, inform and encourage our veterans so they will be able to use electronic services. This bill comes against a particular background. I am delighted that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is in the Main Committee because, in particular, I want to refer to the government’s response to the Clarke review and the major amendments and outcomes from that. The recommendations that the government has accepted from the Clarke review of veterans’ affairs can largely be grouped into five broad areas: firstly, service eligibility; secondly, access to the gold card; thirdly, benefits for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans and access to disability benefits for recipients; fourthly, rehabilitation; and fifthly, a selection of other measures. In particular, I want to commend the government’s action in providing an additional $267 million over the next five years to implement these recommendations. Perhaps the most important of the recommendations, and one on which I particularly commend the minister on the MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
229,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.25 A.m.),"The Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Electronicadvocacy and the fight that she showed within the cabinet, was ensuring that the TPI benefit would be calculated in future not just against the CPI but against male total average weekly earnings, known as MTAWE, or the CPI-whichever is the greater over a time frame. That is a very important practical issue and a very important symbolic issue for veterans. I am delighted that we have been able to deliver that. It is a big step forward. It was a challenge. I spoke in the House only a number of weeks ago advocating this. I am pleased that the cabinet and, in particular, the minister have been able to take steps on that front. I think it is a very important step. In addition, under the Clarke review we have seen an increase in funding, with a rise in pension rates from 20 March this year of $11.40, to $464.20 a fortnight, with the maximum rate for couples to increase by $9.60, to $387.60 per fortnight per person. The TPI pension rose this year by $8.40, to $771 a fortnight. However, veterans in need, such as a single TPI recipient on an age pension with no other income, will be eligible to receive an additional $257.60 a fortnight. These are all practical and real improvements, along with the fact that more than 19,000 disability pensioners who receive their income support from Centrelink will benefit from the change and on average will receive an additional $40 a fortnight. Perhaps a very important thing, because I know that I have some people with strong connections to former Korean prisoners of war, is that the government has accepted the committee’s recommendations to extend an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War and the widows or widowers of prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War. This is in particular in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions they endured. They served Australia. They were captured. They suffered. It is critical that we recognise the extraordinary level of suffering they went through. The benefits in the Clarke review are not one-offs. They follow on from a consistent pattern of recognising and caring for the veterans community in the period since 1996. In particular, since coming into office in 1996 we have increased spending on veterans affairs from $6.4 billion to $10 billion in the federal budget for 2003-04. That is an increase dramatically in excess of the CPI rate. It is a real and tangible increase in the benefits available to our veterans community. In addition, the Howard government has shown its commitment by increasing spending for veterans’ health from $1.7 billion in 1996 to a record $4.1 billion this year. It has more than doubled the amount of spending over that eight-year period. Furthermore, as of 20 March 2004, dependants of Australian Defence Force members killed in compensable circumstances on operational service will be entitled to a range of indexed compensation benefits which will be significantly increased. I hope that the need for this is negligible but I recognise that, where there are service men and women who have given their lives, it is utterly incumbent upon the government to ensure that their families are compensated in a real, meaningful and significant way. That brings me finally to the questions in relation to the government’s commitment to electronic resources under this particular bill. The bill is in line with the government’s commitment to putting all appropriate government services on line since the passage of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999. This act aimed to remove the existing restraints which prevented a person from utilising online resources in order to fulfil obligations under federal law. It is recognition of the fact that, as a society, our means of communications have evolved, are evolving and will continue to evolve. MAIN COMMITTEE The Electronic Transactions Act applies to all Commonwealth laws after July 2001, unless they have been specifically excluded from the legislation. What that means here for veterans is that we will be able to simplify and make easier the way in which they can submit their claims, their applications and their documentation. I think those steps, whilst we do need to educate, provide information and give teaching to the veterans community, are important steps forward. I believe that this bill, whilst largely technical in nature, is a continuation of the decisions we have made since 1996 to dramatically increase the benefits available to the veterans community and, most recently, under the Clarke review, with the most important decision being the change to increase the rate for TPI by calculation against not just the consumer price index but also male total average weekly earnings-whichever is the greater over the time period. Finally, this bill helps with these simple changes to allow electronic lodgement of documents, which will assist our veterans and make their lives easier. I commend this bill and wish it speedy passage through the House. ments and the support this morning for the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment (Electronic Delivery) Bill 2004 from the member for Cowan and the member for Franklin, and I also acknowledge the government members who spoke on this bill and recognise their very strong commitment and support for the veterans in their own electorates. These members were the members for Blair, Pearce, Moncrieff, Herbert, Dickson, Kooyong and Flinders. I was lucky enough to visit the electorate of Flinders and meet veterans and hear their concerns directly on a special visit arranged by that member. Members have emphasised the importance of ensuring that our veterans and war widows have efficient and practical ways of contacting and working with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. As members have stated, the circumstances and ages of our veterans span a great range. Ensuring that services are delivered in a way that meets the needs of all our veterans is a priority for our government. We are committed to maintaining a comprehensive repatriation system that recognises the special standing and the special needs of the veteran community. This bill is further evidence of the Australian government’s recognition of the need for improvements in the delivery of repatriation services to Australia’s veterans and their dependants. The repatriation system provides a range of benefits to compensate veterans and their dependants for injury, disability or death resulting from their service during wartime or other conflicts. The changes made by this bill will improve the efficiency of the delivery of those benefits and the other services that are provided to veterans and their dependants under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The bill is designed to achieve two purposes: the unification of all the existing lodgement provisions within the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and provision for both the electronic and physical delivery of documents into the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The bill contains a series of amendments that will enable the electronic lodgement of the documents required by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs for the provision of benefits under the act. In providing for the electronic communication of claims, applications and other documents to the department, the amendments will not impact on the existing arrangements that provide for the physical delivery of those same claims, applications and documents. I would like to address some of the issues raised by the members for Cowan and for Franklin. The member for Cowan has implied that the introduction of this legislation will comMAIN COMMITTEE",141,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
230,Mrs Vale (Hughes,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (11.36 a.m.)-I welcome the compound issues concerning the handling, retention and storage of all electronic records by the department. I wish to assure the Main Committee that the department and the other authorities established in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act will ensure that all electronic documents will be handled and stored in accordance with the advice and standards promulgated by the National Archives of Australia. The member for Franklin raised issues concerning current practice and expectations about future usage of electronic means of lodgement. At the moment, it is not possible for the department or the Repatriation Commission to accept electronic claims. The trial in Tasmania involved the issuing of passwords and electronic access to both veterans and members of the ex-service community. Approximately 22 per cent of the claims lodged during the trial period were lodged electronically. I would expect that the use of online services will be an increasing feature of the way veterans, ex-service organisations and their families interact with my department. I remind members that, under TIP and the BEST program, the government provides funding to assist ex-service organisations with their role as advocates and pensions officers, including funding for information technology. This bill will assist both veterans and their families directly, as well as the hard working volunteers who assist as pension officers and advocates. This government has demonstrated a commitment to veterans and their families to improve the repatriation system to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of those who have served our country. The passage of this bill provides another step forward in the government’s ongoing program of improvements to the delivery of services to the veteran community by building on our government’s commitment to the use of new technologies in service delivery to veterans. It will ensure that the veteran community continues to enjoy the high standard of compensation and care that is provided by the repatriation system. I also take the time to point out that this commitment is reflected in the $10.1 billion allocated to this portfolio in the last budget, 2003-04, and a further $267 million in the government’s response to the Clarke review, which was of great concern to the veteran community. This is very important legislation for the future for the delivery of our relationships with our veteran community and their families, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee Report Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by Mr Jull: That the House take note of the paper. this debate on the report of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into Iraq. As I indicated yesterday, this is a very important report. I indicated also that I think the members of the committee did a sterling job in being able to bring down a report that highlights deficiencies in our intelligence-gathering capacity without the use of any intemperate language. Given the nature of the matters that have been considered by the committee, it was very important that that was the way things were handled. SoI commend the committee and its secretariat. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Veterans Entitlements Amendment Electronic Delivery
231,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (11.42 A.m.),"I rise to continue my contribution toButI do think it is important for the record that we note the government’s deficiencies in handling this matter. It is fair to say that, arising from this report, we will have a better understanding of what we need to do to ensure that we have intelligence agencies that are fully competent and well resourced to undertake their mission. However, it is also important to reflect upon the government’s conduct in receiving information, the manner in which they used that information and on some occasions, it has to be said, distorted the information, the advice received, for, it would appear, their own political purposes. I do believe that, just like with the Mick Keelty affair, the government are in denial in this area if they believe that they did not in any way distort or exaggerate the assertions that have been made by our intelligence agencies. If the Prime Minister believes that he and other ministers did not distort and exaggerate the information received, he has certainly lost touch with the public perception of what has happened. As is now clear, axiomatic and overwhelmingly supported by most Australians, Australia is a greater target of terrorism as a result of our involvement in the Iraq war, and it is something that the Prime Minister seems unable to comprehend. Again, he and the government fail to understand that this report sheets home blame to him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the government at large due to the way in which they have conducted themselves. As we know, and it is on the record for everyone to see, the primary basis upon which we prosecuted a war against another sovereign state was to remove alleged weapons of mass destruction. That was the prime reason given by the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the executive to prosecute a war. There has been an attempt at historical revisionism by this government; it appears they now want to find reasons post facto to justify the decision to go to war. Whilst there is a unanimous view held by members in the House that the regime in Iraq was awful, autocratic and violent, the fact is that the removal of that regime was not the basis upon which we went to war. Whilst that is a beneficial consequence, that was not the explanation given by the Prime Minister to Australians for sending our young men and women so far away to fight. It is important that when a government makes such an important decision-and there is no more important decision than the decision to send young Australians to war-it analyses not only Australia’s intelligence capacities but indeed the conduct and motives of the government in involving itself in this matter. This report clearly indicates the Prime Minister’s failure to do that. There were a number of what I assert to be misleading comments by the government in the lead-up to the war. The report concluded: The statements by the Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC judgements ... In particular, in the 4 February 2003 speech to the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister quoted the findings of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK and the key judgements of the National Intelligence Estimate of the CIA. In both of these documents the uncertainties had been removed ... These dossiers comprised stronger, more emphatic statements than Australian agencies had been prepared to make. We now know that the information in those dossiers was in fact wrong, that it was overstated and, further to that, that the Prime Minister exaggerated those claims. I would have thought that, when it came to such an important decision, a strong leader, a leader with integrity, would place the lives of Australian soldiers and Australia’s security at home before everything else. This report, handed down by the committee, has indicated that there are some areas in the intelligence agencies that we have to rectify. But, more fundamentally, the conduct and behaviour of this government has to be challenged: it should never be able to use the excuse MAIN COMMITTEE for war for its own political purposes. The committee’s report underlines the misconduct by this government in that regard. (Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.49 a.m.)-In rising to speak to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into Iraq, I would like to join with the member for Burke in commending the work of the members of the committee and congratulating them for putting together such a fine report-a report in which the committee would have found it very difficult to come up with any unanimous recommendations. Also, the inquiry was limited in its scope-and that is noted in the report-which impacted on the members of the committee. This report confirms what everyone in this parliament and everyone in Australia knowsthat is, our Prime Minister and this government are loose with the truth, particularly when it comes to the war in Iraq, the need to send Australian troops to Iraq and the causes in relation to this war. This government has a philosophy: ‘You never let the truth stand in the way of doing what you want.’ In this particular circumstance, it was: ‘You never let the truth stand in the way of committing Australian troops to war.’ Our troops-young men and women-had to go and put their bodies on the line for the purpose of this government misleading the people. As I said in my speech on the war in Iraq on 10 September 2003: Truth has been a victim of this government for a long time. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and many members of the government unleashed a tirade of propaganda and justification for sending Australian troops to Iraq. Underlying this, first and foremost, was the need to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that this government constantly emphasised existed in Iraq. However, not everyone in the Liberal Party was convinced by the argument that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The Liberal Party national president, John Valder, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 January, said: Does anyone seriously believe that Iraq constitutes the greatest problem confronting the world? Even Major General Alan Stretton said that he was ‘unconvinced about the veracity of the US intelligence reports presented to the United Nation’s by the Secretary of State Colin Powell’. Unfortunately for us here in Australia, our Prime Minister and our government were not prepared to question. They accepted the most extreme intelligence reports that were given and at no time sought to find out what the real truth was. The foreword to the report said that the United States and the United Kingdom argued that the war in Iraq was necessary because it was important to disarm Iraq, as it was believed that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq. They argued, the report detailed, that intelligence had revealed that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and therefore we should go, gung-ho, into Iraq. There was no questioning whether or not these weapons existed, and there was plenty of information available to raise the antennas of a government that was really watching the situation and was seeking the truth. A government that was not loose with the truth would have asked questions about these reports that were coming in about weapons of mass destruction. The reports were not really verified by our own intelligence agencies-but I will talk a little more about that in a moment. The report recommends that we need to have independent assessments. It questions the accuracy of assessments and mentions the need to look at that. It also recommends that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of intelligence agencies, so it is MAIN COMMITTEE looking at the performance of intelligence agencies. I note that the committee also recommends that there should be a more comprehensive inquiry into the issue of weapons of mass destruction. When we look at how this government, which is so loose with the truth, seeks to get out of our commitment of troops over the fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been found, we find that the government argues that it did not doctor or sex up the documents and intelligence reports that it received. I would argue very strongly that it was just very selective about those that it chose to read and those that it chose to accept, and that there was no checking of the veracity of any reports that it received. Our Prime Minister went to a barbecue with the President of the United States, back in July 2002, I think it wasMr Brendan O’Connor-The cookout. made a decision there that he was going to back his mate President Bush in a war in Iraq. He did not look at the consequences, he did not look at the impact that it would have on the Iraqi people and he had no long-term plan about when the troops would be removed from Iraq. He admitted yesterday in parliament that it is a long-term commitment. Who knows how long we are going to have troops in Iraq-two, three, five, 10, 20 years? Look at the situation that existed in pre-war Iraq and at the situation that exists in postwar Iraq: there was a functioning society in Iraq prior to the intervention and, subsequently, there is ongoing conflict and constant terrorism. That brings me to the government’s attack on the head of the Federal Police, Mick Keelty. I have to put on record that I think it is absolutely deplorable-a disgrace-that a government would attack the head of its law enforcement agency in the way that this government has, simply because he stated a fact that is quite obvious to all Australians: as a result of us committing troops to Iraq, we are a higher terrorism target. It has got to be so. You cannot get around the fact. If you commit Australian troops to this type of a war, if you take the line and direction that this government took, you have to place yourself as a greater target of terrorism-end of story. But the government chose to shoot the messenger, as it often does; we have seen many examples of the government shooting the messenger. Another defence that this government have used for being in Iraq is that it does not matter if they were wrong about the fact that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction; they got rid of a dictator. But I would argue very strongly that it does matter. Time and time again, this government told us that we were going to war in Iraq purely and simply because we wished to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that existed. It is important to turn to some of the statements that were made by the government prior to Australia committing troops to Iraq. On Lateline on 18 July 2002, our Minister for Foreign Affairs said: ... I don’t think there’s any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. I put it to this House that, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs had sought to find the truth-if he had really been interested in whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction-he would have allowed the weapons inspectors to continue their search. Rather, he was more interested in political spin. He was more interested in the justification of a war that his Prime Minister had committed Australia to at a barbecue with the President of the United States. As such, I would say he was not putting an honest picture to the Australian people. Once again, MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Committees
232,Ms Hall,"Yes, the cookout, as the member for Burke says. And the Prime Ministerhe was being loose with the truth. The Prime Minister, on 7 August 2002 on Radio 5DN, stated: Iraq does have weapons of mass destruction. It is believed they have the capacity to develop a nuclear strike capacity within the not too distant future. Once again, we have a Prime Minister who did not seek to verify the statement he was making, who was obviously loose with the truth and who was determined to honour his commitment to the President of the United States at the barbecue the previous month. The government also said, on 12 August 2002: We have ... indications that in the last four years he has expanded his chemical and biological weapons ... This is not backed up by the Australian intelligence agencies. The Australian intelligence agencies provided ‘hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of the threat’-that is from the committee’s report, at paragraph 2.40. Once again, we have the Prime Minister being loose with the truth and not seeking, in any shape or form, to verify the statements that he was making or allow full investigation of whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction. On9 September 2002, once again we have the Prime Minister, on AM, saying: There’s no doubt, on the evidence of intelligence material available to us, that not only does Iraq possess chemical and biological weapons but Iraq has not abandoned her nuclear aspirations. Where is the evidence, Prime Minister? That is what I ask. I might add that the report that we are debating in the Main Committee today does not provide the evidence or verify the statement that the Prime Minister made. It demonstrates very clearly that the Prime Minister and the government were loose with the truth and that there was no substantial evidence to support this argument. Once again, on 9 September, the Prime Minister reiterated that same statement. On the evidence of the report we have before us today, I think this government should apologise to the Australian people, it should apologise to the head of the Federal Police and it should immediately put in place a strategy to withdraw our troops from Iraq. This report shows once and for all that this government has been loose with the truth, that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that the government did not seek to verify their existence.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Regional Roadshow State Director, ABC Tasmania and all his crew, both national and Tasmanian, for the excellent roadshow that they brought to the north west coast from 14 to 19 March. It was an extraordinarily well-organised and very successful roadshow.

234,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.05 P.m.),"I would like to congratulate Rod Batten,gional communities. I believe it was also a test case to see if there was potential application to other states. On behalf of the community of the North West Coast, I say that it was a resounding success. I encourage other communities to urge the ABC to take this roadshow-this veritable road caravan of entertainment-to their regions. There were outside broadcasts by ABC local radio, including the ever-popular Country Hour. ABC Television’s Stateline was presented directly from Devonport. There were free evening concerts in Burnie, Smithton and Devonport. The ABC exhibition trailer featured interactive displays of ABC Television, ABC Online, ABC Radio and ABC Enterprises. There was a demonstration of the new digital television outside broadcast van, which is worth a cool $7 million. I believe it passed the application test, because hundreds and hundreds of schoolchildren went through it, pushing all the knobs and turning all the handles. I believe it came through with flying colours. There were also appearances by B1 and B2. Gardening Australia-now there is a program-recorded local segments for national replay. As you all know, the place I come from is so fertile that if you planted a toenail it would grow a foot. That will be demonstrated on Gardening Australia. The ABC’s Managing Director, Mr Russell Balding, visited all the centres. I had the great privilege of meeting Russell and his lovely wife. Twenty-one staff from around Tasmania and some from Sydney went on the road, along with our local ABC presenters, who do such a fine job. The tour commenced in Burnie then went to Smithton, which is in the magnificent Circular Head part of my region, and ended up in Devonport. ABC Radio broadcast 30 hours of information and entertainment from our three centres. I am told that 65 local people were interviewed. They did a terrific job. As we all know, you can get a bit nervous if you are speaking on the radio or speaking in public; but they did an excellent job, because everything they say in the electorate of Braddon comes from the heart. The concerts featured 20 local performers, ranging from a comic to a nine-piece band, which gave a wonderful heartfelt performance. People were able to participate in the roadshow through the ABC’s excellent online services. Stateline, which is a very popular program in Tassie, went live from Devonport, with three local stories and two interviews on location. About 3,000 people, including the school students I mentioned, inspected the ABC’s exhibition trailer and digital outside broadcast van during the three-day roadshow. About 2,000 people attended the three concerts. In fact, they were sell-outs-you could not get in. Those concerts, which were broadcast across Tasmania, were excellent. Apart from Beccy Cole and Adam Harvey, who record with ABC Music, the highlight of those shows was our local entertainers. The standards were so high that even I was not good enough to get a spot to present a song or two. Importantly, through this roadshow, ABC staff have become a lot more aware of community dependence on the ABC. I think it is very good that they get community feedback so that they can truly appreciate how important the ABC is to rural and regional Australia. The local print media provided extensive, positive coverage of the roadshow. The possibility of having a roadshow-a veritable caravan of delights-will be put to other ABC branches throughout Australia. I urge every local community that has the ABC, which is so important these days, to look at this roadshow and invite the ABC to join their community. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Fisher Electorate: Health and Ageing Administration) (12.10 p.m.)-Those honourable members who are present in the chamber will be well aware that I am privileged to represent the most beautiful part of Australia, namely Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. Ms O’Byrne-Second most! Sunshine Coast of Queensland. So many people are moving from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to sun belts like the Sunshine Coast, and we are pleased to welcome people from Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and other states who want to join our Sunshine Coast community. The Sunshine Coast, particularly the electorate of Fisher, is one of the ‘oldest’ areas in Australia as people move from around the nation to retire in a place that has a wonderful ambience, a wonderful climate and a tremendous lifestyle. While we welcome all these people, the rapidly increasing population of seniors means that as a community we have certain challenges. That is why I was particularly pleased to be able to entertain the Minister for Ageing on the Sunshine Coast, twice in the last week. We do have a need, of course, for an ever increasing number of aged care facilities, and the minister is exceptionally focused on the needs of the Sunshine Coast, as indeed she is on the needs under her portfolio right around the nation. The Minister for Ageing came along to a number of events and she opened the Southern Cross Care facility in the Caloundra city area. The Southern Cross Care facility is run by the Knights of the Southern Cross, which is a Catholic organisation, and it will provide 40 highcare and 60 low-care places, all funded by the Australian government through the 2001 aged care approvals round. Southern Cross Care operates seven residential aged care facilities and two community aged care packages in Queensland, with a total of 94 high-care places, 257 low-care places and 55 community aged care package places. The Caloundra facility has been built on the same site as the first stage of the Caloundra Rise retirement village. I have to say that I was particularly impressed with the minister’s words, as were other people in the audience. I am always pleased to see community input and so many people in our community have put in so many hours to make sure that this Southern Cross Care facility is the excellent facility that it is. Honourable members will be interested to know that the Australian government has provided more than $30 million in 2002-03 in recurrent funding for residential aged care and community aged care packages in the electorate of Fisher. The Sunshine Coast region received 159 extra aged care places as part of the 2003 aged care approvals round. That is a tremendous investment by the Australian government in the lifestyle and living situation of so many seniors on the Sunshine Coast-but of course we always need more places, and I will certainly be continuing to fight to make sure that we get not only our fair share of those places but more of them. I believe that as a government we have played a tremendous role in the area of aged care since we were elected to government in 1996. All of us here are particularly proud of what the Howard government have achieved in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Adjournment

I set up the Fisher Seniors Council with a range of representatives from a number of seniors organisations in the electorate of Fisher. I think it is very important that as the local member I receive input and feedback from people on government policies, and suggestions for improvements to government policy. Mrs Maureen Kingston AM is the effective chairman-the deputy chairman in name, but she chairs the meetings when I am not present-of this organisation. I must say that, as the local member, I have found it particularly useful to be able to receive this input and I just want to place on record publicly my thanks to the members of the Fisher Seniors Council. I mentioned the two visits by the minister. She also returned to the Sunshine Coast to open the Maroochydore office of Carers Queensland, which provides support for carers in our region who provide valuable assistance, often in trying circumstances. I thank the House. (Time expired) Health: Australian Resource Centre for Healthcare Innovations Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.15 p.m.)-My electorate is not only very beautiful but certainly the most innovative area in Australia. TodayI want to draw attention to a situation facing a national organisation which is based in my electorate of Newcastle. That organisation, the Australian Resource Centre for Healthcare Innovations, assists all health practitioners and professionals around this country. It does so with a staff of only seven people, yet it is perhaps one of the most effective and quality innovation programs in the health care sector in this country. To provide this service, ARCHI, as it is affectionately known by health professionals, has a web site, an e-library, an inquiry service, a Net news reader service and it holds discussion forums and seminars all around the country. Its achievements are well documented. Last year there were over four million hits on its web site. I am sure that most people would know that that is an outstanding number of hits, demonstrating a high level of demand from health professionals. ARCHI has 2,500 e-resources available. Most of those e-resources, it is important to know, are actually placed there by medical practitioners and professionals at no cost. Their copyright is waived and they are provided free to assist the profession in the provision of quality health management. ARCHI particularly aims for quality and safety in clinical management and clinical practice and has 16,000 health care professionals subscribing to that service. The Department of Health and Ageing has provided about $2½ million to ARCHI since it began in 1997 under the National Demonstration Hospitals Program, but now the department wants to close that program down; it says that program is finished. It says that one of its most outstanding outcomes is the service provided by ARCHI but it can no longer fund it. Apparently, in a response on behalf of the minister, the acute care strategies spokesperson from the Department of Health and Ageing, Ms Alex Rankin, said: There may be occasions in the future where the department would be interested in contracting ARCHI on a fee for service basis to promote or disseminate information to specific programs and services. I have an offer for the minister and his department: for less than half a million dollars per year, ARCHI can provide that service and disseminate that information not only to the department but to every public hospital, every GP, every specialist and every aged care facility in Australia. Half a million dollars does not seem to be very much given that the government are spending $21 million on an advertising and vote-buying campaign to save themselves and MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Adjournment
238,Mr Slipper,"I am pleased to have the concurrence of my friend the honourable membertheir Medicare safety net. In the Hunter and in Newcastle, we are very happy to forgo that advertising campaign. We will save you half a million dollars, Minister, and you can spend that to save ARCHI, a professional service that assists the whole health care sector in Australia. Let me explain who uses this service. I am told that health advisers from almost every state and every health minister in Australia use that service. I know that the shadow minister for health in Western Australia, one of Tony Abbott’s colleagues, attended a seminar recently on emergency demand issues, presented by ARCHI. I also know that the member for Boothby in this parliament, Dr Andrew Southcott, who launched ARCHI’s web site in South Australia a year or so ago, praised that service and I know would be a strong supporter of it. Not only does that service go out to the whole country; it is an outstanding service for rural, remote and isolated practitioners and professionals. It is something they can log on to instantly and where they can get advice on best practice within the health sector anywhere around the country. If you want information about the best clinical management of diabetes, the best management of emergency care and the best new developments in aged care, ARCHI has that information. To stop that service would be equivalent to stopping our library service for members of parliament. I know we have more than seven members of staff in the Parliamentary Library to support us, but ARCHI provides a similar service for every medical professional in Australia with just seven members of staff. It is suggested that the cost of most of those inquiries would be $1,000 if you were to do them privately. With 2,500 searches done for professionals a year, that is equivalent to a saving of $2½ million to health professionals-so at $500,000 per annum it is a bargain. It certainly does protect the standards of safety and management of health care in Australia. I call on the government to continue its funding past June this year. ARCHI deserves that and so do the Australian people. Education: James Cook University begun a campaign that will see James Cook University in Townsville become the home of a powerhouse of tropical scientists, creating the largest group of tropically focused researchers in the world. Unfortunately, there are many powerful vested interests in the higher education sector-people who, in the past, have worked in their own interest against the best interests of our university. I well remember the big guns aimed at JCU when I succeeded in getting a medical school for the north. Well, it is time to have the next battle. The federal government has made available an extra 2,303 university places for distribution to Queensland universities, with the new places on offer to be taken up at the beginning of next year. The Queensland government are making certain recommendations to the federal government as to how the places should be allocated across universities in the state. Their model is a dud for JCU because it does not recognise the many opportunities JCU has to meet its vision. IfI have to pick a fight with the Beattie government, then I look forward to the battle. I want a minimum of 500 extra places for JCU, not the paltry 250 being recommended by Queensland. I am fed up with Brisbane-centric policies that see the metropolitan universities getting an unrealistic number of extra places when the need for new places is in the north. The University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology have had it too good for too long. It is time to build on the potential of JCU. MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Adjournment
239,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (12.20 P.m.),"TodayI want the parliament to know that I haveI am particularly interested in seeing the establishment of the first veterinary degree course outside the capital cities and a focus on a complementary agricultural science program. Plant and animal production systems are climate specific, and none of Australia’s three tropical universities-JCU, CQU and NTU-have programs in agriculture, veterinary science or horticulture. The training gap is therefore national as well as regional. I would expect undergraduate programs in these areas to recruit students from other tropical countries as well as from Australia, as the existing graduate programs do now. I am working to convince the government to allocate 80 new funded places with a pipeline to veterinary science and 70 new funded places with a pipeline to tropical agricultural science. IfI win the battle-and I intend to-JCU can begin the new courses next year, as existing infrastructure will allow the first year of both programs to be delivered. I am also working on a $12 million capital grant to establish additional facilities in Townsville and Cairns and points of presence in Mackay, Atherton and Mount Isa. At present, a young North Queenslander who wishes to be a veterinarian, an agronomist, a soil scientist, an agricultural extension specialist or a plant or animal breeder-in order to work in professions which support North Queensland rural industries or to obtain professional skills which will enhance farm management-must leave North Queensland to obtain professional training. As in other professions, those who leave for training often do not return. In an era where survival as a primary producer is becoming progressively more dependent on professional skills, access to technical advice and security from new biological threats, this training gap is a serious deficiency for the region. Most of the industries which contribute to the economic and social well-being of North Queensland are well supported by JCU’s professional programs and by its research, but the plant and animal production industries are not. This is a serious gap, both because the region has no local alternatives to JCU for professional training and because the biosecurity issues for tropical plant, animal and human populations present a research agenda of critical national importance. Zoonoses, emerging and imported infectious diseases of humans, animals and plants, and agricultural pest and weed invasions are all threats whose likelihood and potential impact have increased with increasing human mobility between Australia and other tropical nations. JCU has significant capabilities and the potential for much greater contributions in support of tropical primary production and its protection. Development of its agricultural and veterinary professional specialties and the synergies available with the existing capacity in medicine, bioscience and environmental science offer a unique opportunity to strengthen Australia’s capacity to respond to biological threats. The lack of undergraduate programs further constrains agricultural and veterinary research in North Queensland, since the supply of graduates who might then train as researchers does not exist. This limits the capabilities of other research agencies as well, since research training and the students who undertake it are a key element that universities bring to research collaborations with other organisations. This proposal would further enhance collaboration by providing co-location of other agricultural and veterinary research agencies on JCU campuses. James Cook University in Townsville must play a crucial role in this, by transforming the Northern Australian economy and ensuring the well-being of its people by providing the knowledge, ideas and innovations that lead to new industries, new technologies, better health MAIN COMMITTEE and new ways of managing complex systems; by underpinning the sustainable management of Northern Australia’s internationally significant terrestrial and marine ecosystems and its nationally vital beef, sugar, tourism, fishing, horticulture and mining industries; by equipping future generations of scientists with the capacity to develop path-breaking solutions; and by acting as a centre of excellence with critical mass in tropical science. I am ready for the inevitable fight. I want the North Queensland community to back me and I want to see JCU become the world’s leading hub of tropical science. Transport: Security Forestry: Managment Australian Broadcasting Corporation Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (12.25 p.m.)-The need for increased maritime security has finally come to the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister. I know that my colleagues opposite were probably waiting for me to make this comment. In a press release dated 21 March 2004, the Deputy Prime Minister announced: Australia’s maritime security framework will be assessed by the Secretaries’ Committee on National Security (SCNS) as part of the Government’s continuous review of Australia’s security arrangements … Why has it taken the government so long to take this most basic of steps? Last year I raised in the House my concern about the lack of attention that was being applied to supply chain security. We now have the Deputy Prime Minister announcing a review, albeit joining the party a little late. I continue to be amazed at the doubletalk of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister. One minute we have the minister talking about the need to move away from modal based policy and the next minute we have the minister announcing modal based policy. We see it in roads and now we see it here in maritime transport policy. Supply chains are the veins of our economy. Surely it does not take too long for a minister with all the resources of the department at his feet to understand the need for a security assessment that takes into account multimode transport issues across Australia’s supply chains. It is well known that the Department of Transport and Regional Services recently completed a consultancy to examine the flaws in the movement of dangerous goods. I understand that the consultants undertook extensive consultations and unearthed flaws in the regulatory environment, in that industry is confused about who is responsible for what. I wonder if the minister’s announcement might include addressing the weaknesses that have been identified by this dangerous goods consultancy. Perhaps we will then see the minister announcing a new body to oversee all imports and exports by sea. Perhaps we will see a training or licensing regime placing a further burden on industry. As I warned last year, industry should be very careful. The Howard government will tighten the screws, but it will do so at a cost to industry. I see a number of announcements coming up soon that are going to cost industry. The minister will use the dangerous goods consultancy as a justification. He will say that industry has demanded these changes. Make no mistake: the dangerous goods consultancy will be an input into the review being conducted by the Secretaries Committee on National Security. What the minister will not say is that industry cannot cope with the additional cost of more regulation. Industry is being asked to bear the burden once more of this government’s responsibilities. I also rise today to draw the attention of the Main Committee to the opposition leader’s recent visit to Tasmania. The opposition leader spent two very solid days listening to representaMAIN COMMITTEE tives of both the forestry industry and environmentalists to learn about the complexities of the Tasmanian forestry debate-and, as we all know, it is not a simple issue-and to look at the implications of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. There are several priorities in the debate and the first is recognising the importance of phasing out the clear-felling of oldgrowth forests. But it has to be done in a way that not only is good for the environment but also ensures job protection-it must ensure that those people who work in the industry have a financial future. The second priority is that of value adding within the forestry industry. That includes strategies such as downstream processing as an alternative to woodchip exports. A third part of the future policy agenda is to rebuild World Heritage funding, which has been substantially cut under this government. This funding has been a significant ingredient in the achievement of 40 per cent of Tasmania’s native forests being held under reserve. A final fourth priority is to engage in discussion with the Tasmanian state government about the important conservation and ecotourism issues. A Labor government strategy would incorporate these four areas as the basis of a policy that is based on good science and consideration of all sides of the debate, ultimately ensuring the development of a policy that is the right policy outcome. We look forward to the state government finalising its report into the financial implications and the appropriate time lines for phasing out clear-felling of old-growth forests. This approach to the forestry issue has been considered and very sincere and will culminate in the best policy decisions for both the environment and jobs in the forest industry. In the time that is left to me, I want to join with my colleague the member for Braddon in his support of the work that the ABC does in regional communities. However, there are a couple of things we must remember. The ABC is centralising sports broadcasting and regional sporting announcements-that is wrong; no longer having that focus is a terrible thing for regional communities. The other thing is that regional ABCs are being forced to cut jobs and not replace jobs, and if they do replace them they do so at a lower level. We need to support the ABC because it is an important part of regional Australia. (Time expired) Roads: Funding Red Cross: Anniversary government’s focus on the very great, important matter of road funding for regional Australia. I am talking about the national highway, Roads of National Importance, Roads to Recovery and, of course, the black spot program, which I chair in Queensland. I can assure members that the next round will be warmly received in all states. The main focus of my address today is the 90th anniversary of the Red Cross. I would like to pay tribute to the members and volunteers who freely give their time and resources in order to help their fellow citizens. The Red Cross began life in 1914, as a branch of the British Red Cross, nine days after the outbreak of World War I. It is now the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising 97 million members and volunteers worldwide. March is ‘Red Cross Calling’ month in Australia and I encourage fellow members and everyone else to show their support for this marvellous organisation. Last weekend I attended the official launch of the Red Cross Calling campaign in Bundaberg and learned a little more about the support services they provide locally. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Adjournment
240,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.30 P.m.),"BeforeI commence, I would like to commend theLast year, the statewide campaign raised around $1.4 million, with $85,000 of that coming directly from the Bundaberg area. Every year the Queensland branch of the Red Cross uses that money to help more than 76,000 vulnerable children, 10,800 families and people in crisis, and 116,000 elderly people. You might ask: how does the organisation achieve such an outreach? It does so with the generous support of the public, its 110 branches throughout the state and 10,100 Queensland members. I pay tribute to the public’s ongoing support for the Red Cross, because the generosity of the public provides vital assistance to children’s services, disability services, aged care services, youth services, blood collection services, and first aid training. I am proud that Hinkler is the home of 500 Red Cross members and volunteers. Around 100 of them-led by branch president, Jeanette Davey; vice-president, Betty Taylor; and secretary, Chris Thompson-are associated with the Bundaberg branch, which has been operational since 1937. During the war years, the branch was very active in fundraising. They conducted street stalls, organised prisoner of war street collections, participated in button and flag days, and organised concerts. Members worked frantically to knit items and prepare wound dressings for hospitals in Australia and overseas. Memorabilia of those days is now displayed at the Bundaberg Historical Museum and the Bundaberg RSL Memorial Club. For many years branch business was conducted from a small cottage in the grounds of the liquor merchants Fred Baker Wine and Spirits, free of rent. Fred and Agnes Baker’s unfailing support extended to Mrs Baker filling the role of branch president for 27 years, while her husband’s estate, upon his death, allowed the Red Cross to continue operating rent-free from the cottage. Mrs Baker’s efforts were rewarded with a Red Cross Distinguished Service Medal in 1967. While the business was eventually sold, a small piece of land was given to the Red Cross and donations and fundraising eventually resulted in the new Wide Bay premises on the corner of Barolin Street and Woongarra Street in Bundaberg. One of the most prominent modern-day Red Cross projects came to fruition in 1983, with the completion of the Myra Boreham rest rooms and chapel in the grounds of the Bundaberg Base Hospital. I was a member of the hospital board at that time and I am very proud to be associated with that project. These rooms, which are similar to motel rooms, are available free of charge for the families of critically ill patients and clients from outlying areas requiring treatment. Gladstone also has a long association with the Red Cross, with the local branch formed in the wake of the cyclone which hit the city in 1914. The membership list holds some distinguished individuals: Mrs Joyce Staples, the longest serving member of the branch, and Mrs Kathleen Kahler, who was awarded the BEM by the Queen when the Britannia berthed at Gladstone in 1970, in recognition of her service to the Red Cross, after being branch president for 21 years. Current branch president Rowena Krone should also be congratulated on maintaining a commitment to providing emergency family hospital accommodation, and a variety of other programs in the Gladstone and Calliope areas. Between the two Red Cross branches within my electorate, the public can have access to hospital library services, cosmetic care programs, a visiting service, youth groups, blood services, disaster preparedness training and medical equipment hire-a truly outstanding contribution, and I salute that organisation. MAIN COMMITTEE Burke Electorate: Local Government election of councillor Mohamad Abbouche to the position of Mayor of the City of Hume. Councillor Abbouche is a well-known community member in the area of Broadmeadows. He has been a fantastic local representative for what is a very multicultural area of Melbourne and he certainly deserves his elevation to this high office. He follows Councillor Burhan Yigit, who performed outstandingly for 12 months in the role of mayor of one of the most important and vibrant municipalities in Melbourne. I have had the great opportunity of working with both councillors and indeed with all the councillors of that municipality. They love their area and they represent it effectively. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, local government is the grassroots politics of Australia. It is the government closest to the people, and we do need representatives who put in their all and are sincere about their efforts. I believe that in the case of both of these councillors-and, indeed, the councillors of Hume generally-we are definitely in good shape. I would also like to comment upon the election last Tuesday evening of Councillor Sam David to the position of Mayor of the City of Brimbank, another municipality that overlaps with my electorate. Again, the City of Brimbank is a municipality that represents a very diverse multicultural population of Melbourne. There are over 50 recognised ethnicities in that area. It is a wonderful mix of people and cultures, foods and music, which enriches Melbourne and this country. I think Councillor Sam David should be congratulated. I know Sam quite well. He is a great local representative. His ward, in fact, is not in my current electorate, but I will be a candidate for the new seat of Gorton, and Gorton will incorporate the ward that Councillor David represents. I look forward to working more directly with him-because we will be representing the same people-in the event that I am elected at the next election. I thank him for the way he has welcomed me to the community and I congratulate him on his elevation to mayor. I am sure he will do an outstanding job. I also congratulate and thank the outgoing mayor, Councillor Dorothy Costa. Again, she is a local representative who has lived in Keilor for a very long time, if not all of her life, and has provided a great public service to that community. I thank Dorothy for her work, and I also look forward to working with her in the coming years, because she will remain as councillor for that great City of Brimbank. Griggs, Ms Dawn Transport: Road Funding Firstly, I would like draw the attention of the House to the senseless death of Dawn Griggs of Byron Bay who was, among other things, founder of the New South Wales Accelerated Learning Association. Dawn was stabbed to death shortly after her arrival in India earlier this month. Talk to anyone who knew Dawn and you will hear words such as ‘intelligent’, ‘trusting’, ‘open’ and ‘peaceful’ used to describe her. She was a lady who found it easier to search for the good in a person than to accept the bad. Dawn was also a deeply spiritual person and had recently published a book and organised an international conference on reviving the spirit of learning in education. I had the pleasure of speaking with her on several occasions in her MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment

244,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs) (12.39 p.m.)role as founding president of the New South Wales Accelerated Learning Association and was always impressed by her passion for her work. To those who knew her, her family and friends, I offer my sincere condolences. I would also draw the attention of the House to the apparent reluctance of the New South Wales government to address safety issues on the Sexton Hill section of the Pacific Highway at Banora Point. The name itself demonstrates the long history of accidents that have been occurring over many decades at this location. The NRMA has now identified this hill, close to the New South Wales-Queensland border, as being the worse black spot on the Pacific Highway. During 2000-02, there were 114 accidents at Sexton Hill compared to 38 at the secondworst black spot, located in Coffs Harbour. These accidents have involved loss of life, personal injury, substantial property damage and long delays in traffic movements both north and south bound. Heading south, there are severe problems caused by the traffic merging onto the highway from Minjungbal Drive mixing with traffic exiting the highway to the underpass accessing Darlington Drive. Coupled with the high volume of heavy vehicles, including B-doubles accelerating to traverse the hill, the dangers to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians are increasing daily with the volume of traffic. Heading north, traffic that has been travelling at 110 kilometres per hour along the new Yelgun to Chinderah section of highway and the Chinderah bypass, both jointly funded by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments, comes to a halt at the traffic lights on top of the hill at the Terranora Road intersection. Curves in the road prevent the traffic from being seen by approaching vehicles and, despite reduced speed limits and flashing lights warning of queuing traffic, this remains a dangerous situation. These lights only control traffic heading north and traffic turning into and out of Terranora Road. However, vehicles heading south on the highway drive over the crest of the hill and, due to the curve of the road, appear to be travelling directly towards the traffic lights. Drivers unfamiliar with Sexton Hill brake suddenly for the red light, then speed up as they realise the lights do not affect them. Combined with merging traffic from Terranora Road and the curve and camber of the road, this contributes to the accident rate. I note in yesterday’s Daily Telegraph, page 2, that the New South Wales Labor government has found $50 million to build two bridges between the two small townships of Clifton and Coalcliff on the Illawarra coast. I understand this section of road has been closed to traffic for some time-for $50 million these bridges are certainly impressive. The cost to address the Sexton Hill black spot is estimated by the local council to be around $40 million, but funding is seemingly unavailable for a project that impacts on the safety of around 40,000 vehicles per day. If the Illawarra bridges were located on the North Coast, I wonder if this money would have been so quickly allocated. Perhaps the local state member in Illawarra has more clout than does the state member for Tweed. During the state election in 2003, commitments were given to look into the situation at Sexton Hill. A year has passed and nothing seems to have happened. It seems that, unless the federal coalition government becomes involved in highway funding in New South Wales, nothing happens. A case in point is the Alstonville bypass on the Bruxner Highway. The bypass had been planned for many years but was constantly deferred by the Carr government. Finally, the Commonwealth offered $12 million to get the project under way, though the Carr government is still dragging its heels. MAIN COMMITTEE Yet another example is the Ballina bypass. In the 10-year agreement for the Pacific Highway upgrade, the New South Wales government agreed to fund this project in its entirety. After eight years, this project is still in the planning stage and it seems that the Carr government will renege on its commitment to build this road. Three weeks ago, Mr Carr demanded that the Commonwealth contribute to the Ballina bypass or else it would not be built. I find this type of blackmail disgusting and the residents of the North Coast are fed up with being the last in transport matters. Even when projects do not require funding from New South Wales, such as the Tugun bypass, the obstructive and uncooperative approach of the state government puts lives at risk-and they are not putting one cent into it. I call on the New South Wales government to honour its agreement, accept its responsibilities and properly fund the Pacific Highway in northern New South Wales. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.44 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: McCormick Centre for the Environment (Question No. 2024) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Can he detail the amount of funding contributed by the Commonwealth Government to the McCormick Centre for the Environment. (2) Can he detail the amount of functions and events hosted by the McCormick Centre since its official opening in September 2002. (3) What has been the level of patronage of the McCormick Centre since its official opening. (4) Has a tourism plan been established for the McCormick Centre and the adjoining Chaffey Learning Exchange. (1) A total of $827,000 was provided by the Australian Government as a contribution to the total cost of establishing the Centre. (2) to (4) Management of the Centre is a matter for the Australian Landscape Trust and the Renmark Paringa District Council which jointly operate the Centre. Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (Question No. 2253) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 August 2003: Is the Treasurer aware that (a) AMP released confidential information about Mr Michael Gane’s fund to his ex-wife using a revoked power of attorney, (b) AMP refused to release funds to Mr Gane to meet his obligations as approved by the Family Court between 30 October 2001 and 31 January 2002, (c) AMP, contrary to the Family Court orders, diverted funds directly to Mr Gane’s ex-wife until stopped by the solicitors acting for him in the Family Court, (d) AMP, without authority, reduced the amounts of withdrawal applications of 5 October 2001 and 30 October 2001 which were in accordance with Family Court orders and subsequently denied to the SCT that they had cut back these withdrawal applications, (e) AMP referred Mr Gane’s withdrawal applications to his ex-wife or her solicitors for scrutiny even when these applications were made in accordance with the Court orders, and (f) AMP refuses to supply Mr Gane with copies of missing withdrawal detail forms, which were requested from AMP on 27 June 2002. The detail of matters before the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is confidential and protected by the secrecy provisions in the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. Employment: Job Seekers (Question No. 2591) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 13 October 2003: (1) Would he provide details on the (a) activities, (b) services, and (c) items purchased for jobseekers out of Jobseeker Account funds between 1 July 2003 and 30 September 2003 including (i) the amount of funds spent on each category, and (ii) the number of jobseekers who were assisted.",157,Adjournment

(3) How many long-term (i.e. unemployed more than 12 months) jobseekers have had (a) $0, (b) $1$300, (c) $301-$600, and (d) more than $600 spent from of their Jobseeker Accounts.

(2) At 30 September 2003, 19% of Job Seeker Account expenditure was flagged as spent on purchases from related entities. Data is not available on the breakdown by related entities for activities and services. (3) In the early days of the Active Participation Model, Job Network members progressively saw job seekers. Not all long term unemployed job seekers had contact with their Job Network member straight away and temporary exemptions from Centrelink, non-attendance by jobseekers at interviews and so on may have delayed jobseeker commencement. Not all long term unemployed jobseekers were immediately eligible for Intensive Support customised assistance (e.g. referred or participating in other programmes). Because Job Network members were still commencing long term unemployed job seekers after 30 September 2003, providing data on expenditure for this group for the first three months of the Active Participation Model will not accurately reflect the level of assistance provided to job seekers when they first saw their Job Network member or trend patterns of expenditure. Similarly, some commitments against the job seeker account may not yet be reflected in current expenditure as claims are made retrospectively to the job network provider’s purchase of services. In these cases the level of expenditure may not yet reflect services being delivered to job seekers.

247,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Has his attention been drawn to the critique by Ian Castles and David Henderson of the economic and statistical work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and especially the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) as published in an ongoing exchange in the journal Energy and Environment. (2) Will he ensure that the matters raised in the various articles by Castles and Henderson and the responses from the IPCC Team are analysed by Treasury officials and other relevant Government statistical experts to ensure that emission projections are based on a sound economic and statistical footing. (3) Will Australia take up this issue at the international level to clarify the complex issues involved. (4) Will he (a) require his department, and (b) encourage statistical officers of other OECD countries to be fully engaged in the development of the economic and statistical work of the IPCC to ensure that uncertainties of this nature do not arise in the future. (1) Yes. (2) These matters are under consideration by a range of Government agencies. The Australian Government considers it important that emissions projections are based on a sound economic and statistical footing. (3) I am informed by my Department that these issues are being considered by relevant international bodies. As noted in my answer to Question 2, Australia’s efforts are directed toward promoting emissions projections based on a sound economic and statistical footing. (4) Refer to answers provided for question (2) and (3) above. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 2854) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1346 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23135), is it the case that the secrecy provisions under section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act do not preclude the Commissioner of Taxation from disclosing ‘publicly available’ information. (2) Can he explain whether the Commissioner of Taxation’s letter to the NSW Bar Association on 24 January 2003 means that, in future, when requested by the NSW Bar Association, the NSW Law Society or other professional body, the Commissioner of Taxation will respond to requests made by those bodies for information on individual members if that information is already public. (1) The Commissioner has sought advice from the Solicitor-General about the disclosure of information to professional bodies. The Solicitor-General’s advice is that section 16 prohibits the disclosure of information about the tax affairs of another person to professional bodies. (2) Having regard to the advice from the Solicitor-General, it would not be appropriate for the Commissioner to disclose information about the tax affairs of another person to a professional body. Taxation: New South Wales Bar Association (Question No. 2855) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2447 (Hansard, 2 December 2003, page 23141), in respect of the Commissioner of Taxation’s statement in his letter dated 24 January 2003 to the President of the New South Wales Bar Association that “the advice we have received to date acknowledged that",161,Questions On Notice

249,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:there is an argument to the effect that section 16 does not prohibit the disclosure of ‘publicly available’ information”, will he now review his response that “section 16… prevents the Commissioner of Taxation from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers with others except when expressly empowered to do so under the Act”. (2) Can he explain how it is possible for various media organisations including the Sydney Morning Herald to obtain the type of information that would otherwise be covered by section 16, while formal requests for the same information from the NSW Bar Association are denied; if not, why not. (1) Since writing to the NSW Bar Association, the Commissioner has obtained advice from the Solicitor-General about the disclosure of information of the type referred to in that letter. The Solicitor-General’s advice is that section 16 prohibits the disclosure of information about the tax affairs of another person to professional bodies. (2) I am unable to comment on how the Sydney Morning Herald or any other media organisation has obtained information on this matter. Employment: Job Seekers (Question No. 2884) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) For the period 1 July 2003 to 1 December 2003 what was the total value of the activities, services and items purchased by Job Network providers using Jobseeker Account funds. (2) How many jobseekers were assisted. (3) What proportion of long-term jobseekers have had funds from their Jobseeker Account spent on them and what was the average amount spent on each long-term jobseeker. (1) The total value of the activities, services and items purchased by Job Network providers from 1 July to 30 November 2003 reimbursed by the Job Seeker Account is $17.4 million. (2) The number of job seekers assisted by the Job Seeker Account for which reimbursement has been claimed between 1 July and 30 November 2003 is 88,878. (3) In the early days of the Active Participation Model, Job Network members progressively saw job seekers. Not all long term unemployed job seekers had contact with their Job Network member straight away or were eligible for Intensive Support customised assistance (e.g. temporary exemptions, non-attendance or referral to other programmes). The proportion of long term unemployed job seekers in the Active Participation Model for which reimbursement has been claimed from the Job Seeker Account as at 30 November is 26%. The average amount that was spent on each of these job seekers so far is $353. Similarly, a number of commitments against the Job Seeker Account would not yet be reflected in current expenditure as claims are made retrospectively to the Job Network provider’s purchase of services. In these cases the level of reimbursement would not yet reflect services being delivered to job seekers.

Finance and Administration: ComSuper Pensions (Question No. 3219) Mr Organ asked the Minister Representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 2 March 2004: (1) Is he aware that the increases to ComSuper pensions paid to retired public servants are based upon increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (2) Has he considered basing future increases to ComSuper pensions on increases to Average Weekly Earnings; if so, will he explain why increases are still based on the CPI. swer to the honourable Member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The Government considers that indexation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase method provides an equitable and satisfactory method for calculating pension increases and protects the living standards of retired Australian Government employees. The best analysis of the cost of living of retirees is contained in a recent article published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) entitled “Analytical living cost indexes for selected Australian household types: update to June 2003”. In this article the ABS measured and compared changes in the CPI against changes in prices of out-of-pocket living expenses experienced by different categories of households, including self-funded retiree households. The results have revealed that the CPI compares favourably with the cost of living index for self-funded retiree households over the four year period to June 2003. Based on these results, the ABS article concluded that “the CPI provides a reasonable estimate of changes in living costs for each of the selected household types over this period.” The ABS findings reinforce the Government’s belief that the CPI does provide a reasonable measure of the cost of living, and that the living standards of retired Australian Government employees are not being eroded because of this method of indexation.",170,Questions On Notice
