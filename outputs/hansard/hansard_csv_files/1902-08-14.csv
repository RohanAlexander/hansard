If this interpretation is correct, what are the reasons for this regulation ? Sir PHILIPFYSH the honourable member's questions are as follow:J. It has been approved to make a regulation restricting the payment of commission on the sale of postage stamps ns indicated. 2. It means that a licensed vendor of postage stamps will not be allowed commission exceeding 5s. per day throughout the year, and arrangeinents will be made to adjust the stipulated amount of commission monthly. 3.

26,Sir William Mcmillan,"SanPOST ANDTELEGRA PH RATES BILL. . Sir PHILIPFYSH (Tasmama) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recollect that on a former occasion they assisted me to pass through the House a Bill relating to the administration of the Post and Telegraph department, and the construction and maintenance of telegraphic and telephonic lines. One of the clauses of that Bill provided for the making of regulations by the GovernorGenerali n Council, and the Postmaster: General proposed under it to frame a regulation in relation to postal and telegraph rates. The House deemed it desirable, however, that those rates should be embodied in a Bill, with the result that we ;have before us the measure of which I am now moving the second reading. I regret 'that there has been apparently so much delay in introducing it . That delay has not been due to any fault on the part of the Government. The -absolute settlement of certain points of administration relating specially to the carriage of newspapers in New South Wales, and to the cable rates to be charged between the mainland and 'Tasmania has only just taken place. Although the Government were prepared to proceed with this Bill at an earlier date, those two points necessitated delay. Irrespective, of their existence, however, the House, since -re-assembling on the 22nd ult., has been fully engaged upon the Tariff. A t hist we have before us the B ill which I had hoped to introduce very much earlier, but which for the reasons I have stated could not have been brought forward before. I regret further that it has been to some extent delayed because it has kept in existence an incongruity in regard to certain rates, which it is advisable should be removed. We have still in force in the various States differing by some Act, and it reads as follows:rates for the carriage of newspapers, under which advantages have possibly been reaped by one class of newspaper proprietors over another. It would have been far better in the interests of the Commonwealth, as a whole, had we been able earlier in our Eederation to bring these varying rates into line. Honourable members will recollect that three out of the six States have been carrying newspapers through the post free of charge, and thab they are still doing so, while in the remaining three States a charge is and has been made. That state of things must continue until we have passed this Bill, and therefore I venture to disagree with some of the observations which were made on a former occasion by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who expressed the hope that this measure would be delayed for some considerable time. I hope we shall find that there are several reasons why no further delay should take place. The Bill itself contains only eight clauses, and with the exception of clause 8, which provides for a new regulation, they are comparatively unimportant. The power to make regulations under the Post and Telegraph Act does not enable the Governor-Generali n Council to make any arrangements for the limitations and the rates to be prescribed with respect to town and suburban telegrams or letters. It is proposed, therefore, in clause 8, that the Governor-Generali n Council shall have power by regulation to prescribe the limits within which the rates for town and suburban telegrams and letters shall have effect, and for prescribing charges for the porterage of telegrams. Special necessity for such a regulation arises from the fact that we have not a uniform regulation in existence in the various States. While, for example, we have in five States a suburban or a town rate of 6d. for certain telegraphic messages, and a State rate up to Is., we have in Victoria a uniform rate of 9d.,whether in relation tocity, suburban, or State messages. Therefore it becomes necessary to make special regulations prescribing the limits within which there shall be varying rates for letters and telegrams. There is a provision in clause 5 in regard to -which only a word or two is necessary. It relates to the rates for telegrams and postal matter which have not been exempted ' Telegrams, letters, and postal articles transmitted or posted on behalf of the King, the Commonwealth Government, or any State Government shall, unless exempted by some Act, be subject to the postal and telegraphic rates for the time being in force Sir JOH N QUICK -Does the clause refer to a federal Act ? minded by the Attorney-General tliat under section 38 of the Acts Interpretation Act,",16,Customs Tariffbill
27,Sir Philip Fysh,"Yes. I am rean Act passed by the Commonwealth may be referred to by the word "" Act "" alone. ""VVe know, therefore, that the provision applies only to that which the Federal Legislature does. State by a federal Act. important features of. this Bill are to be found in the schedules, and I have no doubt that when we reach them we shall come to the more controversial matter. Dealing with the first schedule which relates to newspapers, I am instructed that the present revenue from postage on newspapers in the three States, which do not carry them free of charge, amounts to about £25,000 per annum. There are three States-Tasmania, Western Australia, and New South Waleswhich carry all newspapers through the post free of charge. The new rates provided for in the 1st schedule will enable the Postmaster-General to increase his revenue from this source by about£40,000, bringing up his total revenue from newspaper postage to nearly £70,000. I am only giving these figures approximately. Whether the Postmaster-General puts down his total, anticipated increase at £42,000 or £45,000, it is a matter of speculation, and for my purpose I shall allude to the anticipated increase as being about £40,000. That sum is divided in various ways. Fbr example, I find that Queensland, instead of gaining additional revenue on the postage of newspapers, will lose some £2,800 under this arrangement, whilst all the other States, except Victoria, will gain very considerably. I am happy here to notice that Tasmania^-whic h for the purpose of enlightening the public mind and conveying literature into our country homes, so it has been . said, has been carrying newspapers free to the detriment of the service-wil l now be recouped to the extent of about £10,000. New South Wales will also gain under this schedule to the very large amount of about £27,000. tralia gain 1 she -will gain only a trifle-abou t £200. Victoria will stand practically in the same position as she was before. be Queensland's position ? about £2,800. This legislation will liberalize postal regulations with respect to the carriage of newspapers in the three States which have hitherto been imposing a charge upon them. The loss occasioned by liberalizing the rates in those three States will be more than made good by the additional revenue collected in the States which have heretofore carried newspapers free. affect Western Australia ? lia will come out about £6,700 to the good. I shall have to return presently to the question of newspaper carriage. I see that the honourable member for Macquarie is following me closely, and I shall take care to give him, and those who think or do not think with him, all the information they desire, remembering that on a previous occasion questions were asked which I was unable to answer so satisfactorily as I hope to be in a position now to do. If I forget to return to this subject, no doubt the honourable member for Macquarie will refresh my memory. I desire to pass on to the 2nd schedule which deals with ordinary telegrams, and introduces a new system and a new tariff with respect to telegrams of a private or business nature and press messages. Under the 2nd schedule the Government desire to give an enormous benefit to the people of the Federation as a whole. I think I may allude to it as a considerable, if not an enormous, benefit, for whereas there has been a charge of 3s. or 4s. each for messages between Western Australia and Queensland-the western and the north-eastern boundaries of Australia-whic h have to be transmitted through five States, this Bill provides for a Commonwealth rate of Is. for all messages consisting of a certain number of words that are sent to any part of the Commonwealth. This, I hope, will be regarded as a great boon. It will, however, lead to a loss in the telegraphic revenue equivalent to that which the Postmaster-General hopes to gain in his postal revenue. I desire honourable members when dealing with these rates, to remember that the Commonwealth is not is a position to give up £40,000 worth of revenue now collected upon telegrams unless it can in some way be recouped for that loss of revenue. We therefore propose to set against this reduced revenue from the Telegraphic department the profit we hope to realize upon. the carriage of newspapers. W it h respect to",17,Second Reading

35,Sir Philip Fysh,"Western Austrathese two points, I should like, first of all in connection with the charge for the carriage of newspapers, to refer to a question asked a few evenings ago by the honourable member for Macquarie. That question had special relation to the position of newspaper proprietors in New South Wales. They have had an advantage over the proprietors of newspapers in some of the other States in that they have been able to send their papers by morning trains at the cost of the Government. Sir PHILIPEYSH the Government while they were States, but at the cost of the Post-office now. Their newspapers have been carried by early trains for which the Post-office has paid. gentleman say at the cost of the Post-office now t must-be remembered that the Postal department has been taken over by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has to pay this sum of .£2,500. it? said to be a charge upon the Postal department. Sir PHILIPFYSH system had been continued, it would have been a special loss. The Government, however, have deemed it desirable to put a stop to that arrangement for the present, and until Parliament has had an opportunity to deal with the matter. of the action taken, I presume that the newspaper proprietors concerned, or some of them, are up in arms. Because their gains have been to some extent arrested, they feel themselves aggrieved, forgetting that they have had an advantage which the vendors of newspapers in other States have not had. I say advisedly that they have had an advantage which the vendors of newspapers in other States have not had, because although I gave certain information to my honourable friend the honourable member for Macquarie on a previous day, with respect to what I believed had been taking place in Tasmania, I was compelled to give him an answer to the question he put recently upon the motion for the adjournment of the House, which was not as complete as ' I should have liked to make it, nor was it as f u l l 'as the honourable member and'the House' were entitled to receive it . But there were extant at that particular time messages from two States, at any rate, and from each of two departments in those States, which, if they were not absolutely conflicting replies, were yet replies which needed further explanation. In the meantime, I have armed myself with further information, so far, at -all events, as Tasmania is concerned. While, on the one hand, I have to reply that in Of the Post-office. Tasmania newspapers had been carried free A t the cost of by the Postal department for a great number of years, and that the Railway department, which was also a Government department, had been carrying free parcels of newspapers sent by the publisher to. the authorities to the publisher's agent elsewhere, I now find that although the circumstances warranted that replya reply which reached me from the Treasurer of Tasmania -ther e were other circumstances which, perhaps, he had overlooked. ThoughI had myself been a party to the arrangement made, I had not refreshed my memory with respect to it, and I also had forgotten it for the moment. While our newspapers in Tasmania were being carried free, if delivered at the post-office addressed by the vendor to private individuals, parcels of newspapers sent by publishers to the railway stations No ; but if the were also being carried free, as a matter of compliment, by the railway authorities. free ? We do not require to know anything about the compliment; the question is, As a result what was the practice observed ? compliment. free. I do not know that I should speak of it as extraordinary as far as Tasmania is concerned, that the General Manager of the Railways, knowing that there was free postage of newspapers, accorded to the proprietors of newspapers the privilege of sending their papers in bulk to the railway station, without having previously passed them through the post-office.

The arrangement was that the postal matter should be carried by the Postal department for the lump sum named. Let us draw a distinction, if there be a distinction, and I do not desire to make it too arbitrary : The Government assented to the two departments making .in arrangement under which, by a cross entry, the Railway department debits the Postal department, and the Postal department credits the Railway department for certain services rendered. The Railway General Manager, knowing that newspapers were carried free throughout Tasmania under the Postal regulations, drew no distinction between newspapers addressed by the proprietors to individuals, and the bulk parcels of newspapers which were sent to the railway stations. tention that they were carried free on the paid by one department to the other railways of Tasmania was absolutely correct.

Notwithstanding interruptions I have tried to let honourable members see exactly how the matter stands. When the honourable member talks of dealing with one as we deal with another, he must bear in mind that in several of the States a charge has been made for the carriage of newspapers for years past, and we are only now bringing the equity of the matter into force. previously existing arrangement should have remained in force until the passing of uniform legislation; but the Government have withdrawn the privilege previously existing in New South Wales, whilst it has not been withdrawn in Tasmania. brought under our observation that such a privilege is in existence there that privilege will be withdrawn. The amount now appearing in the books of the Government of Tasmania to the credit of the Railway department for these services is being paid by the Postal department, and that brings the matter within the ken of the Federal Postmaster-General. He can now deal with it as he has dealt with the system in force in New South Wales.

It is proposed to charge £d. per word for town and suburban Here the question will arise, so far as Victoria is concerned, whether this State is to come into line with the other five States, all of whom have their town and suburban rates, or whether the other five States are to be drawn into line with the one State of Victoria. nexion with a federal proposal like this a federal purpose will be observed .throughout, and that we shall establish If so, we shall have to establish this town and suburban rate of £d. per word. The rate for telegraph messages within State will be $d. per word; and the rate for all messages sent from one State to another-whether to Queensland, or from Queensland right through to Western Australia-will per word. Surely for so great a boon as this some of us' will be quite willing to give up some of our present privileges. It must be borne in mind that under a Eederal Bill all the States must be brought into line. The question then arises as to whether one State should give up its privileges, and join the other five, and whether by so joining the other five, the system thus inaugurated will lead to cheaper telegraphy on the whole. I have pointed out that, as a whole, the people of Australia will gain from £40,000 to £45,000 a year by this re-arrangement. contains a fairly large number of words, the sender receives an immense advantage in being charged only %d. for each word for telegrams within a State, whereas at the present moment ld. per word is charged. so far as the shorter messages are concerned, tlie sender will be under a small disadvantage, but in regard to messages containing more than eighteen words, a great advantage lies with the sender. The Stock Exchange of Melbourne, and the Stock Exchanges of Tasmania, have made a special request with respect to charging for telegraphing names and addresses. I have had a conversation with the Postmaster-General on the subject, and have arrived at the conclusion, which I trust the House also will adopt,' that while in the smaller number of instances a few persons may be disadvantaged to the extent of a few pence per message, yet. a greater number of . Sir Philip Pysh. The proposal people throughout the Commonwealth will be immensely advantaged by the reduced rates offered by this schedule. The minimum rates are-tow n and suburban, messages. 6d. per message; messages within a State, 9d.j and Commonwealth messages-that is, telegrams from State to State, from the extreme at one end of the continent to the extreme at the other-Is. To my mind there is only one blot upon this Bill, and that is with respect to the position of TasI hope that in conmania. When the Bill was sent to the Senatei t contained a provision that to the charge of l d . a word there should be uniformity. added the cable charges. I was very much in sympathy, as, I hope, other honourable members were, with the senators who oba jected to that provision. Any one, on first reading the Bill, must have been startled to find that, while a telegram could be sent from from New South ""Wales Cape Leuwin, by Cape Howe, to Thursday Island at a minimum charge Of Is., altliough be ld. hundreds of miles had to be traversed over wires in Western Australia and South Australia, the people of Tasmania, on sending a message 180 miles across the Straits, were left out of the Federation, and treated as a separate community. That anomaly arose from circumstances which I shall briefly relate. The Tasmanian cable is owned by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, who contracted with the Tasmanian Government to lay the cable on receiving a subsidy of £4,200 a year, in addition , to a guaranteed revenue of £5,600 for services rendered. For many years the .messages When a message passing between Tasmania and the mainland left a large deficiency on the guarantee of £5,600, but the development of the mines on the West Coast, in consequence of the enterprise of the Tasmanian people, and Certainly, also, of course, the enterprise of the people of the mainland, brought up the revenue, until last year it amounted to nearly £10,000. TJnder the contract the Tasmanian Government aie entitled, directly the revenue of the company exceeds £5,600, to reduce the present charge of l d . per word, and I do not know why that part of the agreement has not been carried out in the past few years, during which the telegraph company have been receiving more than they agreed to accept, and have been making a considerable profit. purpose of making a profit.

93,Mr Brown,The company exists for the,23,Smith Did The Honourable Railway Office And Delivered By The Railway
94,Sir Philip Fysh,"That may be! so;regarded as representing an established business, and there is little doubt that the reduction of the charge from l d . per word to i d . per word will give to the company all the revenue to which they are entitled.. When fchis Bill has passed, the Postmaster General will soon be able to complete an arrangement, already agreed on with the Government of Tasmania, for a reduction of the rate to the extent I have indicated, and will do so without, I believe, creating any important loss. If , however, there should be any immediate loss, it will very soon be compensated for, owing to the supply at the lower rate creating a larger demand. I am very sorry that Tasmania should again find herself handicapped with this responsibility. Many years ago an arrangement was made by the various State Governments to pool the subsidies to the various cables. That, however, was only for a period which expired about two or three years ago; and Tasmania is now responsible for a subsidy of £4,200 a year, and also Eor a guaranteed revenue of £5,600. I hope that we shall be able to arrange, as between the Tasmanian Government and the Federal Government, for an alteration of the cable rates. If that be so, I shall propose, in committee, to re-insert the words which were eliminated by the Senate, through, I believe, a mistake; and when that proposal is made we shall know that the charge will most likely be hd. per word, instead of l d . The words to which I have referred were eliminated by the Senate on the representations largely of the senators representing Tasmania, who believed that the Bill lost its federal character by containing such an incongruous element, nnd urged the desirability of making a uniform charge throughout the Commonwealth. When some objection was raised by the Postmaster-Geneval, the senators for Tasmania undertook that the Government of that State would take the responsibility for the elimination of the words. Circumstances have shown, however, that the Tasmanian Government are not in a position to .assume such a responsibility ; and I am sorry to say that my latest communication from tbe Treasurer of Tasmania is to the effect that the rate hereafter must be a matter of arrangement, although at the present time he agrees thafc ifc should be ^d. per word. The result of the conference of Premiers and Postmasters-General, held on 15th and 16fch . May last, was very unfortunate. Afc that 42 Y time a conclusion was arrived at which left the Tasmanian Treasurer in a hopeful state of m in d ; bufc circumstances subsequently arose which showed that the agreement was premature, or, afc any rate, was qualified by some of the parties concerned. Sir John See, speaking on the Federal Postal Bill, saidI think that any loss caused to a 'State in consequence of the alteration of an agreement in connection with cable rates should be a federal charge. I think it is absolutely fair that where a State is under an obligation to carry out a contract it is to its advantage, as well as to the advantage of the Commonwealth, that the Federal Government should meet the deficiency. This concerns all the States. Thereupon the conference unanimously agreed to the following resolution:The conference is of opinion that any loss caused to a State through the cancellation or alteration of an agreement in respect of cable rates should be borne by bhe Gommonwealth. I need not say that in that opinion I thoroughly concur. I am always hopeful that in time we shall become a Federation in reality, when nothing shall remain to indicate that any one State receives differential treatment. tion to pay for the disadvantages of geographical position. Sir PHILIPFYSH I do not think that the question of geographical position ought to enter into the discussion. The question is whether we are one people; if so, there should be one purse. law, but we cannot cancel distance. Sir PHILIPFYSH I have told the House that in committee I propose to move the re-insertion of tlie words eliminated by the Senate. I recognise that the Tasmanian cable is under different conditions from those which govern the wires through' Western Australia and South Australia. The Tasmanian cable is, so to speak, rented from a company, whereas the wires through Western Australia'and South Australia belong to the State, which has incurred capital outlay on their construction. The interest on that capital is a charge on the people generally; and we must not forget that the loss on the Post and Telegraph department arises largely from the fact that in carrying messages for a minimum charge of Is., nothing is charged for interest on the construction of the -wires through the mainland States. Thafc loss is borne by the people generally, whereas in Tasmania the rental",23,Smith Did The Honourable Railway Office And Delivered By The Railway
95,Mr Glynn,We cannot expect federa,24,Smith Did The Honourable Railway Office And Delivered By The Railway
96,Mr Glynn,"There may be one uniformis borne only by the people using the cable. There are only one or two further points with which I wish to deal. The cost of press telegrams will, by the Bill, be brought into line, uniform charges being .provided throughout the Commonwealth. In committee, however, it will be my duty to call attention to an incongruity which arises in this part of the B ill by reason of the action of the Senate. TheB ill as sent to the other Chamber provided charges within any State, as follows :-2 5 words, 6d.; 50 words, 9d. : 100 words, Is. 6d.; and every additional 50 words, or portion of 50 words, 9d. That was a sliding scale, advancing by proper degrees ; but, for some reason or other, the Senate thought it advisable to make the charge 6d. for any additional 50 words, or part thereof. The result of the amendment is that the last 50 words are charged only 6d., while intervening 50 words aid charged 9d., and the rates are taken out of line so far as press telegrams from State to State are concerned, the charge in the case of the latter being Is. 6d. for every additional 50 words, or part thereof. In committee I propose to make the charge 9d., as before. I do not think I need keep the House any longer on this measure. I have no doubt that when we get into committee a great number of points will arise, but these I shall not anticipate. I have a mass of papers here, but I think the House will regard what I have said as sufficient for a second-reading speech, further opportunity being afforded in committee for considering details. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I think that the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Eysh, is to be congratulated upon the clear and satisfactory explanation of the Bill with which he has favoured us. Upon an occasion like this, we should not forget the Postmaster-General. not a member of fchis House, and we have therefore nofc been brought into immediafce contact with him as we have with other Ministers, we can all bear testimony to fche painstaking manner in which he has discharged his duties. There can be no doubt as to the great responsibility attaching fco the discharge of those duties, and fche immense labour involved in it, especially and for the Governments of the various during the earlier period pf the history of the Commonwealth. The Minister has been called upon to deal with many serious and knotty problems, and to reconcile and harmonize the conflicting interests arid laws of six States, and although there may be in fche Bill many provisions in regard to which fchere will be differences of opinion, I think it must be regarded upon the whole as an honest attempt fco promulgate a uniform postal system applicable to the whole of Australia. Our Post and Telegraph department is an institution of great magnitude and importance, and affects the commercial, social, and domestic life of the whole of our people. It must, however, be regarded not merely as a taxing department, but as a department established to render services' to the public. The public should not expect to receive those services gratuitously, however, but should be prepared to pay reasonably for them. Unfortunately there has been a tendency to look upon the Post-office as an institution which should give almost gratuitous aid to many of the ordinary occupations of life. In my opinion, those who use the Post-office should pay for the services rendered by it . But while we should demand fair and reasonable remuneration for the carriage of mail matter and for the transmission of telegrams and telephone messages, we ought to remember that if the charges imposed are excessive, or are regarded by fche public as excessive, there is a danger that the facilities provided by the department will not be as fully used as they should be. Therefore, the great problem with which we have to deal is, how can we secure fair payment for -the services rendered by the department, and at the same fcime provide that the charges imposed shall not be such as will drive away business, and prevent the proper utilization of the facilities offered. Clause4 sounds the right key note in regarding a. postal rate as a fee or charge for the performance of a postal service, and clause 5 gives effect to that principle by providing Although he is fchafc all letters, telegrams, and postal articles transmitted through the post on behalf of fche King, or of the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State, shall be subject to postal and telegraphic rates. The Postmaster General is to be heartily congratulated on that provision. The Postal department is held in trust by him for the people of Australia, States of the Union. The States Governments are interested in the revenue earned by the Post-office, and consequently it is only right that they should pay in cash for fche services which ifc renders to thein. We should hail with satisfaction this thafcfcheywill speedily become reconciled to provision for the abolition of the vicious it as a natural and inevitable one. franking system which has existed in the States for so long.

If there be substantial objections to the proposal on the ground that ifc would not pay, I shall not press it I merely present this view to the consideration of the House, because certain newspaper proprietors in some of the States will have to submit to the shock of having all their free carriage taken from them, and it it is only right that any suggestion made by them, which would tend to mitigate that loss, should be fairly and reasonably considered. attention is the rate which is to be charged for fche carriage of single newsN o ; bulk parcels papers weighing more than 8 ozs. Under fche Victorian Acfc, newspapers up to 10 ozs. in weight have been carried for -id. each, but under the Bill as it stands, the weight limit has been reduced to 8 ozs. I desire the Minister to take a note of thafc alteration,. and to give afc a later stage some explanation of fche reason for ifc. Byfchereduction, the large newspapers, such as the Sydney MaU, the Adelaide Observer, the Town and Country Journal, the Australasian, the Leader, and other large and important journals, will be excluded from fche benefit of the £d. post. Most of these large newspapers, which are very interesting and attractive literary productions, weigh more than 8 ozs., and thus the postage required to be paid upon them will be l d .

123,Sir John Quick,"There may be twoBendigo, and Ballarat, tbose who are tlie principal customers of the Telegraph and Telephone departments, strongly object to the proposal, whicli on the business done by the 'Melbourne Stock Exchange will it is said involve an extra charge of 1,800 per. annum that they use the f u l l number of words in their messages, while, as a matter of fact, they very rarely do so. S""ir JOHN QUICK -I the information which has been placed in my hands, and on the basis of the business done last year, it has been calculated that the amount I have stated will be the extra charge involved by the proposed . change. This is a provision which has rendered this Bill very unpopular Another objection is this: It is proposed under this Bill to have three rates for telegrams, a sixpenny rate within towns and suburbs, a nine penny rate within a State, and a shilling. Inter-State rate. The question is asked-Why this specialfavour of sixpenny conceded to the city aud suburbs and not to the country? such a discrimination as that 1 account of the greater number of telegrams sent. pay throughout the country 1 number. Sir JOHN QUICK business people or private individuals in the capitals should have the advantage of sixpenny telegrams, while people throughout the country aredeprived of that advantage. I would add that in-the various great centres, such as Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney, the people have the benefit and advantage of the telephone system.. I venture to say that if the sixpenny telegram system is extended in these great centres, it ' will mean either that the telephone revenue will be injured by the sixpenny telegram system, or that the telegraphic revenue wUl be injured by the telephone system. If we are to have sixpenny telegrams the system should be mode general within a State, and should not be confined to city and suburbs. If it will pay in the city and suburbs, it will also pay throughout the country. There is no doubt that it must involve increased expense in the city and suburbs, because additional messengers, and possibly additional operators, will be required, whilst the extension of the system to the country should not involve much extra expense. Another objection has been taken to the Inter-Staterate. It has been pointed out as a very extraordinary anomaly under this Bill that, whilst the charge proposed for sending a telegramfrom Melbourne to Wodonga is 9d., the charge proposed f o i sending a tele am only giving, gram from Wodonga to Albury, on the other side of the river, is Is. that. Sir JOHN QUICK I am very glad to hear it . The provision certainly seems anything but a federal one. The matters to in. .those quarters. which I specially desire to call attention, in so f a r as the telegraphic rates ure concerned, differential ore the proposed charge for names and addresses of sender and sendee, and the proposal to introduce a sixpenny telegram system for towns andsuburbs, while the should there be country districts are left out in the cold. I telegrams trust that when we get into committee the Ministeri n charge of the Bil l will.be able Why should we make to formulate some scheme for the sending of cheap telegrams at aminimum rate of 6d. within each State. I am sure that he will have the assistance of honourable members in making the B ill comwill it not plete and workable, and one which will tend to recognise and harmonize our new federal conditions' as far as possible.
