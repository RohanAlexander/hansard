Beyond that, I am not able to give the honourable member any information about that matter. The fact is that very few contracts are being let by the Postmasterfor use. Goneral's Department for the construction of lines, as we let contracts also for the' construction of telephone exchanges, buildings, post offices and the like. So far, the contracts that have been let have proved quite satisfactory to the department. of the Postmaster-General been directed to the fact that in the town and district of Walcha, due to the extensive programme for the land settlement of ex-servicemen, increasing pressure has been placed upon the postal facilities and the antiquated post office in that town? Can the Minister inform the House whether there is any possibility of even temporary 'action being taken to relieve the situation there? conditions at Walcha are not all that one would desire them to be. honourable member is not satisfied with the postal facilities in his electorate.

Will these additional aircraft improve the flight schedules of commercial jet aircraft, such as the between the capital cities, from the point of view of both the number and the duration of flights? Is there auy indication yet when Trans-Australia Airlines will place its Vickers Viscount aircraft in operation? Will these aircraft operate on capital city routes only? Has the Minister any information in relation to other new types of aircraft being purchased by airline operators in Australia? DC6 aircraft purchased by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be in operation, I think, some time next month. I do not know on what routes they will fly. That is a matter for the management of the company. I presume that they will iiuprove the flight schedules between the various capital ci ties. The use to which Vickers Viscount aircraft will be put is a matter for the management of Trans-Australia Airlines. I presume that they will be flown on the capital city routes, although this type of aircraft is suitahle to land at any place where a DC3 machine can land, which opens UD possibilities for country services. I do not know of any other purchases of new type3 of aircraft by Australian airline operators, except for a Heron recently imported by Butler Air Transport Proprietary Limited. Civil Aviation inform the House whether a decision has been made to remove the automatic control device from planes operated by Trans-A ustralia. Airlines and other airline services? Is the Minister aware that the pilots flying these planes are deeply concerned about the decision to dispense with these safety devices? If such a decision has been made, had the Minister any say iu the matter? If so. i.* he satisfied that the discontinuance of the use of these controls is in the best interests of safe flying? representations from the pilots or from the pilots' association in relation to this matter. I shall try to ascertain the facts for the honourable member. Civil Aviation state whether the major airports of Australia which handle overseas aircraft are suitable for the handling Comet? Are suitable refuelling facilities available? Is it anticipated that overseas airline services will be operating jet aircraft in Australia in the near future ? are suitable for handling Comet and other types of jet aircraft. As far as refuelling facilities are concerned, a forced fuel feed system will be installed at Mascot. At other centres the usual mobile refuelling systems will bo in operation.

""Will he order the security quite wrong about this matter. I have service to stop the tapping of telephone, teleprinter and telegraph circuits and direct the Postmaster-General to restore the integrity of these channels of communication ? able gentleman began by asking about four Questions, and then he asked a couple more in which he assumed the correctness of everything to which the previous questions referred. That is against the Standing Orders. Minister wish to reply? that the security service is vastly concerned with the integrity of Australia. Whether it has an office in CanberraI do not know. If I had your army of snoopers, I would know. Prime Minister. able member for East Sydney must not interrupt. Prime Ministership shows the desire of the moth for the star. When I deal with the security service, I deal with the head of the service. He comes to see me in my office. Whether he has an office in Canberra, I cannot say. honourable gentleman ask him ? out where k is, but whether I shall convey that knowledge to anybody else is an entirely different matter. LONG RANGE WEAPONS able member for Hindmarsh asked me a question about the auditing of accounts at Woomera. He inquired whether the audit system in my department was satisfactory and whether there was any truth in a rumour that there were large-scale discrepancies and an attempt to cover up shortages of stores at Woomera. I want to tell the honourable member that he was had it investigated. As I told him when I replied to his question, the matter he had raised had no reference to the Department of Supply. I suggested it might have reference to another department. The construction of the Woomera establishment was a large-scale undertaking. Most of the construction work was carried out by the Department of Works, on behalf of my department. I have the permission of the Minister for Works to say that there were difficulties Does the Prime in his department so far as the stores recording system was concerned. These difficulties relate to the past, and nearly all of them occurred when the Chifley Government was in power. They were commented upon by the Auditor General and the position has been corrected. When a very large undertaking is being pushed forward repidly as a matter of government policy, it is not uncommon that recording and accounting systems have difficulty in keeping pace with construction work. That difficulty has been overcome. I am sure the House will be glad to hear that, so far as we know, there has been no loss, to the Australian taxpayer. to a letter said to have been written recently by the Prime Minister of Ceylon to the Governor General of that dominion about the playing of the National Anthem, the use of the flag and the position of the Governor General.

35,Mr Osborne,"My question relatesthe Prime Minister of Ceylon to the Governor General of Ceylon was reported in the press four or five days ago. Since then, the Prime Minister of Ceylon has said tliat his statement was wrongly reported and, I think, grossly distorted in the course of publication. He has issued a further statement in which, I believe, lie has set at rest any doubts about what he said or meant in relation to the Governor General, the flying of the flag and the playing of the National Anthem. He has said that the flying of the British flag and the playing of the British National Anthem will take place during the visit of the Queen and on all other appropriate occasions. He has said also that the Queen will be given a right royal welcome when she comes to Ceylon. These are matters entirely for determination by the Government of Ceylon, but I think I am in order in saying we all realize that the unity of the British Commonwealth is something that has to be preserved because anything that diminishes that unity diminishes the strength of each of the component parts of the Commonwealth. ""WAR. which is addressed to the Prime Minister, by stating that some time ago an announcement was made that moneys received from the sale of Japanese assets in this country would be distributed among Australian ex-prisoners of war!

Can the Minister for External Affairs say whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is experimenting with methods to eradicate bracken? Bracken is a troublesome and persistent pest in our high rainfall areas, particularly in the Mount Lofty Ranges, and the south-eastern districts of South Australia. eradicate bracken is very well known. I can well imagine that bracken is very troublesome in the honourable member's electorate, and in many other parts of Australia as well as in many overseas countries. As far as I know, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is not now conducting any work designed to discover a method to eradicate bracken. All sorts of chemical methods of treatment have been tried in the past, including experiments with hormone weed-killers. They have all proved almost entirely negative. Work has also been undertaken in connection with this matter in other countries, notably in Scotland, and that has proved equally ineffective. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is keeping a careful watch on work that is going on in other countries towards the perfection of chemical means to destroy bracken. At the moment, this plant cannot be destroved except by burning wherever possible, mowing, trampling down by stock, and, in particular, by competition of pasture plants after mowing or burning. I regret that I cannot give the honourable member any comfort in respect of this matter, because research into it has come to a full stop for the time being. However, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has the matter in mind. for Territories whether an audit of his departmental accounts in New Guinea has disclosed grave examples of excess expenditure, absence of commercial project and administrative records, increase of outstanding amounts and instances of unsatisfactory store accounts.

Minister for Territories a question in relation to the unfortunate massacre of two Australian patrol officers and two police boys, at Telefomin, New Guinea, recently. Is it a fact that the killing of these men by New Guinea natives was the result of the drowning of five carriers who were members of a previous patrol led by the late Geoffrey Harris? Is it also a fact that the promise of compensation to the relatives of the five carriers had not been honoured? Is it also a fact that the delay in considering such payments had extended over a period of four months? Will the' Ministei' call for a report on the cause of this delay? Will he also instruct the oflieers of his department in New Guinea to deal more expeditiously with claims of this nature with a view to strengthening the goodwill between the native population and the white residents? to make the observation that the honorare working in the area. I feel sure that able gentleman has asked some questions, if the missionaries had noticed anything and then assumed that the statements consuggesting food shortage, they would have tained in them are true? They are not directed my attention to it. So far no true. I also wish to correct his use of shortage of food or failure of agriculthe term ""massacre"".

So far it line of progress in the territories have has not been established that the incident been directed to encouraging people to try referred to by the honourable member has to grow their own food rather than any relation to the happenings at Teleimport it. That is customary over a fomin. Apparently the honourable memlarge part of the Territory of Papua and ber has taken at their face value some New Guinea. newspaper statements that are nothing more than surmise. The investigation has shown so far that there is no truth in any of the statements contained in the aware of the strong protests that have honourable member's question. for Territories aware that in the area of Buin, at Bougainville, in the Solomon Islands, both the white and the native peoples are very short of food I believe close to starvation level? The Minister will appreciate the difficulty experienced in growing food in this area because of the terrific rainfall. Will he immediately investigate the position and send necessary food at a reasonable price because rice is beyond the means of people in the area? Will he also investigate the possibility of securing for them the American multi-purpose food, known as MPF, which is made up in packets and is supposed to be very nutritious for people living in the circumstances of those in the area concerned? ledge of the rather alarming situation which the honourable member has sketched. In July last, I visited Buin, Sohano and Kieta and as I travelled over Bougainville, I formed the impression of flourishing gardens and of every one in the highly satisfactory condition of being well fed. Australian officers are stationed at a number of places in Bougainville, and I am sure that if any unusual situation had arisen since I was there in July they would have directed my attention to it.

Does the right honourable gentleman agree that this religious persecution is in direct workers at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, defiance of the Declaration of Human Rights, in which Poland professes to be; lieve? ""What action, to which Australia may subscribe, can be taken through the United Nations or other channels? weeks I have received, and other honourable members have also received, a great number of protests from a variety of sources about the persecution of church leaders in Poland. Undoubtedly, there is a great volume of indignation in this country about that persecution. The persecution, of course, is clearly an example of the violation of fundamental human rights which unfortunately has been not uncommon in recent years in certain countries. As far as the Government of Australia is concerned, we have instructed the members of the Australian delegation to the United Nations to watch for an opportunity in debate to express the Australian Government's abhorrence of such acts of religious persecution. The Government has also instructed the acting High Commissioner in London to lodge a protest with the Government of Poland. for Health explain why pensioners confined to approved hospitals other than public hospitals are denied the additional Commonwealth benefit of 4s. a day? Does the Minister know that public hospitals cannot cater for all the aged and invalid people who require treatment and that, because of the Government's denial of thc full benefit while they are in hospital, pensioners are compelled to meet the extra cost of hospital treatment out of their pensions, and are caused acute hardship? Will the Minister take action to have the full benefit paid to all pensioners irrespective of the hospital to which they are admitted? the benefit to pensioners is covered by the hospital benefits agreements with the various States. The agreements do not apply to private hospitals. to the Minister for the Navy, relates to the dismissal of many hundreds of New South Wales, and the resultant necessity for many tradesmen, highly skilled in naval construction, to seek work elsewhere. Will the Minister inform the House what measure of protection will be given to apprentices to this highly skilled work, and thus allay the fears of their parents caused by the action of this Government in curtailing naval construction at this national dockyard? employees at Cockatoo Island Dockyard is at present approximately 2,450, which is the average number employed there during 1952. For a very short period the number of workers employed at the dockyard was increased, but because of the fall-off in civil demand a number of men has since been retrenched. During 1953-54 the demand of the Royal Australian Navy will remain as high as it was during 1952-53. Therefore, the dismissals that have taken place at the dockyard cannot be attributed to action taken by the Department of the Navy or the Government. For the benefit of the honourable member I may add that I think it is true to say that what has happened is that the dockyard is no longer repairing big ships like Palana and Aorangi. As civil demand has diminished workers have been put out of employment, but I have heen assured that they have rapidly found employment in other industries or other parts of the shipbuilding industry. The honourable member will know, perhaps better than any one else, because of his association with the Cockatoo Island dockyard, that apprentices are under indenture and that they will not be discharged because of the dismissal of approximately 200 employees. The standard of the training given to apprentices at the dockyard is extraordinarily high. It is recognized by the trade union movement as being almost unequalled elsewhere in Australia. If a lad goes through his training at Cockatoo Dockyard he is quickly taken into his trade and recognized by the trade union movement as a first-class tradesman.",15,Religious Persecution

In Canberra, perhaps a little extra paint is being applied to cottages along the route that will be followed by Her Majesty. I would not say for one moment that such is not so.

As honourable members may be aware, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 gave officers or ratings of the permanent naval forces who had an entitlement to deferred pay, a right to elect either to contribute for full beneunits based on their rates of pay for rank. fits, for limited benefits or not to contriI f they now elect for full benefits, it simply bute under the act. Those who elected not to contribute under the principal act retained the right to a lump sum payment of deferred pay which accrues until their retirement, but since exercising that right of election, certain members have realized the advantage of the benefits to which they would have become entitled had they elected to become contributors for full benefits, and have accordingly made representations for permission to withdraw the election they previously made and become contributors to the fund. The desire of these members to acquire instead of for limited benefits. rights to benefit under the act on retirement, and to adequately safeguard their concern minor matters which in the course dependants in the event of death during of administration or altered conditions service, can be readily appreciated, and applicable to thc services have been found as these members have accepted the service to be desirable or necessary and have been as a career, this bill will permit them to recommended by the Defence Forces revoke the election previously made, and Eetirement Benefits Board constituted allow them to contribute to the fund on a under section 5 of the act.

Territories) [3.23] I move That the bill be now read : i second time. The House will recall that by tbe New Guinea Timber Agreement Act of 1952 approval was given to an agreement between the Commonwealth and Bulolo Gold Dredging Limited to form a company to be known as Commonwealth-New Guinea Timbers Limited for the purpose of working the timber stands at Bulolo in the Territory of Papua-New Guinea. The text of that agreement was appended as a schedule to the act. The agreement provided for a nominal capital of Commonwealth-New Guinea Timbers Limited of £2,000,000 ancl by the act of 1952 the sum of £500,00.1. was appropriated from Consolidated Revenue as the Government's first contribution to that ca pital. Commonwealth-New Guinea Timbers has proceeded with a. great deal of energy in the establishment of the mill nnd plant at Bulolo and is on the point of commencing operations. As a. result of this rapid development it was decided that a further £500,000 would be required during 1953-54 to bring the paid-up capital of the company to £1,500,000. Of the additional amount of £500,000 to be provided tliis year the Government's share will be £250,000, and the sole purpose of the bill now presented to the House is to appropriate that amount. Provision, of that sum has already been made in the budget for 1953-54. No new principle or any point of policy is involved in the appropriation of this amount. I commend the bill to the House as very heartening evidence of the rapid progress that is being made in a great joint enterprise which should be of marked value in the progress of the Territory. I also take this opportunity to express appreciation of the way in which the company has applied itself to the purposes for which it was formed. adjourned. BILL (No. 5) 1953. Debate resumed from the 12th November (vide page 171), on motion by Sir That the bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to amend the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 5) 1930-1939. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden), in his second-reading speech, indicated the nature of the proposed amendments. The Opposition will not oppose the measure. However, my colleagues and I desire to take this opportunity to discuss the sales tax generally in relation to the proposed amendments. The sales tax was first introduced in 1930 by the Scullin Government when its need for increased revenue was urgent: At that time it was believed that the imposition of the tax would not have a very great impact on the cost of living or on the cost of production and services. I had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss this matter with Mr Scullin when he was Prime Minister. He informed me that his Government had investigated the imposition of sales tax in Canada and that a survey indicated that in the circumstances existing at that time the greater part of the burden involved in the imposition of the'tax would have to be borne by those in industry best able to bear it and, consequently, the full impact of the tax would not be made on the cost of living. The tax operated in its original form until 1940, when the government of the day, in order to obtain additional revenue, introduced the multiple rate system. However justified that alteration may have been under war-time conditions, it had the effect of making more complex the administration of the tax and of increasing the cost of collecting it. At the same time, the task of the business community was rendered still more difficult. Reports of the Commissioner of Taxation disclose that the cost of collection of the sales tax is less than that of any other class of tax. But the actual cost",19,Ageeement Bill 1953

80,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [3.36],"to the Government in this respect does not represent the final cost to the community, because the tax is imposed on the principle of self-assessment. Clearly, the cost incurred by the business community in collecting the tax on behalf of the Government is substantial. In addition to the revenue derived from the tax that cost is passed on in the prices of manufactured goods and, accordingly, is reflected in the cost of living. It is clear, the payment of sales tax on goods that therefore, that the tax. is complex and costly to collect, notwithstanding that the cost to the Government is small, and that it has an irksome effect upon the business community. Sales tax and other indirect taxes are described as regressive taxes. The percentage of their incidence varies inversely with the income of the taxpayer. An extensive survey conducted long ago in Great Britain proved that the ratio rises very steeply in the low income groups. The proportion is as high as 10 per cent. able member appears to be engaging in provides for the deletion of a redundant a general discussion of sales tax. I point section.

One amendment refers to are imported for the purpose of being re-exported later. As the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) pointed out in his second-reading speech, the Collector of Customs, who collects the tax on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation, has power to hold the tax for a period of twelve months and then, if the goods are re-exported, to refund it to the trader. The bill provides that the Collector of Customs shall be empowered to accept a security or an undertaking for payment of the tax. The Opposition does not object to that proposal.

87,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"; goods are not re-exported and are sold in Australia, the ultimate purchasers pay, uot only the sales tax paid in the first place hy the importing company, but also an extra percentage at the rate of the margin added by the retailer to the original cost. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) tried to direct attention to this anomaly when he spoke of the evils of sales tax. The margin allowed to retailers might be 50 per cent, or 33^ per cent. The percentage would be applied to the wholesale cost and the sales tax combined. This would have a severe inflationary effect on retail prices. they are now 16$ per cent, and 12-& per Reference has been made in this House already to-day to the effect of inflation on transport costs. This system of levying sales tax has a serious inflationary effect. I have said, for the sake of illustration, that the sales tax on a consignment of imported goods could amount to £100,000. That figure is improbable, but it indicates the danger of the system. I agree with the Government's proposal to provide greater protection for persons who import such goods. The Opposition does not oppose the bill, but we wish to take advantage of every opportunity to remind the Government and the public of the spiralling inflationary effect of sales tax upon the cost of living. the Army) [3.39] I shall reply briefly to the observations of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), who spoke of the inflationary effect of sales tax. This bill will not have an inflationary effect. It refers simply to goods prescribed under regulation, such as travellers' samples, certain goods imported for the purpose of public exhibition or entertainment, personal belongings of tourists and temporary residents, wedding presents, containers and goods imported for the purpose of being re-exported. No sales tax is payable on those items if the persons who bring them into this country are to leave again within twelve months. immediately. refunded. There is no impost on the public at all. I remind honourable members opposite, who have referred to tlie inflationary effects of the sales tax, that this form of tax was introduced by' the Scullin Government. Therefore, when they are criticizing this imposition, they should remember that the party to which they belong was the author of it. Both the Curtin Government and the Chifley Government substantially increased the sales tax. This Government has reduced the number of sales tax classifications from four to two. Whereas previously the classifications were 50 per cent., 33-J, per cent., 20 per cent, and 12-J per cent., cent. If anybody is to be applauded for having eased the burden of sales tax, it is this Govei'nment and not honourable members opposite.

Of course, thc honourable gentleman administers a branch of our defence forces and he is accustomed, as he thinks, to defending the country. the facts. and inadequately stated by the Minister. Under the Labour Government, the basic rate of sales tax was 8-J per cent. In 1949, the party to which the Minister belongs promised to reduce the rates, but the basic rate is still 50 per cent, higher than it was at that time. Instead of being 8$ per cent., it is 12-J per cent. Members of the Liberal party clearly promised to reduce the sales tax on essential items, such as furniture, but they have not done so. The rate has not beeu reduced, and the actual yield from the tax has increased enormously. prosperity in the country. rently believes in inflation.

This year, in spite of the over-vaunted reductions announced in the budget, the yield will be reduced by only about £1,000,000 on last year's figure of £90,000,000. The basic rate is the importaut rate from the point of view of young people who need furniture for homes, and those are the people who were specially mentioned in the promises of .Liberal leaders such as the Minister for tlie Army.

The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) took great care not to disclose that under Labour the highest rate of sales tax was 25 per cent., which is considerably higher than the maximum rate provided in the current legislation. The right honourable gentleman said also that large sums of nioney are being collected by way of the sales tax. Of course, large sums of mouey are being collected by way of the sales tax because of the buoyancy of the commercial life in this community. So far from being a thing of which we should be ashamed, it is a thing with which we may be highly delighted. The Leader of the Opposition continually refers to inflation in this House although he knows that the policy of his party, as disclosed by him from time to time, is to provide a tremendous amount of bank credit which could only send inflation flying even higher. should not have 'risen in this debate except for the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), who ostensibly sought to correct some statements by the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis). The right honourable gentleman noticeably refrained from referring to goods from which the sales tax has been removed entirely by this Government. that matter in this debate. to like matters and I am replying to those references although the honourable member for Balaclava. ( Mr Joske), who received the call before me, has said much that I intended to say. As the honourable member rightly pointed out, greater production has increased the yield from the sales tax; but there is more to it than that. When Labour was in power, sales tax was not collected on many commodities for the simple reason that it is impossible to collect taxes on black-market transactions. That is one of the fundamental reasons why sales tax receipts are so much higher to-day. Although it is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that the minimum sales tax rate was lower in Labour's time than it is to-day, the maximum rate was much higher than it is now. This measure should be considered fairly and free from the party political influences of which the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) is an obvious victim. The measure, as you have rightly pointed out, Mr Speaker, has no relation to the general subject of sales tax rates. However, certain statements made by the Opposition had to be refuted. further debate on this measure, it must be related specifically to the contents of the bill. take it that references to matters already mentioned by honourable members will be allowed ? ber for Mallee( Mr TurnbuU) referred to black markets and I think he should apologize for his reflection upon the",22,Arthur Eadden

Debate resumed from the 12th November (vide page 169), on motion by Sir Thut, the bill be now read a second time. Opposition) [3.50] -The bill proposes that standards shall be established for drugs and other substances used in the prevention and cure of illness. It is of great general importance. If the measure established a framework of standards for therapeutic substances for the whole of Australia, it would be of great significance bnt, as it is, it represents a step forward in thc solution of the important problem of protecting the people of this country from the possible harmful effects of drugs used in the prevention and cure of illness. A great deal still remains to be done. Uniform action must be taken by the Commonwealth and the States to establish common standards for drugs throughout Australia. That could be done by a reference by the State parliaments to the Commonwealth Parliament, under the Constitution, of legislative authority to deal with the composition and standards of drugs and other substances for medical use. The importance and. difficulty of the problem are shown by the second-reading speech on the measure of .the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page). The right honourable gentleman has pointed* out that, ill some respects, the present position is very serious indeed. He has admitted that there is evidence to show that drugs are being supplied that do not conform to the requisite standards, and are incapable of doing the job that the medical profession believes they will do. I think everybody .agrees with the statement of the Minister that it would be criminal to allow such a state of affairs to continue through lack of appropriate action. Even in the case of life-saving drugs, to which the right honourable gentleman referred specifically, there is evidence of the necessity for a close check of standards. Under this measure, standards will be prescribed in regulations, but, in the absence of regulations, reference will have to be made to the British Pliarmacopoeia or the British Pharmaceutical Codex, which provide recognized standards. I propose to give one illustration of the changing situation in connection with life-saving drugs. In 1951, the Minister for Health said that a life-saving drug effective in treating pneumonia, typhoid fever and whooping cough had been produced in Australia for the first time. He said also that the drug, Chloromycetin, was an important addition to therapeutic agents, such as penicillin vaccines and sulpha, drugs, that were being made here. He added that Chloromycetin had been accepted by the American medical profession as an important new antibiotic, and its use had increased rapidly during the last two years. That statement was made in 1951. On the 4th July, 1952, according to press reports published in Australia, the United States Food and Drug administration announced that its entire staff had begun a nation-wide survey to find out whether the antibiotic Chloromycetin was harmful and caused blood disorder. The deputy commissioner of the administration, Mr Larrick, said that 200 new cases of blood disorder called plastic anaemia had been found since the previous Friday among persons treated",23,Arthur Eadden
108,Mr Speaker,Order! This bill,24,Earle Page

110,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thewitli the drug. He said that some deaths had occurred, and reports of more deaths were coming in. At the same time, the American Medical Association Journal warned doctors against the promiscuous use of Chloromycetin. It was stated that three separate articles written for the journal »blamed Chloromycetin for the onset of plastic anaemia. That shows how changes can occur. A great discovery is made. A new drug is used, apparently successfully. But then disaster and death are caused by overuse of the drug or its use in unsuitable cases. Nothing could illustrate more strikingly the necessity to have standards for drugs than the varying reports in connection with antibiotics. The medical profession recognizes that standards must be prescribed. As the Minister has said, it would be criminal neglect if anything were omitted that could be done to ensure that proper standards are prescribed, especially in connection with antibiotics, and that the drugs used shall be such as shall prevent disaster from ensuing. Having made those general remarks, I turn to the bill and ask: How is it that the Commonwealth Parliament is dealing with this matter? The measure is very interesting and, as I have said, represents a step forward. It seeks to establish standards for therapeutic substances imported into Australia. One of the undoubted powers of the Commonwealth Parliament relates to trade and commerce with clause 7 of the bill, the undoubted power of the Commonwealth' over imports is, so to speak, picked up and utilized so that standards can be made to operate in the field of imported therapeutic substances. That is very important. In addition, there is a provision of a general kind with regard to pharmaceutical preparations provided under a law of the Commonwealth. As a result of the constitution alteration of 1946, proposed by the Chifley Government, medical benefits and pharmaceutical benefits can be provided and are being provided, by the Commonwealth. is very important. The Commonwealth has constitutional power to fix the standard. Clause 10 picks up that power, and there is a reference to quarantine, Dr. Evatt. in respect of which the Commonwealth has a limited power. However, I wish to direct the attention of honourable members particularly to the provisions of clause 9, which refers to trade and commerce among the States. The Commonwealth may legislate not only in relation to trade and commerce with other countries, but also in relation to trade and commerce among the States. Therefore, up to a point, the Commonwealth can, constitutionally, ensure that in the course of interstate trade there are effective standards, which can be laid down. Clause9 provides(1.) A person sliail not, without the consent in writing of the Minister, cause, suffer or permit goods that consist of a therapeutic substance to become the subject o! trade or commerce among the States-unless they conform to certain standards. How is that provision to be applied? How will a person, when dealing with these goods, be able himself to distinguish, on the day of sale or even on the day of delivery, whether those goods will become the subject of trade amongst the States? I am only pointing out the enormous difficulty of applying that concept of interstate trade to a subject that cries out for uniform regulation. At present the Australian Parliament has a power over imports and over pharmaceutical benefits within our territories. ""We have a power over interstate trade and commerce for the purpose that I have mentioned. A person is bound to conform to other countries. In a standard. But it is very difficult to apply a rule that is laid down. It is almost impossible to distinguish between goods for interstate trade and goods for trade within a State. Our object should be to establish a standard that is safe whether the goods be for local use or for interstate trade. "" A "" may sell a therapeutic substance or drug to "" B "" and may not know that "" B "" is going to send that substance interstate immediately. Therefore what is required-and the Minister's second-reading speech indicates that he appreciates the position-is action not merely by the Australian Parliament That but also by the State parliaments, assuming of course, that there is a reference of power to the Commonwealth to deal with the subject on a uniform basis. The Commonwealth should be empowered by State statute, until there is a constitutional change, to deal with drugs and therapeutic substances. Apparently there is a desire at the departmental level to do this. However, we are still far short of that objective. It will be very difficult purity for these new drugs. Of course to apply the provisions of clause 9 because of the way in which local trade spills over into interstate trade, and interstate trade becomes domestic trade. The drugs are still used, ultimately, for the prevention or cure of disease. Therefore the standard of the drugs is of supreme importance to the people of Australia. The Opposition supports the bill, and agrees with some of the comments made by the Minister. The need for urgent legislative action to achieve uniformity is proved beyond doubt by the illustration that I have given in relation to one drug. Further illustrations could also he given in relation to many other drugs. Let us consider the manufacture of a curative drug, the use of which is not attended by any risk. It must not be forgotten that inadequate raw materials could be used in its manufacture, which would reduce the efficiency of the drug. Therefore Commonwealth action is required not only in relation to importation, but also in relation to manufacture, with which the Commonwealth at present cannot deal. There is a need for co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in this matter in order to achieve uniformity. As the bill is a forward step in that direction the Opposition supports its passage through this House. Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has referred to the powers possessed by the Commonwealth in relation to matters mentioned in the bill. He has also referred to factors of interstate trade. I am glad that he supports the bill. We must not lose sight of the faet that this is a technical bill, which makes provision for the enforcement of new standards in therapeutic substances. This has been rendered necessary as a result of the new life-saving drugs and substances that have come into use during the last decade. It is only right that the Parliament should take steps to protect both the Commonwealth Treasury, and the taxpayers of this country, because claims amounting to millions of pounds are paid each year in respect of pharmaceutical benefits, repatriation dispensing, and the pensioner medical service. It is right that the Parliament should consider standards of there have always been standards in operation during the years that drugs have been dispensed and distributed to the community, but the bill lays down unified Australian standards in relation to drugs that are in general use. The British Pharmacopoeia, which is referred to in the bill, is a treatise on the standards of drugs. It is published at frequent intervals. That official publication contains specifications and standards for drugs used by the medical profession in ali British Commonwealth countries. The British Pharmaceutical, Codex is also referred to in the bill. That publication provides standard test methods of preparation for all drugs and combinations that are not in common use, and which are not referred to in the British Pharmacopoeia. From time to time some drugs are removed from the pharmacopoeia and new ones included. In addition to those two treatises, the health departments of the six States administer regulations in connection with the standards of drugs. But unfortunately they vary considerably in each State. Notwithstanding the variations in present State law, there is a very important principle embodied in all enactments that relate to the sale of goods. That principle is that the buyer shall be entitled to receive goods of the standard and quality that he demands and specifies. Consequently, it may be correctly presumed that when a buyer purchases a drug which is in common use, he will obtain the drug at the standard referred to in this measure. That is, when he specifies and demands a drug, he will be supplied with the drug according to the British Pharmacopoeia standard. If he does not get it, then the vendor of the drug is liable to a fine unless the drug is specifically stated to be of commercial standard, second quality or something other than first quality. As well as the drug laws administered by the State health departments, there are special pharmacy laws in each of the six States. The Pharmacy Board in Victoria has promulgated regulations which",24,Earle Page
111,Mr Hawoeth (Isaacs) [4.7.],"Th eprovide that all drugs or medicines prescribed shall be actually used to fill the prescriptions. Also, no specified drug shall be left out of a prescription without quickly to apply simple preliminary tests the consent of the medical practitioner who wrote the prescription. Sometimes the prescriptions of medical practitioners have been found by chemists to be iml>"" acticable, because certain prescribed drugs are incompatible. Therefore, it has often become necessary for a chemist to consult with a doctor in order to arrive at the best method of filling a prescription. The pharmacy boards in the various States lay down specifically what can aud what cannot be done in these circumstances. Thc British British Pharmaceutical Codex, the six State health departments and the pharmacy boards of the States all control the standards and regulations i i i connection with drugs. Therefore, it seems rather peculiar that we' must now have another law to superimpose further authority on the laws of the State health departments aud the regulations of the State pharmacy boards, and I sincerely hope that the bill British Pharmacopoeia. will not foster the development of another big Commonwealth department. I hope that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) will be able to bring some uniformity into the six State health departments, or delegate authority to the States facturers who have set up business to iu some way, so that the new standards in. regard to new therapeutic substances may be administered. If that is not done, them irrespective of their quality. Morewe shall perhaps build, up a large ancilover, the Australian Government which lary section to the present Department of Health, or, indeed, a new department altogether. If that should happen the cost of administration of our health serensure that it will get the drugs that vices would be considerably increased. I agree that there is a great need for uniform drug standards and tests for therapeutic substances throughout the Commonwealth, and to-day honourable members heard the Leader of the Opposition refer to some anomalies in this connection. However, the steady introduction of new drugs has revolutionized medical practice ancl has brought undreamed of benefits to mankind. At the same time these drugs have increased complexities in regard to the administration of the laws controlling the manufacture Mr Haworth. and sale of drugs. In earlier days when drugs were of a more simple nature, pharmaceutical chemists were ablein order to ascertain whether drugs were up to standard. Now drugs are becoming more complex, and elaborate and expensive equipment is necessary to ascertain their quality and standard. That has made the work of the chemist much more difficult. New, complex drugs have increased chemists' difficulties very considerably because simple tests are no longer sufficient. TJnder this measure the manufacturers of these new drugs will have to comply with the specifications laid down Pharmacopoeia, the in the regulations and each package will have to be labelled accordingly. That will particularly apply to new substances like penicillin, sulphanilamide, streptomycin and aureomycin. Nowadays when more and more of these complicated drugs are coming on the market, many of them are being given fancy names by their manufacturers although they are really well-known substances mentioned in the The older manufacturers, whose names are household words throughout the British Empire, will welcome this measure because 'they will be protected from the activities of those newer manumanufacture popular new drugs because there is a quick and ready market for is a big supplier of drugs through its pharmaceutical benefits, repatriation activities and the like, will be able to it orders and pays for. Manufacturers of good repute welcome the bill but, like the chemists, they want to have some say in the carrying out of the regulations, because the regulations will materially affect those manufacturers who have been practising, in some cases underdifferent names, for centuries. Moreover, pharmaceutical chemists should be able to give the Government the benefit of tbeir experience, not only in regard to packages which vary so considerably in different States under State law, but also in connection with the recognition of the drugs and the reduction of administrative expenses. It must be conceded that lay people do not understand the difficulties that arise in carrying on the business of a chemist who is involved in the dispensing of these drugs. The manufacturer must be represented on these committees, too, because he could give a tremendous amount of guidance to the Government. Clause 19 of the bill deals with the making of regulations and provides for the setting up of committees for the purpose of ad visi ug the Minister on matters relating to the importation into Australia of therapeutic substances and on such other matters as may be prescribed. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that he will establish these committees and that they will he composed of the people to whom I have referred, and not only of medical practitioners but pharmaceutical chemists, manufacturers and possibly the wholesalers of drugs all have their own distinct province to represent. I remind the Minister that there are still six State demned and inferior drugs which could health departments in this country and. as far as I know, six pharmacy boards, all policing their own standards and administering their own regulations in regard to the sale of drugs. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that another big branch will not be set up within the Health Department in order to administer this bill. Surely the departments of health that are already functioning in the various States should be able to administer some of the provisions of the bill on behalf of the Commonwealth and so reduce the cost of administering these laws. I support the hill and hope that the Minister will clarify the matters that I have mentioned. high time that legislation of this nature dards would be observed. That is why was introduced in this House. The the Government has been forced to introOpposition does not take objection to the duce this bill. bill, but we criticize the Government for its tardiness in introducing it. The bill seems to have been introduced as a facetask by the chairman of the Ethical saver for the Minister for Health( Sir Pharmaceutical Earle Page), who has incurred the better McDonald, who said that the Minister's part of £20,000,000 in the implementastatement was quite untrue and that the tion of the scheme for the provision of principal cause of the supply of subfree medicines and life-saving drugs standard drugs was the ridiculously low which he announced two or three years prices that were offered for them hy the ago and which he said would be the salvation of this country. Having spent about £20,000,000 of the people's money, he has now told us blandly that a considerable amount of it has been wasted. As a matter of fact, at the end of last year, the Minister announced that tests had shown that some drugs that had been supplied under the free medicine scheme were of such inferior quality as to have no therapeutic value. In addressing the conference of Federal and State health officers which was held in Canberra last November, he said that this was a dangerous state of affairs which should not be allowed to continue. He said that the scheme had cost £7,000,000 a year for prescriptions that had been dispensed by chemists. The Director-General of Health, Dr. Metcalfe, told the conference that the Commonwealth was concerned with the likelihood of the importation of inferior brands of antibiotic and glandular products. He said that Australia was exposed to the dumping of connot be marketed in countries where a stricter control of drugs was exercised. It seems that Australia was caught just as flat-footed in its importation of drugs as it was in the importation of other commodities which flooded this country before the Government imposed import restrictions. The Government should have been much more alert. But the Minister for Health is so enamoured of life-saving drugs that he overlooked that very important fact. Dr. Metcalfe said that the Commonwealth was the purchaser of the great bulk of the life-saving drugs sold in Australia and was entitled to demand that they should conform to accepted minimum standards of purity and efficacy. The Commonwealth could The Minister for Health was taken to Association, Mr",26,Earle Page

I am inclined to accept the viewpoint of the Minister on this matter because he has spent about £20,000,000 on these drugs which represents about £1 a prescription. Influences are at work to dump worthless commodities «in this country and it is time that thc public was given protection against them. A royal commission was appointed hy this Parliament in 1907, the commissioner being Octavius Charles Beale, who examined the whole subject of the sale of imported drugs. He made a world tour in order to investigate the matter and he finally furnished one of the most damning indictments that has ever been made of the people who manufacture and peddle these commodities. Apparently the government of the day decided that his report was too hot to handle because it is still in a pigeon-hole. At long last, something is being done about the matter. Unfortunately, the public has had a raw deal in the meantime. The voices of the few people in thc Commonwealth and State Departments of Health, who have striven to improve this state of affairs have been like voices in the wilderness. Vested interests have been able to ensure that worthless. drugs should remain on the market under different names and in various forms from time to time. The latest craze is the antibiotics with which the Minister seems to be carried away. The made 1,000 findings and either that they were implemented or that another royal commission was appointed in order to review the present situation. Full page advertisements about these commodities appear in the press. I' cite paragraph 1012 of the report of the royal commission, which deals with the question of advertising. It reads in partThey find papers not merely willing but solicitous to share in their iniquitous and fratricidal gains. Paragraph 1013 statesThe shouting in the markets, tlie blatant once heard a medical man say that in advertisements of these quacks, often printed his opinion the majority of the drugs so as to be indistinguishable from reading matter, mislead thousands to their ruin, and the silence of the cemeteries covers their infamies. Mr Morgan. An important point in relation to this measure is whether it will deal with the question of secrecy as well as the question of the efficacy of these substances. The preamble to the report statesThe preservation of secrecy and of the privilege to deceive is absolutely indispensable to the traders whose traffic is reported upon, but the perpetuation of the advantages they now enjoy means moral corruption, physical deterioration, and national decadence. According to the medical journal Lancet, quackery has destroyed more people in this country than sword, famine and pestilence united. History repeats itself. The same old remedies are still advertised in the press. Unfortunately, there is no counter-propaganda. That is where this measure, in the opinion of the Opposition, does not go far enough. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) said that he hoped that the people who will investigate the quality and use of these substances will include pharmacists, manufacturers and representatives of the drug companies. In my opinion, they are the last people who should be .given that responsibility. It should be given to some independent authority unfettered by any vested interests. The public generally should be represented. Many of these substances that are displayed to the public are harmless and are not poisonous like many of the antibiotic drugs. It has been established that of approximately 300 antibiotics, royal commission of 1907 only five-penicillin, aureomycin, streprecommendations and tomycin, terramycin and Chloromycetinit is high time have been regarded as sufficiently nonpoisonous for human use. Unfortunately, as the Leader of the Opposition said, it has been shown that some of those antibiotics are setting up powerful reactions and in many cases are proving to be fatal. Steps should be taken to warn and to educate the public in regard to the various nostrums and secret drugs that are publicized. drugs. otherwise nobody would take them.

According to a recent report, the United States Food and Drugs Administration has warned doctors against the indiscriminate use of the drng Chloromycetin for minor infections. The report statedTlie US. Food and Drugs Administration warned doctors against the indiscriminate use of the drug Chloromycetin for minor infections. It anted on a nation wide medical survey in which some serious Mood disorders were found to have resulted from tlie uso of this potent antibiotic drug. Chloromycetin has been administered to about 8 million patients since it came on the market in 1949. The US. National .Research Council's report said it appeared that disorders in at least 177 of 4.10 serious blood cases studied were associated with the use of Chloromycetin. About half of these patients died, tlie report said. Further evidence was given in the Sydney DailyM i r r o r of the 5th Januaryi n an article whicli read as followsA controversy among many doctors has arisen over a Britisli Medical Journal leading article saying the prescription of powerful antibiotics such as streptomycin and Chloromycetin must be curtailed drastically. It is said that the grave dangers in using the drugs indiscriminately for minor ailments like measles, coughs, colds were (1) the too frequent use of the drugs established a high degree of resistance to their remedial qualities, and (2) Chloromycetin could cause sudden death from a plastic anaemia or degeneration of the vital bone marrow. Critics of the Journal are accusing it of scare tactics-the y claim the drugs are perfectly harmless if they are restricted to normal use. That is the point of view of those who manufacture or retail these commodities. A reliable, independent source, the British Medical Journal, has issued a warning in regard to the dangers of these nostrums. The same comments may be made about penicillin. An article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the l s t Afarch read as follows:"" People had been admitted to Sydney Hospitals seriously ill after taking penicillin"" a leading pathologist said. Ho was commenting on an American doctor's statement (Dr. Sheppard Siegel) that indiscriminate use of penicillin could kill people. The pathologist said ""I haven't heard of anyone dying after using penicillin-but -could happen. We have had quite a few people in hospital seriously ill from its effects."" Mr Morgan. A similar warning was given in the American journal Time. I suggest that these warnings show that the Minister for Health is really out of date in this matter. He is probably 30 or 40 years behind the times in regard to many matters concerning health and medicine. The American journal Time published the following article on the 24th October, 1949, which was before this Government's free medicine scheme commenced:Doctors are keenly aware that the antibiotic (sulpha drugs: penicillin, streptomycin, &c.) have two great dangers: (1) Sometimes the drug has a poisonous effect on the patient; and (2) the bacteria undeiattack may develop a. tolerance for the drug. Last week doctors at tlte 13tli Congress of tlie International Society of Surgery in NewOrleans were reminded of another danger: antibiotics speed up the clotting time of the blood, and thus subject the patient to the risk of death from blood clots forming, breaking loose and being carried through the heart into the lungs. One would have thought that the Minister would have been in possession of such information before deciding to flood the country with these antibiotics or so-called wonder drugs, which have been included in his free medicine scheme. TheM in ister himself must accept responsibility for the admitted huge expenditure and wastage in regard to the worthless drugs which are being brought into the country under his scheme. As the Leader of the Opposition stated, a few years ago the Minister announced the great potentialities of Chloromycetin, which has now been shown to be h a r m f u l and even fatal in some instances. Honourable members may recollect that the Minister eame into the House a couple of years ago and, with bated breath, told us of the wonders of ACTH and cortisone. However, it has been found that they are of no real lasting value. The sad part about it is that many people who suffer from various diseases are led to believe that these nostrums w ill help them. Honourable members may be aware that a. well-known Sydney philanthropist set up a clinic f o i the treatment of cancer, and a certain drug was hailed as the one which might solve the problem of cancer. Ten it "" guinea pig "" patients were put into the clinic, and although their hopes were raised for a few weeks, one by one tbey passed away. I knew some of tbose people. They were led to believe that their lives were going to be saved, but finally their hopes and those of their relatives were completely dashed. This Government is looking about for methods of popularizing itself with the electors. Apparently, the free medicine scheme is the last card in the Government's pack. If the Minister for Health is able to pull some miracle drug out of the hat before the next general election he w ill be cheered by all Government supporters. It seems to me that with his long experience of health matters, greater caution should have been shown in selecting these drugs. What should concern us all is how these therapeutic substances will be used. The Minister has not given us much information at all in that connection. He has asked for power to administer their control by means of regulations, but we know that he has a habit of handing over control of health matters to outside bodies. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) suggested' that those concerned in the trade, the retailers, chemists, manufacturers and drug merchants, should have representation on the proposed committees of investigation. As I have already said, to my in ind they should be the last people to serve on such committees. Indeed, an assurance should be given that the committees w ill be of an independent nature. I.' appreciate that the retailers and manufacturers are entitled to some protection, but it is essential that the members of the investigating committees should be in no way concerned with the vested interests involved. That is the trouble in the United States of America, from where many of these drugs are coming. Recently there was a hullabaloo in that country concerning a drug for .the treatment of cancer which had been discovered there. On the l s t August last the Sydney Morning Herald contained the following report:An investigator for tlie US. Senate Conuncrce Committee said yesterday there was an "" interstate conspiracy of alarming proportions "" to restrict sales of the controversial uancer drug Krebiozen, and that the American Medical Association might be involved. The investigator, Mr Benedict Fitzgerald, said in a staff report printed in the Congressional Record that there was "" reason to believe"" the American Medical Association acted in a "" hasty, capricious, arbitrary and outright dishonest manner "" in opposing immediate use of the drug. His investigation of the Krebiozen controversy disclosed "" the weirdest conglomeration of corrupt, motives, intrigues, selfishness, jealousy, obstruction and conspiracy that 1 have ever seen "". "" The alleged machinations of Dr. J. J. Moore (treasurer of the A.M.A.) could involve the A.M.A. and others in an interstate conspiracy of alarming proportions . . . Public and private funds have been, thrown around like confetti at a country fair to close up and destroy clinics, hospitals and scientific research laboratories which do not conform to the viewpoint oi tlie medical associations. Contrary to the American Medical Association view, it was his profound conviction that Krobiozen was "" one of the most promising materials yet isolated for the management of cancer"", and he recommended that the committee go into the matter furtlier. Honourable members may well imagine the kind of controversies that may arise about the efficacy of therapeutic substances in the manufacture of which vested interests are involved. I believe that there are certain organizations engaged in the manufacture of therapeutic substances in Australia with which members of the medical profession are associated. Great controversies have recently arisen between them and other drug manufacturers. That fact, in itself r calls for an assurance on the part of the body to he charged with responsibility for investigating therapeutic substances that its members are not i h any way to be interested or involved in their manufacture. I am wholeheartedly in accord w i th the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Isaacs when he said that he hoped that the members of theauthority to be established to investigate therapeutic substances should be completely free of self-interest in the matterand that it should not be an arbitrary authority. Proper care should be taken to ensure that the interests of the people shall be protected. Very few of the so called experts who have given their imprimatur to certain of these substances are completely satisfied that they w ill turn out all right. Too often it is a case of "" Your guess is as good as m in e "" . The health of the people must be the first consideration. Provision should be made for a right of appeal against therestriction of output or the banning of the use of therapeutic substances either to the investigating authority or to the Minister for Health. Provision should also be made in the bill for the importation of therapeutic substances for experimental purposes. Although in the first instance the edict may be against the use of a particular substance, after further trial and experimentation it may prove to have desirable qualities. Provision should be made for the re-submission of such substances to a properly constituted examining body. Great credulity is associated with many of these substances. In order to show how a certain impression may be gained, and quite sincerely so, I mention that when the drug ACTH was first discovered, the medical profession of the United States of America was very much enamoured of its prospects. The substance was manufactured by certain drug companies. In 1949, a demonstration of its use was given at the Mayo Clinic, in Chicago. referring to the demonstration, had this to sayLast October, John B. Mote, medical director for Armour, called a conference of those to whom he had given supplies of ACTH for an exchange of reports on the results of their use of the hormone. They met in Chicagof o i two days. [Extension of time granted.'] I thank honourable members for their forbearance. I was just rounding off the point which I desired to make. The article continued""Never have I attended such a conference,"" reported one physician, on his return home. "" It was like a religious meeting, w it h men popping up all over the house to tell of some seeming miracle. No medical gathering in history ever heard reports of so many different diseases yielding to treatment w i th a single drug."" That is how ACTH and cortisone were launched. The article continuedThe Bible relates that the pool of Bethesda stood by the sheep gate to Jerusalem, and hundreds of the sick, the crippled, the withered of body and mind waited at its edge. waited for the moment of healing. to tradition, an angel descended into the pool at certain seasons and troubled the water. Whoever then first stepped in was healed, no matter what his affliction. there exists a universal sovereign through the centuY-ies. The medieval for the elixir of life has been succeeded in more Mr Morgan recent times by the familiar examples of homeopathy, osteopathy, and chiropractic, each w i th its one cause and one cure. Scientific medicine has consistently frowned on all unitary theories of the healing art. But the demonstration of what hormones eau do brings this whole subject under a new scrutiny. To be sure, there are many blanks in tlie hormone picture, many questions yet to be answered, many byways to be explored. For example, ACTH may stop a few attacks of gout; but when administered in the quiet period between attacks, it may also bring on an upflare of the disease. Like a valve, the hormone seems to work in eitlier direction, depending on which side exerts the greater pressure. The report which I have read reveals the credulity of so-called authorities in these matters. The Minister for Health should ensure that proper investigation shall be made of the curative properties of therapeutic substances before the people of Australia are put to the expense of importing them. I am sorry that he did not make suitable inquiries three or four years ago about some of the substances to which the article from which I The Scientific American, have quoted referred. I realize, however, that his department is short-staffed and that it is doing a yeoman job with a handful of men and the limited facilities at its disposal. When the Labour Government introduced its health scheme the present Minister for Health said that, instead of providing free medicine for the people, it should provide them with free coffins. Before he began to give effect to his health scheme he should have sent his officers overseas to obtain the latest health information then available. If he had done so he would not have wasted £20,000,000 of the taxpayers' money and be now engaged -in locking the stable door after the horse has gone. [4.58] -'Contrary to the impression that might have been gaining ground during the last 30 minutes, this is a comparatively simple bill about which little needs to be said. At the commencement of the debate, we were assured by the Leader They of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) that the According Opposition whole-heartedly supported the measure. I am at a loss to know what the honourable member for Reid( Mr The idea that Morgan) is so upset about. I gathered remedy which is that, on the whole, he is opposed to antiover all diseases has persisted search biotics and, in some measure, to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page).",29,Earle Page
115,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"Although thia is a short and simple bill, rt is an important one, because it is concerned with the standards of drugs and with the fact that they should be uniform in strength and be capable of producing the therapeutic effects which are claimed fpr them. It is more than ever necessary to have legislation of this bind in these days because drug usage within the last few years has become quite a different proposition from what it was a few years ago. So many diseases, many of them important, are now treated with single drugs that there has been a revolube used before they can be incorporated tion in the prescribing of drugs. The treatment of common diseases such as pneumonia has become much less difficult than it was a, few years ago. Largely it has become a matter, first, of exact diagnosis and, secondly, of the administraHowever, for the purposes of the legislation of single drugs such as penicillin, Chloromycetin or aureomycin or others that may be prescribed; but because prescribing now is of that nature, it is more than ever important that the drugs should, in fact, do what they are designed to do and that they should be of sufficiently high standard to cure diseases when given in therapeutic doses. That is the object of this bill. As the Commonwealth now meets the cost of most of the major drugs used, it is important tliat the Australian Government should insist upon them being of high standard because they are used throughout the nation. Australia consists of six States and therefore the States and the Commonwealth must join together in ensuring that the drugs used in modern therapeutics are of required standards. Nobody with any knowledge of current affairs believes that the States present Government has. done and is will refuse to co-operate in this matter. The Minister for Health has assured the House that the opposite is the case. However, this legislation is none the less necessary because there must be a unified authority to fix a central standard, and the co-operation of the States in that matter is important. I do not remember the Minister stating in his second-reading speech that the States had actually agreed to pass the required legislation ensuring their co-operation, but he did say that they had agreed to co-operate and I believe that honourable members can conre -[9] fidently anticipate that the legislation will be passed. I turn my attention now to the nature of the tests that should be applied to drugs. By and large, it can be said that there are two main divisions that must be considered. The first includes drugs, the standards for which are laid down in the British Pharmacopoeia and the British Pharmaceutical Codex. The other includes the drugs that are introduced between the editions of the Pharmacopoeia, but may become available and, in fact, in the Pharmacopoeia. That occurs frequently. Many of those so-called drugs are not drugs in the strict sense of the word but are sera or antibiotics or therapeutic substances of a different nature. tion, they can be described as drugs. The testing of those drugs is often a complicated process. It is not a simple chemical analysis, by any means, and often involves what is termed a biological assay. The effect of the drugs and the doses have to be determined by the use of laboratory animals before the drug is applied to human being3. Obviously, some central .standard authority is necessary to lay down for the whole of Australia the standard that the drugs need to attain. The bill makes that provision, I merely wish to say in that connection that I hope the Australian Government will always take advantage of existing relevant authorities. Numerous State universities and hospitals have facilities for testing and standardizing drugs. I hope that any government that is in office will take advantage of them, as the doing, rather than set up complicated new laboratories or organizations to do that work. Again that would require the co-operation of the States. Undoubtedly that will be forthcoming. I turn my attention now to the expert committee on standards to which the Minister has referred. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) was correct in his statements upon that matter. Representatives of the manufacturers should be included on the committee because the manufacture of the substances to which the bill refers is a highly skilled ancl technical process and involves various problems. It is not a matter of getting profits; it is only common sense. The members of the committee should include also persons who are skilled in the pharmacology of the drugs and persons conversant with their uses. 1 am sure that the Minister will giye those matters consideration. It is easy to say, in effect, "" We must not have manufacturers as members of the committee because they might make profits out of it If there is to be a committee to determine the standards of drugs, naturally those who make the drugs must be represented on it. They are the persons who, above all, should be represented. I believe that my brief comments have covered the substance of the bill, for it is not a long or controversial measure. Essentially, all modern drugs should be of high standard because they could fail to produce the proper effects if they are not of the best quality. In addition, their use must be carefully supervised because they can have unfortunate effects from under-dosage or over-dosage. No one of common sense would suggest that a drug should be eliminated from use because it can have unfortunate effects. If that attitude were adopted generally, practically every drug that is used by doctors would be discarded. It is important that imported drugs should measure up to the standards of the Australian drugs, and that the standards should be uniform. bill provides the mechanism to ensure that: that will be so. Other matters for which provision is made in the bill are also important. Drugs should be correctly labelled and it is most important that, the label should be of such a nature that the drug cannot be mistaken for some other substance. The standard of the drug should measure up to the standard that is claimed for it on the label. Those are matters for which provision is made in the bill. sensible measure and with the cooperation of the Statesi t will work successfully. I am sure that the Government has the co-operation of not only all parties in the House but of all the States in putting this most useful measure into practice. Dr. Donald Cameron. [5.10] I agree with the statement of the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) that members of the Opposition are supporting this bill, but I point out that the measure will give rise to some debate, because it affords us an opportunity to discuss certain important matters. This bill may be regarded as a result of the astonishing advances made in medical science and in the knowledge of drugs in recent years. For a long time, the British Pharmacopoeia set certain standards in respect of drugs. Most of the drugs in general, use were well known to the public, and were dispensed by chemists in accordance with the prescriptions written by doctors. About 30 years ago, members of the medical profession begain to prescribe new drugs, and new mixtures of drugs, in place of the drugs named in the British Pharmacopoeia. That change was brought prominently to the notice of the public at that time, because dispensers and chemists, under the agreement between friendly societies and medical practitioners, had been dispensing, at a flat rate of charge, prescriptions written by doctors from drugs contained in the British Pharmacopoeia. As the result of the introduction of new drugs, and new mixtures of drugs, members of friendly societies discovered, when they went to dispensers or chemists, that they had to make a payment in addition to the flat rate of fee, because The certain drugs that were not contained in the British Pharmacopoeia were included in prescription. Usually, they were proprietary lines, and mixtures of drugs, which had previously been mixed by the chemists, or even new drugs. At times, dispensers told me that they had on their shelves some of the drugs which had been prescribed by doctors and for which members of friendly societies had to pay an extra fee because the drugs were proprietary lines. The chemists could have mixed them for the patients It is an eminently without any additional charge to them. As the years passed, doctors, because they considered it desirable and beneficial to do so, began to use, on an increasing scale, these new proprietary lines. In recent years, the life-saving drugs, the antibiotics and others, havo. come into",33,Earle Page

The Ministerf o r Health( Sir Earle Page) speechI regret to state that at tlie present time there is evidence to show that drugs are being supplied that do not conform to the requisite standards and so are incapable of carrying oiu the job which the medical profession believe they will carry out. About a year ago, the Minister, in reply to a question, mentioned that some of the new drugs had not been tested sufficiently to satisfy him that they should be in general nse and should be made available, free of charge, to the public. That statement indicated the need for control of the standard of drugs, and of the importation of various drugs. Doubtless, other honourable members have had experiences similar to that which I am about to relate. suffered for many years from chronic The Government has accepted that advice; diseases, such as arthritis, have asked the expert committee is to be appointed. me: "" Why cannot we obtain such-andThat bears out the statement that I made such a preparation?

The Minister said, in additionwhich I refer is one which the Minister has in mind. This bill represents an measure and complementary legislation is attempt to control the standards and enacted by thc States, the collaboration of manufacture of drugs.

I hope that this monwealth should pass an amending act dealbill w ill achieve, in practice, all the hopes ing with therapeutic substances. As a result of this recommendation, the Commonwealth that have been expressed by the Minister and State governments agreed that a conin his second-reading speech. The right ference of their representatives should be held. honourable gentleman has also mentioned . . . This conference passed a number of the supply of drugs by the Government. important resolutions concerning the regulation and control of therapeutic substances and I assume that he refers principally to of otlier matters incidental thereto . . As I listened to those words, I was i m pressed with the need for action in this matter. The conference to which he referred recommended that the Commonsaid, in his second-reading wealth should enact legislation, to the l i m it of its constitutional powers, relating to the standard of purit y of certain therapeutic substances. The definition of "" therapeutic substance "" given by the Minister w ill be of interest to many people. It is as follows:"" therapeutic substance"" means any material nr substance that is used in the treatment of disease or sickness. I am sure that the people of Australia, when they understand the purposes of this bill, w ill be most satisfied with it . The Minister also statedThe governmental experts at their conference recommended that there should be an expert committee set up to advise the Commonwealth :ind the States on suitable standards for drugs not yet included in either the British or other recognized Pharmacopoeia and other related Persons who have matters which are incidental to such standards. Also, if the I'arliament approves of this those parties will result in uniformity of packaging and labelling of therapeutic submatter recalls to my mind an occasion what are termed the life-saving drugs, which ere prescribed by doctors and are supplied by the chemist to the patient free of charge. The Minister has pointed out that the bill provides that such drugs must be pure and in accordance with tbe requisite standard. Honourable members may well debate this bill on non-party lines. It does not confer a privilege on one section ""to the disadvantage of another section of the community. No privileged group of persons will derive any particular advantage from it. The doctor who prescribes the drugs, and the patient who takes them, will be assured that they are of the requisite standard, and that the claims made in respect of their thoroughly tested. Approval of drugs does not mean that they will provide a certain cure. If any claim that is made in respect of a drug is considered not to be warranted or has not been fulfilled, the supply of that drug will be prohibited. Such a precaution is required, particularly in respect of antibiotics which are so expensive and in such wide use to-day. I compliment the Minister upon the introduction of this measure. I trust that the Government will receive the full co-operation of the States so that only therapeutic substances of an approved standard shall be supplied to the public. If that is done, the people will be re-assured. Certain drugs have been known to impair health some time after they have cured the complaint for which they were originally administered. I should like to know whether anything is being done to protect the public in that respect. One hears frequently of persons having been treated with life-saving drugs which, after they have relieved the complaint for which they were administered, have subsequently reacted unfavorably. Can the Minister say whether consideration has been given to that aspect? The public would welcome an assurance that drugs that are approved by '""hp ""Department of Health will not subsiXjUei.fcly impair the health of patients. desire to make a few comments upon this pletely non-party political spirit because measure which, as the Leader of the we realize the importance of these proOpposition (Dr. Evatt) has said, is supvisions. It is essential that only drugs ported by members on this side of the of an approved standard shall be supplied chambei-. At the same time, however, we accept this opportunity to offer constructive suggestions and to impress upon the Government the urgency of implementing the provisions of the bill. The Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), when concluding Ids second-reading speech, saidIn conclusion, therefore, I state briefly that this Bill will empower the Commonwealth to establish standards for therapeutic substances so far as it may do so, and to prescribe testing facilities to ascertain whetlier such standards are being maintained. In that statement, the Ministei sum1 marized the provisions of the measure and, naturally, no one will take exception curative powers have been to them. However, the Minister has never been noted for expedition in implementing measures that come within his control. His parliamentary career clearly shows that he has a habit of delaying the implementation of measures that fall within his administration. The provisions contained in this measure are vital to the protection of the public, and they must be implemented as speedily as possible. The Minister also saidIn 10-35, Great Britain passed a Therapeutic Substances Act for the control of these substances, and Australia passed somewhat similar legislation in 1937-38. After fourteen long, weary years, the Minister has now introduced a measure to make provision for that control which was embodied in a bill that was introduced when he was a member of a previous government. Therefore, he must accept a share of responsibility for the delay that has occurred in the implementation of such controls. In the intervening period, as the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) has said, millions of pounds have been expended on the provision of pharmaceutical benefits, but effect has not yet been given to provisions that were introduced so many years ago to protect the people against drugs of inferior standard. Honourable members opposite who are members of the medical profession have expressed their views on this measure.",35,Earle Page
117,Mr Halt (Grayndler) [5.23],"I My colleagues and I approach it in a comto the public. On this point, I mention the case of an ex-serviceman who was a prisoner of war for many years during World WarI . After he again enlisted at the beginning of World War II . he fell ill and was admitted to a military hospital. In that institution he was given an injection of a drug of inferior quality and as a result he was paralysed and remained in that condition for the following five years. He was fortunate to make a complete recovery; and he is now employed in a government department in Sydney. That drug was administered to him in all good faith, and his case should convince any one of the need to protect the public against drugs of inferior quality. The honourable member for Reid cited statements by eminent members of the medical profession thai, emphasized this point. The report of tlie 1952 Australian Medical Congress, dealing with the drugs, cortisone and ACTH, statedAccording to Dr. Keith Harris (N.S.W.) these drugs could cause blood pressure, nervous disorders, diabetes, depression, mania, sleeplessness and a false feeling of beiug on top of the world Government supporters appear to have that f e e l in g from t i m e to t i m e Patients reverted to normal wheu the treatment was stopped. One can imagine the ill effects that would result if those drugs were administered indiscriminately. The Minister referred also to what he termed the "" wonder"" drugs. I quote the following report from the Sunday Herald of the 20th July, 1952In the United States of Americai t is estimated that 90% of anti-biotics administered is wasted in over-dosage and in the treatment of diseases not affected by them. Dr. R. A. McDonald, President of the B.M.A. (N.S.W.) said at a meeting of that branch that the picture presented by various -speakers as to their use and harmful reactions was rather gloomy. That statement stresses the need for a measure of this kind and, at the same time, emphasizes the seriousness of the delay that has occurred in implementing provisions which this Government should have put into operation many years ago. A report that was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph some time ago, statedDr. American Academy, said that penicillin, if indiscriminately used, could k ill people. Hi. said that research indicated that penicillin reaction was increasing steadily. Pive doctors at the Academy listed 24 cases of sliock and seven deaths which penicillin had caused since 1950. I do not deny that these drugs have made a great contribution towards the relief of sickness. However, without criticising their virtues, I stress the importance of ensuring the maintenance of purity. Great care should be exercised in their use, and only those of the highest quality should be employed, particularly if lives are at stake. I could quote from now until six o'clock extracts from articles that cite instances in which drugs have been used unwisely, to the detriment of patients and sometimes with resultant danger to life. Indiscriminate use of so-called wonder drugs should be prevented at all costs, and every precaution should be taken to maintain absolute purity. The Minister for Health apparently makes a habit of basing his plans on features of the Labotir party's policy. . Having studied Labour's programme, he devises some half-baked proposition for himself. The result is never entirely satisfactory. The people should realize that the provisions of the bill now before the House are based largely on suggestions that were made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator McKenna), when he was Minister for Health. The Labour party realized at that time the need for safeguards to prevent the unwise use of drugs. Therefore, this bill may be regarded .as a measure inspired by the Labour party. Had the Minister for Health been left to his own devices, without the example of the former Labour Government to encourage him, he probably wouid not have thought of enacting sueh a measure as this, or of giving effect to the act of 1937-38. This bill provides for the establishment of an expert committee to advise the Minister. That is a highly desirable provision, but I hope that the committee will be fully representative of all organizations capable of exercising sound judgment in relation to the use of drugs. It is well known that the Minister for Health is predisposed to favour the Sheppard Sicgal, addressing the British Medical Association. I make that comment without intending to convey criticism of individual members of the association. I recall that, about twelve years ago, the late Mr Chifley named the present Minister for Health as the agent in this Parliament of the British Medical Association. A ll health legislation that he has sponsored since he has been Minister for Health has indicated his tendency to yield to the wishes of the association in all respects. I do not say that the association is always right or always wrong, but I repeat my earnest hope that the proposed expert committee will not be representative only of the British Medical Association, which already is over-represented on many bodies that have been established under the Minister's health scheme. According to the Minister, the bill has been based on the recommendations of a conference that took place some time -ago. rJo doubt the decisions of that conference were carefully considered. Nevertheless, members of the Opposition would not be doing their duty if they failed to place on record tbe fact that the bill, in essence, should listen carefully to our comments was suggested in the first place by the present Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The legislation of 1937-38 should not have been, allowed to remain inoperative. I hope that the proclamation of this bill and other legislation in relation to health will not.be delayed for years in the same way. Such legislation is of vital importance to the community, and it should be put into effect as expeditiously as possible. The people must be protected from the use of inferior medicines. The Leader of the Opposition earlier to-day discussed the constitutional aspects of health administration. We all know that, because health matters fall within the scope of the various State parliaments, prior negotiations are absolutely essential to the effective working of national health plans. The Minister should never falter in his efforts to reach and maintain agreement with the State governments on all matters with which this bill deals. The health of the people is so important that no obstacles should be allowed to stand in the way of the enactment and operation of protective measures of this kind. Long delays must not be allowed to take place. itr. Daly. I commend the bill to the House. I have made various constructive suggestions for the benefit of the Minister for Health because my close study of his health plans since he has been in office has convinced me that he has much to learn. He will learn a great deal if ie will take the trouble to study the policy of the Labour party on such matters. The Labour party is concerned, above everything else, with the welfare of the people and the protection of their interests. All its proposals on the subject, of public health have been made in good faith and after the most careful consideration. I hope that the right honourable gentleman will tell the House before this debate is closed what he intends to do to restrict the activities of people who use inferior drugs. What penalties does he intend to impose on persons who offend, whether deliberately or otherwise? The people must be protected against unscrupulous individuals who may try to exploit their sufferings by using inferior drugs. I give my blessing to the bill. The Minister for Health, instead of smiling cynically at members of the Opposition, and incorporate our constructive suggestions in his scheme. WhilstI support the measure, I sincerely hope that the right honourable gentleman will see fit to amend it at the committee stage in order to improve it in the ways that we have indicated. for Health) [5.38] -in reply-Even after 34 years in this Parliament I must confess to my astonishment at the speech made by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly). I suggest to the honourable member that, if he honestly studies the record of this Government and its predecessors, in the field of health administration, he will compare the present Government to a rocket and the former Labour Government to a tortoise. I remind him that the legislation of 1937-38 was on the statute-book throughout the period of eight years for which the Labour party was in office. The Labour Government made no attempt to proclaim it. The honourable gentleman had the audacity to try to read this Government a. lesson. Like the honorahle member for Eeid( Mr Morgan), he lectured us on such drugs as cortisone and",37,Earle Page
118,Sir Eaele Page (Cowper,"Ministe rACTH. Who made all the demands for the unrestricted use of these drugs during the last two or three years? I resisted all the representations made by members of the Opposition in favour of their inclusion in the list of free drugs because the advice available to me indicated that it would not be wise to do so because of their unfavorable side effects, which the honourable member mentioned i i i liis speech. Because of the attitude that I adopted, those drugs were not made available freely under the health scheme and all the awful results to which the honourable gentleman referred were avoided. 1 thank the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) for some of the constructive suggestions that he made. I understand that honourable members opposite as a whole approve of the biJ] in principle and in detail. However, the speech macle by the honourable member for Grayndler has made it advisable for me to relate the history of the health legislation enacted hy this Parliament during the last twenty years and to record the fact that the Labour party has consistently obstructed all progressive measures. The first definite step towards securing the coordination which is so necessary was taken by me when I established the Federal Council of Health in 1926. That council consisted of the Commonwealth Director-General of Health and the Director-General of Health of each of the States. Members of the council met .'imuially to discuss their mutual problems and to endeavour to co-ordinate their activities. As a result of those conferences we felt that there should be a royal commission to examine the whole of this question, and especially to consider whether constitutional reform should be sought to enable the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of the purity pointed out, when a government of the of foods ancl drugs. What happened? The Bruce-Page Government proposed t;o the Federal Parliament that a royal commission consisting of State and Federal members of Parliament should (»e formed. The Labour party rejected ihat: proposal outright and would not permit it? members to serve on any such royal commission. Thank God, outside the Parliament there were men. in the Labour movement who recognized the importance of this matter! Three men representing various Lahour organizations agreed to sit on the royal com* mission which was headed by Sir John Peden, a leading Australian jurist, who, in addition to having had a great deal of administrative experience in State parliaments, was a professor of law at the Sydney University and had trained most of the lawyers of New South Wales. The royal commission sat for three years and made certain recommendations, in which the Labour representatives must have concurred because the recommendations were unanimous. Foremost amongst the recommendations was that action be taken by the Commonwealth Parliament to ensure the purity of drugs. In the meantime, however, the Bruce-Page Governnient had been defeated and Labour was in office in the federal sphere. Did Labour implement any of the recommendations for constitutional reform made by the non-partisan royal commission? No; Labour did nothing at all. The Labour tortoise was still going backwards instead of forwards. Yet honourable members opposite accuse this Governinent of having delayed action! In 1934, I established the National Health ancl Medical Research Council, which was constituted by an act of this Parliament in 1937. The new body incorporated the Federal Council of Health, and it still exists as the recognized authority. It consists not merely of the various Directors-General of Health, but also of eminent professors of the medical faculties of universities, research workers, and representatives of the lay public. It is a most representative body, and its opinions are always treated with great respect. The council virtually controls and co-ordinates the entire medical research system in Australia. That action was taken, as I have already same political complexion as the present administration was in office. Then we brought down the control measure to which I referred earlier. Why was it not implemented? It was not implemented because we could not get the co-operation of the States that we have been able to secure on tliis occasion. Even now, unless we get 100 per cent, co-operation, we shall not be able to do all that we wish to do. We must have the co-operation of the States, which, after all, hold the major health powers under the Constitution. The Commonwealth has only minor powers, such as the quarantine power. In 1946, when alterations of the Constitution were under consideration, I urged that approval of the people should be sought to widen the Commonwealth's health powers to end for all time the necessity for the Commonwealth to go cap in hand to the State governments when dealing with matters that affect the lives and welfare of the Australian people. That goal was brought nearer by our action in regard to the whole medical scheme when we came into office in 1949. One of our first actions was to introduce the free life-saving drug scheme. That scheme has been criticized by lionorable members opposite; but I do not think their opposition to it is unanimous bet ause the honourable member for Port AcHaide( Mr Thompson) appears to liave an entirely different opinion. Undoubtedly the free drugs provided under that scheme have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in this country. They have cut down the length of serious illnesses, ancl so have eased the hospital accommodation problem. How have we proceeded in this matter? We decided first to make certain that the drugs were pure. For that purpose we have used the laboratory of the Department of Trade and Customs, which is a fine research laboratory, to examine imported, drugs, and we have used the pharmacological laboratories of the universities of Sydney and Melbourne to examine drugs produced in Australia. We have subsidized those two organizations. Our justification for entering this field time to draft. The proposals had to be was the fact that we were dealing with submitted to the States to make certain our own property. We are paying for that they were uniform and that the those drugs and they are being given whole field had been covered. Obviously to the people free of cost. We took we had to be sure that there were no the tional limits might intrusion into health matters, unquesof inferior drugs. I thank honourable tionably we had a right to examine members on both sides of the House for goods for which we were paying. We their reception of the measure. have been doing that all the time, and the suggestion that this measure takes belated action is sheer nonsense. These drugs studied it? are costly. In fact, they cost three or four times as much per prescription as cussed it with them for two or three the drugs that are given to the people of years. The Commonwealth will deal with Sir Earle Page. Great Britain and New Zealand. But we consider it worthwhile to give those drugs to the people of Australia if they are the only medicines that will save their lives or cure their diseases. We do not count the cost. In our endeavour to make the drugs of real use we asked the medical profession, through the British Medical Association, and especially the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, to "" vet"" the preparations and tell us the diseases for which they were specifics, the dosage that should be prescribed and so on. Subsequently we inserted regulation 14A, which lists the diseases that each one of the drugs should cure. In some cases only three or four diseases are listed. In other instances there are as many as fifteen or twenty; but they are all limited;. However, it is possible for a doctor to use any one of those drugs for any disease at all if all other treatment has failed. That is done simply by making application to the appropriate Director-General of Health, who makes contact straight away with the specialist. As a result of these provisions, potent and expensive drugs are being used quite satisfactorily under this scheme. They are controlled in a manner which is envied very much in America. In that country, some potent drugs have been used without restriction, sometimes to the ultimate detriment of the patient. I say, therefore, that this measure is not something strange. It is a properly considered proposal that we should carry into effect. Finally, after exhaustive discussions, this bill establishes co-ordination of Commonwealth and State functions. It is a year or so since the conferences took place, but legislation such as this takes a long view that whatever constituloopholes which would permit manufacexist on our turers to get away with the production",39,Wonder Drugs At The Crossroads
119,Mr Thompson,Hav e the States,41,Wonder Drugs At The Crossroads
120,Sir Earle Page,"Yes. We disimports and interstate trade, and the States will deal with local manufacture and sales over the counter. In that way. either the States or the Commonwealth will be able to take any action that is required. Perhaps it would have been better if the States had referred the appropriate powers to the Commonwealth, but honourable members know how difficult it is to persuade the States to refer power. If we had tried to persuade tbem to do so, we might have argued about the matter for years. However, the States and the Commonwealth, between them, will have power to deal with all aspects of this problem. We are satisfied that we have done the right thing. Provision is made in the measure for regulations to be issued that will enable us to secure the assistance of drug manufacturers, chemists, doctors and other people concerned in these matters. They know their own jobs, and we want them to be our partners in this venture. I assure the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) that we intend to make certain that all sections of the community that deal with the matters with which we are concerned now will be represented on the appropriate committees, and, through such representation, will be able to deal with their own problems. Members of the different committees will be able to meet together and deal with all aspects of the problem. A ll kinds of conferences will be necessary. Let me give an illustration of the kind of thing that will have to be considered. Under the present health laws of the States, a manufacturer is compelled to label his -product in different ways in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Consequently, the cost of the product to the consumer is increased considerably. Ultimately, unnecessary extra costs of that kind will be avoided. I hope the House will agree to the motion for the second reading of the measure. The details of the bill have been discussed, and I trust that when we go into committee we shall deal with it as a whole, so that it can be passed before Labour party in the establishment of the 6 p.m. Question resolved in the affirmative.

124,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)opposed to Labour's methods. The methods specified in the bill are obnoxious and undemocratic. They are completely opposed to all modern thinking in relation to the provision of social services. This Government has been compelled by public opinion, reluctantly, to take a step along the road towards the welfare state that many of its members so bitterly detest. It has therefore embarked on methods which are callous and wicked in the way that they sacrifice the interests of patients and of members of the community generally. They are obviously designed deliberately to do two things: Pirst, to hand over completely to the control of the British Medical Association the health policy of this nation, and secondly, to protect the pockets of the wealthy supporters of this Government from the obligation to make a proper contribution towards the cost of a national health scheme. It needs to be made clear beyond doubt that the scheme now presented by the Government is not accepted by the Labour party, which, at the appropriate time, will present to the people its own comprehensive national health plan, radically different from this paltering and pitiful scheme. In due course a succeeding Labour government will present its health plan to the Parliament for approval. It is worth noting that this is the second occasion on which the Minister for Health( Sir Earle -Page) has presented a health bill to the House. He did not refer to that fact in his second-reading speech. may have made a slight reference to that fact. In March last the Minister introduced a health bill to this House, and made a very long explanatory speech about it ; thereafter the matter was allowed for instructions, aud was told what to do. to rest. Both the bill and the speech wei;e designed solely as placards for the Senate election campaign. accepted it. allowed to die with the prorogation, of the Parliament a few weeks ago. That is an extraordinary commentary on the sincerity of the Minister for Health, and a soi'iy commentary, also, on the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) who says that the people accepted the first bill. They did not do so. How badly drawn was the bill of March last is shown by the scores of alterations that were made to it in order to produce the Minister's second version, which is now before the House. Of course the Minister is most prolific in the produetion of health schemes, all vague and different one from the other. Any one who studies the bill of March last will see that alterations and amendments have now been made on every page. tions? some very remarkable alterations indeed. The Minister stated in his second-reading speech that he saw a happy augury for the success of his plan in his experiences when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth in the Bruce-Page Government in the 'twenties. Whatever the Minister may think of that as a happy augury, it will bc a fearsome augury to the people of Australia who remember this man's record as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, a record which brought from the father of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) a stinging description of him as the "" tragic Treasurer "". After seven years of his Treasurership, Australia was left completely exposed to the horrors of the depression. So that if the Minister can take any comfort from such an augury, he is the only one who does. But, of course, the Minister is nothing if not audacious. All his years of experience in this Parliament have taught him the value of audacity. The Minister claims credit for reaching agreement with the medical profession on health matters. What are the facts? He went to the British Medical Association Now he says. "" Give me credit; I have reached agreement with the British Medical Association The scheme now before the Parliament at no point places any obligation on the medical profession of this country, to which the Minister belongs, to bear social obligations as members of the Australian community.

130,Mr Allan Feaser,"There areit is a medical scheme in the interests of doctors. Throughout the whole scheme flie emphasis is wrongly placed. For many years there have been valid arguments why the Minister for Health should not be a member of the medical profession, and, in many preceding governments care was taken to ensure that, tradition was observed. If confirmation were needed of the value of those arguments, it is to be found in the record of the Minister, and the legislation that he has now brought forward. Typical of his attitude was the speech that he delivered to the world medical association at The Hague a few months ago. Those whom he addressed did not represent, governments, departments of health, or citizens: they were doctors who had been sent to the congress by various organizations throughout the world. From a perusal of the report of the Minister's speech to them, it is obvious that he spoke as though his only concern was to demonstrate to them that his health scheme was suitable for, and profitable to, doctors. I presume that the expenses of the Minister's visit were defrayed by the Australian Government. ""Whether or not that is so I do not know, but at least much of his time was taken up in presenting his views on this scheme to doctors of various countries. I fail to see that any good purpose for Australia was served by the Minister's visit to The Hague, and I should like him to inform the House what ,cood his trip did for Australia, and what it cost the taxpayers of this country. When he"" got to The Hague, many thousands of miles away from where his statements could be checked, be proceeded to make to his fellow practitioners complete misstatements regarding the policy and outlook of the Australian Labour party on health matters. He informed the convention that it was the policy of the Australian Labour party to nationalize medicine. The Minister knows perfectly well that the Australian Constitution permits no such thing. The Commonwealth's only direct power in relation to health is .a quarantine power. The other power is to provide medical and dental benefits hut not so as to authorize any civil conscription. That power was written into the Constitution at the instance of a Labour government in terms that expressly negatived the possibility of nationalizing the medical profession through the provision of medical benefits. The Minister for Health also saidLegislation passed by tbe Labour Government forced doctors to prescribe certain proscriptions. That is wholly untrue. There is not a word of truth in it. At all times under the scheme put forward .by the last Labour Government, doctors were to be free to prescribe for their patients as they thought fit. The one degree of compulsion which was to be attached to pharmaceutical 'benefits was that if a doctor, in his unfettered discretion, decided to prescribe an item contained in the Commonwealth formulary, he should write it on a government form, and thereby make it free to the patient. The compulsion attached to the document to be used, and not to the medicament to be prescribed. The. Minister has done no credit to himself, he has done no credit to his Government and has done no credit to Australia in making statements of that nature. On a par with these statements are the claims made by the Minister-and made earlier, to his discredit, -by the Prime with the Senate election campaign earlier this year. The statements were to the effect that this Government had provided free immunization, and was responsible for the campaign to eradicate tuberculosis. There is no truth in those statements. The truth in the first matter is that immunizing agents against diphtheria and whooping cough were provided free to State and municipal authorities in 1947, which was at least two years before this Government assumed office. The Minister for Health has become so irresponsible that he sometimes does not know whether or not he is telling the truth. As a matter of fact the plan to eradicate tuberculosis was formed by the last Labour Government in 194S, and was put into effect along with a scheme of allowances to tubercular sufferers and their dependants in 1948, eighteen months before this Government assumed office. The_ Minister for Health has claimed credit for increasing tuberculosis allowances in 1950. Let us examine the facts of that matter. TJnder the last Labour Government, the experimental",43,Earle Page
131,Minister ( Mr Menzies),"in connexionstage having heen passed, a scheme of greatly increased tuberculosis allowances, signed by the previous Minister for Health, was awaiting the Minister in his office on the day that he took over.

All that the Minisshallying and evasiveness of the Minister ter had to do was to put the Labour in the promulgation of his various health Government's scheme into operation, but schemes. It is almost impossible to find it took him six months to do so. This out the nature, of his schemes, the Gomeasure has been divided into various vernment's powers under them, and the sections, and I now propose to deal with benefits that they may confer on the the pensioner medical service.

139,Mr Allan Fraser,"Apparentl ytlie Minister has written two remarkable limitations into the measure about the prescribing of free medicine. The first is in clause 84, and it ties a doctor down as to the amount or quantity of a drug chat he may prescribe, and clause 85 gives the Minister power to limit a doctor as to the disease or purpose for which the doctor may prescribe that drug. In accepting those two limitations on. the freedom to prescribe, the medical profession has given way on a matter about which it formerly refused any compromise whatsoever, because it said that this was a matter of the highest principle. Why has the medical profession now given way? Simply because it has accepted the position that restrictions on thc prescription of certain drugs are urgently needed, because experience has shown great abuse, waste, and extravagance, as well as possible damage to the natural flora of the human body through reckless over-prescription of these drugs. Any one who has any doubt about that statement should refer to the article in the Medical Journal of Australia of the 28th June, 1952, headed ""Anti-Biotics Amok "". I now propose to contrast the hospital benefits scheme which operated during the regime of the Ohifley Government with the scheme that the Minister now intends to implement. TJnder the Chifley scheme of hospital benefits, the basic prinapparently with the approval of honorciple was that those who were unfortunate enough to be sick should be as far as possible relieved of the financial burden associated with their illnesses. The scheme was implemented by the Oommonwealth paying to the State governments an amount suflicient to reimburse them for the total collections that they had previously made by way of fees from patients in public wards and from other sources. Commonwealth payments were macle originally at the rate of 6s. a day for each patient and were increased to Ss. a day by the Chifley Government in view of the increase im hospital expenses. At the same time, the Chifley Labour Government agreed to reimburse the States for salaries paid to medical and other professional personnel who attended patients in public wards. A patient could then enter a public ward of a public hospital and, whether he was the richest man in the community or the poorest, the only consideration was whether his health required the occupancy of a bed.. If so, he was admitted without any degrading or humiliating means test. If he was a wealthy man he had paid in taxation, according to his means, proportionately more than the poorer man. Each, according to his means, had paid for this right which was given to them by the Chifley Government. Mr CsAiLEK.:-But the scheme did not work. and no charge was made during that time in public hospitals for accommodation, treatment, or medicine. The scheme worked splendidly. If tlie patient was entitled to a friendly society or insurance benefit he retained that benefit for his own use. Most patients badly need a little extra cash when they are confined to hospital. That scheme has been completely swept aside by the present Government, which has made it a condition of any payment to a hospital that the States should accept an agreement with the Commonwealth involving the raising of charges against patients in hospital. The Minister for Health insisted that the States make a charge against every patient before he would even agree to continue the payment that had been made by the Labour Government. By his action, and able members opposite, he destroyed a scheme which gave free hospital attention without a means test to the people of Australia and established a scheme under which payment for hospital attention was compulsory. Under the Page scheme, a payment of Ss. a day for each patient in a public bed is made by the Oommonwealth only if the State has accepted the Commonwealth agreement and made a charge against the patient. An additional benefit of 4s. a day is paid by the Commonwealth only if the patient is insured. In view of changes in the value of money alone, if the Government wished to continue the benefits that were granted by the Labour Government, it would now be paying at least 16«. a day in respect of every occupied bed in the public ward of every public hospital. However, the Government has continued to pay only 8s. a day.",45,Earle Page
140,Mr Allan Feasee,"It did work,making the payment of an additional 4s. a day dependent on the patient having made some provision for himself. This is the most extraordinary means test that has been established by any government. The Government, in effect, has told the applicant for hospital attention that if he has succeeded in making some provision for himself it will make this payment to him. If he has not succeeded in making some provision for himself it will not assist him. That is a complete reversal of the social services means test, under which the Government tells a man, in effect, that if he has succeeded in making some provision for himself it will not assist him. socialism. is socialism or not Labour's scheme represents social justice. The scheme that was introduced by the Labour Government was approved and endorsed by the people of Australia and they will welcome it back when a succeeding Labour government re-establishes it. The Labour Government, when it is elected, will re-establish the hospital sclieme as has been announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I now move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill:Tbat all words after "" T h a t "" be. left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the ibill be withdrawn and redrafted to plaee greater emphasis through co-operation with the States and local authorities on tlie promotion of positive health(a) in the establishment and maintenance of diagnostic ancl health centres; (6) in dental care of children under sixteen years of age; (c) in the provision of medical training and research facilities and a system of regional hospitals: and to provide(1) for substantially increased rates of hospital benefit having regard to the rise of hospital costs; (2) for the negotiation of fresh agreements between the Commonwealth and the States to ensure that throughout Australia there should be no charge and no means test for qualified patients occupying beds in publio wards of publie hospitals; (3) that payment of Commonwealth hospital benefits or medical benefits the citizen who is already suffering from shall not be conditional upon a patient being a contributor to a hospitals fund or a medical benefits fund; (4) that registered organizations shall be subsidized to ensure that tlieir Ibenefits w ill be extended to chronic sufferers and those suffering disabilities at the commencement of their membership or registered organizations; (5) to devise in consultation wit h the medical profession and State Governments machinery to stabilize medical charges and to determine just variations of those charges; (0) tliat medical benefits be extended to mileage charges of medical practitioners incurred by patients especially those in outback areas; (T) that the provision of medical and hosj.ital benefits should be financed from revenue raised on a graduated scale based upon capacity to pay; (8) for the cure and relief of mental illness."" The provisions for medical benefits in the bill are the most lopsided and clumsy in the whole measure. They fail to cover the whole community. In fact, they leave literally millions of people without cover. On the basis of the Minister's own figures, 5,000,000 people are now covered in one form or another by the Commouwealth health scheme. No doubt the Minister picked that figure out of the air because I have seen no documentary confirmation of it. Tlie population of Australia is well over S,000,000 so that the Government has failed to cover the whole community. Its scheme is complicated in a most extraordinary way. It has been utterly unjust in its allocation of financial cost and it has actually excluded many old and chronic sufferers who are the people most in need of medical attention. With the idea of Commonwealth medical benefits, the Labour party entirely agrees. But it is fantastically wrong that a citizen who has paid his taxes should be deprived of a Commonwealth medical benefit wliieh is paid for out of revenue merely because he has not contributed to some private fund or friendly society. It is equally absurd that the Minister should complacently produce a so-called medical scheme which excludes the very people who most need medical attention in this community. Who needs medical attention more than some illness or disability? Yet, under the",46,Earle Page

142,"Mr Alla N Fraser,","Whethe r itprovisions of this fantastic bill, he is excluded from it if he happens to be suffering from an illness or disability at the time that he applies for membership of a society. ""Who needs medical attention more than the unfortunate sufferer from a chronic condition? He is the man upon whom, the cost of medical services presses most heavily. Yet he also is excluded from full benefits under this scheme. Who needs medical service more than the aged man or woman who has reached that stage of life when medical attention is more frequently necessary? Unless that person can qualify as a pensioner under the social services means test, he also is debarred from full benefit under this scheme. is extraordinarily defective in that there is no safeguard to prevent doctors from increasing their fees. There is no safeguard to prevent doctors from increasing their fees to the extent of the benefits prothe benefits provided by the scheme gb vided and thereby depriving the patient of any benefit at all. The Minister for Health made that very plain in his speech at The Hague when he addressed fellow doctors and took credit for the fact that members of the medical profession were to be allowed to charge what they liked. That matter is covered by my amendment. If the Minister is anxious to do justice to the people of Australia rather than to enrich fellow members of the medical profession, he will accept that amendment. When the Minister fixed the amount for each benefit under this scheme, surely he had in mind what would be a reasonable fee for the service that would be provided. a complete answer to that, too. says that he had in mind what would be a reasonable fee and that he fixed the benefit on what he thought would be a reasonable fee. I hope I am not misinterpreting him did not just imagine the figures or set them down at random. Doubtless they were more than carefully worked out. Doubtless he had professional advice as to what would be a reasonable fee for each service covered by this scheme and, therefore, what would be a reasonable benefit for the Commonwealth to pay. If those amounts are reasonable, why does the scheme not provide for some safeguard to prevent a few unscrupulous members of the medical profession from so increasing their fees that they would take the whole of this benefit for themselves and leave the patient without any benefit whatever? There should be an advisory committee on medical charges. It, should include representatives of the doctors, but they should not he allowed to dominate the committee as they seemingly dominate every committee that the Minister has established. There should also be on that committee a member of the legal profession, perhaps the Commonwealth Statistician and a representative of the friendly societies. There should be consultation for the purpose of ensuring that to the patients and that they are not quickly dissipated by increased charges made by members of the medical profession. Clause 26 of the bill provides that payment of the Commonwealth medical benefit shall not be made unless full information is supplied to the Director General of Health. Both the department and the benefit society need to have particulars of the service rendered by the doctor before they can pay the benefit. It is perfectly clear that only a doctor can supply that information and that the doctor, because of his relationship with the patient, woulcl provide that information only to the patient. But there is no provision in the bill that could compel the doctor to provide that information. This bill should contain a clause that would require a doctor, at the patient's request, to supply to the patient particulars of the service that he has rendered. The omission is notable, because it is typical of the manner in which this bill has been framed in order to avoid the slightest obligation being placed upon members of the medical profession. The Minister has been very tender towards his fellow members of the profession in every provision in this bill. The doctors have",47,Earle Page

148,Mr Allan Fraser,"The Ministerbeeii protected at every stage. I am sorry to say that to the extent to which they have been protected the public has been allowed to suffer. The only clause in the bill that could possibly touch a doctor is clause 30, but that clause provides for action against him only in the case of a crime such as fraud or conspiracy. Another notable omission from the provision for medical benefits is the provision bers to compare this complicated, discrifor a mileage charge. ""Why did the Minister for Health, who at one time was Leader of the Australian Country party and is certainly a veteran member of that party, and other members of that party who are supposed to look after the interests of the country people fail to ensure that this bill contained any provision for a mileage allowance? Apparently the Minister did not overlook it, because the pharmaceutical benefits part of the bill, in clause 99, which is copied from a provision made by a. Labour government, provides that extra fees shall be paid where the service has to be provided at some distance. Furthermore, the pensioner medical service part provides that, where a doctor has to travel a mile or two in some small locality, he may charge for miloage. I cannot understand why the Minister failed to include it in the general medical benefits section of the bill. I hope that he will accept at least that portion of the proposed amendment. The matter is of vital importance to people living in the country to whom very often the mileage charge is the greater portion of the cost involved in bringing a doctor to the home. Surely members of the Australian Country party will take steps to ensure that that fair and just provision will be placed in the general medical benefits part of the bill. It is a reproach to the Australian Country party and to the Minister for Health that they should have to be asked by members on this side of the House to ensure that at least that much .justice is :!:ne to country dwellers. This medical benefits scheme amounts their payments to contributors should be to a fiat rate contributory scheme, expressly stipulated in the bill. Surely operated in a most discriminatory way, that is an elementary safeguard which which deprives citizens of their rights as is necessary for the protection of taxpayers unless they join a private those who are compelled to join and pay society. In practice it compels the paytheir fees to these societies in order to ment of additional taxation to obtain a obtain their rights as taxpayers. Although benefit for which payment has already people are compelled to join and pay fees, been made in full. Who will say that the there is no statutory provision which KTr. Allan Fraser. people of Australia, through taxation, have not already paid in full for the health servioe for which they will now be required to pay again in contributions to private societies and funds? No member on this side of the House will say that, because there is a credit of £186,000,000 of the people's contributions in thc National Welfare Fund. I invite honourable memminatory and unjust scheme, which deprives so many people of benefits and which gives other people benefits only at the cost of paying twice, with the simplicity and effectiveness of a. scheme under which doctors could charge fees at an approved scale, obtain portion of the fee from the patient and send to the Commonwealth each month an account for the balance of the fee. Under such a system the Australian Government would need to deal with only 6,000 or 7,000 accounts each month from the 6,000 or 7,000 members of the medical profession instead of having to deal with millions of accounts during the year. I recognize the difficulty of getting members of the British Medical Association to deal directly with the Government. I recognize that much thought and much education would be needed to democratise the medical profession in this country. That simple and effective scheme would preserve all aspects of the doctor-patient relationship about which the Minister speaks so keenly. The Labour party is opposed to the idea that citizens should be compelled to contribute to a private fund, but, if that provision remains in the bill, at least there should be adequate control over the administration of those organizations. The bill, does not provide for such control. Two reforms are necessary. They are conspicuous by their absence from this measure. The first is that the ratio of management expenses of societies in relation to their income and in relation to limits the amount which these societies may spend on salaries and expenses of various kinds. Clause 72 of the bill certainly provides that these matters shall be examined by a committee of three officials, but, again, there is no stipulation anywhere in the clause, or elsewhere in the bill, that the expense ratio of these societies or private funds shall be limited in any way whatever. Because this is very important, I wish to cite certain figures contained in the seventh annual report of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, a fund which will he very familiar to honourable members because it is known to be controlled by members of the medical profession. No fewer than eighteen of the 22 members of its council are members of the British Medical Association. that? the honourable member what is wrong with it. I have here the income and expenditure account of this fund. Last .year, by means of contributions, it received £401,693. pared with what it is receiving now! able member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) apparently believes that it is receiving very much more now. In the year which ended on the 30th June last, the fund received contributions to the value of £401,693, as I have said, and paid out in benefits £166,909. Its expenses were £52,377, or more than 30 per cent, of the payments out, and it transferred to approtreatment of chemists. The medical serpriation account a surplus of income over expenditure of £1S5,000. Therefore, people are being required to pay into this society more than twice as much money a3 the society is prepared to pay out in benefits. The second necessary reform is provision that the directors and controllers of these funds and societies shall be elected by the members, those who pay the contributions, and not by people who have other interests in their management. There is very good reason for concern at the activities of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, which, as I have pointed out, is almost completely doctor-owned and operated. doctors? nothing wrong with doctors, of course. Indeed, I have the greatest admiration for the medical profession. Nevertheless, I maintain that a scheme which is run in the interests of patients and contributors should be managed by the contributors. It should not be managed by doctors who receive payments from the fund. Many people consider that this society is receiving preferential treatment from the Qovernment and that it will in time weaken and destroy the valuable friendly societies. If unchecked, this society could become a most powerful pressure agency, not for the benefit of its members and contributors but for that of the medical profession in future negotiations with the Government. Clause 81 of the bill differs very much from the provisions of the bill introduced in March. This clause specifies the penalties for offences against the medical benefits regulations. The interesting point is that the provision of penalties is made necessary because of go-getting, profit-making organizations whose activities should have been prohibited long ago by the regulations under which this scheme has so far been conducted. I wish now to make a passing reference to the committees of inquiry which are to be established under this bill and, again, to show the contrast between the treatment of the medical profession and the vices committees which are to be set up as committees of inquiry are to be dominated entirely by members of the British Medical Association. In this connection I refer the House to clauses 107 and 109 of the bill. On the other hand, the similar committees which are to deal with the pharmaceutical services will have no representatives at all of the Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia. In this connection, I refer to clauses 112 and 114 of the bill. [Extension of time firavledJ] I direct the attention of the Minister to clause 133 and ask him how a",48,Earle Page

154,Mr Allan Fraser,"There ischemist, under that clause, may know that a doctor has been suspended from writing prescriptions. Why is not that fact to be gazetted ? The clause provides that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, notify the suspension in the Gazette. Why is the Minister so tender where his fellow-medical practitioners are concerned ? If a medical practitioner commits an offence and is suspended from writing prescriptions, surely the chemists should have a way of knowing that that is so. The way in which such information should he made known is by publication in the Government's official journal, the Gazette. The major criticism of the health activities of this Government concerns its failure to initiate measures which are designed to promote positive health in the community. this bill are designed merely to alleviate illness and the cost of illness. The bill is entirely lacking in provisions for the promotion of the positive health of the community. That is why the amendment which I propose to move on behalf of the Opposition stresses particularly the need for such measures. Apart from the free provision of milk for school children under the age of thirteen years, this Government has made no provision for the positive health of the community. The Minister for Health, for example, has taken no step whatever to care for the teeth of children so that they may escape dental decay, with all its attendant ills, and carry their natural teeth throughout their lives. It is a great reproach to the Minister that in four years he has failed to do anything whatever to protect and preserve the teeth of Australian children. The Australian Dental Association itself prepared a plan which was designed to provide stich treatment free for all children under sixteen years of stressed these matters in the amendment age. That plan is there, and although it has been available to the Government to see and read, the Minister has done nothing about it. The members of the Australian Dental Association co-operated magnificently with the previous Labour Government. Indeed, they co-operated to such a degree that when Labour left office there were very few outstanding matters which might have prevented early initiaMr Allan Fraser. tion of a dental scheme. This Government has lost four valuable years. Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong when I say that during the whole of those four years he has not even met the representatives of the Australian Dental Association to discuss national dental health. The Australian Labour party believes that the Government would have made a great contribution to positive health had it encouraged the establishment and maintenance of diagnostic and health centres. It should have built throughout Australia experimental health centres where doctors, working in private practice, could come together to provide all diagnostic facilities, including radiology, and where, in the interests of the community and themselves, they could rationalize their activities and roster week-end work. All the provisions of Oentres of this nature would encourage people to seek early diagnosis of disease and so prevent much distress and save many lives. The Government should have concerned itself with the construction of regional hospitals, particularly in outback areas, which would operate in close conjunction with the base hospitals which provide all specialist facilities. I recognize that the provision of such hospitals is primarily, as matters stand at present, the responsibility of State governments, but leadership and financial assistance might well have flowed directly from the Commonwealth. The Australian Labour party further believes that the Australian Government should take an active interest in ensuring that complete facilities for medical training and research are provided in Australia. Many of our bright young medicos are obliged to go overseas to gain such experience, and in many instances are permanently lost to Australia. Por these reasons the Labour party has which I submit to the House. seconded ?

157,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"listened to a long speech on it hy the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr burden which the ordinary individual Allan Fraser). I do not intend to spend much time in discussing what he has said. I shall merely direct attention to one or two features of his speech. First, uhe honourable member made no substantial attack on the bill at any point. Everything he has said was a matter of detail. Labour would reverse the health policy outlined in the bill if it ever came to office. which this bill is chiefly concerned and I hope that all the friendly and benefit societies, and the people throughout Australia who have invested their money in them, will remember his words. Thirdly, the honourable member spent most of his time in attacking personally the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page). If any one thinks that the dignity of debate or the effectiveness of health legislation can he supported on such a basis I can only say that I do not agree, and while I am not a prophet, I venture to say that this House and this country will remember the right honourable member for Cowper, the Minister for Health, long after the name of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has boon completely forgotten. I remind the House that the Labour party on. one occasion offered to Australia a national health scheme ancl on that occasion it was thrown out of office. T pass from the attack, if it can be so called, that was made on the bill by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. and I hope to devote the rest of my speech to saying something constructive about the measure. I commenced my speech by describing it as a social services measure. It is significant that this great social services measure should have .been presented to the Parliament by the Liberal and Country party Government. Even those who have only a most superficial knowledge of the history of our country know that in securing most of the great social advantages that we now enjoy those two political parties have taken the leading part. We are discussing the health of the nation and in this connection every modern State is faced with the problem that the increasing complexity of modern medicine, modern methods of diagnosis and treatment, pathological investigations and X-ray examinations have imposed a finds to be almost beyond his financial capacity to bear. This problem exists in every modern State. I want, first, to make a distinction between public health medicine-preventiv e medicine which is concerned with such things as water supplies, conservancy and the like, or what Secondly, he declared that I might describe as the impersonal side of medicine-and curative medicine with which is a personal problem. This latter is, in fact, a matter of personal relationship-the everyday health, life and well-being of the individual. The problem that this country is facing, in common with every other modern State, is to bring medical care within the reach of all, without sacrificing this personal relationship of doctor and patient. It is not just a matter of technical excellence at all. In the solution of this problem every country is faced with three choices. The first is that the State should do nothingthat everything should be left to the individual. The second is that the State should do everything-that it should assume all responsibility and provide full medical care. In passing, I direct the attention of the House to the fact that that choice has been well stressed by the honourable meinber for Eden-Monaro and that it is Labour's solution of the problem. This third solution is the formation of a partnership with freedom for the individual patient and for the doctor ancl assistance from the State. The first alternative can, I believe, be rejected out of hand. For the reasons I have outlined, it is no longer feasible in a modern society. I want to say something about the second alternative because it implies that the State not only provides medical services but also exercises control. It implies the loss of independence of the individual nnd of the doctor, a diminution of th'i personal relationship upon which the sound practice of medicine depends aud degradation of the atmosphere and traditions of a great profession. It rests upon the idea, which nowadays is so often expressed or'hinted at, that responsibility can be handed over to that vague and amorphous entity known as the State. There is a great clamour for rights in tlnjou days and an almost complete silence about duties. If duties are irksome we are inclined to believe that they should be handed over to the State; we tend to forget that they are primarily the inescapable obligation of the individual. It is so easy to be overcome by the power of words. It is so easy to utter. glib phrases, such as we have heard to-night, about the welfare State. They sound so attractive. Let us have welfare by all means, .but do not let ns imagine that we can have it without paying for it. Do not let us imagine that we can hand over the responsibility of the individual to the welfare State and retain for him his rights, which very often mean the privileges he desires. This bill is not based upon that philosophy; it is based upon the idea that the individual has responsibilities. I am sure that we all would be willing to agree that it is the responsibility of the individual to see that he does not become a drunkard, or a drug addict, or slovenly, or slip-shod, or lazy. Just as we all agree that these are individual responsibilities, so, I believe we should all agree that the individual has some responsibility in the matter of his own health. I want to say at this juncture only one more thing about this socialist theory. I shall say more about it later because it is inevitably bound up with whatever differences the opposing parties in this House may have in relation to this bill. The socialist theory that the State should provide everything free, which means, in other words, that the taxpayer should provide it, was offered to the people four years ago and was soundly rejected by them. If the Lahour party wants to go back to that state of affairs, let me remind it that the people have already thrown it out of office because of its advocacy of that policy. The real solution of this problem rests upon the third alternative, a partnership, upon freedom for the individual and freedom for the doctor, and upon assistance from the State. it must be based on the general practitioner and the family doctor and not on the clinic or the hospital, nor on the doctor as the salaried servant of the State, but on the. general practitioner of high standard, who is free to maintain the Dr. Donald Cameron. intimate personal relations with the people whom he treats. I wish to Jay some stress on the clinic and the hospital, because if we examine every system of State medicine in the world, we shall find that these things are taken as its basis, and the same pattern is apparent in the amendment which has been submitted to-night. In fact,, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has stressed that there should be diagnostic and health centres and clinics, in which medical care could be given. I wish to make the point plain, if I can, that the State can provide technical excellence, but only the general practitioner can provide real, fundamental medical care. I now desire to speak of the part which the general practitioner plays, and then show how ""this bill ensures that he will be able to play it. The part that the general practitioner plays is easily appreciated if we consider for a few moments the causes of death that appear in any list of statistics such as cancer, cardiac diseases, tuberculosis, and so on. It is perfectly easy for us to jump to the conclusion that alt those diseases could be cured if we had sufficiently skilled specialists and sufficiently well-equipped laboratories. Nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, we must have specialists, laboratories, X-ray, pathology and the like, but what about the part that the general practitioner plays? What about the longillnesses that lead to those causes of death? Who is to manage that aspect? Wliat about the family of the invalid ? Who is to look after them, if we base medicine on the clinic and the specialist? Who is to deal with the innumerable problems which are comprised in all those matters? What about all the people who suffer for years with chronic diseases-the chronic asthmatics, the people with rheumatoid arthritis, the people with pernicious anaemia, and the people with diabetes? Who looks after them ? It is not the specialist. Occasionally, such patients Furthermore, go to a specialist, and occasionally their own medical officer receives advice from a specialist, but the man who really looks after them is the doctor who goes into their homes. This bill makes it possible for them to have the man of their choice in their homes. What about all the acute and mild diseases from which the generality of people suffer ? Those diseases are not first diagnosed in clinics. They are diagnosed in the family practitioner's surgery, or in. the patient's home. This bill makes it possible for that system to continue. In addition, the hill makes it possible for the patient to have the doctor he wants, not a doctor sitting in a clinic, and on duty by the day. What ahout the early recognition of disease,, particularly serious disease? That is not done in clinics. It is done by the doctor who goes to the patient's home. It is to be done, under this bill, by the medical practitioner whom the patient wants in hi3 home. No system of State medicine, no doctor on a panel, no salaried doctor, no socialist system of medicine can ensure all these things, which are the very basis of good medical practice. The great virtue of this bill is that it ensures that the people of Australia will liave these services. The patient has, in the first place, some responsibility. He has, i i i the second place, freedom of choice of a doctor. He may choose the doctor he wants, and dispense with the doctor of his choice and have another doctor. In other words, under this bill, tlie patient has, if you like, the right to hire and fire, and he should have it. The doctor, under this bill, has a responsibility, first to his patient and to his conscience, and not first to the State serviee of which he is a part. Every doctor should have that responsibility, but no doctor under a State system of a salaried medical service can have it. It is important that we should appreciate those matters, because they are the very foundations of this bill. Under a State salaried service and under the service offered by the Labour party and rejected by the people, clinics would be established in which there would be specialists who, perhaps, would know more about the technical side of medicine than the family doctor. A patient could go to the clinic, and he would be seen by the doctor who was on duty for the day. A nurse would take the patient's card from the filing cabinet, and hand it to the doctor, and he would read on it, not the notes he had made over the years, but the notes that had been made by sowoL/udy else. Clinics treat cases. General practitioners treat human beings. That is the essential virtue of this bill, and it is embodied in this partnership, about, which I have spoken. I wish to quote to the House some words that were spoken not long ago by one of the greatest practitioners of modern medicine, Lord Horder. He has pointed out that there is no apotheosis of medical care, but there is a synthesis. In other words, if we are to have really good medicine, and a worthwhile medical system, we should start to build it from the foundation stones, as the Minister is doing with this bill. We should not start to build from the top-fro m the clinic and the # specialist, as the Labour party proposes, and work downwards. The general principles of this bill are well understood, but I should like to recall its main aspects to the House so as to bring the legislation into proper focus and attention. For our present purposes, we can say, 'briefly, that this bill is divided into five sections. The first section provides for medical services, and most of my remarks this evening have been devoted to an explanation of how it does so. The patient insures himself, voluntarily, with a society, and the Commonwealth pays a subvention to it. That arrangement makes it possible for the patient to secure the medical services that are provided. The second section is concerned with hospital services, and it is founded on the same principle. We on this side of the House believe, not only that individuals have some responsibility to provide for their medical services, but also that persons who enter hospitals should pay for their treatment if they cau afford to do so. Why not? I challenge the Opposition on this matter. Why should hospital treatment be completely free? Why should a hospital provide treatment free for many people who can well afford to pay? Members of the Labour party say that people pay for hospital treatment when they pay the social services contribution. In my opinion, such a statement is the veriest nonsense. Everything is paid for on that kind of basis. What of the unUJVIployment benefit, pensions, and other social services? They are financed by the social services contribution, which, very properly, has been amalgamated vvith the income tax. The idea that a sum of £186,000,000, or whatever it amounts to, lies dormant and is stockpiled in the National Welfare Fund, is complete rubbish. Material things can be stockpiled, but money cannot-certainl y not by governments. Therefore, we say that this scheme has a realistic basis. It has certainly rescued the hospital system of Australia from insolvency into which the vaunted scheme of the Labour party had plunged it . The third section of the bill deals with pensioners. It provides that those persons who can ho longer afford to pay the contributions which other members of society can pay, shall have their contributions, in effect, paid for them by the rest of the community. In other words, the community has assumed the obligation to provide medical care for pensioners. However, the most important thing about this section is not that the pensioner does not have to pay for medical services, important though this is, but that under this excellent bill, he can still retain his family doctor-the doctor of his choice. He will not have to attend the outpatients' department of a hospital, and be seen by the doctor on duty for that day. He can still be seen in his own home by his own doctor. That is the great virtue of this provision. The fourth section of the bill deals with pharmaceutical benefits, and it realizes that modern benefits are an entirely different conception from that of a few years ago. The Labour party has not come to a similar realization. The drugs used by the medical profession now are different, more potent, more effective and far more expensive than such items were a few years ago. As the scheme set out in this bill is already in operation, it can be said that the community has already accepted the obligation of providing medical benefits in the interests of its own health. I do not use the term "" free "" hecaijse it is nonsense to talk about free services, but the nation has accepted the Dr. Donald Cameron. obligation of spreading the cost of these services over the whole community. These immaterial things are not like direct medical services that are provided by the doctor. In the case of medical services, it is essential that the patient should have freedom of choice, but with immaterial things such as drugs that does not matter so much. The fifth section is concerned with preventive medicine, public health, free milk for children and tuberculosis benefits. The bill is based upon a new conception which is realistic and sensible. That conception has already been accepted hy the Australian people because the scheme, in effect, has been working for the past two years. I have now said practically all I want to say about the bill itself, but if I may presume to do so, I should like to address a few words of warning regarding it to my own profession. I believe that this measure is a shield against the greatest disaster that could befall the medical profession and the country, which is that the dead and stultifying hand of socialism should be laid upon a great profession. I believe that the medical profession is giving a most efficient service and this bill is a shield against its socialization, but it is not the final defence. The final defence lies in the maintenance of the traditions and the standing of the profession itself in association with the working of this scheme. TJnder this proposal, there is no place for greed or selfishness or the setting up of financial rewards as the ultimate goal. There is no place for a doctor who is bound rigidly pharmaceutical by hours and considerations of salary in making his services available freely to those who want them, but there is scope for charity and helpfulness and the personal human contact that is destroyed by every otlier scheme of State medicine. There is scope and there is necessity for a high standard of personal and professional conduct at all times. One final word. This bill is the product of immense thought and consultation and, I believe, inspiration. While it is a human instrument and will therefore probably need from time to time some alteration or amendment, in the light of experience, I believe that those alterations will be in matters of detail and not of substance. 1 believe thnt the scheme is based upon such -sound principles as will provide a solid .and enduring foundation for the practice -of medicine in the future and will help to retain all that has been best in Australian medicine in tbe past. I believe that it will confer a great benent upon Australia, and thc nation might well be thankful to thc Minister for Health who introduced it. I think it is probable that of all his achievements, and of his services Health, who notoriously reflects the views to this country over many years, it may well prove that none has been greater than this. able members have heard the doctor's point of view upon this measure, and 1 rnay be permitted now to give the point -of view of the patient. To understand the purpose of this measure, it is necessary to trace its history. During World War II . , the Labour governments led by Mr tion for the support of that body for -Curtin and Mr Chifley promised social justice to all sections of the community as a reward for contributions made by -every one to bring about victory. Further, the leaders of the Labour governments promised that if the Australian Labour party was still in'office after the war it would ensure that its programme would he translated to thc statute-book and the people would not be sold out as they were after World WarI . That promise was kept. Among the social services that were implemented by the Labour .Government was the national health scheme of the Chifley Government, pharmaceutical benefits, free hospitalization, assistance to tuberculosis sufferers, sickness benefits obtain endorsement of his plan by that and other social services designed to relieve suffering and disease in the community. At the same time, sufferers were relieved from any financial burden resultother country. It was purely a private ing from their illnesses without a means test. That scheme did not meet with the full support and co-operation of the British Medical Association although it is to the credit of a number of medical men that they did co-operate in implementing the scheme including the pharmaceutical and medical benefits enactments which were the main one of con1tention with the British Medical Association. That association used its organized strength to the point of intimidation of individual practitioners and imposed a levy to produce a fighting fund to bring about the downfall of the Chifley Government ahd the election of this Government. Following the advent of this Government the new Minister for Health, Sir Earle Page, who notoriously aible member may not use the name of an honourable member in his speech. of the British Medical Association, took steps to undo the whole scheme and in May of the following year, he presented to the British Medical Association Congress in Brisbane the prospectus for a plan which -he now describes as his own. In fact, it is a British Medical Association plan which tlie Minister, acting on behalf of the Government, agreed to implement as part of a secret bargain made with the British Medical Associathe Liberal and Australian Country parties in the 1946 and 1949 general elections. I make that statement unequivocably as there is conclusive evidence of that arrangement whicli I shall disclose in more detail later. Having received the imprimatur of that body, the Minister took steps to introduce the scheme in various stages by legislation or regulations, which the Government now proposes to incorporate in this measure. Before doing that, however, the Minister took the trouble to attend the World Medical Congress at The Hague at the expense of the Australian Government so that he could gathering. The congress did not represent the people of Australia in any way, nor did it represent the people of any gathering of medical men. When the scheme is fully analysed it is not to be wondered that a representative of that congress ironically commented, according to a report in the New York Times, that the Minister's scheme was "" just what the doctors ordered"". It is a purely negative approach to the question of national health, establishing as it does, a huge super-structure dependent uoon and even encouraging more sickness and disease. It contributes nothing to the positive health of the community.",51,Earle Page

160,Mr Morgan,"The Minister forAnalysing the various aspects of the scheme, it is easy to observe just how and why it differs from that of the Labour Government. pharmaceutical benefits and hospitalization were available under the Labour Governuent to every one irrespective of any means test. TJnder thisscheme, the means test has been re-imposed although it has been done in a backhanded fashion by making availahle certain limited benefits provided recipients become members of certain insurance organizations which are now springing up like mushrooms and by bringing pressure on the State governments to recognize those bodies and re-impose the means test. One of the main grounds of attack by the Minister on the previous scheme was that it was too costly, but it is interesting to note, in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits or free medicine scheme of the Chifley Government, that in the period of 27 months for which it operated, the total cost was only £294,446 dangers charted. It is worthy of memfor the provision of 903,227 prescriptions for an average of 6s. for each prescription. In its first year, the present Government's scheme has cost £7,297,281 for approximately 7,000,000 prescriptions, or an average of over £1 for each prescription. That is more than three times the average cost of prescriptions under the Labour Government's scheme. This was above the Minister's own estimate of £2,500,000 per annum, the reason being that he had overlooked psychological factors in his scheme which provides only for the prescription of so-called life-saving or wonder drugs. If the patient so desires and the doctor is willing to prescribe free drugs, this can be done only with respect to costly lifesaving drugs, whereas under the previous scheme the doctor could prescribe from a very wide range of drugs or medicines included in the British Pharmacopoeia. It is now evident that many of these were not only much less costly but also just as efficacious as the so-called wonder drugs. In fact, many medical men are becoming alarmed at the dangerous reactions, and harmful, even fatal, results from continued use of these wonder drugs -merr y for those who profit therefromTn this connection, Dr. Perry, Professor Mr Morgan. of Medicine at Bristol University, writing: in the Cyprus Medical Journal, recently challenged the poAvers of cortisone and Medical and ACTH, the advent of which the Minister announced in this House less than two years ago and from which he prophesied miraculous results. Dr. Perry saidIt cannot be stressed too strongly that neither drug has yet cured a patient. In fact for the past few years, the medical world has been busy treating all the diseases we do not understand with substances whose action we understand even less. It is perhaps time that wetook stock of the position and attempted to determine what, if any, real place these drugs which undoubtedly produce profound effects, should have in practical therapeutics. Likewise, another leading medical authority, Dr. Ethan Allenbrow, editor of Annals of Allergy, the official publication of the American College of Allergy, said that there had been indications that aureomycin and terramycin had caused ""super infections"" and fatal allergies, and he advocated an improved system of reporting the effects of the drugs so that they could be better evaluated and their tion also that of the 300 antibiotics experimented with, only five have been -found sufficiently less poisonous to be rnken into the human body, and it would now appear that these five also are seriously questioned with respect to both their efficacy and dangerous effects as the body becomes poisoned from over-dosage Despite this, the production of so-called wonder drugs has become .big business. In fact, to use the words of the British Medical Journal, "" It is a case of antibiotics run amok"". New theories are propounded and well advertised by the drug companies, and then discarded by the medical profession as offering nothing better than the old. Wonder drugs follow one another in alarming succession. Pirst, they are acclaimed to be a certain cure for this, that, or the other disease. Next, we hear that they should be used with caution owing to the serious side effects that have been produced in many cases. Then, we learn that these remedies lose potency, and that bacteria become resistant to treatment. After this a new wonder drug is enlisted. So, the merry chase goes on whilst sickness and degeneration progress -steadily in the community. It; is well to remember' that, despite the Minister's claims, only 4 per cent., of people in Australia die from natural causes whilst 9.2 per cent, die from avoidable sickness -and disease,, and 4 per cent, from result -of accidents. Another ground of attack by the Minister on the previous scheme was that it was subject to abuse, and would lead to racketeering; but it is quite clear, even the home of private enterprise even in -at this early stage, and quite apart from the question of the efficacy of wonder drugs, that his own scheme is more open to such abuses than was the previous one. Already, grave warnings have been issued in this respect by the Minister and Commonwealth health authorities. Frauds have been perpetrated by some doctors and chemists through fictitious prescriptions and similar malpractices as a result of which the Minister has been forced to set up disciplinary committees. But -even in that instance he has again bowed to' the dictates of the British Medical Association and constituted these committees from nominees of that body instead of establishing an independent tribunal of a judicial or semi-judicial nature. The financial basis of the scheme, which the Minister has described as encouraging self-help, is the establishment of hospital and medical insurance -organizations along the lines of the American health insurance societies with which he has become greatly enamoured since his visit to the United States of .America where, he ascertained, 86 per cent, of the cost of hospitalization was borne by the only 14 per cent, by the government. Under the Chifley Government's scheme the position was practically the reverse. Eighty per cent, of the cost of hospitalization was provided by governments, Commonwealth and State, and the balance was contributed by the public, -or was obtained from charitable sources. It is readily understandable, therefore, why the Minister has become so -enamoured of the American scheme and, to use his own words, desires to ""marry the American and British schemes"". However, the marriage that he proposes resembles a shot-gun marriage. In favouring the American procedure the Minister has not only been very derogatory andi denunciatory of the previous Australian scheme under Labour which, in the main, followed the New Zealand and British national health schemes, but he has also, been critical of the schemes im operation isn New Zealand and Great Britain. He prefers to look for guidance to the United States of America, which is matters of public health.. The fact remains, however, that despite changes of government in both New. Zealand and Great Britain, the national health schemes in operation in those countries have been maintained by Conservative governments that have succeeded Labour administrations. In fact, the British Medical Association, which previously resisted the inauguration of Labour's scheme, has now swung in favour of it. No doubt, a similar position would have arisen here if Labour's scheme had been put to a fair test. In confirmation of this change of attitude, a recent comprehensive survey that was made by the British Medical Association in Great Britain, in which 30 investigators ascertained from 12,657 members of the British Medical Association in that country their attitude towards the British scheme, showed that it was so popular with the masses of the people that no government, tory or conservative, would dare undo it. That scheme is growing more popular with the medical profession. Over 45 per cent, of the doctors examined by the investigating committee said that their scope had been widened pu'blic, ancl and that the treatment of patients had improved under the scheme. Furthermore, and this is the all-important factor, the report showed that the scheme had enormously lifted the general standard of health of the community, and had done wonders for British children, particularly in respect of dental treatment. In ether words, the report showed that the British national health scheme had been an undoubted success, and that criticism of it was designed primarily to improve it still further, both for the benefit of the people and of the medical profession. Yet, the Minister is so politically blinded and swayed by prejudice against Labour that, instead of following the British way of life in relation to health, under which thc British Government accepts the main financial responsibility, he has subverted health to the American principle of domination by private enterprise and vested interests which profit from sickness and disease. The Minister, in order to obtain g"":dawfi, invited from the United States of America, again, presumably at the Government's expense, a couple of cigarsmoking experts who are associated with American insurance bodies. These gentlemen naturally bestowed their blessing on the Minister's so-called voluntary insurance organizations, although they indicated certain weaknesses in the structure of those bodies. These organizations are now springing up like mushrooms, not as genuine people's organizations, but from inspired sources. Very little information is obtainable about their constitution and nnancial soundness by intending members who, by an indirect form of conscription, must join them in order to qualify for benefits provided under the Government's scheme. The free medical, hospital and pharmacetitical benefits are confined to pensioners who, obviously, are unacceptable financially to such organizations. In the introduction of these American methods, the Minister, in his desire to save the Government from its financial responsibilities, looks at one side of the. picture only and turns a blind eye to the other side, which will bring in its wake, assuredly as night follows day, abuses and malpractices more far-reacbing in their consequences than were those which the Minister feared would arise under the previous scheme. Such abuses are likely to be worse for Australia than if a plague hit this country. For example, in order to obtain medical benefits a person is obliged to belong to one of these insurabuses and malpractices which have ance bodies which, as I have said, are sponsored, and even controlled, by interested parties. I instance the Medical Benefits Fund which has sprung up like a mushroom. I have been shocked and dismayed to learn that this organization is both sponsored and controlled by leading members of the British Medical Association. channeling patients into that organization with the express object of undermining the structure and recognized principles of ghost Mr Morgan. genuine, long-established friendly societies. Worse still, there is evidence of the fact that it is being represented as having tbe imprimatur of the Australian Government and of the fact that the Government itself is conniving at this propaganda with the object of misleading people into believing that it is officially sponsored. That organization is not even registered as a friendly society, but is incorporated as a public company. No fewer than seventeen of its directors are doctors, ancl its rules are designed to prevent contributors, who are most vitally concerned, from having any say in its administration. That is an atrocious and arrogant procedure. If these are intended to be genuine people's organizations why does not the Government itself sponsor them, openly or confine them to existing friendly societies which are subject to proper control and supervision and are democratically governed? It is a well-established principle that no director or officer of such a body shall have a direct or indir.ect pecuniary interest in any business dealings with it because of his fiduciary relationship witli members. Just as is the case with the provision of costly life-saving drugs, there will be a natural psychological tendency on the part of those who will be paying into these newly-founded insurance bodies to want to get some benefit back from their money, even to the point of being easily persuaded to undergo unnecessary operations involving the removal of vital organs of the body. This has been the trend in America, the procedure of which the Minister slavishly adopts, as is borne out by evidence adduced by' more responsible elements of the medical profession there who have become most outspoken and imbued with a desire to clean up the sprung up in recent times at the hands of the more unconscionable elements in their ranks. Dr. Paul R. Hawley, director of the American College of Surgeons, was asked in a very frank interview published in the UnHied States Nevis and World Report and condensed in. the Reader's Doctors and chemists are Digest of June last, ""How extensive is unethical medicine?"" He repliedThere are four major evils; unnecessary operations, fee splitting, overcharging and surgery. It has also been disclosed, in a number schedule, as against 192 under the Chifleyof reports which give details of surveys and observations of prominent physicians and surgeons recently published in leading American medical journals, that there has been wholesale abuse and malpractice in the performance of unnecessary operations, with particular reference to hysterectomy, appendectomy and tonsillectomy. It was shown that hysterectomy, an operation for the removal of vital organs from womenfolk, had been performed unnecessarily in as many as 50 per cent, of the cases involved. Appendectomy, or removal of the appendix, had been unnecessary in up to 70 per cent of the cases examined, and tonsillectomy, or removal of the tonsils, had been unnecessary in 100 per cent, of the cases handled by some surgeons. It was contended that tonsillectomy, children, was wholly unwarranted and most harmful iu the light of a proper understanding and appreciation of the true function of these organs. That is a. clear indication, from unimpeachable sources within the medical profession itself, of the sort of temptation, but the schedule does not specify tions and the anti-social practices that are liable to develop under this scheme with the introduction of overseas methods of finance, unless proper safeguards are provided. And there are no such safeguards in this measure! In Sweden, I understand, an independent opinion must first be obtained before an operation is performed. The establishment of disciplinary or I have previously referred, was asked investigation committees is merely like the question, "" Hasn't medicine been a locking the stable door after the horse sort of secret thing?"" He repliedhas got away and irreparable harm has been done to the patient and the comits That's munity. This not only involves moral mind, the doctor knows best"" still goes, you principles, but also vitally affects the know. For many centuries medicine didn't future welfare of this country, which so know very much, and there was a great fear badly needs more population. Similar ofpatient comments could be made on many other of the people and the sounder scientific basis operations that are provided for under of medicine itself, there is no longer any this measure and for which very liberal reason why a doctor .shouldn't sit down and allowances are to be made, without, inexplain everything to a patient. cidentally, any fixed charge for services, such as applied under the previous dealing with all of the operations in the scheme, which was the main bone of conschedule, especially in the absence of an tention on the part of the medical prointerpreter, but in. the committee stages fusion in ita onposition tr> that scheme. I hope to have an opportunity to say There are, in fact, 701 different operasomething more on that score. It is tions and services provided for in this indeed refreshing, however, to know that McKenna scheme. This is very significant and indicates some outside influence in the considerable enlargement of the schedule of operations. I again suspect the hidden hand of the British Medical Associtaion behind the Minister. l f it is not responsible, let the Minister speak up .and say who is. The previous Minister, Senator McKenna, had the best possible advice and guidance in the preparation of the schedule, and this enlargement of the schedule certainly calls for some explanation. The Minister, as a former surgeon, no doubt still -has an affection for the knife, and he might, therefore, explain the nature of some of these operations to the House, and perhaps provide an interpreter for some of the phraseology. For especially in young instance, item 524 refers to reconstruction of the bile duct, including choledochoduodenostomy, cholecystoduodenostomy. choledochoenterostomy, choledochogastrostomy, cholecystogastrostomy or cholecystenterostomy. The amount of £11 5s. is shown as the Government's contribuwhether that is payable for each of the operations or for all of them. There is another .section in which there are 94' unspecified items of surgical operation. Perhaps the Minister has run out of Latin and Greek phrases and may have to fall baok on Hindustani and Chinese. Speaking of the uifintelligible jargon in which many medical terms are enshrouded, Dr. Paul B. Hawley, to whom right. Medicine hasn't outgrown phase of druidical priesthood yet. "" Never being exposed. Vou didn't daro tell the too much. Now, with better education Limitation of tiuie will prevent me from there are men of Dr. Hawley's type who Lave the courage and puhlic spirit to be outspoken on this subject. The plain faet of the matter is that medical science is still an inexact science and is going through a process of evolution. Some doctors are more enlightened than others. Unfortunately, some are still in the hackwoods. The problem is how to protect the public against the inefficient and antisocial elements while encouraging and assisting the more enlightened in their good intentions. This scheme, as I have said, will not afford that protection. WhilstI consider that local standards of the medical profession have been relatively on a high plane, there are very grave dangers, under this scheme, of an intrusion of the overseas practices to WhichI have referred. The policing of the scheme cannot be left to the profession, for the simple reason, as Dr. Hawley points out, that there is, on the part of doctors, an occupational against each other "". "" That,"" he says "" is thc toughest thing we have to overcome "". I know of that kind of thing from my long experience in the law courts. case at Broken Hill in which a doctor and a chemist were found to have acted in collusion in issuing fictiment, coupled with the establishment of tious prescriptions for large quantities of life-saving drugs, evqry effort was made by other professional men to cover up the matter and quash any prosecution. To the credit of the Department of Health, it resisted these overtures. while unduly high taxation persists, together with the monetary incentive provided with this measure, there will be an all-too-strong temptation to indulge in abuses and malpractices. For example, in order to earn a net income of £4,000 to xo,000, a specialist or surgeon needs to gross £10,000 to £12,000 per annum in hia practice, and it takes a lot of operations and attendances to make up that figure. This provides a glaring example of the futility and dangers inherent in a policy of high taxation. What is more, there is very little encouragement under this scheme foT the physician and the drugless healer, who believe in other therapeutic methods than drugs and surgery. In their ease, only paltry fees are Jfr. Morgan. provided for in the schedule. It would be far better to give generous tax concessions to members of the medical profession, whose work is equally as important as that of primary producers and secondary industries, and to provide for their security generally by way of adequate remuneration, regular hours of work, liberal superannuation or retiring allowances, proper holidays, and time forresearch and post-graduate study to enable them to keep in touch with the latest and best methods of therapy, as well as to educate the people in better ways of living. The Government's incentive basis of remuneration for the medical and pharmaceutical professions, according to the number of operations performed or drugs prescribed, coupled with high taxauon, is a snare and a delusion for them as well as for the community generally. This is the most pernicious measure ever introduced into this House. Nevertheless, I reluctance to testify have as much sympathy for the medical profession as for the public in this situation. The panel system, and the remuneration of doctors on a per capita basis, as in Great Britain and as was the pracIncidentally, in a recent tice under the Australian friendly society system until recently, when the British Medical Association abrogated its agreelocal health centres with all the latest facilities available for treating, as well as educating the people with films, lectures and press propaganda, would encourage preventive measures in relation to health In fact, and physical .fitness and would enable the people to look after themselves. Members of the profession would thereby enjoy better health and greater economic security and have the satisfaction of helping to foster a healthier and happier community. Furthermore, they would be saved much red tape and form-filling, and the intimate doctorpatient relationship could still be maintained, together with freedom of choice of doctor by the patient and the right of private practice ancl specialty work by the doctor if desired. Compensation of existing practitioners for their goodwill and discouragement of trafficking in practices would also provide opportunity for youngeT men without means who are natural healers and have entered tlie profession, not merely for personal gain, but primarily for the love ' of humanity, and who would thus be able to fulfil properly their Hippocratic oath. Under the panel system, as one medical writer has pointed out, doctors would have a vested interest in keeping people well instead of in more sickness and disease as tliey will under this measure, and they would develop a greater social consciousness. The Minister said in Brisbane and ai The Hague that the healing of the sick was personal and individual, and could not be done en masse. I ask, why not. People should be told more of the workings of their own body-the machine they run every day and every minute and second of the day, and in the smooth and efficient running of which they are vitally interested. ""Why should that knowledge be confined to any privileged section of the community? The original derivation of the title "" doctor"" was a teacher, friend, guide, and philosopher to the populace. That is the rolea very honoured role-to which the profession must be restored if we are to have any truly national health scheme. This measure envisages no such plan. Its title '""'National HealthB ill "" is a misnomer. It is a vicious thing that will promote, rather than alleviate, sickness and disease in the community. Countless human souls will be sacrificed to the greedy clutches of the activities of those beyond the pale of mammon. But the medical profession must see the light of day first. To-day, most doctors are groping around in the dark. Similarly, research into other therapeutic measures not recognized, openly at any rate, by members of the profession, would broaden their horizon and help to co-ordinate all the various healing arts for the benefit of humanity as a whole. This measure, however, with its accent on the money making side, will discourage, rather than encourage such a rrend. The whole emphasis of this bill is on the private practice of medicine and the Minister's own pamphlet shows that in this country 11 per cent, of medical men are engaged in private practice, 8 per cent, on medical history, said in a recent in the Public Service, 13 per cent, in public hospitals and only 2 per cent, in teaching and research. That is an undue balance iu favour of private practice. A more correct balance exists in Sweden where 60 per cent, of doctors are in government or community services, aud 40 per cent, in private practice. Sweden has one of the best medical services in the world. Certainly in the realm of research there is tremendous scope for the advancement of medical science which in Australia is still in the backwoods, and is unable to deal effectively with a host of diseases the causes of which are still unknown to orthodox medical science. Yet, there is overwhelming 'evidence of many cases of cures by methods unrecognized by the profession. Often medical castoffs and apparently hopeless and incurable patients are cured by dietitians, naturopaths, homeopaths, osteopaths and other manipulative therapists, metaphysicians, Christian .Scientists, psychologists and so on. All of those people are excluded from the scope of this measure, yet the medical profession, collectively at least, shuts its eyes and wiU not even investigate their work. That is readily understandable when it is appreciated that the Britisli Medical Association, like any other trade union or vocational group, is primarily concerned with the economic interests of its members and must perforce look askance at all outsiders who might encroach on their preserves. Its members must not, therefore, in any way co-operate in, or even tolerate, their ranks. But as with all restrictive trade practices, the interests of the community as a whole should be paramount. An extension of government services, especially in research and teaching personnel, is the answeito this problem. The science of healing, including preventive measures, should be allembracing. Accordingly, its control and development should be in the hands of those who are unfettered by traditional ideas, conservatism or anti-social tendencies. A world-renowned medical man now visiting Australia on a lecture tour, Dr.. Douglas Guthrie, who is lecturer in medical history at the University of Edinburgh and author of many books interview that there existed a power of healing that was different from anything in traditional medical science. He saidI t is something that cannot be explained in terms of medical science, but it must be carefully controlled. This power of healing is something quite independent of recognized techniques and a doctor who possesses it must or not? have a highly developed sense of moral responsibility. Only a good man can be a good doctor-to o often modern doctors lose sight of this. Nobody should enter medicine just to make money. If a man wants to make money he should go into business-no t medicine. Whilst Dr. Guthrie was really commenting on metaphysics, we have, in effect, a very f r a n k admission by a noted medical authority that there is some missing factor in orthodox medical practice.

The reason for that bitterness is, of course, the fact that this bill rubs salt into the wound caused The honourable to the Labour party by its failure in its eight years of office to bring down u national health scheme that woulcl actually work. Now that this Government has succeeded where Labour failed, honourable members opposite are exceedingly bitter.

166,Mr Haworth (Isaacs) . [ 9 . 4 7 ],"Iexisting legislation that is now being consolidated. It is unusual to implement any national scheme by regulations and Executive acts. I confess that, on principle, I do not support such a method, but in this instance it has been partially responsible for the successful launching of a national health service that is entirely new to the Australian way of life. The success of the service has required the co-operation of many professional organizations and voluntary bodies. In some instances, they have given up old-established customs in order to reach agreement on the matters dealt with in this bill. It is not easy for any profession to brush aside established customs in order to co-operate with a government in a part of a government plan. I describe the health scheme of this Government as a compromise between private enterprise and public control. The success of the Page health scheme, if I may so describe it, has demonstrated that, by using the services of the family doctors and the family chemists, and by including the big public hospitals and medical benefits societies, we can bridge the gap between free enterprise and public control without an apparent break in the traditional conduct and customs of the professions concerned. We want to keep it that way. We want our doctors and chemists to get reasonable returns Cor their work in this partnership. We would not get very far if we demanded that neither doctors nor chemists should be permitted to make a profit. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr close study of the health scheme of the Clyde Cameron) indicated last week that it was a sin to make a profit. ciple, it would be exceedingly difficult to make a success of the national health scheme. We say that profit is a legitimate aim for any profession or trade, but that it depends entirely upon public acceptance. The doctors and chemists of this country, who have worked traditionally under a system of free enterprise, know that they can retain their freedom to establish and conduct their practices and businesses only so long as they demonstrate their willingness and capacity to give a better service to the public than could be provided by a government, a salaried doctor or a regimented sick parade, such as would have been in existence if the scheme of the previous Government had been put into operation. That is why the doctors and chemists of Australia are determined that, under this national health service, there shall be no deterioration of the standard of treatment Qr of the medicines dispensed. Both professions have expressed that determination to the Minister. When one compares the health service of this Government with the health scheme of the previous Government, one appreciates the degree of patience, the personal knowledge of the various professions involved, and the creative throught that have been contributed by the Minister and his advisers to the launching of this amended scheme, which honourable members on this side of the House are proud to sponsor. The health service of the previous Government had all the virtues except the vital one. As everbody in the community knows, it would not work. The wisdom of the health policy of this Government stands out in bold relief. We demanded from the very beginning that a health scheme should be neither a regimented scheme nor a socialized scheme, bnt one which harnessed in a proper working partnership the Government's health experts and the medical, pharmaceutical and allied professions, as well as the hospitals, friendly societies and medical benefits societies. Any one who has been sufficiently interested to make a previous Government knows why it was doomed to failure from the beginning. If we adopted that prinBasically, it was designed surreptitiously to nationalize the medical and allied professions. There was no mystery about that, because nationalization of the health services of this country is one of the planks of the platform of the Labour party. black and white in the platform of the Labour party. In the negotiations that took place between the previous Government and the various professions, the Minister for Health at that time did not hesitate to say that he was going to tell those ancient professions how they should",63,Earle Page
167,Mr Cuktin,Who said that?,64,Earle Page
168,Mr Haworth,"It is printed inmanage their own affairs. Naturally, there was an immediate reaction against any co-operation with the Governnient. The ability to conduct a professional practice is the result of a lifetime of study. A professional practice in the health field should not be regarded as a piece of machinery .that can be fitted into a socialistic regime and be expected to work. Any successful national health service depends from its inception upon complete co-operation by the doctors, chemists, dentists and other professional men involved. There must be confidence and trust between the Government and the professions. The fact that in the present health service the Government has the co-operation of the professions concerned shows that there are adequate safeguards of the freedom and status of those professions. As the Minister for Health has said, the bill relates to a series of services, in their proper order and sequence, that are designed to help the people of this country at every stage of their lives. The children benefit from free milk and immunization. prone to tuberculosis, are protected. Everybody is entitled to free life-saving drugs, as well as to medical treatment and hospital benefits. The pensioners are entitled to free medicine and free medical treatment, which they can receive in their own homes. The service has been running for a considerable time and some important results, such as shorter illnesses, less sickness, and shorter stays in hospital-with turnover of hospital beds-have already manifested themselves. This is practical evidence of the efficiency of the scheme. According to a press report to-day, there are now empty beds in tuberculosis sanatoria in Victoria for the first time in the history of that State. This is attributable to the fact that this Government introduced certain services, including the provision of X-ray examinations and the supply of preventive drugs to deal with the scourge of tuberculosis. Earlier this year the Government, by regulation, gave permission for approved societies to accept contributions for medical benefits. By paying a small weekly amount, a person may become eligible for medical benefits If r . Haicorth. and, in addition, a Commonwealth subsidy. The subsidy is contingent on the payment of an equal amount to a patient-member by an approved society. Although this system has great merit, by providing benefits for the people, I warn, the Government that, in giving our blessing to medical organizations, we must guard against providing them, at the taxpayers' expense, with an easy means of enlarging and inflating their financial strength to such a degree that they, not the Parliament, will be able to control the future of the health scheme. We could easily create a Erankenstein monster that could destroy the authority of the Parliament over our health services. The Government should legislate to ensure that, after a ""safe"" period, the reserves that the societies establish from subscribers' contributions shall be handed back to their members by a reduction of contributions. To-day, in every capital city of this country, there' are friendly societies with tremendous resources which collectively aggregate millions of pounds. They have beeu built up by contributions from people who are long since dead. The people, not Young people, who are wealthy organizations, must benefit from this service. I direct the attention of the Government to that aspect of the matter particularly. Medical practitioners, also, have an important responsibility in connection with the scheme, and there is also a responsibility on the chemists. Howeverj as the benefits are initiated by the doctors, the greater responsibility rests on their shoulders. Doctors should avoid over-prescribing for illnesses that can be a greater consequential cured by simple and inexpensive treatment. There is a tendency on the part of some doctorsI am glad to say only very few-to adopt standards of treatment that are not based entirely on the efficacy of the new therapeutic substances, but on financial values. They decide to prescribe a certain drug on the basis of whether it is included in the free list, not from a consideration of whether it will be the most beneficial to the patient. Provision is made in the bill for the establishment of disciplinary committees under the control of medical practitioners and chemists. Such committees will help to prevent abuse and misconduct by members of those professions. I am sure that they will play a worthy and valuable part in maintaining medical and pharmaceutical services at a high level. Let us consider the probable eventual cost of these services to the country. I am not prepared to agree with the figures of probable cost that have been mentioned by tbe Minister from time to time. It is true to say that the governments of other countries have been astonished by the ultithe manner in which this Government mate cost of the provision of medical services. Although the advancement of therapeutic science has been rapid, the provision of the so-called wonder drugs is expensive. A right to be treated with these life-saving drugs should not be denied to any citizen because of their high cost. This Government has recognized that principle by making available life-saving drugs free of cost. Ultimately, however, the cost is debited to the taxpayers, and therefore the expenditure involved in their provision must be controlled in the interests of national solvency. The Leader of .the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has stated that a future Labour governnient will introduce a bigger and better health scheme than the present scheme. The cost of such a scheme would be fantastic. Labour would nationalize the medical and pharmaceutical professions, as has been done in Great Britain. I am sure that the introduction of a scheme such as the Leader of the Opposition envisaged would bring this country closer to insolvency than it has ever been. This Government's health scheme provides for the subsidization of hospital and medical expenses, provided that the people are prepared to help themselves. a scheme might result in an intolerable drain on our national resources. On the other hand, limitation of expenditure could result in progressive inadequacy of treatment. It is clear that the continued provision of a health service depends primarily on national production. It is affected adversely by inflationary tendencies. The people of this country know from their experiences in years preceding 1949 that strikes, go-slow tactics, and shortages accentuate inflation. Unless the forces of inflation are brought under control there will develop not a welfare State but a totalitarian State. We can afford to provide a truly national health service only if a condition of ful l many instances with the methods of impleR -[10 ] production is maintained. This Government has honoured the promise that it made in 1949 to provide life-saving drugs free to the people. Indeed, it has gone much further than that. Within a period of three years it has introduced a complete national health service. I am sure that the people of this country appreciate has honoured its promise in this connection. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) has warned the Government that certain medical insurance funds may be so built up from contributions that they will endanger the future control of the Government's health scheme. I hope that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) will take heed of that warning. I consider that it is time that supporters of the Government discarded the bogy about the provisions of the Constitution in relation to national heath. The powers of the Government in respect of social services are stated in the Constitution as powers in relation toThe provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription) . . . The last Labour Government sought and secured those powers in the 1946 referendum, even though it was opposed by every member of the then Opposition. However, the cost of such It is important that the powers of the Government under the Constitution should be clearly stated, so that the arguments of supporters of this Government may be seen in their true light. If they are so inspected they will fool nobody. The Labour party believes that an emcient service that covers all aspects of the people's health is essential to the welfare of every progressive nation. The principle is that a health service should be complete, and should be available to all citizens, but such a scheme cannot be found in this bill. The Labour party supports the principle of a national health scheme for the people, but it disagrees in menting such a scheme as they are",64,Earle Page
169,Mr Fitzgeeald (Phillip) [10.9],"detailed in this bill. An y scheme under which a f a m i l y or an individual has to bear a substantial portion-in some cases the greatest portion of the cost of medical and hospital services, as well as pay 3s. a week or £7 16s. a year into the health insurance scheme, pay into a hospital fund and pay the heavy taxes they are forced to pay to-day, w i ll not receive any frenzied support fro m people outside this Parliament. I believe that the health of the nation is so important that it should not be kicked around ball. governments have shown the value of joint committees, and matters like health, social services and repatriation should be discussed and considered in parliamentary committees composed of members of ail political parties in this House. I well remember the attitude adopted by the Government parties, during the general election campaign of 1949, towards the Chifley health scheme, and the way that they fomented hostility throughout our hospitals and all sections of the medical profession. That was in the face of the fact that the Chifley scheme had been subscribed to by a number of their own supporters, who were members of the then Social Security Committee. If any health scheme is to succeed, it find doctors who are taking a stand in must have the co-operation and goodwill opposition to friendly societies and other of the entire medical profession including organizations whicli have been looking medical specialists, nurses, hospital staffs, after the welfare of the people for many chemists, dentists, friendly societies and years. Those doctors are now objecting other health and medical organizations. to friendly societies, and aro in effect Without such co-operation great difficulties w ill arise. Moreover, the ordinary citizen is important, and should not be bullied or bludgeoned into a national health scheme, as is at present proposed action against that very fund . In that, by this Government. ForI warn the connection, I quote from a letter to the Minister that the wholesale domination 'by editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, one section of the health services of the published on the 7th Novembercommunity is very dangerous, and can lead to a complete sell-out, of the people. member belong to any medical benefits lowered its proposed benefits of 10s. per consclieme ?

If one selves had to be disciplined and controlled reads through the measure, clause by -by the Government. clause, one finds that the influence of the British Medical Association pervades all its provisions. It is quite obvious that under this measure the British Medical Association w ill control and ultimately dominate the health scheme. Visiting nurses, dentists and friendly societiessome of which have been in existence for more than 100 years-wil l be left completely outside the real beneficiaries. The grand secretary of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows, a society to which I belong, said the following about this like a political footbill:On numerous occasions LabourI regard it as most important that every Medical Practitioner in Australia should adopt a strictly impartial attitude to every type of Medical Benefits Fund. There is considerable evidence to my knowledge that many Medical Practitioners are actively canvassing for a particular Medical Insurance Fund. This is particularly rife in some industrial centres where the Doctors' Clubs have closed down. I do not suggest that because a person happens to be a Registered Medical Practitioner that he surrenders his citizen rights and from that point of view he is and must be perfectly free in a democracy to advocate any cause in which ho believes. But where he wields so much power over the finances of Medical Insurance Fund it is my opinion a strong case can be made out for an impartial approach to these competing Funds. Throughout Sydney at present one may telling people that they should join the medical benefits f u n d that has been ser, up. and is controlled by, the doctors themselves.

170,Mr Pearce,Does the honourable that it would not receive registration unless it,67,Earle Page
171,Mr Fitzgerald,"Yes, Ifor Health should take some notice of members on his own side of the House, even j f he pays no attention to what we say, and be warned of this Frankenstein monster that is being set up by the British Medical Association, aided and abetted by himself and the Government. Any medical 'benefit scheme that allows the medical profession to make profits by keeping people on the sick list is not in the best interest of the nation. The Government has laid it down that if a person is insured under table B of the medical benefits scheme, and pays Is. 6d. a week if single and 3s. if married, 30 years' experience in the administration he will receive subsidies from the Government in the event of illness. Let us consider what will happen under this bill. The money that the people have paid by way of taxation and which has accumulated in the National Welfare Fund to the extent of £186,000,000 will be returned to them to subsidize payment for their illness only if they belong to one of the approved funds. I submit that, the payment of the Government's contribution to an individual should not be conditional upon his being a contributor to a medical benefit fund. It may be argued that payment is made to a medical benefit fund and that such a. change as I suggest would by-pass the society. "" In certain circumstances, the Minister for Health has allowed payment of an approved benefit to an individual. This practice could he extended so as to give the government benefit to everybody who is affected by illness whether covered by insurance or aiot. No effort should be spared to have the advantage of insurance schemes brought home to every person, but I do not subscribe to the Government's claim that people do not deserve medical assistance if they are not prepared to pay for it. All people have not an equal capacity to pay. The payment of £7 16s. a. year for medical benefits plus at least £2 12s. a year for hospital benefits is a terrific slug to the working man with a family. Members of this Parliament with a family find it difficult to live on their own salaries and they must realize the difficulties of people outside this Parliament who live on a little over the basic wage. After making these substantial contributions what advantage do they receive? Health and medical charges have skyrocketed out of all proportions. It is claimed that this scheme avoids the extravagance of the United Kingdom and New Zealand schemes, encourages voluntary effort, and that the benefit represents 90 per cent, of a fair and reasonable fee for services given by a doctor. Consultation with a general medical practitioner carries a rebate of 12s., which is made up of 6s. from the insurance fund and 6s. from the Commonwealth. The secretary of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows, who has had of a medical fund, made the following statement on this matter:This item of "" fair and reasonable f e e "" is very important, e.g., the consultation with a General Practitioner carries a rebate of 12s., (is. each from the ITund and the Commonwealth. This is 90 per cent, of 13s. i d . which is a mean average between 10s. Gd. and 15s. A general practitioner's fee nowadays ranges from 10s. Gd. to 35s. per visit according to the locality and the type of people who live in that locality. Wheni t comes to surgery, the eminence of tlie operating doctor in the particular sphere governs his fee. Removal of an appendix is one of the most common surgical operations. Its benelit under the Medical Scheme is a rebate of £11 os., being £5 12s. Gd. each from the Fund and the Commonwealth. This £11 5s. represents 00 per cent, of £12 10s a fee which the Commonwealth Board of Health doctors evidently considered a reasonable charge for a surgeon sufficiently skilled to capably remove an appendix. There are, however, surgeons in Australia with remarkable reputations for skill and efficiency who would not touch an appendix removal under 50 OT 80 guineas. The Opposition asks that a provision be inserted in the bill in order to provide that the fees charged by doctors be properly controlled and that the Commonwealth's contribution shall more closely approximate an equitable charge to cover the patient's medical account. A doctor has written the following criticism of this bill:Among the larger operations the removal of the gall bladder is fairly common. The usual cost of this is from 40 to 50 guineas. W it h Uie maximum assistance to the patient of £30 there is a leeway of from £12 to £22 10s. to make up. People who pay 3s. a week plus taxation have to pay many pounds for medical treatment over and above the benefits that they receive from their funds. That is the disgrace of this bill.

Opposition look forward to an opportunity during the next election campaign to fight this issue, because every j>erson who comes before a medical officer between now and the next election will not be a friend of the Minister for Health or of the Government. myself in the unique position of supporting a national health scheme which is in operation, is approved by the people, is a credit to its originator and is recognized as one of the best health schemes in the world. BeforeI proceed to deal with the bill, I must comment on some remarks of the honourable member for Phillip( Mr tralian Labour party has no intention to Fitzgerald). The honourable member read at some length from an unnamed publication. fellow. tion from which the houorable member read. He read from an unnamed publication an article by an anonymous doctor. Possibly payment was made for the article. The bona fides of the publication might be questioned, because it purported to publish on the one hand an article by a person who may be described as a ""Doctor Who Tells"" and on the other hand a reply by the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), who is in charge of this bill. It is interesting to note that the publishers did not seek the Minister's approval to publish his reply to the statement of the anonymous doctor, but that they quoted some speech that was made some -time previously. Therefore, the bona fides of the anonymous, doctor's objection to the bill, in which he stated that an operation for some stomach trouble would cost approximately £70, might well be questioned. The case put forward by the Opposition was so shaky and so devoid of real account is being substance that honourable members opposite thought it necessary that the honorsuggest t h a t the n a t i o n a l h e a l t h able member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) should spend half of liis time on a vicious personal attack on the Minister for Health. The Opposition's case is so devoid of substance that half of the statements that were made were nothing more than a spiteful, venomous, Members of the personal attack. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro attempted to justify his apparent opposition to this measure, although in his own heart he knows very well that he supports it. One of the things he said, which I shall cite because it is most illuminating and will no doubt be repeated many times before this debate is concluded, was that when Labour is returned to office it will repeal this legislation. I have no doubt that if the Australian Labour party ever regains office it will introduce the kind of socialistic measure which it introduced previously.

I have no doubt that the medical profession would then be due for nationalization, as it was previously under Labour. stitution? ber for Lalor( Mr Pollard) refers to the Constitution. I know very well that certain legislation which the Australian Labour party introduced was challenged on constitutional grounds and held to be unconstitutional. However, I have no doubt that Labour would find a way round the Constitution. The electors are well aware that it is the intention of the Opposition to nationalize the medical piofession and to repeal this legislation if it should ever be re-elected to. office. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said that the -bill was first presented in March last and allowed to die. What utter rubbish! When the bill was -presented in March practically all of its provisions were in operation. Of course, seme medical provisions have been introduced since that time. To-day, nearly half the population of Australia are enjoying the benefits with which this legislation deals. Honourable members opposite should contrast that position with the tuberculosis campaign which the previous Labour Government introduced and which I shall deal with later because it is a special subject. That campaign took approximately two years to initiate and produced nothing. Since the present Minister for Health has held the portfolio, he has worked steadily to bring into operation the present national health scheme. His efforts have met with such success that the benefits covered by the provisions of this bill have been accepted by the people of Australia and approved by the rest of the world as a most satisfactory and sensible piece of legislation dealing with this subject. The honourable member for Eden Monaro also stated that the Minister went to the British Medical Association for instructions. I-suggest that if the honorthe National Health Bill. In days gone able member required information on a specialist in that subject. As the Minister for Health is himself a specialist in medical matters, it is natural that he should confer with his colleagues. What rubbish it is to speak about the British Medical Association dictating this bill -' The honourable member for Phillip made that assertion and then went on to say that the members of the British Medical Association would have to be disciplined. Surely it is a contradiction of terms to say that although the British Medical Association dictated this bill, its members should be disciplined by the Minister. The honourable members who have spoken of the British Medical Association in such castigating terms should remember that if they experience a pain they will almost certainly run straight to the first doctor they can find. They will not then ask, "" Are you a member of the British Medical Association ?"", and say, "" If you are, I shall not let you treat me "". Yet they come here and make a great song about the British Medical Association running the Government's medical scheme. I remind them that they owe a tremendous debt of .gratitude to the medical profession. If there is one of them who was brought up in a doctor's home he will know that medical practitioners go out on call at all hours of the day and night and give their services in a voluntary capacity if their patients cannot afford to pay for them. He will also know that no person is ever refused attention by a, medical practitioner. Honourable members opposite criticize a profession which stands higher than that of any other in the world. It is ridiculous for them to try to put over that kind of nonsense to people who really know something about the matter. There is no doubt that their criticism has been made with the object of covering up the fact that they recognize that this is a good hill and that the Government's health scheme is working properly. Honourable members may perhaps ask themselves why it has been necessary to introduce this legislation. Parliaments do not make laws unless there is some necessity for such laws. There is a very good reason behind the introduction of by, when the tempo of life was not so rapid",70,Earle Page

176,Mr Failes,"The honourable memand when more members of a family stayed at home, there were usually one or two girls who were able to care for the other members of the family if they became ill. Sickness did not then assume tbe proportions which it assumes to-day. In addition, attention by doctors was not so generally sought. Indeed, one of the complaints of the medical profession in those days was that people waited until they became very definitely ill before a doctor was called in. As times changed aud more members of the family left home nnd went to work, very little domestic help was available within the household, and it came to be a very critical matter if a member of the family became ill . That was particularly so in t'he case of the shoulders of this Governinent. It enbreadwinner. On the other hand, there was always the fear that the young wife would become ill and thus cast a tremendous burden ou her husband. During the war years, as honourable members are aware, a shortage of hospital accommodation meant that much medical attention had to be provided in the home, so that ii. great deal of working time which should liave been devoted to industrial and national production was lost. AVith this general change in domestic conditions and social outlook, governments looked about to see how they might devise medical and health benefits. Other schemes have been referred to in this chamber. It is true that other schemes have been tried, but the present Minister for Health, being a very astute gentleman, examined those schemes and set to work to evolve a scheme which would contain all the benefits which are covered by the hill at present before the House. That .scheme is unique inasmuch as it is nationwide. All State governments participate in it, and all doctors and chemists have co-operated. It is an excellent example of true federation, in which every government in Australia has co-operated. In addition, the whole of the medical and pharmaceutical professions liave helped r,o put into operation a scheme which is of real value to the community. The scheme commenced by improving the nutrition of children by the free provision of milk,'and by providing for immunization against diseases such as diphtheria which can be controlled in that way. Therefore, it has commenced on the right basis by starting off with the children. The Commonwealth accepts responsibility for national health by providing for preventive medical treatment for growing persons and by providing medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits and assistance to those who are growing older. It therefore encourages people who are enjoying good health to provide for time of sickness. In direct contrast to the socialist measure which was previously introduced in this Parliament, a re-introduction of which has been threatened, it sets out to encourage people voluntarily to take some part in and some responsibility for the provision of such a scheme instead of casting all responsibility for it on to the courages them to develop a personal responsibility and to get away from dependence on governments, which is so beloved of the socialists. The scheme proceeds in logical stages to the point where, in co-operation with the community, the individual, the professions, and the medical benefits organizations, it provides a service for the whole of the people. I use the phrase "" the whole of the people"" deliberately because I do not exclude a section of them which was referred to by Opposition speakers to-night and with which I shall deal later in my speech. The honourable member for Eden Monaro in referring to the hospital benefits scheme said that the legislation passed by the Labour Government provided for the payment of 6s. a day to State governments to offset fees previously paid by patients in public wards. The honourable member claimed that that amount was sufficient to offset the fees paid. He went on to say, in effect, that every person who goes into a hospital must now pay for accommodation and treatment whereas under the earlier legislation these services were provided free of charge. We are well aware that the payment of 6s. a day to offset fees paid by public ward patients sent nearly every hospital in New South Wales into the "" red "". They got into such a shocking financial position that they were unable to pay their tradesmen's bills and they were forced to make repeated requests to the New South Wales Hospitals Commission for assistance. They could ""not maintain their beds and as a result sick people were unable to obtain accommodation and treatment. Tbe bonorable member for Lalor, wbo is trying to interject, knows perfectly well that a largo number of seriously ill people in tlie community could not obtain accommodation and treatment in tbe public wards of hospitals in New South Wales. state of affairs was brought about by the constitutional. Only approximately 150 ridiculous decisions of the Labour Governdoctors co-operated with the Government ment that treatment in public wards of hospitals should be free. Upon the introMcKenna health scheme and, accordduction of the sensible health scheme formulated by the present Minister for Health hospitals were at long last able to pay their way. I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister say that this could prescribe from the British Pharmayear the b u r i a l at Dubbo, one of the largest towi<s in my electorate, has a credit in its .""""counts for the first time not understand. The British Pharmasince 1947. That it was able to operate without incurring a loss is a tribute to the far-sightedness of the Minister in formulating and introducing his health scheme. Under the hospital benefits scheme the Commonwealth provides benefit of Ss. a day, compared with the 6s. a day paid by the Chifley Government, plus an additional benefit of 4s. a day to persons who are members of an approved organization and to their dependants. Hospitals in New South Wales and in the other States are now at last established on a sound basis which enables them to provide accommodation and treatment for those who are ill . Contrast the present position with the position that existed a few years ago, when hospital beds were crowded out by persons who probably did not need them to the disadvantage of desperately ill people. The houorable member for Edenmeans of the average person in the comMonaro said that he approves of the munity, are provided free of charge on benefits provided in the bill for invalid a doctor's prescription. and age pensioners. He should do so because no such benefits were provided by to sufferers from tuberculosis. The honorthe government of which he was a supable member for Eden-Monaro, in a porter. The'Chifley Government's legisvicious speech of a most personal kind, lation made no provision for medical, criticized the Minister for Health on the pha-rmaceutical or hospital benefits for ground that he had taken an inordinate pensioner;*. Under the provisions of this length of time to formulate and introduce bill pensioners will be entitled, to free hospital, pharmaceutical and medical benefits which should be of great assistance to them. I come now to the subject of pharmaceutical benefits. These benefits were not provided under the Labour Government's legislation for the simple reason that doctors were forced to prescribe only those drugs that were listed in a formulary. When they appealed against that provision the legislation was held to be unin giving effect to what was known as the ingly, very .few persons in the community benefited from it. ' An Opposition member has said that under the Labour Government's legislation doctors copoeia. I suggest that he should not use words the meaning of which he does copoeia is, in fact, a list of practically every drug used in medical science. The McKenna health scheme provided that doctors could prescribe only those drugs which were set out in the formulary. In other words, doctors were told which drugs they could prescribe for their patients. Mr CI.V»E CAMXROXT -That is not true. scheme the doctors were virtually told how they were to carry out the duties of their profession. Opposition members who criticized the British Medical Association and the members of the medical profession and tried to tell them how they should carry out their part have no right to speak about health schemes.

179,Mr Failes,"Unde r the McKennahis health scheme. I remind the Honge that immediately after the right honourable gentleman was appointed to his portfolio he commenced to work on his health scheme. Upon its completion he put it into operation without delay. Opposition members should be the last to criticize the right honourable gentleman on that score. An examination of the tuberculosis scheme reveals that the Labour Government called for a report on tuberculosis in Australia, which was furnished by a very eminent authority on the subject in November, 1947. The report was referred to a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at which it was thoroughly discussed. In November, 1948, twelve months after the report had heen presented, a bill to give effect to the proposals contained in the report was presented .to the House. Thus, a lot of water had run under the bridge before action was taken to implement the report. The dates upon which the States signed an agreement with the Commonwealth to give effect to the proposals contained in the report are rather significant. Victoria signed it on the 13th December, 1949, nearly two years after the report had been presented to tlie Parliament. Queensland signed it on the 14th September, 1949, Western Australia on the 26th September, 1949, and Tasmania on the 9th November, 1949. South Australia and New South Wales had not signed the agreement when the Chifley Government went out of office. As the result of the good offices of the present Minister for Health the consent of South Australia was obtained on the 17th May, 1950, and of New Sonth Wales on the 31st May, 1950. The legislation then came into operation. I should like to quote the tuberculosis benefits that have been received as a result of the actions of this Government and the present Minister for Health, and those that were provided in 1948-49, the year before this Governinent came into office. In that year, the Labour Government provided tuberculosis benefits totalling £134,000 for the whole of Australia. _ In 1952-53, the tuberculosis benefits provided hy this Government totalled £4,590,000. I do not know whether this Government is for Watson( Mr Curtin) may quote entitled, to any credit for the tuberculosis from many sources, but when I made Act. but it is deserving of praise for inquiries as to the number of chronic attacking the disease at its very base by means of that measure. The legislation was introduced by the previous Government, but it has been administered by this Government. The people have been invited to submit themselves to examination. Those who have been found to besuffering from tuberculosis have been assisted in every possible way to regain their health and they have been prevented from being a menace to the community.. As a result, tuberculosis is rapidly being: stamped out in Australia. In 1948-49, health benefits provided under the Labour Government included' £149,000 iu the form of pharmaceutical benefits, £6,886,000 for hospital benefits and £134,000 for tuberculosis benefits. In 1952-53, health benefits paid by this Government included £7,000,000 for pharmaceutical benefits, £12,420,000 for hospital benefits and £4,590,000 for tuberculosis benefits. Those are three comparative items, but, in addition, this Government provided £1,660,000 for pensioners' medical benefits, £1,450,000 in the way of medical benefits, £1,600,000 for free milk distributed to children and £520,000 for mental institution benefits. None of those last-named health benefits was provided in 1948-49. There is a marked difference, therefore, in the benefits that have been conferred by this Government and those of the previous Administration. I turn my attention now to another matter upon which there has been considerable misrepresentation in this House. I refer to chronic complaints. ""Without question, every lionorable member has the utmost sympathy for chronic sufferers, but that section of the community should be placed in the proper perspective. The honourable member for Phillip gave an exaggerated number in referring to persons suffering from chronic complaints. I have questioned medical practitioners who were uot aware of the purpose of my inquiries, and discovered that there are very few cases of chronic complaints in the community compared with the number of persons who receive medical treatment. Mr Curtin interjecting,",73,Earle Page
180,Mr Failes,"The honourable membersufferers in a town and district of 3,000 to 4,000 persons, I was informed by doctors that they had on their books only six people with chronic complaints, and only two of those were really serious cases. I do not mention this matter hecause I want to minimize the disabilities from which chronic patients suffer, but I claim that the number is not nearly so large as some honourable members have suggested. TJnder this bill, sufferers from chronic complaints will be able to obtain ali the benefits that the measure provides. The honourable member for Eden Monaro said that the scheme was political, and that it was introduced on the eve of a Senate eleotion. I wish to inform him, if he does not already know, that the Leader of the Opposition sent a telegram to a person in my electorate on the eve of the Senate election promising that if the Australian Labour party was returned to office, it would introduce health legislathe evident satisfaction of the Minister, tion which would include provision for chronic sufferers. That proposal was entirely political. At the time that the right honourable gentleman sent that telegram, he should have known that there were hospital benefit organizations in Australia prepared to accept persons suffering from chronic complaints. One of them is the Amalgamated Employees Unions Medical Pund, which has informed me that it will accept anybody in Australia into its fund. chronic cases and pay for chronic illnesses suffered at the time of joining the fund. The Newcastle and Suburban Co-operative Society's Hospital Pund will do the fame, the only condition being that the person concerned must be an employee of the organization or a contributing member as it is a co-operative fund. which are registered under this act, will accept chronic patients. They will pay full benefits for chronics and accept anybody in Australia. Suggestions that have been made in this House to the effect that chronic sufferers cannot obtain the full benefits of this bill are incorrect. I make this statement only after continuous investigation and co-operation with the Minister for Health, who has done everything possible to ensure that those persons are covered. This scheme is only in its Mr Failes. infancy. It has already eliminated the previous provision that aged persons were not entitled to benefits. They will be accepted into the fund. I have given the names of two organizations that accept chronic sufferers, and I suggest that all honourable members should support the scheme fully. If they do so, it will bear fruit. that is before the House is a consolidating measure incorporating into one statute medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits and various other health services. This is a much heralded and widely publicized attempt to provide a comprehensive health scheme. It has been promised for the past 30 years by thc Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), who introduced it and by members of the parties supporting the Government. My only comment on the scheme is that it is good in parts like the curate's egg. Despite it is quite evident to all intelligent observers that much remains to be done in the sphere of medical services before Ihis scheme will meet the requirement? of the people. much audible conversation on my right. ports the benefits that are contained iu the bill because its members have advoIt will accept cated and introduced a number of them, but the Opposition offers total objection to a number of the provisions by which the scheme is to be implemented. It is Contribution obvious from, the provisions of the bill that the British Medical Association has taken a not inconsiderable part in the preparation of the scheme. Despite the fervid denials by honourable members opposite, Those two funds, the effects of the introduction of thc scheme and the organization that led to it, bring one to the inescapable conclusion that the British Medical Association had quite a lot to do with it. So far as I can ascertain, the basis of this scheme, particularly in connection with hospital and medical benefits, is that the administration has to be carried out by approved medical benefit societies on a voluntary insurance basis, backed by Government cash benefits. That is the fulcrum upon which the scheme is balanced, but when it was introduced, many taxpayers",74,Earle Page

183,Mr Bird,"The Labour party supwore perturbed because they had believed that health benefits would be 'forthcoming from theNational Welfare Pund to which they had contributed in no small measure for a number of years. Put we find that this scheme is not general in its application because of the incidence of the implementation announced by the Government. The principal virtue of a government health scheme should be that it covers, to all practical intents and purposes, everybody in the community. Wliy has there been, and w ill continue to be in many countries, an insistent demand for the introduction of government health schemes? The explanation is that the development of medical science has leapt far ahead of social provision to apply that knowledge to the whole community, and not a section of it . Medical science often requires costly investigation, and this is frequently followed by expensive operations. Consequently, an agitation has arisen in every civilized country for the introduction of a. government medical scheme. The cost of medical treatment is beyond the financial ability of the masses to meet, and a government scheme should solve this worrying problein for the average wage-earner. The fundamental principle of any health scheme should"" be that it gives cover to the whole community. But this fundamental precept has been completely ignored by the Government. n dm if sion of the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes), only half the people of Australia are covered by the scheme, so that, in racing parlance, this sclieme falls at tbe first hurdle. The citizen who has paid for hospital and medical treatment by his contributions to the National Welfare Fund w ill not receive any benefits from it unless he joins an approved society. He w ill be denied the benefits payable by the Goto ensure that all the people receive benefits; vernment unless he is prepared to make not only members of approved hospital benefit supplementary payments to an approved organizations. society. I was amused when the Minister quent stage of the Health Service conform to for Health, in his second-reading speech, thc principle of the Pharmaceutical Benefits preened himself and, metaphorically Act, which applies to all Australians, and speaking, patted himself on the back maintaining the independence of the family when he declared, ad nauseam, that the limitations or means test, and available to voluntary insurance was the most satiseverybody, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act has factory feature of the scheme. The word been reasonably successful, but the Hospital"" voluntary "" is completely misapplied in Benefits Sclieme is being hotly criticized because reference to this scheme, which virtually members involves conscription. Apparently, the only alternative to voluntary action is compulsory deprivation of benefits, for which taxpayers have already paid. An y system of voluntary insurance must break down if it fails to provide for the very people for whom it should care. I refer to the vast body of unskilled workers for whom the threat of unemployment is always present. I invite the Minister to in f o rm the House what w ill happen if Australia experiences another economic depression and many people, because of unemployment, are forced to allow their membership of approved societies to lapse. Surely benefits payable from the national health scheme should be availahle to everybody. A person who is prepared to make payments to an approved organization should receive from it the benefits to which he is entitled, but a person who has not paid contributions to an approved society should not be deprived of the payments made by the Government. Members of approved organizations and non-members alike have made their contributions to the National Welfare Fund, and not one reason has heen advanced by Government supporters for this unfair discrimination. I eagerly await an explanation of the reason why a person who has paid contributions to the National Welfare Fund by way of taxation should be deprived of government benefits because he is not a On the member of an approved organization. I am not the only person who holds that view. No one w ill accuse MrE r i c Scott, who is the federal president of the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia, of hpinar a friend and supporter of the policy of the Labour party at any time, but some time ago he wrote an article on tbe national health scheme in which he saidThe major problem confronting Australia is Tliis can be done only by making each subsedoctor and chemist . . . Carrying no its restrictive benefits are available only to of approved societies. That statement shows conclusively that Mr Scott considers that the government scheme, in the present circumstances, is uot fair or just. On this occasion he joins forces with the Labour party in suggesting that the Government should review this useless scheme. The Government is inconsistent in the formulation of this bill. pay his membership fees before he is I should have thought that when a number of schemes were being consolidated in one statute, a consistent principle would be observed. That is not so. The benefits under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act are available to every one, but the hospital Melbourne recently, and subsequently I benefit and the medical benefit are available only to members of approved societies. That is a glaring inconsistency -claims. He ridiculed me and said that, Why does not the Government apply to the hospital and medical benefits the same principle that it applies to the pharmaceutical benefit? The House has not been given an explanation of this extraordinary lack of statesmanship on the part of the Government. I shall now examine the position in relation to approved organizations. After all this matter is of considerable interest because the approved organizations are of comparatively recent origin and many people are now beginning to find out what is wrong with them. Believe me, there is plenty wrong with them! Por example, an examination of their work shows a surprising lack of uniformity. make their own rules and set their own scale of benefits over and above a certain amount allowed by the Government. This lack of uniformity will be a source of continual discontent and bickering in future, when the member of an organization begins to compare the benefits to which he is entitled with those payable by another organization. will be widely discussed, and I venture to say that coals of fire will be heaped on the head of the Government. The honourable member for Lawson tried unsuccessfully to convince the House that some societies made provision for the admission of chronically ill patients. There is a vast difference of opinion in the rules respecting the admission of persons over the age of 65 years. Because the societies have varying regulations, the subscriptions demanded from members, and the benefits available to them, vary considerably. Ur. Bird. That disparity will not make for satisfaction. ' One matter that I must voice in the House to-night is the tremendous difference in the time taken to pay claims. The organizations have uniformity in one respect, and that is that a person must entitled to make a claim. In other words, a person has to pay his subscriptions in advance, otherwise he will not receive any benefits in return. A case of delayed payment was brought to my notice in asked the Minister whether organizations were taking an inordinate time to pay they were taking only seven or eight days to pay claims. He added that those in which the control was decentralized took only 24 hours to pay a claim. Immediately that question was raised, a number of letters were published in the Melbourne newspapers the writers of which sought information about the operation of the Hospital Benefits Association, which is the largest approved society in Victoria. That organization, when it was tackled on the point, replied that it took from five to six weeks after the lodgement of applications before payment of benefit could be made to applicants. That fact refutes the Minister's claim that payments are made within They six, or seven, days. Indeed, a person who receives payment of benefit from that organization within five weeks after lodgement of a claim can be considered to be fortunate. I know of instances where a longer period has elapsed. It has been stated on behalf of that organization that the main causes of delay in paying claims for benefit are lack of information supThe disparities plied by applicants and the large volume of applications. These excuses are unimpressive when one remembers that friendly societies make payment of benefit within a few days and, in some instances, on the day on which an application is lodged. If friendly societies are capable of meeting claims promptly, why should not an organization of the standing of the Hospital Benefits Association in Victoria be able to do likewise? When only the hospital benefits scheme was in operation, this organization, before it entered the medical benefits scheme in A p r i l last, took eight weeks or approved societies are non-profit making -even longer to settle a claim. A t that organizations. time applicants were not required been delightfully vague in respect of this to supply detailed medical accounts. matter. Are these organizations accumuThese facts impel me to inquire lating large reserves by delaying payment wliether have made any investigation to ascertain their members? If that is the case, it is whether all approved societies have comtime that the Government rectified that petent and adequate stafis to handle a defect. 3cheme of the proportions of the present scheme. I should like to know whether the Government w ill insist that as membership of the Hospital Benefits Association increases that organization shall he the member joined the society, or in obliged to increase its staff proporrespect of an illness which became chronic tionately. I have received many comwithin two months of the date of admisplaints from persons who have been waitsion to membership of the society. That ing for long periods to receive payment society has ruled that if an illness beof benefit. The Melbourne Sun, in its comes chronic it w ill not carry a memissue of the 30th October last, published ber for benefit after it has paid two major tbe following leading article:Complaints of delay in settling claims for hospital and medical benefits under the Page Lawson that benefit is payable in respect scheme have become numerous.

Probably, that is by the Hospital Benefits Association, the the worse feature of the existing scheme largest of the organizations concerned, that because, after all, persons suffering from five or six weeks elapses between the lodging chronic illness constitute a surprisingly uf an application for payment and the sending of a cheque. The explanation offered is that this is due proportionately the greatest measure of partly to a lack Of detailed information in assistance under the scheme.

If it cated also lead one. to inquire whether fails to do so, the scheme as a whole will The Government has the government authorities of benefit and thereby denying justice of One approved society has announced that it w ill not pay benefit in respect of an illness which was chronic at the time claims. That fact completely refutes the claim made by the honourable member for large proportion, of persons and require' scheme. Anomalies of this kind should drain upon their resources. Such perthan they pay in total subscriptions to a society. In this respect, the principle underlying the present scheme is entirely unsatisfactory in that approved organizaThe Government should recognize the be merely a travesty of a national health scheme. No provision is made in the bill in order to ensure that fees now chargeable by doctors shall remain reasonably stationary. I sincerely trust that the doctors will not take advantage of the fact that a patient now is obliged to pay only a proportion of the medical fee. Por instance, approved societies pay 12s. of the fee of 15s. chargeable in respect of disabilities, and the Government's plan an ordinary visit. Eor the reasons that I have indicated, provision should be made to ensure that medical fees shall not be increased. The Government should make every endeavour to safeguard the interests of the people iu this respect. After the next general election, perhaps, certain members of the medical profession will seek to increase, their fees on the ground that the cost of living has increased. That section of the scheme is a challenge to the medical profession to exercise restraint, and I shall watch its reaction to the challenge with a great deal of interest. Another glaring weakness lies in the small amount that will be payable for a major operation. The maximum assistance to a. patient in any circumstances will be only £30. That is far too little. Much financial distress sometimes occurs when a major operation becomes necessary. Usually, there in little prior warning, and the patient is required to find the necessary money almost on the spur of the moment. Provision should be macle to meet almost the entire cost of a major operation, in much the same way as provision can be made, by means of fire insurance, to cover the cost of damage done to household goods ancl effects by fire. The careful householder guards himself against the risk of fire damage by means of insurance. Surely nobody will suggest, that £30 is sufficient to cover the cost of a. major operation! The amount is contemptibly small. Such an operation may involve a patient in a charge of £100 or even £150. One notable fault in the bill is the absence of any provision for the assistance registration is cancelled, through no fault of the mentally ill. The Government persists in disregarding the needs of these chance of obtaining benefits. They may unfortunate citizens and the omission will Sir. Bird. perpetuate a weakness that will leave its health scheme basically incomplete. That is why the Opposition suggests that government funds be devoted to the treatment and relief of mental illness. The bill draws an anomalous distinction between mental illness and physical illness, which cannot be justified in any circumstances. Both the physically ill and the mentally ill suffer from health should provide for the needs of both. Modern scientific and medical advances have greatly improved the whole approach to mental illness, but progress has been hampered by the lack of finance. In recent years, there has been a pronounced improvement of the possibilities of restoring health and happiness to those who are afflicted with mental disabilities. There should be a wider recognition of the fact, but the Government has ignored this unique opportunity to acknowledge it. It should provide for tlie allocation of funds under the scheme to exploit these advances to the full. If as much assistance were given to this kind of medical work as has been given in other fields of medicine, the lot of the unfortunate people in our mental institutions woulcl be much less bleak. Unless the Government agrees to make some provision for the benefit of the mentally ill , such persons will remain condemned to suffer under the outmoded and inadequate conditions which now impede their successful treatment. I hope that at least it will accept this feature of the amendment that has been proposed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Clause 28 of the bill provides(1.) Where the registration of a registered medical benefits organization is suspended or cancelled under section seventy-nine of this Act, Commonwealth benefits are not, unless the Minister in respect of that organization otherwise directs, payable in respect of the period for whicli the suspension or cancellation has effect. Too much power will be vested in the Minister under that provision. People who have contributed to a registered organization that is suspended, or whose of their own may be deprived of any be forced to sacrifice their contributions and the benefits to which normally they would be entitled at the mere caprice of the Minister. That should not be so. If they have contributed to the funds of an organization, at least they should not be deprived of the right to receive Commonwealth benefits as a result of any act of omission or commission by the society concerned. Surely the bill should provide that, if an organization is suspended or deregistered for any reason, the people who have paid into its funds should be eligible for the Commonwealth benefit! The danger to which I have directed attention is considerable. Another provision that should be reviewed is clause 70, which deals with the establishment of registration committees to examine applications for registration. The bill specifies a number of factors that must be considered before registration can be granted to a society. That is all right. I realize that organizations must measure up to certain standards. Incidentally, I cannot help thinking that the organization in Victoria to which I have referred, which was guilty of the tardy payment of benefits, could not have been carefully checked before it was registered. However, I hope that, after an organization has been granted registration, it will be subject to continual surveillance by ofncials of the Department of Health in order to make sure that contributors shall not be deprived of any benefits for which they should be eligible under this legislation. able member's time has expired. adjourned.

The present postal activities at Mortdale ure conducted in rented premises which are in need of repair, it is not possible under present circumstances to provide further amenities. 2. A site on which a cottage is erected is at present being used as a postman's depot.

In the administrative arrangements for annual camps of continuous training for the Citizen Military Forces, is consideration still country localities so that selected camp dates will not conflict with such requirements. honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The subdivision of home training time into bivouacs, day parades, half day parades and night parades is at the discretion of Commanding Officers, although guiding principles are laid down by Army Headquarters. Consequent on the reduction in obligatory home training to seven days annually a Military Board Instruction, which is in course of issue, revises the guiding principles to provide for two or three two day bivouacs and the balance of three days or one day to be allotted for whole day, half day or night parades. The instruction states that normally uot more than one day will be allotted to night parades. As most units arrange their programmes of training in accordance with the the Postmasterguiding principles laid down by Army Headquarters, it may be expected that in future obligatory night training w ill be limited to three parades annually. In addition to the seven days obligatory training, Citizen Military Force members are entitled to pay for twelve days voluntary training. The subdivision of the voluntary training into week-end, day and nigbt parados is a matter for the unit concerned, but the tendency is to keep even voluntary night parades to a minimum. 2. The complete annual part time training liability of National Servicemen is fourteen days camp of continuous training and seven days home training. This training must be attended by members residing witliin tlie five mile radius of a country training centre or the ten mile radius of a metropolitan training centre. Although trainees livin g outside these radii are under an obligation to serve for the f u l l National Service training of 98 days f u l l time, training and 42 days part time training, it ha* been thc practice to grant leave from portion of the annual home training.
