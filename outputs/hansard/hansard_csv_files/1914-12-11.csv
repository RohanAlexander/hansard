I desire to explain that shortly after the Titanic disaster fin International Convention was called by the Imperial authorities, and that at that conference every country, including Australia, New Zealand, ancl Canada, was represented. The Convention agreed that certain lines I believe a large pershould be followed to insure the greater safety of life at sea, and in the British Parliament, which is not noted for the celerity with which it deals with such legislation, a B ill to give effect to the decision arrived at was introduced last May, and received the Royal assent about six weeks later. All the powers that were signatories to that Convention have passed the same legislation. Without this B ill , in order to bring our Navigation laws into line with the rest of the world in this respect, we should have to ask each of the six States to pass a separate measure covering our object. We think it better that the Commonwealth Parliat ment should take action, and pass this B ill so that it may come into operation simultaneously with the proclamation of the principal Act. W it h a l l due respect to the Leader of the Opposition, I should like him to appeal to the honourable member for Angas aud the honorahle member for Darling Downs, to state whether this B ill is not necessary, and whether it is not advisable to pass it at once. It is a non-contentious measure, and is similar to legislation passed by the Parliaments of the principal countries in the world for the greater safety of life at sea. [11.28] I am not objecting in any sense of the word to the merits of the B ill . Indeed, I am not acquainted with its merits, although I remember the proposition coming before me before I l e f t office.

I refer to the contemplated great extension of the note issue. I am not going to take up much of the time of honourable members by narrating the history of similar issues in other countries. Honourable members are familiar with those facts. I think the present Minister of Home Affairs has, more than once, shown to us thafc he has made a particular study of this matter, and he has more than oncepointed out that if an inflated paper currency should bring about a depreciaThat estimate is calculated upon tion of that currency, the perils of waritself are hardly equal to the disasters Under existing conditions that will befall the community, and those disasters will fall first and worse upon, the wage-earners.

First of all, I think we a l l agree that in an extraordinary financial period extraordinary financial methodsThe original Act made must be adopted. Moreover, when a l l parts of fche Empire are taking risks we, As my hontoo, must take risks in bearing our share of the burden. fer that the note issue, as it stands to-day, bears any comparison with note issues, which have brought about disaster?

I am conscious of that, and I have hesitated for some time as toI t is proposed to widen whether I should in any way add to the possible apprehensions the people may have with regard to the note issue. Mr J. H . CATTS -But honourable members ought to have some means of consultation on the matter. I admit that. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE J u s t so. I venture The argument that has induced me to say what I am about to say is that so f a r we have not gone to the f u l l extent that the Government propose to go, and if we allowed their proposals to pass without I now pass to a pointing out what appear to us to be the dangers attending them, we should afterwards be accused of not having uttered aword of warning. Therefore, I feel justified in putting before honourable members in all moderation the dangers of the situation with which we are faced.

The purpose of that proposal was the establishment with the Bank of England of a credit by lodging gold with the Treasurer, who was to hold it in trust for the Bank of England, which would I think not, so f a r as establish a credit for us wherever it was needed abroad. position, and has no relation to the present agreement. That was only like a passing feather in the air compared with the otlier arrangement. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I accept that statement, of course.

What is the second? . Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The second result is inflation or appreciation of prices locally. But I wish to deal now with the first result, the drain of gold from a country. Australia, perhaps more than any other country sharing in the present disaster, has conditions which tend towards that particular kind of in The note flation to which I have referred. The balance of trade is always against Australia. It has always been against us. Eveni n the days when our gold output was very much greater than it is to-day I do the halance of trade was against us, but in later years ""it has always been strongly against us. Our gold production last year was in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000 for Australia, while our annual current payments that have to be made abroad for interest, public, municipal, and p r ivate, have been very roughly estimated at £.15,000,000 by Mr Coghlan, whose estimates are generally accepted.

In these circumstances we have to treat gold, as the Treasurer says, as being one I am dealof the products of Australia which have We to be taken into account in our balance of trade, and that balance of trade, including gold, has always been, more particularly in recent years, heavily against us. How has that balance been squared ? By the fact that Australia has been a borrowing nation, and that its borrowings year by year are continuous and extended. Not wrongly.

Eor instance, last year the addition to our borrowing was about £14,000,000, not including loans for redemption purposes. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE sum, bigger than the borrowing in any preceding year, hut each year has shown a large increase of money borrowed over the amount prevailing before, and the result has been that the halance of trade account between us and the world has ""been squared by that borrowing. If that borrowing ceased or diminished, the strongly against us, and we should have to find gold to send away in order to meet our international obligations. This is a point to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members: Once our borrowing ceases, other things remaining the same, we have to find from some source vast sums of gold to send to the Old Country, or have to become trustees of vast sums of gold here, in order to open up credit in the Old Countryin other words, put that gold out of our possession. once. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE follow up the argument for a moment. This year, owing to the war, our ordinary borrowing has practically come to an end; the States are not ahle to borrow and, w it h the exception of the £18,000,000 to which I shall refer presently, we are unable to borrow. Therefore, we have to provide in Australia not out of borrowed money, but out of this credit, or this supposed credit, that we are creating by means of the note issue, in order to furnis h the means of carrying out work which we have hitherto paid for out of money actually borrowed from the other end of the world. I shall be immediately asked whether the £18,000,000 is not practically substituted for the borrowings of the States and the Commonwealth in the past. My answer is "" No . "" It is not a substitute for the reason that the £18.000,000 whicli we borrow from the Old Country is lent to us for war expenditure. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE Of course it is, but it is ear-marked for Avar expenditure, and a great deal of it w ill be spent at the other end of the world, while that which is not spent at the other end of the world w ill be spent in Australia in A big sum. paying for obligations which are quite It is a big sej>arate ancl distinct from the ordinary obligations connected w it h our development work.

Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It does not mean that the money is sent out here. balance of trade would turn Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No r goods. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It makes no difference. I thought that it would be unnecessary to go into this purely elementary aspect of the case. Most of the money borrowed is used in paying debts that we owe in the Old World, our annual obligations, public and private, in in terest alone amounting to something like £15,000,000. It is perfectly right that we as a community should borrow £18,000,000 to enable us to bear our share of the burden of the war. But in addition to that, we are, by means of a note issue, going to create a kind of credit that will enable us to continue the f u l l expenditure L e t me on public works and departmental undertakings which has hitherto been paid for with borrowed money. We are not going to borrow money for this expenditure. Therefore, we may leave practically the whole, if not the whole, of that £1S,000.000, out of the national exchange account. the Imperial loan will not affect the accounts between England and Australia. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No . , But the loan was accompanied with the obligation that we should spend it for purposes on which we do not usually spend our borrowed money; that we should spend it on the equipment and despatch of the Expeditionary Forces, and on other war services. Having accepted the money on those terms, we must put the sum on one side in considering the balance of trade, and our exchanges generally.",13,Budget Landtax And Death Duties

122,,"T h a t is Mr HUGHES -Countries which producedoes not matter at all, so long as the balance of trade is against us. Where you have a country whose gold production is not more than two-thirds of the permanent amount of current liabilities that have to be met outside annually, that production ceases to be of any more importance, for purposes of international exchange, than wheat or wool, or any other -commodity. Therefore we may leave out of consideration the Australian production of gold. The banks must meet the obligations of their customers in London, public and private. They must find the means of paying in gold all our obligations outside Australia. They can do that only by using the gold iu their coffers, which, fortunately, at the present time, possibly in anticipation of the dangers that might arise from an adverse condition of the balance of trade, is very large, amountone by adopting rotten lines of business, ing to £33,000,000. It is extremely fortunate for us that the banks have had the j>rudence to amass such a large gold reserve. If they had not done so, we should now be in a very peculiar position. But if the balance of trade is not re-established will be impossible to deposit a large proin some way, either by our borrowing money abroad in the ordinary way, or by increased production, or by decreased imports, there must be a continuous and heavy drain upon our gold. importation. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE deal with that in a moment or two. The first way in which an inflated note issue is likely to bring about disastrous conditions is by causing a drain upon gold. Hand in hand with that another disadvantage arises, not so much from foreign exchange as from a local redundancy of money, paper or other currency. The banks are only conduit-pipes between lenders and borrowers. They take the money of the man who has more than he can use for current expenditure, pay him interest for it, and lend it out at a higher interest to other persons. They cannot increase the amount of their lending simply because an enormous number of persons wish to lend to them. They can find an outlet for the money only when business is increasing rapidly, and a host of new enterprises are being started for which money is needed. Under normal business conditions, only a certain amount can be lent out by the banks. The result is that when the currency of the community is vastly in excess of the amount required for the ordinary transactions of business, large and small, a number of persons wish to make deposits in the bank. But the banks are obliged very soon to say, "" We cannot lend out any more money. Therefore, although we will keep your money for you, we cannot pay any interest upon it."" Commonwealth Bank say that? not, it would be better that it had never been created. The honourable member's interjection shows the sort of thing with which we have to deal. If the Commonwealth Bank is to be a deified institution, conducting banking business on entirely new lines, and if it is going to help every then it would be infinitely better that it had never been established. If we have an inflated currency-if we have a much larger amount of money than is necessary for the purposes of the community, apart altogether from foreign exchanges, then it portion of it at interest with the banks and other financial institutions. Such institutions cannot pay interest where they cannot make interest. They will have to stop receiving deposits at interest, or lower the rate of interest. I shall at which the honourable member expects that state of affairs to exist in the Commonwealth ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I should say that it will occur very soon. It is, I think, a matter of mathematical calculation. If we have £30,000,000 of notes, in' addition to whatever gold there is in circulation, floating about in a country where the whole transactions of the community can be carried on with £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, then that situation must soon arise. In short, my answer to the right honourable member is that it will occur as soon as ever he raises the note-issue. honourable member has made that statement. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I make it now.

The inflation of prices, coupled with a tendency for gold to go away, has always, in every country, led to the depreciation of everything else, which we dread.

That remark might be made from either side of the Chamber, even if honourable members opposite do not agree with the conclusions of the houorable member in their entirety. in connection with the questions of taxation and borrowing that the most important feature of our outlook under the present conditions w i ll be found by experience to surround the question of the note issue and holding. In consequence of the amount of time which the honourable member for Flinders devoted to this question, I do not propose to tax the patience of the Committee in any elaborate analysis of the matter, but I hope, in due course, to come to some phases which he did not deal with f u l l y , before I conclude the observations I desire to make. Speaking generally, it has always occurred to me that it is a comparatively easy thing to criticise the finance of Labour Governments. Judging by our Australian experience, in the Commonwealth and also in States administered by Labour authority, the fallacies of Labour finance are very transparent, and I think the injustices of it are sometimes I think the agreement glaring and unmistakable. But I realize to-day that we live in unusual and very tragic conditions and times, and that a f a i r consideration of one's political opponents, particularly when those opponents are in ofiice, is perhaps more important than mere excess of party criticism. It is in that restrained, and I hope chastened, spirit that I propose to approach the Budget to-day. My own experience teaches me to be very sympathetic towards a Treasurer. Eveni n normal times the A r e not the words lot of a Treasurer, like that of the policeman in Gilbert's famous song, "" is not a happy one,"" and amongst his own colleagues in the Cabinet and in the party the grave responsibilities which the Treasurer frequently carries are not too keenly appreciated. If that is so in . normal times, it is doubly so to-day. The responsibilities which the Treasurer bears towards his own people and towards those who are lending him money from oversea are enormously intensified and in I creased. Therefore, any comments I shall have to offer on this Budget w ill , cumstances in which it was produced, and they w ill lack some of the severity which otherwise might have been directed tc^ wards some of the Government's proposals. The first question which I desire to discuss is that of tlie form of the Budget.

The outstanding of that peace Budget is the alarming rate, when we look hack over the last few years, at which the expenditure of the Oommonwealth is increasing. those wlio helieve that this nation can stand still either in population or in enterprises, but I do believe that it is the imperative duty of the man in charge of the Treasury, and of his supporting in the Cabinet and in the party, to see that for every pound we spend we get one pound's worth of value. words, economy is a duty which they ought to face, and which is made obligatory on the Treasurer leagues to carry out to the fullest I am not one of those who. hold the view that Australia has reached the limits of taxation in times of peace, or that it is a heavily taxed country, because, in dealing with the taxation which the people of a nation pay, we have to keep in view, to be just in our comparisons, the functions which a particular Government charges. wrongly, and most of us think rightly, have undertaken ship and direction of many which in other countries are left to private enterprise. protection and development of the highest interests of the community, us money.

But the point in feature which I am very interested, and it has. already figured in more than a passing way in this debate, is this: the Governments of the Commonwealth and I am not one of States, interdependent as they are, and serving the same people as they do, must keep in view one another's requirements and systems of taxation. If we of the Commonwealth decide to disregard alcolleagues together the laudable and natural wishesof the component parts of Australia for the development of their interests, and In other push on w i th our system of taxation, it is just as apparent as the sun at noonday that there w ill be a collision, and, perhaps, an irreconcilable difference betweenand his colthese two forces of government which extent. w ill lead to an immediate, and probably permanent, in j u ry to the highest in terests we wish to preserve.

However, the M in ister must not pretend for a moment that higher his Tariff is a temporary or final Prothe happier the comtectionist effort. In that respect, it is We know that to be a fallacy. a delusion and a sham. Let me illustrate, men believe that we what I mean by a story of a lunatic postas light as posimpressionist artist. It is asserted, by some schools of artistic thought, that ambitions of the community. all post-impressionists are lunatics; but this one was legally a lunatic, and was confined in an asylum, and provided w i th a small room, a large canvas, and some brushes and paint, in order to give him a chance of cure ag well as a peaceful and contented mind. He laboured long and lovingly on his canvas; and when some friends went to see his work, he „ One said, "" I wish to show you the greatest thing I have ever produced. It is one of the masterpieces of all the ages."" His friends could see nothing on the canvas, The Tariff was given to the Comand so one of them said, "" What does it I represent?"" The lunatic said, "" It reto every word tlie presents the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea."" The visitor said, "" W h e r e is the Red Sea?"" "" O h , "" said the lunatic, "" t h a t has been rolled back."" Then he was asked, "" W h e r e are the children of Israel ?"" He replied, ""They have crossed over."" "" We l l , where are the Egyptians ?"" The fact was not he was asked; and he replied "" Oh, they The proposals came before have not yet arrived."" That is how this Tariff strikes me. Protection is rolled back; the revenue has crossed over, heading for the promised land; and the In ter-State Commission has not yet arrived. It is not a Protectionist effort, It is a post-impressionist attempt at a Tariff, and is a blank in the truest and I have always been a Protechighest industrial sense of the word. I hope that the Minister of Trade and CusI am a high-duty toms will not take my remarks as perwhich I sonally offensive, but to me, as a Protectionist, the man who produces such a I believe Tariff and calls it Protective is nothing developbut a Fiscal Fakir. If we wish to learn and otherwise, we what the people think of the Tariff, we high, must not go to individuals engaged in the industries supposed to be affected by it . I am always disposed to take with a grain of salt many of the arguments of men who are engaged in the industries which ask for Protection. One must use his own judgment, in regard to representations as the Tariff is made about the Tariff, by sifting the t r u th one; but if he asks from the false. Let us take the attitude of the great advocates of Protection in this country, the journalists who have prescribed the minimum duties that can be considered Protective in any particular in fantile community such as the Colony of dustiy.

What measures we are taking now to defend the Commonwealth, andfcoshow our interest in the great world struggle, are as much for the benefit of the poor wage-earner as of the rich property-owner. You cannot measure by possession the safety of the nation. The rule of Great Britain over this country has meant to every one of us the right to pursue, with success, according to his ability and his luck, his individual ambitions. But the proposed taxation is to be put on a few shoulders, whereas it should, so far as that can be devised, be put on all shoulders. their share in sending their sons to the In my opinion, that is war ? doing their share in that, too.

I do not take that view in disber's friends say that direct taxation is passed on to the people. We may have to alter our taxation, direct or indirect, is to settle down on the bedrock value, that is, on the value of human labour.

Some things are difficult to locate, It is and others are easy to locate. Part of fche land tax will be passed on, and part of it will not.

L et us consider the probate duties. I do not think that the Prime Minister realizes how heavily they will h it certain interests. It looks like a 25 per cent. tas. between the Commonwealth and the States, but it is really a 35 per cent, tax in some cases. Let me state a case beyond the possibility of quibble or doubt, one that has been decided in tlie Courts of Australia, and by the taxation commissioners. If a man living in Victoria lends money amounting to £70,000 or upwards on a mortgage on a New South Wales property and dies, duty at the rate of 10 per cent, must be paid to the New South Wales Government, because the property mortgaged is in New South Wales, and the same taxation must be paid in Victoria because the mortgagee was domiciled in Victoria. On the top of these payments comes the Commonwealth tax of 15 per cent. cases, chiefly where mortgages over large city properties or pastoral lands aro concerned, the death rates will be raised to 35 per cent. line their property to one State. notice, a person living in one State advances money on mortgage on property in another State. These advances have facilitated settlement immensely. Many of the wealthy men of New South Wales have thus assisted the development of Queensland, just as Victorians have assisted the development of Riverina. to get over the difliculty. down the house to roast the pig. Obviously the Government intend to make the assessment permanent, because they propose to appoint a Commissioner whose tenure of office will be seven years. The honourable member for Elinders has dealt powerfully with the-land question. Honourable members opposite are responsible for a promise made to the land-owners of Australia that when h it wifch a bad season they would get relief from taxation. Section 66, which was framed largely on the New Zealand and Victorian legislation, holds out nofc only the hope, but the promise, that in times of drought and disaster the Commissioner, with his Board, may forego part or the whole of the tax. It would be bad enough then to say, "" We are nofc going to allow the section to operate this year,"" because this is the first year in which it could generally operate. It is surely worse if , in stead of foregoing part of the tax, a higher tax is imposed. Unless the honourable member in charge of the measure will give the Committee the assurance that within tlie drought-stricken area, which I believe to be very large, there w ill be indulgence shown, there must be considerable reluctance on this side, notwithstanding our desire to furnish the Treasurer wifch a j>roper supply of money, to allow the measure to pass. by the Commissioner under the powers that we propose to confer upon him. the assurance of the Attorney-General that in framing the Estimates consideration was given to these matters, and that Therefore, in certain remissions of taxation in regard to considerable areas of pastoral property have been estimated for. are pretty high. check them, but it is clear that a large In the case I bring under allowance snould be made for the droughtstricken land-owner who is fighting conditions sent by God, for which he is not responsible. If the spirit of leniency is not in the Treasurer and in the Government, their taxation proposals must be looked upon as confiscatory. Eveni n a time of emergency, to take 25 per cent -and , in some cases, 35 per cent -of the value of an estate is confiscation, and vindictive. I have not ascertained the number of persons in Australia on whose estates in a normal year death duties are paid, but .it is comparatively small. There are about 15,200 persons who pay land tax, and you may add 10,000 or 20,000 more as the number that pay probate. Out of the £4,600,000 that is to be raised by the new taxation, £3,000,000 is to be taken from that number. I hope I may be wrong in suggesting a motive, but it looks to me as if honourable members opposite have said, "" L e t us tax fche people vvho do nofc vote for us."" honourable members opposite, and if I have their assurance that I am in error I shall withdraw the statement.

If they do, then I shall reply in the language of John StuartM ill , that "" there is an i m portant branch of expediency called justice. "" The Treasurer did not give the slightest justification for these proposals. Let us look back for a moment at the way in which he submitted them tc us. He gave us no warrant for them. He did not give us any indication that they had been deliberated upon, or that the merits of the proposed taxation had been discussed. The right houorable gentleman simply said, "" It is proposed to levy this taxation,"" and so fa r we have had no justification of it from his lips. The Minister of Trade and Customs did give the Committee an explanation of the reasons prompting the Government in making the Tariff changes, and set out in some instances tlie And distinctly for this probable effects, according to his judgment, of their proposals. But the Treasurer has not given us the slightest in dication that this taxation will sit fairly upon the people on whom it is imposed. He, has not shown us that there is any substratum of justice in the proposals. posals will come before us in the shape of Bills. when it is proposed to increase the taxation of the country by £ 1 per head, as this £4,600,000 proposition clearly means, some explanation should be given in the Budget statement. But they are the Budget statement. statement that we should have an explanation of such proposals. When, in the region of State activities, we found it necessary to impose taxatioii amounting to 2s. per head, we had, so to speak, fco fight for our very lives with the interests that were opposed to it in order fco get it carried into law. A f t er our failure to pass a graduated land tax I proposed a flat tax, amounting to 2s. per head, by way of extra taxation in Victoria, and it took us three months to pass that proposal through the Legisla fcive Assembly. Every part of it was put under the microscope. If the Treasurer imagines that, by the mere assertion that the Cabinet proposes fco do this or fchafc, Honourable members opposite we are ta be deluded into fche belief that we have had an explanation of fche reasons for, and the justice of, their proposals, then he deludes only himself. The effect of both these taxation proposals, direct in character, will be immediate and pronounced upon our brothers in Government in the State Parliaments of Australia. If this levy of £2,000,000 , in respect of probate, is to be kept on, it means that the probate duties of the States must come off, or that a sense of deep injustice must grow up in the bosoms of the classes affected.",28,Robert Best We Cannot Get Sir Williamirvine W H A T Is Drag

The Prime Minister and tlie other Labour leaders in the Australian party have accepted the same view as to the restriction of public borrowing until now; and I do nofc blame them for saying that this is fche time to borrow-that we musfc depart from our old accepted policy of prudence, because we are at war and cannot gefc revenue as we could under the old conditions of flourishing in ifc; at any rate, it is worthy of emphasis. dustries w i th ample employment.

288,Mr Watt,"I must have overlookedOn the contrary, it may be said that he made darkness visible. Yesterday, however, he made what he regarded as a clear statement about the loan from the Mother Country and its relation to the Australian loan. Let us look at the right honourable gentleman's original statement. He had dealt with the Imperial loan, which is to come to us from the 15th December this year at the rate of £1,500,000 per month, reaching a total of £18,000,000 by December next year, and he went on to sayAssociated with tliat transaction was an agreement made with the Associated Banks whereby they should give to the Commonwealth £10,000,000 in gold for Australian notes. In undertaking this financial transaction, I impressed upon the banks' representatives that, as Treasurer, I should require their assistance, und they, recognising the national emergency, -cheerfully agreed to render the Government -every possible aid in their power. It should be clearly understood that the £10,000,000 advanced by the banks w ill be redeemed at the -close of thc tvar. These arrangements made it possible for the -Commonwealth to make available to the States, -at a low rate of interest, having regard to the state of the inoney market, a sum equal to thu amount the Commonwealth itself had borrowed from the British Government. -the right honourable gentleman has said yesterday. He dealt with the £18,000,000 proposition, £10,000,000 to be lent locally, and said that, because the Government-had raised the £10,000,000 they would be able to give tlie States £18,000,000. tleman says "" Yes,"" and he evidently has in his mind some internal conclusion that he has not made clear to the Committee. I have no desire to be querulous or quarrelsome in regard to this matter. I think that Australia is extremely lucky to get so large an Imperial loan, and, whatever Government may be in power, to have bankers with so much public spirit as to meet the Treasurer in the way they have. But while acknowledging that, why cannot we be clear to one another as to how all these transactions are to be carried out 1 I am convincedfchatnothing is lost by frankness. . ness. is taking place, and see if I am right. Already this question has been discussed -almost ad nauseam, though in a very illuminating way, by many of the speakers. A sum of £10,000,000 is not equivalent to £18,000,000, and the Prime Minister has to find the difference of £8,000,000. We are borrowing £18,000,000 from the Imperial Government for war purposes, and we have exchanged £10,000,000 in Commonwealth notes for £10,000,000 in gold from the banks, and the Government have promised the States £18,000,000. How is this going to be done? If the loan to the States is paid wifch the £10,000,000 i u gold, then that is all that can be done as the result of fche transaction with the banks. If it is paid altogether in paper it will be £18,000,000 in paper against £10,000,000 of gold reserve stored. gold and partly i h paper, that will mean a substantial, although a less increase, in fche note issue. paper. able gentleman w ill not mind the suggestion, but I take it that he desires liberty and then with the to conduct this transaction to the final stajre without being bound down to pay in gold or paper.

I believe the note issue is going to be much larger than was expected when war broke out, and I do not think any of us can name the final maximum to be issued or circulated-and they are two different features-by the time the war is over. I am prepared fco give the Treasurer the fullest trust, assuming that his judgment And honour are equal to the great responsibilities that confront h i m .

If we get this money without interest, we have no right to collect interest when we pass it on to the States, other than a charge for doing the business. Eveni f , as the broker, the Prime Minister took 1 per cent., he would be getting more than any other broker gets in a transaction of the kind, but if he takes the whole of the 4 per cent., I say he is charging a very high commission indeed for his services. nothing. the right honourable gentleman with malfeasance in connection with money he may handle in the public interest. I have nob suggested that, and never will. If the time comes when a man in power is guilty of such an action, the people of Australia will seek him out, and remove him from office. But I am speaking of transactions as between Government and Government, and as between Commonwealth and State, and I say that the Commonwealth should not charge the States interest if we have not to pay interest. The private banks, whioh have arranged this matter, deserve that strong praise which the right honourable gentleman gave them. They have met the situation in a public-spirited and far-seeing way, which w ill bid fair to strengthen the financial resource^ of all parts of Australia. But I ask the Prime Minister what part was played in this transaction by the Commonwealth Bank. How much money is that institution putting up ? We have been told that the 'Commonwealth Bank is the financial saviour of the country; how much of that Bank's money, I ask, is included in this £10,000,000? I do not believe that the Bank has put up a solitary penny. If the Bank is all that it has been claimed to be-if it is the central pole in the tent of Australian finance, and the chief supporker of our credit-wh y did. it not or wanize the movement? I venture to say that the men who have saved the situation are tliose who handle the private means of the country, the directors and managers of the big private financial conI am speaking from obcerns, and it speaks of the ineffable weakness and impotence of the Commonwealth institution that, at the first call made by the Commonwealth for aid in a time of Turning away from jokes, the difficulty, the weakest of all the financialinstitutions which have responded is the one of the Commonwealth's own creation. That fact speaks its own condemnation of the men who launched the Bank, as well as of those who are in charge of it . An honourable member asks how long it is since the Bank was launched. It started operations in this Statei n June, 1912, and it has control of £18,000,000. Bub fchere were men on the platforms during the recenfc election contest -and I introduce this phase of my argument with some reluctance, because I do nofc desire to give a party colour to my criticismI , personally, will get who said thafc this Bank saved the country. I did not mind them talking to the I am not one to charge poor, deluded electors iu the country in that way, but when they openly«and blatantly blurt oufc such fallacies in fchis House, I can hardly believe my own hearing. Here is the actual test of what fche Commonwealth Bank has done: fche private banks have put their money up to the extent of £10,000,000 worth of gold; how much has the Commonwealth Bank put up? Whateverf a u l t or weakness there be in the Bank, lies in the wrong conception of fche institution which was in the minds of its creators, a wrong conception, which has been corrected only in one respect, as the BankingB ill shows, viz., that tlie Government would enlarge the institution in some ways, but would not enlarge it to the extent of taking away fchat spirit of open hostility which exists towards ifc amongst most of the governmental forces of Australia. I ask the Prime Minister to consider thafc as an additional reason why this Bank should not take its place at the heel of the private corporations, but, in any future emergency, should be the bell-wether of the whole flock, and lead them on fco wherever the governing forces of the country think they should go.

Whafc more scathing condemnation of the present system of land ownership could be advanced than the fact thafc fchere is such a distribution of the valuable land of Australia that 600 persons own half of it? This is in itself amply sufficient to justify a system of taxation that aims at a better and wider distribution of the lands of the Commonwealth.

Beyond seizing upon the point that fche Treasurer's statement declared that ""the expectations from this source of revenue would be £2,000,000 instead of £1,000,000, the honourable member's criticism was irrelevant. pretended to find confirmation of fche charge thafc this tax is intended fco be permanent in a clause of the Assessment B ill . But his attempt to do so must f a i l . The explanation of. the language of tlie clause is simple. His contention, which he supported by a reference to this clause, is not supported by the facts.

We are not committed fco fche appointment of a separate Commissioner, nor is the verbiage of the provision to be taken as indicating the length of time for which the tax will be imposed.

It is an expedient for raising revenue, and I venture to say thafc ifc is a form of taxation to which every Government has the right fco resort, and which is amply justified in our present circumstances. The honourable gentleman spoke of the taxation proposals of the Government generally as class taxation. He said thafc we had given preference of employment' to those who voted for us, and now proposed to repay their patriotic services still further by exempting them from taxation. There is no truth in such a charge. In my opinion, the basis of That a few true civic government rests upon taxation levied in proportion to the ability to pay. How has that canon of fair taxation been violated in the present proposals ? Upon whom does the present war press most hardly ? While the rich may be affected the poor feel it much more severely. Thousands of persons are unemployed because of the war, and, in the nature of things,unable to contribute fco the fiscal needs of . the country. Thousands more are employed for only part of their time. In framing a scheme of taxation facta like these must be borne in mind. This scheme of taxation distributes the burdens fairly over the community. It does not press upon tlie rich wifch undue severity. If we compare our Budget with that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it will be seen that the burden imposed on our wealthy classes is light compared with thafc on wealth in Great Britain.

If I may say so without offence, The State indirect taxation the argument of the honourable member for Plinders went round about the subject and led nowhere. It gave us no help at all.

Where paper merely takes tlie place of gold, and the gold is retired, then you are in a perfectly safe position. You may, and probably w ill be, in a country like this, safe far beyond that point, but how far, experience alone will teach us. Some honourable members speak of our position as if we were spinning on the tight-rope of fate, and were in im minent danger of disaster-as if we had no control of it and should have no opportunity to deal with it whenever occasion arose. the Treasurer and the Parliament have at their command with the situation if at any time it should become necessary. position is admittedly normalI speak of I clo not deny that; it being normal in an abnormal timeand no trouble can arise except as the result of alarmist, grossly inaccurate, and misleading statements such as were published over the name of Mr Brookes in a magazine this month.

I shall leave Our note issue rests upon the position in regard to the note issue The with the remark that at the present time there can be no danger of depreciationScotsince it is not an inconvertible issue. As to the notes held by the banks, the understanding is that the banks will not present these to the Treasury; but that is the only obligation; the issue, therefore, is wholly convertible. As to the future prospects, the £8,000,000 now in circulation and the,£10,000,000 to ba circulated, will result probably in £15,000,000 of notes being held by the T h a t is not currency. banks, and £15,000,000 of notes being It is credit. held by the public, that, I am assured, being about the distribution of the whole note issue. We therefore have a state of affairs where, £15,000,000 being in circulation and the whole issue legally convertible, there clearly can be no depreciation. It is an axiom of paper currency that depreciation cannot occur where the currency is convertible, for the holders of notes can convert them into gold whenever they please. No one denies that note holders will be able to obtain gold for notes presented, and there is thus a safeguard, complete and satisfactory, for cur paper currency. I come now to another point to which I desire to refer briefly. The honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Balaclava both dropped some hints as to what we ought to clo at the present time. The honourable member for Balaclava was even more As a matter of fact, vague than the honourable member for Flinders, who, after depicting a state of means to deal affairs little short of chaotic, said that the way out was to borrow money openly ancl The present honestly in the open market, and to pay interest upon it .

But there is no virtue in interest per se. Although it is, unfortunately, axiomatic in this commercial world of ours that money cannot bo obtained without interest being paid on it . stroyed that axiom by this £10,000,000 transaction. making was that it is not by paying interest that one insures financial stability. that we should borrow money in the open market and pay interest-an y interest, no matter how high-for it. The true remedy for these troublous times, however, according to the honourable member, is to reduce our standard of living. Both rich and poor, he declares, are indulging in extravagance. We must, he says, readjust our outlook. We must live within our means. It is easy at this time almost impossible to borrow money in to make a statement of that sort, which involves a gospel of destruction and ruin. The honourable member for Flinders said I do not for one moment preach the gospel of extravagance, but it is very easy to see that a policy of retrenchment at the present time would spell absolute disaster to Australia. If there is one thing more than another that the country wants at the present time it is a vigorous one, and we should pursue it until it is public works policy. It requires the exproved to be unsound. penditure of public and private money, the one postulate only being that both public and private expenditure shall be for remunerative and proper purposes.

By this action alone it has enabled the public works policy of Australia to be carried on. It has kept hundreds of thousands of menI say this deliberately-in employment. The great army of public servants would have all been affected but for our policy in this vitally important The honourable member says matter. But this by no means discharges all our obligations. We have now to carry out a public works policy of our own. This necessarily involves very large commitments. But the question must be faced. The necessary money must be obtained.

We have a right to expect something more from our opponents than mere destructive criticism varied with ademic dissertations upon the dangers of a note issue. member for Flinders means anything he means that the Government should retrench the Public Service, reduce their salaries, and, in short, inaugurate one of those dark and melancholy eras which with some honourable members sitting opposite. Our idea of what is proper at this juncture is quite different. We hope to weather this storm, carrying on to the best of our ability, retrenching nowhere, and using what money we are able to obtain for the purpose of developing the resources of Australia. The provision of a uniform railway gauge, the Murray Biver scheme, and every other means by which employment can be profitably found for the people will have the support of the Government. It is to that policy we are committed, and unti l it can be shown that there is any rational statesman-like directed against the Government must f a i l. We have imposed taxation only because there are no other means whereby we could finance the requirements of the Government. The proposals are in themselves equitable; they bear as fairly as possible upon all sections of the community, and, I venture to say, w ill stand the test of time. being confessedly a war Budget, and the occasion being very exceptional and criti cal, one needs no excuse for trespassing upon this subject, which is rightly regarded as being at the basis of Government, even after such excellent discourses from those who have addressed the Committee up to the present time. I think I ought to touch on some matters such as the note issue; and I shall endeavour, as much as possible, to approach the questions from a point of view that has not been directly, at all events, taken by previous speakers. We ought all, I think, whatever may be our differences as regards method, to be deeply conscious of the fact that we are absolutely capable of f u l filling the fullest obligations that the war may impose on us. A t the same time, we ought to consider matters in the additional sense that this is a time for caref u l , temperate, and, within the limits of our abilities, wise finance. W it h in tlie last two or three years I have once or actwice urged a word of caution on Treasurers, altogether irrespective of their If the honourable parties; and I may, therefore, be permitted to say a few words regarding what I call the somewhat wasteful management of tlie magnificent resources with which both States and Commonwealth are endowed. I say that we have magnificent are indelibly associated resources, because, tested by any means you like-by production, by savings, by the volume of wages, and the average wages paid-ther e are indications of a prosperity that should deepen our sense of our capacity to meet, as I say, to the f u l l , any obligations that the exceptional times may impose. But I very much doubt if we have practised that economy and wise management of our household which ought to be the highest aim of statesmen in public affairs. Let us look at our position, and review a decade. In 1903 the exports of Australian produce were £45,658,883, and in 1914 they rose to £75,090,147. The total trade in the alternative, the criticism earlier period was £86,061,583, and, in 1913, £158,273,422. This indicates, as I say, very admirable resources. During that period the aggregate revenues of the States increased by £13,892,944, or 48 per cent., the increase being per head as well as absolute. The percentage from public works and ser T vices during that period fell from 63 per cent, to 59.09 per cent.; and it is a matter for the States principally, and to some extent for the Commonwealth, to consider to what extent the lavish expenditure of the last five or six years, both actual and projected, is likely to maintain the good results from our public works"", which up to recent years was perceptible in the state of our finances. No matter how good may be our resources, no matter how prolific the revenue, the expenditure nearly always keeps pace with , if it does not outstrip, the increase. I find that taxation was increased per head and absolutely during the period I have mentioned, the absolute increase being 56 per cent. Let us take an index to the",42,Maloney Oh Public Services But Surely The Commit
351,Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.30],"Thisprosperity of the Commonwealth. Between 1901-2 and 1913-14 there was an increase from £11,296,985 to £21,740,473, while the Customs and Excise revenue during that period rose from £8,189,529 to £14,978,069, or an increase per head from £ 2 3s. 4£d. to £ 3 Is. bid June, 1910-11, and the present time the Treasurers of the Commonwealth have been in a fairly good position. From 1910-11, when the revenue was £1,837,175 more than the estimate up to the present, there has been a substantial surplus every year. The fact is that we t r y to live up to the exceptional bounty of nature, though this season nature has, to some extent, failed us, and we are landed in a position that requires the expedients which have been the subject of keen criticism this afternoon, and to which I shall refer later on. The finances of the States and the Commonwealth for the last eight or ten years-and particularly the finances of the Commonwealth-show , I think, that there has not been displayed to the f u l l the two essentials of sound finance-correctnes s of estimates and providence for the future. Ou this point, speaking in August, 1912, I urged on the Treasurer, when he again had anticipation of a surplus of about £2,200,000 -no t the last big surplus-that the course of international politics might develop events that would cause a severe strain on our acknowledged resources. The object was to impress the Treasurer for the time being with the necessity for creating a capital fund out of those exceptional and unexpected surpluses; first, for public works expenditure, secondly, to provide for such a crisis as has now come upon us. Honourable members may remember that the present Prime Minister has declared, in every one of his Budget-speeches for three years, that he intended to bring his expenditure, approximately, up to the level of liis revenue. The expenditure has proved less, and the revenue much more, than his Estimates; and it was, therefore, by circumstances rather than what I may call foresight and prudence f h a t he was enabled to hand over to his successor the surplus of about £2,640,000, of which we have heard so much. I may be excused making the following quotation from my remarks on 21st August, 1912But we must remember that if , through any disturbance arising between nations, tliis Mr Glynn. prosperity receives a sudden or sustained check, it will be found very difficult to withstand the strain. I again say that the Imin the total revenue perial prosperity is exceptional, and the same may be said about our own. Should war arise, then the test of our capacity to meet our responsibilities will be applied. War, we know, is always wasteful; and, on one side at least, is generally wanton. At the same time, we are Between proud to feel that the -Empire makes for peace; but the maintenance of peace depends on conditions and circumstances which we ourselves cannot prescribe or control. Even if the issue of peace or war did lie with the Imperial clioice, we must recognise the fact that, at any time, the incapacity, haste, blundering, or petulance of a Foreign Minister may precipitate a crisis big with the fate of nations. Under the circumstances, it is, perhaps, excusable in me to draw attention to the question wliether we have made the best use of the bounty of nature, and of the wonderful resources we have in Australia. I do not wish for a moment to contribute anything towards a spirit of despondency or pessimism. We ought to be optimists here; and the Treasurer has very properly taken that view, altogether apart from the question whether particular financial arrangements are justified, in the Budget he presented a few nights ago. Buti t is a source of confidence and in spiration to find, as the Budget-papers disclose, that while the State public debts are £302,000,000, tlie investments of the Statesi n public works are £293,741,000. The point, however, that I should like to emphasize is that we have a very large expenditure, both Commonwealth and State, even in normal times of peace. The ordinary expenditure of the Commonwealth for 1913-14, as shown in the Budand, get-papers, was £23,161,327; and if we deduct the amounts paid to the States, including the grant to Tasmania, there is shown a net expenditure of £16,S78,32S. The expenditure of the States is about £45,000,000, which gives a total expenditure, States and Commonwealth, of £61,878,328. If we deduct from this about £15,000,000 expended on railways and other public works-becaus e from these there are a revenue and service as a set-off-w e have, for a population of a little under 5,000,000, a total expenditure of £46,664,136, Commonwealth and States. I pledge my f a it h , at all events, to the desirableness of making the very best of the resources with which we are gifted. If in the past surpluses, instead of being made the measure of put into a Trust Fund, as they could have been by law, during the last four or five years, it is probable that we would now have had, perhaps, £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 to our credit to enable us to do some of the financing that is engaging our attention to-day. with some of the new proposals, thei'e are a few matters connected with exports and imports to which I should like to draw attention. Much has been said in regard to Free Trade and Protection, and this is nofc fche time to discuss fche merits of the question, either in the abstract or in relation to particular T a r if f s; but, as to exports and imports, I should like to quote a summary of the opinion of Sir Robert Giffen, as expressed after very careful examination of the trend of British trade, and the change in the comparative proportions of British exportsthat is, the proportions in relation to commodities. Sir Robert Giffen saysI t is not true that imports of any kind disparatively low estimate, £8,000,000, makplace home production, because what competition may displace in one direction is compensated by a .demand in another direction, and by the greater profit of the community from buying in the best market as compared with the purchase of the dearer article from the weaker home competitors, and it is not true that investments at home, other things equal, aro better than investments abroad. I only desire to point out that very great statistical authorities take, perhaps, an extreme view opposite to that which seems to be the prevailing one; at all events, with honourable members on both sides at the present time. While stating these generalities, I do not for one moment wish it to be understood that there is not an opening here, in connection with the finances, for compromise in relation to principle, because our position is not exactly that of Great Britain in regard to external trade. it is just as well that we should not altogether overlook some of those economic generalizations which may have to be dealt with later on. As to exports, I very much doubt whether, even w it h the provision now being made, we shall be able to finance to the extent that is expedient, during the next year. The Treasurer last night gave us some figures which I have uot had an opportunity to examine, but I made an estimate myself-and ifc is based on some figures considered by a competent financial authorityincreased expenditure, had been which shows that ifc is probable that there will be a shrinkage in our exports during fche present financial year of at least £30,000,000 sterling. much. Before dealing able member tiie leading lines, and I have taken off a considerable discount, to be on the safe side. The production of wool is about £26,000,000, but it is said that we shall not he able to sell at least £10,000,000 worth of that. Our wool is of the fine class, which at present is not in demand to fche same extent as fche coarser fibres for army clothing. ' For that reason, I am advised that within the next ten months it is almost certain that afc least £10,000,000 worth of the wool production will not be got r i d of. Other items are concentrates, £5,000,000; silver, £2,000,000; hides, £4,500,000; lead, £1,500,000; meat, £4,000,000; copper, £3,500,000; tallow, £1,500,000; pearls, £500,000; and grain and flour, at a coming fche total shrinkage in our exports £40,500,000. Assuming thafc that total is to some extent wrong, the shrinkage in exports during the year may be safely estimated at approximately £30,000,000. Ifc is true that in Australia, as everywhere else, exports and imports approximately balance on the average of years, and they did fairly well balance last year. That does not mean that fche products of a particular year balance the imports, because specie has sometimes fco be sent to complete the balance. Generally, it may be said also that the banks finance the imports; they make purchases or advances upon which payments for imports are subsequently rendered possible, especially in the United Kingdom. The position of the banks is that they will only have had during this year, assuming However, their coin is not diminished, about £24,000,000 upon which to operate their credit and to finance any exchanges that may be necessary outside the limits of Australia, because the Commonwealth is to take £10,000,000 out of the £34,000,000, which is the balance at the credit of the banks, and v/hich was ample for all purposes of solvency. I believe the idea is that £10,000,000 worth of gold is to be exchanged for notes of a similar amount which are to be held by the banks in the same way as the gold certificates are held in America, and to some extent",43,Maloney Oh Public Services But Surely The Commit

On fche 1st November, 1910, the note issue came into force. The bank circulation was then about In my opinion, the £4,291,000, in addition to which there was the circulation of Queensland, which was a State issue. The total circulation afc fchafc date may be estimated afc about £5,000,000. Bufc fche circulation of the I banks varies from month to month, so the Prime Minister to say thafc the actual circulation would be about £4,300,000, and honourable members know but if they are not held by that there was a tax of 2 per cent, on fchat circulation. Adding the profits of Australia, unlike Great Britain, the Queensland State issue, fche States were then getting about £93,000 a year from the note issue. The average issue of Australian notes, during fche I understand that the financial year ended 30th June, 1914, was £9,500,000. On that amount the in terest earned was £ 2 1 0 , 2 8 5 ; the cost was of which £10,500,000 is to £27,754, so thafc fche net profit was during £182,531 . A tax of 3 per cent, would Therenot have stopped the issue before the adding Treasury-bills to the Commonwealth took the issue upon itself; indeed, I believe that, afc the present were not paying time, the banks could stand a tax of 4 over to the States, we per cent, without any appreciable shrinkage in their issue. What the States were then able to do if they wanted more But as fche States are to receive revenue from the note issue was simply from month to month, fco increase the tax. The Commonwealth banks are going to provide Treasurer has gone fco the f u l l l i m it that for some purpose that may he can go, bufc fche States had in reserve a power of taxation which would not have been excessive afc 3 per cent., and which would have cost them nothing, because there was practically no machinery reposition in regard to the quired to collect the tax.

What taxation paper currency will stand will depend always on the circumstances of the moment. A t one time there was, in one of Attorneythe States, a tax of 3 per cent., £30,000,000, and it did not affect the proportion of notes in circulation' to the rest of fche currency.

355,Mr Glynn,"The Government asposed on a circulation of £5,000,000. The result would have been £150,000 on tlie banks' circulation, in addition to which there would have been the profit on the Queensland issue, which may be reckoned at the comparatively small sum of £40,000. We thus get a total profit of £190,000, as against the profit of £182,000 made by the Commonwealth note issue during the last twelve months. We would have had this great advantage also, .tliat the automatic adjustment of the volume of the note issue, which is always determined by the general demand and exchange, would have gone on, and the banks would have been able to finance more easily in these difficult times tion in Australia, the worse tilings will than they can to-day. They could have placed notes in all their branches, and only when they were issued would the tax apply, so that they would not have lost any interest on them. While getting as good a profit, the actual accommodation for the needs of commerce would, on the whole, have been better than under the somewhat artificial method which is now being arranged. had the same confidence in those notes as in the Commonwealth issue 1 remind the honourable member that the note issue is a first charge on the assets of the bank, and even if the banks sold their landed assets alone, they would have realized more than double the value of the issue. As a matter of fact, the banks, about two months ago, had current liabilities-that is, deposits on demand and current £76,000,000, which were covered by £36,000,000 in gold, besides a fairly large amount lying at demand in the United Kingdom. Besides, there were their general assets. So that there was no shadow of doubt about the ultimate solvency of the banks' note issue, and I would say solvency for every other purpose of the banks at the time the note issue was taken over. Everything depends upon convertibility, no matter what we do, no matter how we t r y to increase our issue. HereI come to the point touched on by tlie honourable member for Richmond by interjection, that, as long as the note is convertible, the volume of circulation depends on the general needs of commerce, and not upon any idea of forcing the note issue. We find that, with a limited emergency but convertible issue, the financial credit of Great Britain is to-day as great as it was before the war, whereas we have only to look at the New York exchanges to see that Austrian and German notes or securities, durinqr this war, have been at a large discount, while, for purposes of exchange, Bank of England notes were actually at a premium. As the Economist said on 25th July, before the question of the war might have effected people's judgmentAll our international currency to-day is a cheque drawn against bank deposits, and it is the only form of currency which entails no strain at all upon the inoney market. The mere that we depart from that posigradually become. We must guard against creating a state of affairs in which a weak Treasurer may make the note issue inconvertible. If , under convertible conditions, we increase the volume of the note issue even temporarily beyond a certain figure, and private persons who hold notes come to the Treasury for gold, and the gold retained in reserve is but little, the time must come when the reserve w ill f a l l below 25 per cent., or conversion must cease. While the circulation among the public for the last financial year was only £5,000,000 the note issue was about I think so. I would £10,000,00Q, indicating at once the great difference between a note issue of £30,000,000, of which half would be in the banks, and a normal circulation of £5,000,000. W it h the circulation that the Treasurer thinks he will get, when people come to the exchequer to exchange their notes for gold, as they will come, because we cannot nrevent them, if we account-amountin g to do not have the cover which is necessary against the issue, we must reach the point afc which the Treasurer must say that he cannot pay out gold. will depreciate. what the Treasurer now intends, but what is likely to occur, and what we should do to meet such a contingency. The note issue for December is given at something just below £17,000,000. I think that the banks hold about £8,000,000, leaving a circulation of about £8,888,637. A tax of 2 per cent, on that circulation, assuming it to be the normal circulation, would yield £177,780; a tax of 3 per cent, would yield £266,670 ; and a tax of 4 per cent, would yield £355,560, indicating that there is no profit in connection",46,Maloney Oh Public Services But Surely The Commit

It ought, therefore, to be regarded as a war tax, and ought to have had a provision for automatic expiration in a definite time, unless renewed by Parliament. other way is the wrong way to do it . All these war taxes ought to be temporary taxes, and expire with the financial year, subject to their being renewed. A great many of the British taxes expire every year, and operate again under the FinanceA c t ; but Parliament does not lose its vigilance, its power of observing what goes on, so long as it has to sanction the exceptional expenditure.

Referring to some extreme proposals in relation to taxation, he saysTho savages described by Montesquieu who, to got at the fruit, cut down the tree, are about as good financiers as the advocates of tlii3 kind of tax. Of course that is put with a certain amount of excess, but it is very difficult even amongst philosophers to strike the golden mean. it is true of personal property, although it is not true of land, that if you push the progressive principle beyond limits there will be a most marked tendency for the property to shift from the area of the tax's operation. Let us see what fche land tax proposals amount to. I believe fchat we could obtain fche revenue required by land taxation of much less harshness in its incidence than the present, and which would be quite as true to the economic theories of some of those who favour the land tax-and professedly there are a good many on both sides of the House who believe in a fair land tax. The Commonwealth tax produces at present about £1,386,000, and I think the State taxes bring in about £586,000, so that it may be said that nearly £2,000,000 is produced annually, It goes up to 12J per on the latest available figures, by thismeans. Our tax is pretty differential. I think it is only un According to the report of the Commissioner which was presented about twelve This months ago, about 14,000 persons now pay land fcax, and 16,500 -persons who do not possess estates liable to taxation have to make returns, making in all about 30,500 persons possessing property of a value above £3,000, of whom less Any than half are taxed. The total unimproved valuation of alienated land is about £600,000,000. When the matter was last under discussion it was stated that the amount paid to the Crownf o r fche fee-simple of the land was about £123,000,000. You might impose a progressive land tax, with the same economic end in view, but apply it in a much milder way. Deducting the £123,000,000 paid to the Crown for the fee-simple of the land from the McCulloch, dealing with pro£600,000,000 afc which the land is valued, you gefc an assessment of £477,000,000, on which a tax of I d . would return nearly £2,000,000 per annum, or about the amount which is returned by the progressive land tax of the Commonwealtli and fche taxation of the States. out all exemptions. opinions, we must endeavour to find some solid ground of compromise, and no man can be considered inconsistent who modifies his views to obtain the nearest approach to what is possible and reasonable. This involves an exemption per acre. A tax of 2d. i u the £ 1 on £477,000,000 There is no doubt that would return £3,974,000. Such a tax would be fairer, and, perhaps, more consistent wifch the principles of the Labour certain party than the present tax, while it would be far less unjust in its progressive incidence, attaining the end of subdivision by more reasonable and moderate means. We should nofc attempt to force subdivision too quickly, or we may cause ruin to many people. There is, therefore, a method of land taxation, with which, modified, it may be, to strike that healthy mean to which I have referred, a good many Liberals would sympathize fco a great extent, which is capable of realizing all the revenue required, and of giving the same economic results that are now aimed at, while being less harsh in its effects.

I do not think that there could be a much fairer means of providing for war expenditure than by the imposition of an income t a x ; but we should face the obligations which may, perhaps, be incurred within a year by providing for repayment over ten or fifteen years. The people cannot be asked to provide the whole of the money in one year. If the revenue were to continue as expansive as it has been, a good deal of the expenditure might be provided for in that way, but reasonable financing of the obligation would apportion its incidence over a number of years. sion in taxation or we cannot borrow. We may borrow to cover the immediate obligation, whether it be £10,000,000 or £30,000,000, but we must spread the repayment over a number of years, and the taxation should be so adjusted as to do that. I believe that that is the principle which has been, in the main, followed in Great Britain. America imposed an income tax for war in 1872, having then achieved its end. tax, which was held, to be unconstitutional, but about twelve months ago they commenced to tax incomes running up from £2,000 to £30,000 a year, and also imposed a special corporation tax, from which a revenue of £14,000,000 was anticipated. might not, without increasing the burden on the people, re-adjust some of our revenue duties. Personally, I do not think that the abolition of the duty on tea has given the public the benefit that was hoped for, because, in the main, it is lowpriced teas that are imported into Australia. I do not think that the public would grumble much at having to pay £400,000 or £500,000 in a tea tax in conjunction with an income tax. We might re-adjust other Tariff items in a way which would not burden the, masses, who are now paying pretty heavily per head in Customs taxation, and would give a good return to the Treasurer. This is a war Budget, and we ought to be prepared to cheerfully submit to the obligations that it may impose. Although war is a grim affair, productive of more I cannot speak for my suffering and distress than can be realized with our imperfect sympathies, it has its moral compensations. I do not refer to its effect in tightening the moral fibre, and in preventing that softness of mind which too often occurs during prolonged periods of peace and prosperity. But with regard to its effect on our international reputation ancl our Imperial solidarity there are moral compensations involved which ought to make us submit with comparative cheerfulness to the exceptional imposts that are being levied. I do not tliink that Great Britain ever stood in a better light before the nations of the world than she does at the present time. Whatever doubts may have been entertained by those who knew her little, or We must make provisaw her only, perhaps, in the false perspective of German historians like Treitschke, were, I think, removed by her diplomacy before the war broke out, by her recognition and acceptance of the obligations of honour and all that they entailed when diplomacy failed, and hy the valour and effectiveness of her armies in the field.

They have asked what it has done. They previously predicted its failure, and now say the other banks could have carried Oil. without it. I endorse every word the Prime Minister has said as to the cordial action of the various banks in assisting to ward off the terrible times that may occur here. I recognise their splendid courtesy in co-operating with the Commonwealth Government; and I thus repeat to-night what I said in the Banking Institute in Melbourne, at a lecture by Mr also a history extending over a century, Williams, the managing director of the London Bank, upon the various national banks iu the United States of America, with particular reference to the efforts which they have made to bring about a sound system of American finance. Let us examine the balance-sheet of the CommonAvealth Bank. I challenge any honourable member to deny the figures I purpose to quote. The Commonwealth Bank was founded on the 16th July, 1912, with not a penny-piece in the safe, and nothing behind it but the splendid security of the Commonwealth, and the knowledge that every hill, valley, river, and dale of our magnificent territory guaranteed its security. Without credit, of course, no banking system in the world can be established, On 30th June last, after it had been in existence for less than two years, the Commonwealth Bank had, in coin, bullion, and cash balances, £2,670,000. Can any bank point to such an achievement within the same short space of time? I think not. Unlike the honourable member for Flinders, I do not propose to invade the realms of fancy. In order to place before honourable members some interesting figures bearing on this question, I have collected the balance-sheets of the leading banks in the world as put before the Banking Commission of the United States of America. That Commission consisted of the most important business men in the United States of America, who were purposely selected to obtain for the guidance of Congress the fullest information in regard to banking matters. It took, not hearsay evidence, but the direct evidence of the governor or other leading officer of every great bank in the world. The Governor of the Bank of England, the Chief Director of the Bank of France, and the principal officers of the Eeichsbank of Germany, the Bank of Italy, and the Bank of Russia were among, those examined. According to these balance-sheets-and the report of the Commission from which I quote was published in 1909-10-the Union of London and Smith's Bank Limited, one of the soundest in London at the present time, had cash in hand amounting to £3,009,000 on 30th June, 1908. That bank has a history extending over a century. The London Joint Stock, which is famous throughout the world, and has at that time had a turnover of £109,114,511, and its cash in hand and at the Bank of England amounted to only £2,998,000. After a century of business, it scarcely had as much money in its vaults as the Commonwealth Bank has after being in existence for barely two years. The well-known Union Discount Company of London Limited had cash at bankers amounting to £882,000, and the London and Westminster Bank had cash in hand and at the Bank of England amounting to £4,336,000. at the time? £33,411,000. One of the strongest private banking companies in England toexist, or survive. day is that of Robarts, Lubbock and Company, and its cash in hand and at the Bank of England at the time of which I speak was £776,000. The Commonwealth Bank has a record which, so far as I have been able to ascertain, has never been equalled in this respect. with these other banks in the matter of advances to the public? sure in handing this report to the honourable member, so that he may obtain the information for himself.

It has a capital of £7,044,500, whereas the Commonwealth Bank, when the amending Bill now before Parliament is passed, will have a capital of £10,000,000. So far as I knoAv, the Bank of England is the only institution whose capital will exceed that of the Commonwealth Bank when this Bill is passed. The capital of the Bank of Erance is £7,044,500. In this respect it is surpassed by the Credit Lyonnais, which has a capital of £9,650,000, and by the Credit Foncier, which has a capital of £7.720,000. The gold and bullion held by the Bank of France at the time of the issue of this report stood at £139,552,499. The Reichsbank of Germany is also a private institution, and it has a capital of lia, seven; Tasmania, seven; and the £S,56S,000. Its gold and bullion, plus silver £2,500,000, amounted, according to this report, to £33,526,160, and its balance sheet totals £246,000,000. shows a much bigger reserve. were many changes leading up to the war. This report was published in 1909-10, and the balance-sheet of the Bank of England published in it is dated 12th August, 1908. has the largest paid-up capital in the world, and on the date named had gold and bullion amounting to £36,000,000, and its balance-sheet totalled £121,000,000. The Bank of Italy has a capital of £9,600,000. Its total gold currency is £37,000,000; silver, £4,000,000; and cash and coin of other nations, £400,000; or a total of £42,400,000. Its balance-sheet totals £88,000,000. I did not fully complete my reading in connection with the Imperial Bank of Russia; but I found that, it has £102,000,000 in gold. I have made the note that not one bank about which I can obtain any information has more capital than the Commonwealth Bank will have, with the exception of the Bank of England. In Germany there are two banks, one of which has an equal amount, and one of which has something more than the Reichsbank capital of £8,568,000. There is the Dresdner Bank, which has a capital of £8,56S,000. It has a gold reserve of only £2,353,194, or less than the Commonwealth Bank has at present in its safe. The Deutsche Bank has a capital of £9,520,000. Its cash and foreign money totals £4,104,456. It may interest honourable members to learn the number of banks operating in the United States of America. There are 23,937 banks in that country. That may appear, at first sight, to be a large number; but it is not really so. We have a population of only 5,000,000 in the Commonwealth, and yet we have a total of seventy hanks of issue. A bank in a differeut State is counted as a separate bank, even though the head office might be established in one State. New South Wales has seventeen banks, which may be called cheque banks, to distinguish them; Victoria, sixteen; Queensland, twelve; South Australia, nine; Western AustraNorthern Territory, two; or a total of representing something* like seventy. There are really twenty-four banks which are known as cheque-paying banks. The number of the branches of these banks are-In New South Wales, Reichsbank now 654; Victoria, 676; Queensland, 309; South Austi'alia, 257; Western Australia, 180; Tasmania, 60; the Northern Territory, 2; or a total of 2,138. When Ave remember that the United States of America has nearly tAventy times our population, it Avill be seen that 23,937 The Bank of England banks is not an excessive number for that country. Mr Williams, the general manager of the London Bank, whose lecture I had the privilege of hearing, and a copy of Avhich he courteously gave me, that I might give it to my friend, the Prime Minister, stated that in America the system of banking is very different from ours. Speaking by-and-large, though there are some exceptions, the American banks, as a rule, have no branches. Honourable members will recognise that if a bank Avas established in one of the drought-stricken districts of Western Australia, and operated in that district alone, it might easily be ruined as the result of the present adverse conditions ; Avhilst in the case of a large bank like the Bank of NeAv South Wales, with many branches in different parts of the CommonAvealth, it may easily be saved by the operations of branches in more favoured districts. In America banks frequently fail because of adverse con-",51,Maloney Oh Public Services But Surely The Commit

376,Dr. Maloney,"No doubt thereditions in the very limited area of their operation. TJnder the TJnited States of America legislation, country banks were obliged to keep 15 per cent, of their deposits in gold; but they were at liberty to send three-fifths of that reserve to a city bank. turn, were compelled by the law to hold 25 per cent, in gold; but they were at liberty to lodge in the three large central banks at St. Louis, Chicago, and New York 50 per cent, of their gold reserves. When, as the result of adverse conditions in a particular district, people were forced to draw their money from the local honourable gentleman's assistance, and bank, the bank proceeded to draw from the State bank, and the State bank to draw from the central bank, and so a m crisis was brought about. To remedy that state of affairs, the Commission to which I have referred, after a splendid inquiry, recommended the present banking system of the United States of America, which proposes the establishment of from eight to twelve district banks throughout the States. These banks w ill have the power of accepting national banks if they choose, but they cannot compel any bank at present carrying on operations under the law to come in . They can. arrange to keep a smaller amount as a reserve, because the central reserve banks will be guaranteed and supported under certain rules and regulations by the United States Government. To use the words of Mr Williams, this means that we, in Australia, have really arrived in this matter of banking at almost the same stage as the United States at fche present time. Honourable members will agree tliat a large bank, with many branches, has a better chance of keeping afloat; during a time of stress and trouble, like fche present, than a small bank operating on its own in a district thafc mighb be visited wifch a drought or other adverse conditions. One fching fchat struck me forcibly in looking tlirough fche reports and documents was the amount of money that is advanced upon agricultural lands by the Bank of Russia. On the question of the -confidence of the community in banking institutions I am sorry that the honourable member for Balaclava, whose speech greatly interested me, took up the position he did. He appeared to me to support too f u l ly those who are, as a rule, much better able to tide over a time of stress than are those who live by the work of their hands, or b)' their brains, 'if they have to drive a pen for a living. The income tax in Great Britain, in 1913-14, which was collected before war was declared, gave a return of £43,000,000. There was a supertax upon that of These city banks, in their £3,320,000. The honourable inember for Angas will remember that I asked him on one occasion whether he could assist me in trying to ascertain the total amount which would be derived from the duties, taxes, and rates chargeable upon the estate of a man named Morrison who died worth £10,000,000. I tried, with the with the assistance also of the honourable member for Darling Downs, and of the present Attorney-General, to ascertain the amount which would be derived by the Government from such an estate. The difficulties were very great, judging by the number of books which had to be looked up. I found that, from an estate worth £10,000,000, the Government would obtain £3,000,000, which is about 30 per cent, of the value of fche estate. I know that Lloyd George-whe n he came into office there was a 15 per cent, probate duty-brough t the amount payable on an estate of £10,000,000 down to £1,000,000. Let us see what a super tax on an income tax means. An j ' iucome over £5,000 would be subject to the super tax. In addition the taxpayer would pay an income tax of Is. 2d. in the pound, that is over 5 per cent. He would pay 6d. for every pound over £3,000, so that a man with an income of £10,000 would pay Is. 2d. in the pound on that amount; and, in addition to that, he would pay 6d. in the pound on £7,000, or a total sum of £758. We find thafc in that year an income tax of I d . in the pound gave a revenue of £3,130,000. According to a statement in the Argus, on 19th November, 1914', they doubled the income tax. If we multiply the £3,130,000 by 28, representing the 2s. 4d., we shall get a total of £87,640,000. Now, the population of Australia is about 5,000,000, or, speaking roughly, one-ninth of. the population of Great Britain and Ireland. That amount divided by nine would give £9,737,000. If in Australia in fchis time of stress the people had to contribufce an amount equal to that whicli is paid in England they would pay £9,737,000 in one tax alone. That does not mean that England is content with that position. What does Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, say ? His £200,000,000 Budget will he nothing compared to the Budget mitted the income from wealth in 1913 was £2,300,000,000, Napoleon it was only £250,000,000.

""Was there one honourable ou fche other side who would dare to suggest fchafc, if it were put to the vote by initiative aud referendum, the people would not say that those who had most should be taxed most heavily ? nofc. The suggestion, to my mind, is the most pathetic thing thafc can be said in reference to England. nofc, and never was, a Free Trade country.

Any honourable member who realizes thafc the war may last for perhaps a year will understand readily that there will be far more taxes to follow the taxes I have referred to. Will the money be raised by means of an income tax as being one of the most fluid taxes which can be levied ? The amount once settled, a penny is added to the tax, and so on. It is asked in England, we going to have a super tax?"" ing up what fche Imperial have done, I certainly think that the Dr. Maloney. larger incomes oughfc to pay far more than they have done. Surely no one will which will have to be subsay for a moment that it is not more unin 1915.

It is too ridiculous to consider for one times, moment. In war credit is nothing, and in one gold is the only thing that counts. I do member not tliink thafc any honourable member will deny that next to a gold currency a silver currency is besfc. If fchafc be so, why should we not take advantage of the fact that we are one of the great silver-producCertainly ing countries of the world to coin more silver ? I propose to speak on that subject later,, and I hope to prove that we Now, England is are neglecting a great opportunity. By the courtesy of the Prime Minister, I country. hold in my hand a statement which I value very much. I have converted the dollars into gold currency so thafc the in formation will appeal to honourable members better than it would if I were fco speak in . dollars. In the TJnited States people of America there are two varieties of That will affect paper issued. There are ""greenbacks"" Let me of the nominal value of £67,000,000, against which there must be held a gold labourer in Essex, reserve of £30,000,000. A gold certi-' ficate is issued by the Federal GovernFor ment, and gold must be held pound for pound. The sum of £188,000,000 is represented by gold certificates with a similar amount in gold, held in reserve. There is of tea he has £93,000,000 worth of silver certificates, and fche reserve of silver is valued at 45 On half a pint of beer the tax per cent. W it h silver at 2s. per ounce, I think that there must we. produce silver coins of the value of 5s. 6d. If our shillings, sixjsences, and half-crowns were converted into solid metal it would only bring about 30 per A .cent, of the face value of the coins. Then there are Treasury notes guaranteed by a silver currency. Greenbacks and gold certificates are redeemable in gold coin, and silver certificates and Treasury notes in silver dollars. National Bank notes are redeemable in l a w f u l money on demand at the counter of the bank; and "" l a w f u l money,"" I take it , is silver money. They are also redeemable in United States notes on presentation at the Treasury. Every national bank ""Are is required to take and receive at par, for Followany debt of liability to it , the notes of Government other national banks. I may say that the national banks in America are p r i vate concerns, though the designation might lead one to suppose that they are Government institutions. They are called "" national"" banks because they are constituted under an Act passed by the Federal or National Legislature. In Everybody's Magazine, in an article on "" The New Banking,"" under the new Federal BankingA c t , there is the following: At the end of last year the National Banks of the United States among, them had cash on hand (in round figures) of only . . . . $890,000,000. Their aggregate deposits (in round figures) were . . . . $8,300,000,000. That is to say, the depositors were entitled to demand from the bank nine times inore money than the banks had to pay out. This expresses the lending power of a dollar. Tlie cash reserve requirements arc changed. promptly sent for. The letter from Mr. Where a country bank was required to keep IS per eent. before, it will keep only 12i per cent.; where a city bank was required to keep 25, it will keep only 15; and where banks in St. Louis, Chicago, and New York were required to keep 25 per cent., they will keep only 18. We all hope, I am sure, that the Commonwealth Bank w ill ultimately take the place of the national bank system of America in assisting the Australian banks. I propose to show that the note issue of the Commonwealth is,-perhaps, the safest in the whole world, so f a r as security and liquid assets are concerned. First of all, I desire to speak of its pliability and mobility. Time was when there were forty-eight different notes issued by as many banks in the various States; ancl it w ill be remembered that on a note sent from one State to another, in those days, exchange was charged as in the case of cheques. Later on, the banks were good enough to make the notes current, to the great convenience of the public. There is one advantage I find in the 10s. note. My son, for instance, is 35 miles from a post-office, and if I send h i m a post-office order he has to travel that distance in order to get it cashed, whereas, if I send h i m 10s. notes in a registered letter, he is in possession of money i m mediately he receives it . That is an advantage never before enjoyed in the history of Australia. Then again, the security of the notes has been secured in a way never before attained, so f a r as my. reading of the subject goes, in any country in the world. I do not know any bank in which a f u n d is laid aside, ancl cannot be touched except by an Act of Parliament. On the 30th September last I received a letter from the Under-Treasurer, Mr G. T. Allen, who may be complimented on the fact that his name w ill ultimately appear on more bank notes than that of any man in the world. This recalls a story of the celebrated Mr May, Governor of the Bank of England, who, when touring Scotland, offered a cheque : to the hostess of an hotel. The good lady was dubious about the cheque, and asked h i m, "" H o w do I know it is your signature ?"" He got her to produce an English £5 note, and pointed out that his signature also appeared on that. This, however, only convinced the hostess that her guest was a forger, and Mr May had to explain to the police, who were Allen was as follows:In answer to your telephonic request, the following figures are furnished, viz Note Issue .. .. £13.066.966 Gold Eeserve .. .. 6^567^496 Amount invested. . . .. 6,902,500 Interest received, £65S,491, less expenses (£95,065) .. 563,426 Interest earned per annum. . 227,085 Face value of a ton of sovereigns .. .. £127,190 Face value of a ton of silver coin .. .. .. 8,983 Face value of a ton of copper (pence) .. .. .. 448 None of the greatest banks in England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, or any other country have a gold deposit equal to that mentioned in the letter of Mr Allen. I have already pointed out that in the case of the national banks of the United States£ 9 may be advanced for every £ 1 in gold, and that now the amount of gold held as seeurity has been decreased. they had the biggest money crisis in the world, owing to their short reserve. owing to the faulty banking system, which is now being amended in the direction of giving it stability and security of tenure. Against this gold reserve what are the claims? Only the notes that are in circulation. The assets comprise £6,500,000 in gold, balances amounting to £563,000, and an amount of £6,900,000 lent out on gilt-edged securities to the States. Let honourable members look at the assets and liabilities of",52,Maloney Oh Public Services But Surely The Commit

In the time of the big crash following the boom, even the Bank of New South Wales would not give assistance to men who had large amounts on deposit. One man who had a deposit of £800 to his credit asked for £50 and was refused. I went next day to the manager, and he kindly arranged to allow the depositor to draw £ 3 0 on that day and £ 2 0 on the following day; he explained thafc he could nofc do more. What bank has a security equal to that which is comprised by these Australian notes? Let honorable members compare our Bank with the Bank of England, which has such huge amounts at call, ancl at seven days' notice, and they will see that it is wonderful how the institution is able to carry on. Sitting suspended from 6.SO to S p.m. was suspended, I was endeavouring to show that the Commonwealth Bank, during the two years of its existence, has acquired a larger sum in gold than have many of the most powerful banks in the world, and thafc when it has obtained the proposed increased capital of £10,000,000. which it will presently secure by the issue the Barrier mines, it would have a large of debentures or otherwise, it will possess a larger capital than will any national bank in the world, wifch fche exception of the Bank of England, which has a capital of £14,553,000.

As a matter of fact, many offchelarger financial institutions of the world have nofc as much gold in their coffers to-day as has the Comobvious that there would be very little monwealth Bank, after only two years of existence. WhatI propose to show is that this Parliament, if it chooses, can make our Commonwealth notes safer in war time than are the notes of any counshort notice, £3,556,000. try, not excepting those of England. There is no gainsaying the factfchafcthere is no such thing as credit when an in vading army enters a country. If Germany were, unfortunately, to conquer This statement. I am readEngland to-morrow, of what use would be fche notes of the Bank of England? But . by making use of the silver which we produce, we can make our Commonwealth notes absolutely safe. Eveni f an enemy's fleet were to land an army of occupation here, our Commonwealth Bank would be able to offer our citizens a greater chance of having money to plant in their backyards than they would otherwise have. On fche SOth June of this year, silver was sold in fche open market in London for 2s. ner ounce. Now, an ounce of silver will make 5s. 6d. worth of currency. I wrote a letter to the Age pointing this out, and stressing the fact that 175 per cent, profit could be immediately made by minting our own silver. Honorablo members know that, during the past few years, the Commonwealth, which has been minting gold at a slight loss, has been given the privilege of minting its own silver, but that for purposes of expediency our silver has been minted in England at a cost of 5 per cent., including insurance and freight. In view of the large expense involved in the purchase of land, buildings, and machinery in connection with every W h e n the sitting mint, it w ill be seen thafc fche cost of labour must be very small indeed. If we allow 4 per cent, for the minting of silver in Australia, ifc is obvious thafc the extra 25 per cent, would more than pay the wages of the men who would be thus employed. If the Commonwealth would purchase all the silver produced by fund of current coin of ifcs own. In consideration of our embarking upon this enterprise, the BrokenH ill mines should be kept working f u l l time. If they reI n other words, the fused to do thafc, the State of New South Wales, by virtue of the law of eminent domain, should seize those mines, work them, and hand over all profits made to the companies concerned. On the other hand, if the mines were worked at a loss, the companies should suffer. But it is chance of any loss being incurred. The",55,Position Of Note Account At 30th September 1914
379,Dr. Maloney,"letter which I wrote to the Age attracted the attention of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, whose directorate requested me to grant its members an in terview. I did so, and I had the pleasure of meeting MrE . L . Baillieu, who assured me that his company would be only too pleased to accept the terms which I had outlined. that it would be willing to accept even 30 per cent, less than the selling price of silver in London before the declaration of war. In other words, it was prepared to accept Is. 4 4-5d. per ounce for its silver. Honourable members will see that that would allow the Commonwealth to make a profit of 292 per cent, upon the minting of silver. In other words, for every-£l,000,000 worth of notes issued for the purchase of silver won by Australian workers from Australian mines, we sliould get in silver coin £3,928,571, less 4 per cent, for minting. nage of silver in circulation? hand. £8,983. member to know that at the back of our Commonwealth note issue there are 51 tons of minted gold, and that the £10,000,000 loan granted to the Commonwealth by the banks is equivalent to another 70 tons; so that we have 121 tons in gold alone. WhatI propose is that every note of the Commonwealth should be redeemable, 25 per cent, in gold, and 75 per cent, in silver. If an army of occupation came to Australia, every citizen knows that by a regulation it could make all our Commonwealth notes nothing but pieces of tissue paper. In such circumstances, nobody will deny that every citizen would like to have'his savings in hard cash so that he might plant them wherever he deemed them to be safe. Men who have experienced the terrors of war have assured me that at such times they prefer to have small money rather than gold, because it enables them to purchase commodities more easily. scheme, our citizens would be able to get 25 per oent. of the value of their notes in gold, and 75 per cent, in silver. It is significant that many persons entertain a doubt as to the value of notes. connection, I may mention one incident which happened during the boom time here. A shareholder in one of the banks, angry that he had lost a lot of money in [62] them, endeavoured to make use of the un. employed by offering so many men a £ 1 note each, and requesting them to rush round to a certain bank and demand gold for it , his idea being that the institution would not honour its notes. I prevented effect being given to his suggestion, and for my action He further declared received the thanks of the bank. Men have doubted whether notes are of any use; and if we go into some banks and ask for 10s. notes, some of the superfine darlings, which many bank clerks are I was a bank clerk many years ago, and know-wil l curl up their lips at the mention of a 10s. note. Not taking into consideration the £10,000,000 which the splendid partnership of the States and the Commonwealth has placed at the disposal of the community, the £6,500,000 in the coffers of the Treasury on the 30th September last ou a 25 per cent, basis would give us £26,000,000. Of this, of course, £6,500,000 would be ear-marked for the gold and £5,200,000 would be I cannot say offear-marked for silver. We have already The value of a ton of silver is invested £6,992,500, which earns £227,085 It may interest the honourable a year, leaving £7,307,500 for investment, which sliould bring in a further income of £292,300 a year at 4 per cent., giving a total of £519,385, which would be available for a f u n d which could be ear-marked and placed beyond the-reach of any Treasurer except by the passage of a B ill through both Houses. Thus we would have a currency of notes, not necessarily going up to £26,000,000; but how different from any other notes in the world. I believe that the Commonwealth should purchase every ton of copner produced in Australia, and thus enable the mines to be kept going. Owing to tlie superlative richness of our copper lodes, we can produce copper more cheaply bhan any other part of tlie world. We also produce zinc. Why should not a sufficient amount be advanced by the Commonwealth for the purchase of zinc concentrates, so that our silver mines may be kept going ?

There was one man who adopted an English alias, and after taking the oath of fealty, and a further oath as an officer in the Automobile Corps, was found to have been writing treasonable letters; yet the Army and Navy Club-the frills and feathers club in Swanston-street, who expelled a straight man for criticising another-allowe d this traitor to resign. There are too many frills and feathers about that twopenny-halfpenny, tin-pot club. The three colonels who demanded Major Mclnerney's resignation were only mosquito colonels. Not one of them had volunteered, but I am glad to say tliat two of them have now done so. If they are accepted, they will be luckier than I have been, because the authorities would not take me.

I do not want to say a harsh word of Mr Murdoch, who is a good and capable architect in every sense of the word; but he is too much under the thumb of Colonel Miller.

There was-one Minister of Home Affairs who was the first man to have the pluck to introduce preference to unionists, and his name is known throughout Australia, because the previous election was fought on that question. I refer to the honorahle member for Darwin. He required the ofiicers of the Department to sign their names on arriving at the office in the morning; but he was also man enough to sign his own name. Now, however, the present Minister has not the pluck to require Colonel Miller to sign his name. Look at the type of man who says that I am talking rubbish. Why, his very hair stands on end I He is not fit to loose the boots of the honourable member for Darwin, who was the first man to put Colonel Miller in his place. The Department should not be ruled by tliese heads, and I am sick and tired of it. I am credibly informed, and believe, that 3,000 men can be put on the roads at the Federal Capital; but when I asked a question on the subject. I was told that the Departmental Board had charge of. the business. Not one of the members of that Board had the pluck for designs for the Capital; but they got together, and stole a bit of an idea from one plan, another bit from a second plan, and so on, and produced a plan which they called their own. When I asked the Minister a question about the cost of visits to the Federal Capital, I was given a lying answer. There were five separate picnics up there, and I was told that the cost was only £50. I suppose that was rubbish also. A t any rate, He tries to the answer was a lie. an action at law against them for pirating?

The honourable gentleman saidHe hoped to see some comprehensive review and revision of the Tariif on a scientific and business basis. Tlie Tariff was not a question to be treated as if it were one of party politics. True, Protection and Free Trade were party questions; but once they established a fiscal policy for Australia, then the giving effect to that policy should not be a party matter at all. The adjustment of the Tariff was a matter for investigation and adjustment on the merits of each particular item. He admitted that Parliament was not the best instrument to arrive at that information. Whether the Inter-State Commission or some other body should do so was a matter for consideration. But the question should be settled on those lines, having regard to the requirements of the manufacturers, workmen, and consumers, and the public generally. The Minister of Trade and Customs canary and secondary industries in 1912 not dispute that statement. We know from past experience in the framing of Tariffsi n this House that Parliament is not the besfc body to make Tariff investiserve and encourage our primary in gations.

I say that Australia can well be requirements, so far as that can reasonably be done. I have here some figures which will serve to indicate the extent to which we are dependent upon primary productions in this country. In 1912, our agricultural output was valued afc £45,754,000. The output of our pastoral industries was valued at £51,615,000; dairying, £20,280,000; forestry, £6,432,000; or a total of £124,081,000. That sum represents the output of the primary industries referred fco for Here is one year. The output of those in of his views on this dustries has gone on increasing, and the value has mounted up. It is because of the splendid returns we are able to get in the markets of the world for the products of our primary industries that we have been able to pay the high rates of wages which we have paid in all the cities of Australia. Ifc is therefore incumbent upon us, if we wish to maintain, and even to increase, the standard of living in our cities, to do all thafc is possible to encourage and increase the primary productions of Australia, and make ifc easier and cheaper for those engaged in our primary industries to increase their output. The mining industry is another of our primary industries, and its output in 1912 is valued at £25,629,000. The value added to materials used in the factories of Australia in 1912 amounted to £57,022,000. So that the value of the output of our prim amounted to no less than £206,732,000.

But in no cases have the items been investigated as they should have been by the Minister. have boasted of the fair manner in which they are treating the Old Country, and the Tariff on its face -does look as if that cry was well founded. There are preferences of 5 and 10 per -cent, all through, and I am not surprised that one or two leading men outside Parliament, after a superficial glance at the Tariff, have remarked on what a fine thing it is to see Australia giving such a. substantial preference to the Mother Country. I admit that that is the general sentiment of the Australian people. We do desire to give some preference to the TJnited Kingdom, but we wish it to be a substantial preference. We find, however, that in this Tariff the preference, instead of being a real preference to the United Kingdom, is only a preference against other countries, in order to raise extra revenue. In many instances that extra revenue is raised from those who are engaged in primary production, and on the tools of workmen, who, in consequence, will find it more dimcult to earn their livelihood. If these preferences led to an expansion of the industries in the Old Country, one could justify them, but in many instances they are preference duties which the Old Country can never take advantage of, and for that reason they are obviously nothing else but revenue duties. ence has been granted to the United Kingdom on machines that are not made there. details in illustration of what I am saying, but my figures are subject to correction by the Department, because an individual member making his own investigations is naturally liable to err when there are hundreds of items affected, and he has only time to deal with them in a hurried manner. For instance, how nice the preference on pickles looks. The old duty was 6d. and 7$d. The Government have said, ""We had better give the Old Country a preference,"" with the result that the new duties are 6d. and 9d. At the present time the total importation On all those goods there of quarter-pints and smaller is 47,950 dozen, of which 46,127 dozen are already coming from the United Kingdom; so that practically the whole lot, with the exception of about 1,800 dozen, comes from the United KingHonorable members opposite dom at the present time. Obviously the preference cannot operate there. Of halfpints, the total importation is 300,717 dozen, valued at £91,101, and of that total, 291,377 dozen, valued at £88,234, comes from the United Kingdom. Therefore there is only left about 9,000 dozen for the United Kingdom to capture. preference. sounds well to say that we raised this item from 7^d. to 9d., but actually the preference does not mean much. Of pints, the total importation was 96,933 dozen, valued at £37,922, of which 85,388 dozen, valued at £34,202, came from the United Kingdom. Another striking instance is provided by jams and jellies, which hav.i been raised from l^d. and 2d. to 2d. and 3d. The total importation from all countries last year was 453,951 lbs., of a value of £12,213, and of that quantity, 437,463 lbs., worth £11,651, comes from the United Kingdom. Again, preference has been given to the United Kingdom on malt. The importation in 1913 was 34,001 centals from all sources, valued at £31,071, and no less than 30,138 centals, valued at £27,347, came from the United Kingdom. Mustard also is interesting. To make it hot for the foreign country, a preferential duty has been put on that item. The total importation of mustard at present is 886,067 lbs., of which 846,035 lbs. comes from the Uuited Kingdom. In the case of canvas and duck, the value of the present importations is £344,333, of which £304,356 worth comes from the Mother Country. The same anomaly is to be discovered right through a number of these items. We find thai the Government are giving preference upon goods in which the Old Countiy has almost the whole trade at. the present",64,Temporary Chairman Sons I T Was Years Before America Gave

440,Mr Groom,"It looks well ana ittime. I admit that there are other items .to which this criticism does not apply. justice to the Government, but I have mentioned these other items to show the haphazard way in which the T a r i ff has been framed. Take, again, bags and sacks for bran, chaff, and compressed fodder. The total importation at present is 1,223,922 dozen, valued at £351,546, of which the United Kingdom sends us 350 dozen, valued at £ 1 0 0 ; the Straits Settlements, 750 dozen, valued at £ 2 4 7; and India, 1,222,822 dozen, valued at £351,199. Oould the preference which has been given in the T a r i ff operation be anything like a substantial preference to the Old Country? How is the Minister going to do it? W ill the duty of 10 per cent, cause a transfer of the trade from India to the United Kingdom? doubt that the item is nothing but a revenue duty put on the primary producers of this country, and that it cannot operate to give a preference at a l l . If it could operate, and give a preference to Great Britain, ib could be justified. and flour bags the total importation is 3,483,322 dozens, of which we import from India 3,483,073 dozens, valued at £1,153,908. imported from the United Kingdom, yet the Government are giving a preference to the United Kingdoma preference which cannot operate in any way. Take again the item of mowers, reapers, and binders. item out of the free list, and made the articles free and 5 per cent. The total importation is valued at £160,281 , namely, from United Kingdom, £ 1 6 , 3 4 1 ; from Canada, £ 8 4 , 6 4 2; from the United States of America, £ 6 1 , 2 4 8 ; and from other countries, £ 5 0 . the Minister wil l not contend that in this case he is imposing a, protective duty. a revenue duty, and it is a revenue duty levied on the manufactures of a sister' Dominion, which exports over £84,000 worth to Australia. Again, take the case of strippers and harvesters. land we import absolutely nothing, from Canada, £65,459 worth ; and fro m the United States of America, £11,816 worth. The Government have raised the duty on this item from £ 1 2 to £ 1 4 , giving a preference of £ 2 . It can operate as I must admit that, in a protective duty, but it certainlv is not likely to give a preference to GreatB r i tain. Of tbe metal of these, we import £226,146 worth from Canada, and £60,381 worth from the United States. The Minister has given a preference to the Old Country, but nothing is imported from there. If it operated it would transfer trade from one part of the Empire to the United Kingdom. The same remark applies to churns and many other items. If honourable members examine the Tariff and apply the principles I laid down at the beginning, it w ill be seen that the Tariff violates every principle which is applied in the formation of a scientific protective system. In the first place, it does not pretend to pick out the leading industries in Australia, and t r y to put them on a satisfactory protective basis. In the second place, it deliberately imposes reveThere is not the slightest nue duties on machinery which is required in our manufacturing industries. It deliberately puts ever so many revenue duties on various items I have mentioned, such as cream separators, chaff-cutters, churns, strippers, machine tools and Of. corn tools of trade which are. required in the secondary industries. If the secondary industries do not flourish, the primary industries w ill languish. Even No corn and flour bags are raw material which is required by various industries is taxed. In every possible way the Minister seems to have violated the principles of proper taxation. Revenue duties should be so imposed that they f a l l upon people according to their The Minister has taken this ability to pay. Sof a r as the Minister taxes luxuries, no one can find f a u l t with him, but when one looks through the Tariff he sees that the revenue duties are falling even on the tools of trade required by the workmen in their ordinary avocations, that is in cases I am sure that where"" their manufacture cannot be successful. If it can be established clearly that these tools of trade can be It can only operate as manufactured in the Commonwealth, they ought, I think, to be made dutiable.

I do not wish to say anything more on the Tariff. It has been brought forward in a most haphazard manner. I arn sorry that, in deciding upon the taxation to meet the requirements of the present situation, the Ministry did not pay due regard to the necessities of the States. Both the Commonwealth and the States can be indirectly affected by the war, and will feel the results of it . The Commonwealth has a legitimate sphere of taxation, on whicli it should live.

January, 1901, in the first policy speech he delivered, Sir Edmund Barton dealt with this questionNow as to taxation by the Commonwealth, I may tell you that I feel, quite as fully as any Treasurer could, that such a power is not to he harshly or rashly exercised. In this case any rash exorcise of the power might be disastrous to every State. over great obligations from the States; but we have taken over the Customs with them, and you must recollect that if, after the Commonwealth imposes its Tariff, the States require more revenue, they can only obtain it by direct taxation within the States. The exercise of the power by the Commonwealth imposes on us an enormous responsibility; but in carrying out that responsibility they would interfere as little as possible with the States of the Commonwealth, as it was absolutely necessary to leave the field of direct taxation to those States. The States should be studied in every way, and the early difficulties of so great a change made as little trying as possible. There must be no direct taxation by the Commonwealth unless under the pressure of some great national emergency, and noteven then if it can bo avoided. Then Sir George Reid, speaking on the We can range over 21st January, 1901, is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to have saidMr Barton says he is against direct taxation in the Commonwealth, except in the case Excise should be our main of emergency. As I pronounced this policy two or throe weeks before, I am very glad Mr Barton has in this respect adopted my views. When the Labour party framed its That was Federal platform, at the Inter-State Labour Conference which was held in MrB . R. Garran January, 1900, it made no provision in it for a Federal land tax.

That being so, we ought not to exercise our powers of direct taxation except in case of national emergency. But, as a matter of fact, whafc are we doing ?

In 1912 the sum of £525,45o was collected from town lands, and £919,805 from country lands. Preserving approximately the same proportion during £1,000,000 will be derived from city lands, and £1,700,000 from rural lands. Now, the £1,000,000 which will be derived from the cities will not lead to the bursting up of any estates, and the men who own large properties fchere will pass on fche fcax as part of fche cosfc of running their businesses. In other words, the tax will be felfc by their tenants. Consequently it will operate in a way that my honourable friends opposite do nofc desire. leaseholds ? yet before us the amending Bill dealing with leaseholds which the Treasurer has promised to submit for our consideration. Thenfcheprobate duties, whioh it is proposed to levy, will press very heavily incedent. We have been told that these deed. If honourable members wish to institute a comparison between the probate duties operating in fche various States, they have merely to turn to the sixth volume of Erdbbs, page 814. There they will find that the highest duty operaI say that the men who control our pritive in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, upon estates valued at more than £100,000, is 10 per cent.

I need scarcely point out thafc the proposed duties will be in addiduring the currency of the war. Of tion fco those which are imposed by the States. Thus, in Queensland, a 10 per cent, duty will be collected upon an estate those notes into circulation. But, even if of about £20,000 value, in addition to a Federal duty of approximately £4 12s. per oent.

It is to be regretted that liament would step in and prevent ifc. fche Government have not observed the principles which were obviously in the minds of the framers of our Constitution. What is still more disconcerting is the factfchafcthese taxes are apparently contemplated as permanent sources of revenue. Our expenditure will be founded upon them. This will make ifc more difficult for any future Government to restore these powers to the States. TJnder these circumstances, although the Ministry have made an heroic attempt to meet the necessities of the times, I cannot help thinking thafc, in many respects, their proposals will work unsatisfactorily, in addition fco which they will inflict the current nnancial year, hardship in a way thafc is not contemplated. utterance of the honourable member for Darling Downs at least had the merit of being direct and definite.

However, it is time to get a move on, if not by direct action, at ""least by indirect action through the Tariff. Darling Downs was severe on the Government for what he termed the haphazard way in which the Tariff has been brought down; troduced better than none at all.

I Am Mr Carr,"Lik e bringing in a T a r if fand if that is accompanied hy an increased manufacture here, there is no telling the extent to which Australian development may go on. The war of 1870 practically developed the American nation, and there is no reason why this great war should not have the incidental effect of developing Australia. I believe it will if the opportunity is properly handled, and the way to handle it is the way I am now indicating. As for borrowing for war purposes, we ought to borrow if we can. I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that wartime is the time to borrow; but, unfortunately, the effects of the war are so far-reaching that we find it difficult to borrow, and, whether we will or not, are forced back on our own resources. If we cannot borrow, surely we are entitled to utilize our own credit to the fullest extent necessary. We have done so to an extent which has met with criticism, but to which I contend that we are justified in going. We shall be justified in going even to the lengths that I have already indicated should conditions become as bad as they promise to become before they start to mend. If , during the bad times, we lay the foundations which will enable us to grasp our opportunities, we shall indeed have cause to congratulate ourselves when the trouble is over. It is a matter for congratulation that we have in power men who have not stood upon ceremony in these matters, as the Opposition would indubitably have done. They have simply taken definite steps without attempting to reconcile all the conflicting views. I only hope that the move they have made will be persisted in to an even greater extent, and trust that many of the industries I have in my mind's eye will benefit when the time comes, in common with others with which the Minister of Trade and Customs has already dealt. -The tone of the debate so far as it has gone is an evidence that the House is unanimous in the desire to help the Treasurer to tide over the great crisis through which we are passing, and I hardly think he can take exception to the character of the criticism that has been launched regarding the Budget. I have studied it carefully myself, and think that, generally speaking, notwithstanding the large increase in expenditure, most of it will com£11,742,000, the difference is £2,680,000, mend itself to the general good sense of the country. The Treasurer has wisely separated the war expenditure from the ordinary expenditure, thus giving us an opportunity of judging how far our ordinary expenditure is mounting up, and how far we are carrying on our affairs in a business-like way. The Treasurer might have made the taxation proposals much easier by debiting more of the new revenue-earning reproductive works to loan account. This is the time when every legitimate means should be taken by the Treasurer to ease the burden of taxation, and that could have been done by including in the loan proposals practically all new works. Large sums of money debited to loan account by the previous Administration are now brought back into the revenue account in the most trying time in our history. We have a war expenditure of £11,742,000, and every one of us will agree that not only is that large sum justifiable, but that it might have been substantially increased. I quite appreciate the Prime Minister's statement that we in Australia, having a Navy which has done very effective work, redounding to its credit and to the credit of the Empire, hardly stand in the same relationship to the Empire and its allies on the field as do places like Canada. The last information we have is that Canada is prepared to train and to place in the field at the earliest possible moment no fewer than 300,000 men, should that number be needed. I do nots say that she will be called upon to make good her offer. The moral effect on the enemy of a declaration in definite form from all parts of the Empire of what they are prepared to do in its defence must be very great. In the circumstances, I am sorry that we are not going to spend more than the sum of £11,742,000 which it is proposed to spend, because I think that a larger expenditure and more men would bring about a more speedy termination of the war. Returning to the Budget, I find that the amount spent in 1913-14 was £23,161,327, and that in 1914-15 the expenditure will reach £37,583,000, or £14,42i2,000 more.

Regarding the proposed increases in public servants' salaries, the honourable member saying motions might well be postponed for twelve months, without prejudice to the right to advancement. Such a postponement might be made without doing any injustice, especially where the more highly paid officials are concerned. that the j>ublic servants should be well paid. The Public Service of the Commonwealth is one of which we have a right to be proud. As the Departments increase in importance, their permanent heads come to preside over expenditure amounting to millions per annum, we can hope for efficient service only by paying such salaries as will attract the best brains in the community. I wish now to call attention to the increases of taxation, which have been dealt with this afternoon so ably, trenchantly, and effectively by fche honourable members for Flinders and Balaclava. The probate duties are estimated to yield £1,000,000 per annum; but the honourable member for Balaclava showed that they might probably yield £2,000,000. duties is always doubtful. The estimate in this case is a little over £1,000,000; bufc it would be quite possible for us' to get that sum within half a year. Everything depends upon the deaths that occur. proposed on estates valued afc more than £70,000 is 15 per cent. In Victoria, the taxation does not amount to 10 per cent., except on estates worth £100,000 or more, and the duties yield about £400,000 a year. The proposed land tax is expected to give £1,200,000. Thus we are to get altogether £2,300,000 in direct taxation. Prom Customs and Excise duties there is to be an increase in revenue of £1,500,000. That money is needed to make up a deficiency that will occur through the shrinkage of imports. The objection that I have to the land tax propos i b of the Government is that they mark a new era in Australian taxation. Por the first time in the history of the of values proposed. The land tax proposals of the Government outrage all hitherto accepted views of constitutional ethics and legislative equity. I do not wish to be misunderstood. The nation is at war, and I think thafc we should submit to all the sacrifices which may be for Balaclava was right in necessary to carry us through an unprethat increments and procedented crisis. Individually, we should be prepared to do our part at home as our soldiers are doing theirs abroad. Bufc fco impose a fcax on between 14,000 and 15,000 persons only is class taxation. In some instances the whole income of tlie I consider land fchat is taxed will be required to pay the tax; thus the whole value of the land will be taken away, because when you take the revenue from the land you take from the owner its value. Shylock saysYou take my house, when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house. This crushing taxation amounts to confiscation. The class which the Government is taxing has little political influence. A body of 14,000 or 15,000 voters counts for little in an election. The large land-owners have not many friends. There is no large body of members to defend them against this crushing onslaught. We are, in fchis predatory tax, introducing an immoral principle, which may be used later, when the occasion demands, to tax away other values. Mr Lloyd George, iu a celebrated speech made some time ago. said fchafc treaties are the currency of international statesmanship. The currency of statesmanship within a nation is the just and equitable laws which are imposed on the community. Parliament, instead of establishing the immoral principle of the confiscation of the values of property by taxation, should set an example to the community of moral ethics by defending the rights of every section. A Parliament that w ill consent to the imposition of a confiscatory tax upon the property of auy section in the community is a very dangerous and destructive, instead of, as it should be, the bulwark of defence in its guardianship of the rights and property of the people as a whole. It must be agreed thafc the present is fche worse time afc which such taxation could have been introduced.

It is the confidence reposed in those documents which enables thousands of tons of commerce to be carried overseas, and which give their value to bills of exchange, bank notes, and other commercial instruments. Do not our titles to land stand in exactly the same category ? Isi t not the honour of the community which is understood to be behind these securities that gives them their value? If this Parliament is going to disregard its moral obligation to protect the people's rights and maintain public confidence in the security of landed titles, we must seriously consider the road we are travelling, and the danger which must accrue to the community in the future if we decide to take that road. I thoroughly agree with the statement made this afternoon, that in the circumstances at present existing the taxation proposed should have been imposed upon the whole community in proportion to the means of individuals. when we should have been prepared for mutual sacrifices. ber would impose the burden upon the smaller men. posed that the increased taxation necessary should be met as f a r as possible by the whole community.

I remind honourable members that if we proposed to raise the same revenue per head from Customs duties that New Zealand does it Mr Lloyd George has stated would probably provide us with an additional revenue of £4,000,000. Although the New Zealand Tariff yields a revenue of 17s. per head more than does the Commonwealth Tariff, the protective incidence of the New Zealand Tariff is higher than that of the Commonwealth. This shows that it is possible to raise large sums of money through the Customs, and at the same time have a Protective Tariff. If the Minister of Trade and Customs will look up the information given in Mr. Knibbs' Y ear-Booh, he will find that on dutiable goods alone, apart altogether from spirits and narcotics, the protective incidence of the New Zealand Tariff is higher than that of the Commonwealth Tariff. member is wrong. not wrong.

I hope that, as members of a This National Parliament, we shall have regard for every interest in the community. As There a representative of an agricultural district, I am prepared to vote for substanI aro tial Protection, in order that our secondary industries may be built up.

Land is a commodity which will produce As a representative of a abundantly in accordance with the I amount of intelligence and industry applied to it by man; and in just the same -way, raw materials are manufactured into In my view, the finished articles necessary for the human race.

The taxation is to be imposed on one particular class, and, as the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out this afternoon, it is a method of taxation that should cause any fair-minded elector to have most serious misgivings. Here we find the Government prepared to give special preference in the way of employment to members of their own party who are unionists; and when it is necessary to impose direct taxation they select a class which, numerically and politically, are not powerful, and are thus unable to defend themselves. wards and punishment. earnings, the humblest worker is more heavily taxed than the richest land-owner, seeing that four-fifths of the revenue comes through the Custom House. paid by the worker. earnings, the worker pays more than any man in"" the community. large free fist, with duties imposed for the purpose of encouraging manufactures, not of the very highest quality of goods, and if the workers are paying the bulk of the duties, it only shows that there is not sufficient Protection. Otherwise, we should ourselves be making more of the goods which are chiefly purchased by the wage-earners, and it would not then be necessary to pay duty. The Prime Minister, in a war period, has produced a Budget there is, on the part of the Opposition, and the House generally, a genuine desire to assist him in the present crisis; and I regret that, under the circumstances, a method of taxation should be proposed that means a reliance on a few members of the community to make up the deficiency in the revenue. [10.20] I would not have had anything to say at this stage were it not for some of the remarks which have fallen from the lips of the honourable member for W i m mera. I have very little complaint to rise with a bundle of notes. orable member may look at the notes if he cares to do so. The honourable member for Wimmera made use of a statement, which also came from other honourable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House, in regard to one particular question, and I do not wish to see the remarks of honourable members appear in Hansard uncontradicted, and so give them an opportunity to use that material during the recess to mislead innocent people in the country as to the incidence of this proposed taxation on unimproved land values. that we would do that. what I know of the honourable member In proportion to their for Balaclava personally, one would be inclined to think that he is incapable of saying those things which he has been acqujstomed to say very often against members on this side of the House, particularly when he was on the public platform.

Wheni t comes to a matter of making extravagant statements, the honourable member cannot be excelled by any one on this side, particularly if he is desirous of making political capital at our expense.

The honourable member for Wimmera represents a constituency which is in every particular similar to the one I have the honour of representing, and I tell him that, in my constituency, there are only 124 land-owners who are paying land taxation under the proposals of the present Government. member for Echuca, when speaking last night, would have had every landowner in his constituency believe that he was being robbed by the Government's proposal in regard to increased land tax.

I can remember well when the land tax was proposed by the Labour party in f u l f i l ment of the pledges which returned them on the 13fch A p r i l , 1910. I can also remember well the reasons given by practically every accredited member of the party, both inside and outside of this T h a t is House. These proposals, they informed According to the reasoning of fche ns, were intended to achieve two objects, one of which was to provide money for the defence of Australia, thus giving effect to that plank in their platform which reads, "" N a v a l and military expenses to I did not suggesfc that. be allotted from proceeds of direct taxaT h a t was tion."" That plank to-day represents the creed and the test of membership of the party. Every person who joins it has to subscribe to the doctrine that all naval and military expenditure should be derived from the proceeds of direct taxation. The second reason advanced for the Federal land tax was that its effect would be to burst up large estates. reason, I think. ister had favoured us with anything like a reasonable explanation of the amending Land TaxB ill , I had intended to ask h i m My honi f the reasons which prompted h i m to submit the original measure were those which still actuate members of his party.

I admit that to-day Australia occupies an unparalleled position from the standpoint of the supreme responsibility which rests upon her.

535,Mr Rodgers,"But how much of£1,000,000 annually. Let us see how this proposal will operate. Practically it will call upon less than 14,000 persons to contribute the absent portion of the money that is required for the government of Ausof a road, for example, is to be tralia. Both in this House and outside of it we have never ceased to hear of the manner in which combines have crawled all over the Commonwealth, and of the way in which they have sucked the lifeblood of the people. To-day we are assured that they are more rapacious than ever. But do the Government propose to levy any direct taxation upon them? I do not, refer to the merchants, traders, or shippers of the community with any feeling of scorn, because I believe that they are all anxious to do their duty to the Commonwealth. But my honourable friends opposite have brushed them aside, and in effect have said to them, "" Not one penny of direct taxation shall fall upon you except in respect of city property, in which case the tax can be passed on."" Now the fiscal policy to which I subscribe is that of Protection for reasons whicli I shall have an opportunity of explaining later. Buti f I required any further reason why I should support a Protective policy, that put forward by the honourable member for Wimmera would be sufficient. He pointed out that when a trust exists outside of Australia we can exercise no control whatever over it, and the truth of his remark is well illustrated by the condition of the jute industry. The trust which controls that industry is punishing the farmer, and we are helpless to repress it. I have heard honourable members of my own party describe this tax as a class tax. That is not my view of it. I regard it as a tax on a section of a class If there be wealth on the side of those whom we represent in politics, why should we not spread the tax over the whole of that class and of Australia? At a time 0 when the country is at war, when the men upon the land are not only earning no income, but are suffering immense losses as the result of their stock perishing from drought, when many of them are unable to provide their families with even the requisites of life, the Government bring down a proposal to further tax land, but to exempt all holders of estates of less than £5,000 unimproved value. I ask honourable members, Isi t humanly possible, even under a pretence, to exempt farmers from the payment of the tax-to exempt them from its effect? Upon one side found a large land-holder, whilst on the other side, perhaps, all the small sections are owned by men whose estates are worth less than £5,000 unimproved value. The moment the Pederal land tax is imposed, down comes the value of the big man's holding, together with tbe value of every small man's holding. Under the law of the survival of the fittest, the last to go out will be the big man. This is a country in which contractual obligations used to be honoured, but in some States, I regret to say, the law of contracts has been swept aside. To-day the world revolves on public credit. The men on the land, above all others, are those who take advantage of the stored-up cash reserves of other people. To-day, at least 50 per cent, of the capital value of all alienated land in Australia has been placed there by those who have built up cash reserves from other industries. That is to say, the ordinary land-holder has borrowed at least 50 per cent, of the capital value of his land. Sometimes by hard work and by the enslavement of his family, he has gradually been able to subscribe the balance. Now he is to be hit with the second instalment of a confiscatory land tax which is designed to reduce the valuo of the big man's land, but which cannot help decreasing the value of the holding of the small man -d n other words, of the man who is least able to call upon other reserves. If he is unable to secure fresh money, what will happen to him? Will his little neighbour alongside, be able to buy him out? The possibility is that the biggest man will be able to step over and get the property at a sacrificial'price. If I can gauge public opinion, and if I know the minds of the land-holders of Australia, the time is ripe-in the language of the honourable member for West Sydney, "" rotten ripe "" -for the formation of a Land League, and then what we are now unable to achieve in the House, on account of numbers, will be forced by conviction upon this country in a manner thafc will probably awaken my friends opposite. The honourable member for Wimmera says that he holds no special brief for the large landholder, except it be a brief of equity, and I am not able to discriminte money put into land and money put into a bank or into some other industry. I want to know why, when the plank providing for tbe defence of Australia from money raised by direct taxation was framed by the political Labour party, two the present Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, forgot that it was the nation that had placed them in the highest positions in the gift of the And why should they not, out of the emoluments little bit towards the defence of the country that has placed them in their positions? House should contribute cording to his means. discriminate, in a time of war, as to those who should put in their money ? I have many friends among the land-holders who are not contributing to the Federal land tax, and none of them wish to skulk behind the 14,000 persons who pay land tax and provide the money for the defence of the country. ment of a confiscatory land tax as an attempt designed to hit men towards whom our opponents have particular and as a first step in the direction of the leasehold system, or, in other words, tlie nationalization of land, designed with the object of shrinking honourable member for Indi, who interjects, has asked me no question that I am not prepared to answer. Has the honourable member though he said he was going to do wonderful things in connection with trusts and combines, neither he nor his leader has lifted one finger to place an impost upon these trusts and com'bines, which, if they existed at the time of the last electionand every honourable member on the Government bench vouched that they did, and the Prime Minister, in his Bundaberg speech, said it also-must in existence to-day. Several months have since elapsed in which they must have increased in virility and further their tentacles orer Australia, yet the honourable member, who had so much to say before his electors in regard to the imposts on farmers, has not been able to show fhat Ki3 party has done towards relieving the community vile operations, if we are to believe the .honourable member, of these trusts and Mr Rodgers. combines. The proposed land tax is another attempt on the part of the Federal between Labour party to do indirectly what they are constitutionally not entitled to do directly-that is, to lay down the land policy of Australia. When was the power given to the Federal Parliament to determine the land policy of Australia? By gentlemen, sovereign right this power was reserved to the States. Every State is busy, at Home and abroad, by every agency possible, endeavouring to induce people to community. settle on the lands of Australia; but the irony .of the situation is that all the time of their offices, pay their every Statei n the Union is imposing taxation on land-holders, while, on top of the State imposts, we have a superEvery honourable member in the tax and a super supertax imposed by the his quota acFederal Parliament. All these imposts Why should we are not likely to assist those anxious to spread out on the lands of Australia, whether they come from inside the Commonwealth or abroad. In Victoria the land-holder pays three taxes-the State tax, the existing Federal tax, and the new Federal tax. I regard this second instalmoney for defence ? enmity, person in Australia should contribute to the cost of the defence of his country in the proportion and to the extent to which he enjoys the p r i v i land values. The leges bestowed by the community. In other words, I am a convinced believer in the principle of an income tax and if there were sufficient honourable members told his electors that, with the same conviction as myself in this matter, I should be prepared to bargain with the States so that the Commonwealth would surrender to the States the proper avenue of State taxation-that is, taxing the land-and , in exchange, the States would surrender to the Commonwealth the sole right to impose an income tax. Then the Commonwealth could levy, for defence and other purposes, sufficient taxation still be upon incomes. I am ' unable te discriminate between the man who puts his money into land and the man who puts extended his money into a bank or factory. It is everybody's duty to contribute to the defence and economical administration of bhe country. By the way, it is intended simultaneously with the imposition of an anything increased land tax, to present at least of the another 5 per cent, protection to our manufacturers. I have no objection to that assistance being given; but, at",78,Temporary Chairman Sons I T Was Years Before America Gave
536,Mr Shabpe,Wher e would you get the,80,Temporary Chairman Sons I T Was Years Before America Gave
537,Mr Rodgers,"I believe that everyfche same time, it is hard that there should be discrimination of fchis sort. While we are supposed to be able to set up those who are starting in secondary industries, with a certain knowledge as to the conditions under which they will carry on, and wifch a fairly accurate knowledge as to fche profits they can make; on the other hand, why should we put fresh imposts on the land-holders of Australia, who, this year, as has been vividly demonstrated, are up against the elements, and can gain no profit upon their holdings? To my way of thinking, the public of Australia, and fche manufacturers, in common wifch others, do not desire this segregation of fche land-holders of Australia as the special subject of taxation. I asked the Treasurer to-day whether, in regard fco his taxation proposals, particularly the land tax, he proposed fco relieve the landholders of the burden of paying this new impost during the present drought, and his reply was, of course, indefinite. The right honourable gentleman smiled, and said that he would be very pleased to be able fco do it . There is in the Land Tax Assessment Act , section 66, which provides fchat the Commissioner, in association with a Board, may take into consideration adverse circumstances, and may practically waive the payment of the tax in case of bankruptcy and insolvency, or for other unfortunate circumstances; and I do not know whether the Treasurer has changed his mind in this regard, but, afc a later stage, fche Attorney-General assured the Committee that provision would be made in the B ill to meet the case of those land-holders who failed in the present year owing to adverse circumstances.

I take it that the Committee can accept the assurance of the Attorney General that the machinery of the Act will be sympathetically enlarged to meet bhe conditions of the existing drought. If thafc be so, we may take ifc as fairly certain that from 75 to SO per cent., at least, of the large landholders of Australia no Federal land tax w ill be collected during the first term of the operation of the new Act. right. The drought does nofc apply to Queensland at all. members to look at the production returns. The Prime Minister said that it was unwise for honourable members to decry the position of the country, and that we were drawing the long bow. Those people abroad who are concerned in the welfare of this country, however, have a more accurate knowledge of its conditions than the right honourable member seems to think. Knowing as they do that we are importing wheat to feed our people, and in many cases to provide seed -knowing , also, that we are importing fodder for our stock-it is fairly certain that the people of New Zealand, Canada, and the Mother Country, from whom these imports come, are f u l l y aware that a condition of drought alone could be responsible for such a state of affairs. They know that Australia is essentially an exporting country in the matter of wool, wheat, butter, f r u it , &c. the honourable inember makine the position appear worse than it really is.

Ifc is not my usual custom. too good-natured. ent from that of the honourable gentleman. I have witnessed an outburst or two on his part in this House that do not make me think that he is the embodiment of good temper. I wish to deal very briefly with the financial position as outlined today. I shall not discuss it at length, for we have already had to-day two very admirable addresses from the Opposition benches and an answering speech by the Attorney-General. that we do nofc arrive afc a true analysis by comparing the conditions of the Old Countryi n the matter of currency with those prevailing in Australia. Australia is a debtor nation, whereas the Mother Country is a creditor nation. We may make, internally, arrangements in respect of our currency and exchange which will suit us; bufc whilst these temporary arrangements may tide us over for the time being within Australia they cannot permanently make up the leeway or the loss or balance of trade that this nation w ill suffer during the present year. what I think are the admirable arrangements he has been able fco make in very difficult circumstances-the arrangement by which he has secured from abroad a loan to provide for war expenditure and fche arrangement; he has been able to make with the Associated Banks, which, in my judgment, reflects a great deal of credit, more particularly upon the banks themselves. of a good deal of sagacity on the part of the Treasurer, who has been able to make such an arrangement. I regret to say, however, thafc the arrangements made by fche right houorable gentleman are altogether in conflict with the statement thafc he put before the people in the manifesto of the Labour party, issued last general election but after the declaration of the war. In the LabourI manifesto, issued on 24th August; last, we have this statementThe Conference at which representatives of the Opposition sat with those of the Government and the States has made such arrangements, and it was enabled to do so because thc Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue had created the very instruments by which credit could be supported, and the wheels of industry kept moving, even in this great crisis. Thanks, then, to the Australian note issue, enough money is to be loaned to the States by the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain their public works policy, and thus prevent a huge army of unemployed being thrown upon the streets. Similarly with private employment. Had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank and the note issue, the private banks would have been compelled, in sheer defence, to restrict credit. It seems to me tinuesOverdrafts would have had to be reduced, so tliat enterprises affected by the war would have shrunk almost to nothing. The honourable member for Denison says "" Hear, hear,"" although he has heard only to-day an emphatic declaration by the Treasurer that these very banks have been the buttress of the credit of the country-that they have been the means by which the Commonwealth and every State of the Union, except Queensland, has been financed in the most difficult period ever experienced. The manifesto proceedsI compliment the Treasurer on Money would have been very dear; unemployment and trade crises would liave come upon us like a flood submerging everything. Instead of whioh, money is very cheap, employment is encouraged, traders should not be called upon to reduce overdrafts or harassed by dread of complete ruin. The wheels of industry move, and trade becomes possible. It is hardly necessary to point out that this is a pre-election manifesto-that it was issued on the eve of the last general electionThe Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue, without whicli at this juncture we should be faced with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance, are due to the Labour party alone.

561,Mr Rodgers,"The statement conI have no desire to decry it , but I wish to point out the glaring inconsistency between this statement and what actually took place later on. I have here an empliatic declaration by the Prime Minister that his party was pledged to, and would, during the first session of this Parliament, introduce, a policy that would give absolutely effective Protection to Australian industries. I am content to accept, for the time being, the public estimation of that Tariff, and the opinion of honourable members who sit behind the Government, and of others sitting in Opposition, who are pledged to a policy of Protection. my Leader nor the Attorney-General, who, in a great measure, leads the Labour party. I include neither of them among those pledged to a Protective policy. It has been clearly demonstrated by rccimt happenings, fortunately for those who have undertaken manufacturing industries in Australia, that the grave state of international complications now existing has changed the opinions of many with regard to fiscal matters, but there are one or two items in connection with the Tariff presumed to have a protective incidence which, personally, I am not prepared to support. tionist ! orable member's point of view. I hope I am able to look all round this question, because I am not leg-roped and tied up, as my honourable friend is, to the policy of the new Protection. The Assistant Minister may rank in the minds of some outsiders as a good Protectionist, but he is not so to the members of this House. Like every other member of the Political Labour party, he is pledged and tied up to the policy of the new Protection. Before the elections the party took the risk of promising effective Protection through the Customs House, although, at the time they were speaking, and the same thing is true to-day, the real plank in their policy was the new Protection, to which every one of them was pledged. That plank cannot be altered by the Government, or by any member of it . It can be altered only by the Labour movement itself. Take, for instance, the tax on cornsacks and woolpacks, which I regard as nothing more than a direct impost on one class. On the face of it, it might appear to the public unacquainted with the facts as intended to encourage the industry of cornsack and woolpack making, both in Great Britain and Australia, but will any Minister tell me that one pack or cornsack is made, or can be made, in Australia 1 make them for Is. apiece. item out of court. How many are made in the United Kingdom? Is not the item a mere humbug and pretence, introduced ostensibly to protect the interests of Australia, or the Empire, when, as a matter of fact, it simply imposes a direct revenue duty on one of the staple industries of this country ? One honourable member behind me asks if I am a good Protectionist. I say, unhesitatingly, that if all the items were levied in that direction I should vote for none of them, but if I am shown items which will genuinely and honestly encourage Australian industries, I shall vote for every one of them. this late hour I clo not propose to say more than this: I am not prepared to vote a single halfpenny more of taxation, direct or otherwise, that is going T h is is the good Protecto be borne wholly and solely by the men on the land. I say that definitely and deliberately. In the submitted Tariff proposals it seems to be absolutely misleading to say that, under the heading of stripper harvesters, the United Kingdom is going to get a £ 2 preference over foreign countries. The United Kingdom has never built a single harvester that has come to Australia. The item, therefore, is absolutely misleading, and a species of fraud to place before the public. there. the kind of thing to put seriously before the people. We are also offering to the United Kingdom a preference of a farthing per pound on metal parts for stripper harvesters, and the United Kingdom has not made a single part for a stripper harvester.

I want the truth to prevail, although the heavens fall. Until we have some evidence of the United Kingdom being able to take advantage of the preference we are by these items simply throwing dust in the eyes of the people there. If any British manufacturer sees them, the Budget of the Australian Parliament will become a laughing stock for the whole business community of the Old Land. Some time ago, when the distributing agents in Buenos Ayres had a difference with a firm here, they approached certain English manufacturers, asking if they would make stripper harvesters; but the reply given was that it would not pay to do so, unless an order were placed for some thousands of machines. I believe that one machine was sent to the Argentine from Great Britain, but that it proved quite inefficient. The proposed preference is altogether misleading. As to the duty of 10 per cent, on corn-sacks and bags, it seems to be an attempt to bolster up the speculator, who alone can send forward orders, and take advantage of cheap prices. usually buys at high prices; and if he purchases towards the end of a season, he will find himself in a position very different from that of a speculator. great primary producers should not be penalized in this way.
