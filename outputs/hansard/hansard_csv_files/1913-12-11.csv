Bailey, naval clerk at the Naval Base? 2. Will the Minister place the papers in connection with this case upon the Library table? the honourable member's questions I have been furnished with the following statetable the following papers:ment:i . For some time prior to the termination of the period for which Mr Bailey was engaged friction existed between himself and other officers employed on the works at the Flinders Naval Base. In consequence, apparently, of this, Mr Bailey tendered his resignation, which was accepted. quent lv raised the point that his resignation was not in order, and he was, therefore, permitted to withdraw it. The trouble continuing, an inquiry was held by the Minister, Admiral Creswell, and Mr Swan (Assistant Director of Naval Works), and the officials concerned, including Mr Bailey, were given an opportunity of stating their case. quiry, it was decided to allow Mr Baiiey to complete the term of his engagement, but it was proposed, in view of the friction referred to, to transfer Mr Bailey to the head office. Mr Bailev, however, disputed the right of the Board to effect such transfer, claiming that his agreement was that he should be employed on the Base. He was, in consequence, not transferred to the head office, and the term provided in his agreement was completed at the Base. 2. Yes.

Statei n the Commonwealth has a provision similar to that now proposed, and it is desirable that Commonwealth stock should be placed in the same position as that of the States. TheB ill cannot be circulateduntil this motion has been passed, and, therefore, it would be unwise at the present stage to discuss the proposal set forth by the Treasurer. I take it that the intention is simply that the Commonwealth shall come into line with other borrowers. The only singular point about the measure is that it would appear to be an indication that the Government are preparing the way for what is coming if they remain in office. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, and adopted. OrderedThat Sir John Forrest and Mr W. H . Irvine do prepare and bring in a B ill to carry out the foregoing resolution. B ill presented by Sir JOHNFOBREST , and read a first time. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [10.48] I move That this BiU be now read a second time. Honourable members are aware, from the statement made by me in the Budget speech, that the object of this B ill is to increase the special payment to Tasmania under section 96 of the Constitution from £500,000, which was agreed to last session, to £900,000. the increase? Sir JOHN FORREST ment are acting in accordance with the unanimous recommendation of the Royal Commission. When the proposal to pay Tasmania £500,000 was before us, the Government of the day thought that that sum was as much as could then be given, and though the then Opposition would have liked to increase it, and tried to do so, there was no feeling exhibited in the matter, and a majority of this House thought that the proposal presented a reasonable solution of the difficulty at the time; but, as a year has elapsed since then, the Government think that Parliament Every should be asked to deal with the matter in the most generous way. The recommendation of the Royal Commission was unanimous, and I do not think it is any reflection upon the Government of the day to say that they did nob recommend a grant of the whole amount at that time, because we a l l know that there are difficulties and exigencies in the financial arrangements of the country that do not always admit of one doing altogether what one would desire. The Government do not desire to recommend the expenditure of money if we can avoid it. The people of Tasmania, as a whole, are unanimous on the question. ' Sir JOHN FORREST I think they are reasonable people, and the grant is being made under a section of the Constitution which entitles a State that requires financial assistance to meet its obligations to apply to the Commonwealth for ib. There can be no doubt that Tasmania, of all the States, has probably suffered most in the diminution of Customs revenue, and whatever may be the cause, there is no doubt that there has been a great diminution in the receipts, from that source in that State. Eventually the Government, not being too eager to rush into this matter, came to the conclusion after f u l l consideration that it would be far better for this Parliament to comply with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, which took a great deal of trouble, and made exhaustive inquiries. They have consequently submitted this B ill for the consideration of honourable members. It is proposed to spread the payment over the same years as in the.

The speeches of many honourable members opposite, including that of the Leader of the Opposition, would almost lead the public tosuppose that the previous Government had paid the whole £500,000; as a matter of fact, they had only paid £95,000 before they left office.

There is no doubt that if we pass this B ill we shall be fully recognising that Tasmania has experienced financial difficulties under Federation. Personally, aud I know I can say the same for my colleagues, it gives me much pleasure to move the second reading of the B ill . The way in which the Treasurer has put the position of the Government in this matter is rather remarkable. The right honourable gentleman was, I think, in three Governments which were appealed to, in the same way as the Fisher Government was appealed to, to give succour to the State of Tasmania. During our term of office we appointed a Royal Commission to investigate Tasmania's demands in the first instance. so. F o r many years Tasmania would-not look at a proposal of this kind. Minister talking about? Tasmania appealed for assistance very soon after the Uniform Tariff was passed, on the ground that she was losing unduly by it. She appealed through her representatives, directly and indirectly, to the second and every succeeding Ministry. It was only when the Fisher Ministry was returned with a majority that steps were taken to investigate the claims of the State by means of a R o y a l Commission.

They could not sustain its legal claim to redress for any loss' incurred through any faulty administration on the part of the Customs Department; but the question having arisen as to whether the circumstances of the State did not demand some relief altogether outside the legal claim, the Commission, having favourably considered that aspect of the matter, recommended that the rest of Australia should pay to Tasmania a sum of not less than £900,000. The Chairman accordingly moved in this House the adoption of the Commission's recommendation On that occasion I made a statement in the House on behalf of the Government. I said that we would give to Tasmania a sum of £500,000 over a period of ten years. I said that this was a fair and reasonable offer at the time, but I did not hold the opinion that the grant we proposed should close the matter entirely. I also pointed T h a t is not quite out-and I hold the same view just as strongly to-day as I did then-that the Commonwealth Parliament would not be W h a t is the Prime justified in paying £900,000 to Tasmania on the legal claim put forward.

Tasmania is a small State, but it was hoped that it would become larger under Federation. population better than Victoria has done. Budget-papers, page 52, the population of Victoria, which on the 6th June, 1910, was 1,193,000, has since increased by 227,000, which is more than the total population of Tasmania to-day, Tasmania's population having increased in the same period by only. 29,000. The recommendation of the Royal Commission that this grant should diminish on a sliding scale seems to me a prudent one. The Treasurer knows that under the Constitution, Western Australia was given special consideration for a period of five years, but on a sliding scale, so that the assistance would not abruptly come to an end, but would taper off gradually. Fusion party made an agreement with the Premiers of the States, and desired to insert in the Constitution a provision which would compel the Commonwealth to pay to the States 25s. per capita for all time; and it was arranged, also, that Western Australia should enjoy a special concession. declined to ratify the proposal, but when the Labour Government assumed office, it decided that there should be a per capita grant to the States, but only for a period of years, and the concession to Western Australia was provided for in these terms, in section 5 of the Surplus Revenue Act No. 8 of 1910The Commonwealth shall, during the period the population of Tasmania is increasing of ten years beginning on the first day of June, rapidly. One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter, until Parliament otherwise provides, pay The Commission unanimously reto the State of Western Australia, by monthly instalments, an annual sum which in the first year shall be two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and in each subsequent year shall be £120,000, aud .to be progressively diminished by the sum of ten thousand pounds. That was considered a wiser arrangement than one to divide the sum to be given The into equal yearly payments which would come to an abrupt ending. Similarly, it would be wise to provide for the tapering-off of the payments madeto Tasmania. That would be much better than to give the State £5,000 this year, £15,000 next, £25,000 in the following year, and so on until in the last year £80,000 was given. That is not a fair way to treat the State. It would be better to make the larger payments in the early years, during the State's time of need. The Government proposes to give effect to the Royal Commission's recommendation, so far as the amount of the grant is concerned; and I urge that it should also adopt the sliding scale recommended by the Commission.

Sir JOHN sort! uoon-day that this is not a generous gift, as the Treasurer endeavours to make put, but is a payment under pressure of the marvellous majority of the Government. sure at all. sure is clear when the Treasurer is able to offer Tasmania only a paltry £5,000 for the first year. It is as though the Treasurer said, "" I do not wish to make any payment if I can help it, but since you press us, and your vote is all important to the Government, I will try to squeeze £5,000 for you this year."" The Government are thrusting aside every principle laid down in connection with such grants. Surely the proper time to extend help is when a State is in distress; and a wise Government would taper the assistance off until the State had learned how to do without it. The Government, however, in order to relieve their terrible position, completely reverse the order of things. The weak part of the proposal is to give Tasmania £90,000 each year, because it will mean that Tasmania, when suddenly deprived of this assistance, will have to ask for another grant to tide her over her difficulties. It can only make trouble for future Governments if we cease assisting Tasmania at a time when that State should have learned to work out her own redemption. years in which to do that. cause she is being given £90,000 every year. I am sure that if the Treasurer desired to assist his son to enter into business with £5,000, he would not pay him verse the engine if it is going the wrong £1,000 a year for five years, but would way. give him a lump sum and taper off the payments, so as to test whether the young man could make a success of the venture. That should be the position taken lip by a Treasurer who is carefully safeguarding the funds of the Commonwealth; but, instead, we have the present wonderful financing. The Treasurer tells us that we should not look a gift horse in the mouth. A ""gift horse""-£5,00 0 is a great gift, is it not? It is an apology, a mere subterfugea ""get-out"" of a difficult position in a mean way, which is going to do this country, and Tasmania, more harm than anything else. If we year to year, and decade to decade, we shall find it always in need. It is not a fair thing to cultivate this dependence when proper statesmanship would train the State to meet its own liabilities after she has been helped over her immediate necessities. It is the fortune of war only that has made the Treasurer bring in a Bill, of the kind at this stage. sort; I deny that absolutely. whether the Treasurer denies it or not"" the proof of the pudding is in the eating."" The right honourable gentleman has squeezed out only £5,000 for Tasmania, and he would not have squeezed out any money if he could have helped it. If the Government had had a great majority, we should not have found the Treasurer troubling about Tasmania. nothing for Tasmania for ten years. Treasurer shows that he moves only when political needs drive. Whenever in power, he has been cute enough to watch the political barometer, and when it was running down against him, to add a little mercury to bring it up again. pilot. he is not just to Tasmania, and he is ""piloting"" the Commonwealth into trouble.

The Treasurer should be ashamed of this legislatiou after all his boasts about the genius of the present Government in regard to finance. He should not again speak of finance if he admits that the Commonwealth is so badly off that it can only afford £5,000 for Tasmania, and cannot spring anotner £20,000 to meet, according to his own statements, the .reasonable and just necestake action. sities of that State. If we give Tasmania £25,000 this year it will not create a cul de sac that will prevent us squaring the financial barometer. The Bill will go down on record as an example of the Treasurer's absolute inability to live up to his reputation. Every time he introduces a financial Bill he gets lower and lower in the scale of the admiration of those who looked up to him in days gone by. All he can say is "" Let the Bill go."" It is cruel to let this Bill go, and 1 say it deliberately. A Treasurer who will bring forward a measure such as this, in order to save the political skin of the Government, is not worthy of his position. It is cruel for him to build up trouble for future Treasurers. Furthermore, it is cruel to think that, at this stage of the history of the Commonwealth, a Government should be so lost , to every sense of justice that it is prepared to sell the whole of its political principles for the sake of gaining votes. I have always admired the Treasurer; I have always looked upon him as a pattern, but here we have another idol shattered. I cannot understand the Attorney-General not putting down his foot on this legislation. Mr W. H .

However, having entered my protest against the B ill , and placed it on record so that it will be referred to in days to come when Tasmania comes along for another grant, to show that some one spoke, not from party interests or political necessities, but from the broader ground of what should operate in a national Parliament, I am ontent to allow the B ill to pass, putting the responsibility on the shoulders of men who have showed themselves so incapable, and so absolutely-unworthy of the trust reposed in them. [12.11] I protest against the niggardly treatment meted out to Tasmania. The Treasurer is telling us nearly every day that he has not the money with which to do these things, yet in bis Supplementary Budget speech he intimated that, although things looked a little black, he anticipated that before the end of the financial year there would be ample funds available. He spoke of a thumping wheat harvest, a better butter season, a good wool crop, and good prices for it, and he said that, all things considered, he anticipated the lee-way would be made up before the end of the financial year. If that is the case, the Treasurer will enjoy one of the biggest revenues any Treasurer has enjoyed in Australia; and, therefore, he is behaving in a very mean way to a State that needs more assistance than he proposes to give. He is taking a very small view of the necessities of Tasmania. He ought to be in a position to spring a little bit on this grant to the State; and I trust that, if another place amends the Bill, he will reconsider his decision, so that Tasmania",21,Forrest Nothin G Of The Once Begin To Spoon Feed A State From

If he were he would be out of order, but all that he asks is that an alteration shall be made in the scale of annual payments without interfering with the total appropriation. an intimation that an amendment of this kind would be moved, I went very carefully into the question, and it appears to me that the position is very clear. The Governor General's message recommended an appropriation of £400,000 for the purposes of this Bill, and under this Bill it is proposed that there shall be an expenditure of £5,000 during the present year. The amendment proposes to increase that amount, although it does not affect the total amount appropriated under the Bill. Let me remind the Committee that the control of all expenditure by the Crown is one of the fundamental principles of constitutional Government. The expenditure proposed by the amendment, it seems to me, cannot be said to have been recommended under section 56 of the Constitution, and I have, therefore, no alternative but to rule the amendment out of order. The principle is the same, whether the amount involved be large or small, but assuming that a much larger payment is proposed, by the amendment, to be made this year, I think that the necessity for my ruling becomes more obvious. If a grant of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 were proposed by the Bill to be made, over a period of years, it would be possible for an honourable member, if this amendment were in order, to move to confine the total payment to the year under consideration. That would place the Government of the day in very serious difficulties, and would be, as I have already indicated, quite out of touch with the principle that the Government of the day must control all expenditure. I accordingly rule the amendment out of order. That the ruling of the Chairman be disagreed with. We cannot allow what I consider-with r out any reflection on the Chairmana loose method of procedure.

Under the standing order the point may be decided forthwith by the Committee. prefer, Mr Chairman, be dealt with tomorrow. I regret to have to dissent from your ruling; but the point at issue is one in which I take a peculiar interest. Soon after the inauguration of Federation, Mr Speaker Holder gave a ruling which permitted any member to increase a Tariff Duty. To that I, among others, took strong, objection. I need not state in detail the grounds of that objection, but may say briefly that I considered the ruling bad in principle, because the Crown should not be given more money than it asks for. Subsequently I became the Chairman of Committees, and while I was in the chair, the honourable member for Gwydir sought to increase the duty on, I think, angle iron. I ruled that he could not do so, because a private member could not move to increase an impost. As honourable members generally wished for an appeal to the Speaker, I consented to that, although I did not approve of it. Mr Speaker Holder, when the matter was put before him, partly reversed his original ruling, and upheld me in the decision that it was not in order for an honourable member to move to increase a duty. The authorities lay it down as a cardinal principle that, while a member may not move to increase the amount of a duty, he is at perfect liberty to propose any re-arrangement of the tax that he may think proper.

Sitting suspended I was contending that if this ruling stands we shall stultify ourselves and establish the precedent that, whenever a B ill is brought down under a Governor General's message, we must confine ourselves absolutely to that B ill , having no power to amend. serves me, Mr Fowler, you said that the Governor General had seen the B ill , and had sent down a message in accordance with it. because we shall then have no alternative but to pass the B ill as it is, and it will be of no use our going into Committee. The Governor General's message is as follows : In accordance with the requirements of section fifty-six of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia the Governor General recommends to the House of Representatives that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a B ill for an Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £400,000 for the purposes of further financial assistance in tlie State of Tasmania. I maintain that this message is so broad that, under it, we could make the whole of the £400,000 payable in one year. The. amount expended is exactly the same, and whether it is spent in one year or in payments extending over a number of years is a matter of no moment so far as the procedure is concerned. going into the question elaborately, not having had time to look up the necessary authorities, I say distinctly that the ruling is not in accordance with our procedure. I hold that even a private member can move an amendment for the expenditure of the sum in one year. What is the object of our going into Committee? It is to try to make the B ill perfect-to elicit the ideas of honourable members, and make the measure as effective as possible. If honourable members are not permitted to make any alteration, what is the good of our going into Committee? end the discussion at the second reading ? Ifi t were a question of the imposition of taxation, and the amendment of the honourable member for Y a r r a would tend to increase that taxation, then, of course, he would be distinctly out of order; but in the present case the proposal neither increases nor lessens the amount which we are recommended to appropriate. If the honourable member had moved to decrease the amount, do I understand, Mr Fowler, that your ruling would then be that his suspended from 12.4.0 to 3.15 p.m. amendment is out of order? Under the W h e n , the sitting was circumstances, if the honourable member for Y a r r a is not able to move to increase the amount for the first year, he would not be in order in moving an amendment to the opposite effect. I contend, sir, that your ruling is not in keeping with our practice, and, further, that if it is So far as my memory maintained it will stultify us to such an extent that no honourable member in the future will be able to propose any amendment at all in a B ill of this nature.

That message says nothing at all of this year, next year, or of any subsequent year, but leaves this Chamber to decide how the money shall be appropriated. The honourable member for Kennedy put his finger on a weak spot in the ruling, and his remarks should commend themselves to the Prime Minister and the A t torney-General. ber pointed out that if he could not amend this B ill to increase the amount in any one year, we could not amend it to decrease the amount in any one year. That argument appears to be quite sound. Sir amount is a very different matter from increasing it. members to reduce an item in the Esti mates, but not to increase it. point of view there is no difference. F o r instance, in Supply we cannot add to the burdens of the people on the motion of a private member, whereas in Ways and Means that may be done. This has been upheld by Mr Speaker and by the Chairman of Committees. I hope the Government will not stand by the ruling of the Chairman, which, in my opinion, violates an important principle of representative and responsible government.

If we reduce the amount payable in one year, we must increase that payable in another, because the total is fixed in the message from the Crown, which is the warrant for the Government proceeding.

When I saw the Prime Minister rise, I thought we should hear some proper justification for the attitude of the Government; but, in stead of this, the P r i m e Minister merely said we could make no alteration because the matter was provided for in the E s t imates. I am not sure that it is ; and even if it was, the Estimates still remain to be passed, and can be altered as we desire. As it is not obligatory on us to be bound by Estimates which are not yet agreed to, the only point which the Prime Minister made falls to the ground. TheB ill has been brought down by the Government, based on a specific message authorizing the expenditure of £400,000 to grant relief to the State of Tasmania. The question for the Committee to decide is how the money shall be allocated. Prime Minister's view is right, imagine the position in which we shall be placed.

It is the duty of honourable members to express their opinions on questions of this character, and they have every right to seek to give effect to their opinions. The Prime Minister's contention is absolutely I was waiting to hear untenable, and dangerous to the future well-being of this Parliament, and the country for which we legislate. The thing is palpably absurd and unjust, and! may lead to Governments trying to carry their legislation through unaltered by anticipating it in their Estimates. Your ruling, sir, is absolutely wrong, and if there is any possibility of referring it to the Speaker, I shall be glad to do it, because be will have time to look up authorities, which I have not.

I feel confident that it is not correct. The Treasurer himself practically gave away the whole case when he said it was possible for any member to move a reduction.

It appeared at one time, from the questions put to witnesses by some of the Commissioners, that there would be a minority report; but, after the various States had been visited, the members of the Commission felt that Tasmania had suffered a real loss, through no fault of its own, from entering the Union. Before Federation was agreed to, it was held out to the various States that, should any suffer by reason of entering the Union, there would be a provision in the Constitution for giving them aid.

I understand that the Tostruaster-General was rather opposed to that view, his contention being that, under this B ill , British newspapers would go through Australia at the same rates as English newspapers go through England. member was correct in his contention. the Postmaster-General to hesitate before he proceeds with this B ill in its present form. I admit that, in 1901, when the PostalB ill was before Parliament, I took the stand that English newspapers should go through Australia on the same terms as our newspapers do. A t that time, however, I had no experience of the Post Office, and it was only after I became Postmaster-General that I realized what our concessions meant. If the Postmaster-General presses this B ill , I shall not vote' against it , though I candidly say that if I were in his place I should not have introduced the measure. Now that he realizes that it is a different measure from what he thought it to be, if he still proceeds with it , I shall leave the responsibility with him. In Australia, not only does the penny carry 20 ozs. of newspapers, but newspapers may be put in bulk, and, although there may be eighty of them, they are still carried at that rate.

211,The First Part Of Mr Thomas,"It is not a small matmatter. The Post Office is heavily burdened by the present conditions, and I do not know whether the position has ever been brought seriously before the Postniastei-General. There is the difficulty, for instance, of deciding what is a newspaper. There are people identified with various causes who wish to get little sheets cheaply through the post, and seek to have them registered as newspapers. Mr Ao'AK WYNNE have to be registered here, and 5s. a year paid for the registration. B ill as it is, we must take newspapers of the kind that are sent from England. ferentiate? What the British Government accept as a newspaper we shall have to accept as a newspaper. like; it must be a newspaper within our law. conform to our conditions? The unfortunate part is that we have given such a big concession to newspapers here that the Post Office is feeling the burden. The conditions provided in the B ill are to extend, not only to England, but to any part of tfie British Empire; and we could not object to New Zealand coming in under the same terms as does England. MrW . H . IRVINE cerned with New Zealand. that in New Zealand a newspaper up to 20 ozs. is carried for a | d . , and each newspaper has to be sent separately through the Post Office. If New Zealand asked, for reciprocity, we could send our newspapers there, but each one would have to pay the ^ d . , whereas the New Zealand people could send any number of newspapers which, if they weighed less than 20 ozs., would go through on the same terms as ours. That surely is no small thing. The Attorney-General would realize the position if he knew the bother that arises about Christmas time in the big post-offices. When I was at the Post Office for eighteen months, this was one of the matters with which I tried to grapple, and I endeavoured to put the newspapers on a fair scale. there were a great many difficulties, and the second proposal in the B ill , though I found that any alteration of the kind I do not think it will be of considerable It is a very serious I desired would h it the small newspapers, and not the big newspapers. However, as I say, if the Postmaster-General chooses to take the responsibility of putting this B ill through, I shall not vote against it ; but, in a friendly way, and w one who has been at the Post Office, I suggest that he should not do so. Since speaking on the B ill last evening, I have been thinking the matter over, and, as I understand the position, the S u c h sheets will Postmaster-General proposes to allow letter-telegrams to be sent after 6 o'clock in the evening to any post-offices which are now open. He is not going to open B ut if we agree to the any new offices? No , no. quired to do so. General is not going to open any new post-offices for these letter-telegrams, and is only going to employ the present staff, expenditure, and that he will not lose much revenue. W h a t will happen will But supposing they be that a large number of persons who now send telegrams consisting of sixteen words per Is. before 6 o'clock will send them after 6 o'clock as letter-telegrams. Thus they will send letter-telegrams at the rate of Is. for forty words, instead of at the rate of Is. for sixteen words. MrW . H . IRVINE We shall get a good many other telegrams, too. We are not conadvantage. But , even if there be no added revenue, there will be this advanI wish to point out tage : that a number of telegrams which are now transmitted under pressure before 6 o'clock will be despatched after 6 o'clock. The result will thus be exactly the same. MrW . H . IRVINE But we shall send more words. the Department any more, because not a single extra telegraphist will be employed. That is the best which can be said for the scheme. MrW . H . IRVINE A p a r t from that, it will be a great convenience to the public. MrW . H . IRVINE L e t us t ry it . However, ject.

IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [4.45] -There is really no difficulty about this provision, if honourable members will look at those portions of the Post and Telegraph Act to which it refers. some amount of respect to the criticism of the honourable member for Barrier, as an ex-Postmaster-General, on the practical working out of the whole system of the bulk posting of newspapers. criticism was directed, not so much to the reciprocity scheme, which is embodied in this B ill , as to the entire system which is now in operation in regard to the posting nf newspapers in bulk. which he has pointed out in determining what is and what is not a newspaper is considerable. that that consideration does not really affect this B ill , which will apply only to that small section of the newspaper posting business-the posting of newspapers from abroad-whic h cannot involve much revenue, all told. simply extend to foreign newspapers the same privileges which are enjoyed by our own newspapers in Australia. The total loss involved will necessarily be very slight, because the amount of business clone in the posting of foreign newspapers in Australia is very small. So that really the criticism of the honourable member for Barrier is rather one upon which an argument mightbe based in favour of a complete change in our Postal RatesA c t . The schedule to that Act provides that two rates shall be charged on all newspapers, which the present law confines to Australian newspapers. upon all newspapers posted for delivery by registered newspaper proprietors, or newsvendors, Id. for 20 ounces shall be charged, and that upon newspapers sent by private persons the rate shall be Id. for 10 ounces. using the term as applicable to British newspapers, as well as to those from other countries-ma y be posted in Australia, under the heading of "" Printed papers,"" at ^d. for 2 ounces or part of 2 ounces. by the Postmaster-General yesterday was correct, all the newspapers posted in Australia could be posted at that rate. [150] I shall be very pleased to MrW . H . IRVINE But the Postmaster-General has admitted that he made a mistake. The total amount of revenue derived from the postage of printed foreign newspapers, at the rate nf ^d. for 2 ounces, is very small indeedTheB ill can affect the revenue only to the small extent to which it will allow those newspapers to be carried at a lesser rate than ^d. for 2 ounces. The criticism I necessarily pay attention and of the honourable member for Barrier was really directed to the whole system of the bulk postage of newspapers. That may require revision, or it may not. I do not know enough about the subject to exHis press an opinion upon it. Probably, from what the honourable member has said, it does require revision. But there can be no objection to our extending to other countries that degree of reciprocity which The difficulty they are prepared to extend to us. There can be' no objection to our falling in with the reciprocal scheme which is being But I would point out adopted by other parts of the British Empire especially, and which may be of considerable advantage to it. The only effect of the B ill will be that, if Canada or-the United Kingdom, for example, allows our newspapers to pass through its The measure will post with all the advantages which are enjoyed by their own newspapers, we shall permit their newspapers to pass through our post at the same cheap rates as are enjoyed by our newspapers. The measure does not, in the slightest degree, affect our power at any time to revise and alter the whole scheme of our postal rates. We are not bound in any way to maintain the existing rates. Therefore, the B ill deals with a very small matter. I would urge honourable members to allow it to pass, and thus enable us to meet the reasonable requests ol other parts of the Empire, It provides that -The Attorney-General's argument fails lamentably in one feature, because in Australia the definition of what constitutes a newspaper is very different from Foreign newspapersthat which obtains in other parts of the world.

Every business man, has a good deal of acumen, and would not send a telegram a.t 5. o'clock which would cost 3s., when, by waiting until 6 o'clock, he could send it for ls.j and have it delivered by post in time to serve his purpose. send these letter-telegrams instead of ordinary letters? I wished to communicate with a man in the northern districts of New South Wales by to-morrow morning, I should have to send a telegram, because a letter posted in Melbourne this afternoon would not reach him until Saturday. We ought to be very careful how we proceed. The Attorney-General and the Postmaster General say that, if this system be found to work unsatisfactorily, it can be altered by regulation. Mr W. H . IRVINE.^-Even a regulation will not be necessary. have to say that no telegrams shall be transmitted after S p.m. become law, the Postmaster-General, I take it, will instruct the postmasters in charge of the various offices that are open after 6 o'clock that they must receive during the hours that they are on duty any message that is offered, despatching the telegrams at the rate of forty words for Is., and the result will be that business firms and others -who have occasion to send telegrams to places that could not be reached early enough next day by letter, instead of lodging them, as they do now, before 6 o'clock, and paying the ordinary rate of sixteen words for Is., will hold them back until after 6 o'clock, and thus get the benefit of the reduced rate. No doubt, the Attorney-General is right in saying that the Government, should they find by experience that the arrangement is a losing one for them, will bo able to put a stop to it. But, I take it, while the regulation is in force, all messages will have to be accepted. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What the Postmaster-General meant was that, should Abe system not be found to work, it can be ended. so. I think that the arrangement will' not be profitable. to send a telegram is the urgency of his business. A commercial man could not afford to waituntil after 6 o'clock for the despatch of his telegrams, except in isolated cases. wo.uld meet the convenience of business people to lodge their telegrams after 6 o'clock, provided that the messages were delivered next morning. There are a great many commercial travellers who could take advantage of the proposed arrangement. In many cases a letter posted after 6 o'clock could not possibly reach its destination by the first post next day, and these cheap telegrams would be used to get over that difficulty, whereas at the present time business people have to pay full rates for the convenience. General is advised by his officers that the arrangement will be profitable, why not give it a trial? i try constituency which is constantly endeavouring to get better facilities of communication by post, telegraph, and telephone, and finds it difficult to do so because of the want of money. Therefore, I cannot sit' quiet when a proposal is made which, I believe, will still further reduce the revenue of the Department, and leave still less for necessary works. would vote with the honourable member. proposed arrangement will benefit chiefly those in commercial life who, instead of sending telegrams, as they do now, at full rates, will keep many of them back until after 6 o'clock in the evening, and send them at reduced rates. guided by the experience of other countries. This system has been found to pay in the United States of America and Canada. what the expeiience of other countries is, but so far as I can form an opinion, a loss will result.

However, there is the safeguard that, if experience shows the system to be unsatisfactory, it can be abolished.

I take it that that is the object of the Postmaster-Generali n bringing forward this proposal, which will, I think, give greater facilities to business people. fit the whole community, because we a ll know that every man who runs a business charges all the expenditure up to the consumer. If he has to send a wire to ask if an article distributed by him is required at a certain centre, the cost is charged to the consumer. Therefore, if these facilities are given, they will benefit everybody. I take it that our desire as a progressive party is to increase, trade throughout Australia. I cannot understand honourable members wishing to stifle industry by curtailing trade. we can make it possible for the merchant of Australia to do double the business that he is doing at present, it will benefit, not only him, but the workers of Australia.

I commend the Postmaster General for rising to the occasion by in troducing such a measure. to the world, that fact should make no difference, because we in Australia should lead in these reforms if we possibly can. As representing a city constituency, I desire to give the clause a very strong support, but for very different reasons from those advanced by honourable members who have already spoken. The people who will use most this increased facility will be those in the big centres of population. The trouble is that already in nearly all, if not a l l , of the big centres of population in Australia the telegraphists work at a very serious disadvantage. The lines are overloaded, and the telegraphists are overworked. There are continual complaints as to overtime, and as to the crush of business in the evening. The telegraphists in Brisbane have complained to me repeatedly of the extra hours they have to work at night because of the congestion of business. This proposal can only serve to increase that, and to that extent it will increase the expenditure of the Department considerably. I believe it will increase the revenue also. I am sure it will be of. great advantage to the business community. the telegraphists get a fai r deal. ing as an argument against the proposal that the telegraphists will be continually overworked, but it will tax the administrative abilities of the Postmaster-General to overcome that difficulty. One argument advanced by honourable members is that this is a proposal only to utilize the lines at slack times during the day; but that can only refer to lines in the country districts. If. the Postmaster-General can If see his way to provide a means whereby, even during the time the post-offices are open for ordinary business, letter-telegrams can be handed in , on the understanding that they can be sent at any time at the convenience of the Postal DeInstead of partment, and delivered by letter-carrier in the usual way, it will be a great advantage. idea.

Other honourable members have been arguing that only on those lines that are not much used would these lettergrams be an advantage. The trouble is that those lines are in country districts,. where they are not available after 6 o'clock. The present proposal will advantage the city and seriously disadvantage the country; but my suggestion would make the concession equally valuable for the country as for the city. I cannot quite agree with the arguments of the honourable member for Denison that the proposal will increase the number of men employed in the , cities, although its immediate effect may be to concentrate business in the cities more and more. As a city member, I do not object to that. The lettergrams will be a tremendous advantage to the business with which I am connected, concerned as it is with the supply of f r u it and other perishable products.

I support the honourable member for Hunter, the honourable member for Kennedy, and the other country members, who say that every additional burden imposed upon the Post and Telegraph Department makes it more difficult for us in the country to get ordinary mail services. The only people who are likely to use this provision are business people, and those who are in love. I would give young people every facility to exchange their love messages, but I am not sure that' it is to the advantage of the Commonwealth that we should enable Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, Buckley and Nunn, Foy and Gibson, George and George, or hosts of other business people, or the honourable member for Brisbane, who says he is interested in a business that will be benefited, to save money by .this means. The honourable member for Denison said that every business man passed his charges on to the public.

There are too many honourable members who claim that the Postal Department is. an institution which should not be called upon to. pay its way, and the men who say this in the loudest tones are the Liberals, who are supposed to' be Anti-Socialists. If we establish a Department that does not pay its way, to that extent it becomes of a communistic nature. In my opinion, the Postal Department should be placed on a business basis, because to the extent that it is a financial failure the people in the back-country must suffer. Yesterday I received a letter from the Department,'saying that a service required in a Queensland district would involve an expenditure of four times the revenue that would be received, and, therefore, the Department could not grant it. There was no talk there about facilities necessit y to be given. In the city' there are frequently three or four deliveries a day, whereas in the back-country there is, in some cases, hardly a mail service once a month. We' should emphasize the fact that if all these extra facilities given to the people in the cities are to be conducted at a loss, it means pushing further away the time when we can give to those pioneering in the back-country the postal facilities they deserve. It does not follow that behave said previously, I shall support the Government in this proposal; it is in the nature of a reform, and if the Government are prepared to find the money for The Attorney-General says that it, I shall not oppose it ; but I was rather amused to hear Ministers say that if the concession does not pay it can be I said it could removed.

When I brought down the B ill establishing penny postage, in a moment of weakness I agreed to very special rates for books printed and published in Australia; but no sooner was that' concession given than it was found that the business people of Australia looked upon a catalogue as a book which could be sent through the post at a cheap rate. This certainly was never intended, and as soon as Parliament met again I tried to alter the rate; but, though I was able to make an alteration to some extent, it was not The y are only to the extent I had hoped. Years ago very cheap telephone rates were granted in W h a t means has the Australia, and there was a hubbub when we tried to put them on something like a fairbusiness basis; and I venture to say no Postmaster-General ever received greater abuse and misrepresentation than I received for so doing. I simply mention these things to show that, once a concession is granted, it is very difficult to take it away. I believe that the business people will make use of these lettergrams. I was told by one prominent business man in Melbourne a short time since that, before we closed the post-offices at 6 o'clock, they held back their telegrams until the office boy was leaving liis work at 6 o'clock, so that he could take them to the telegraph office in his own time on his way home. They did that simply to save the wages of a messenger. Sir ROBERTBEST The telegrams tliey sent could not have been very urgent. that was urgent was sent to the telegraph office at once; but in the case of the majority of the messages it mattered very little whether they were despatched at 5 o'clock or 8 o'clock. This gentleman, who is a member of a very big, up-to-date firm, told me frankly that the only difference the closing of the post offices at 6 o'clock meant was that a telegram was sent away immediately after it was written out. I doubt whether there",43,Wynne N O They Are To Revenue To The Extent Of £400 000

Even if the messages are sent after 6 o'clock, we shall still get the shilling per message, the only difference being that we shall send forty words instead of sixteen. shall be glad if the concession is generally availed of by people who do not make use of telegrams now. There is, however, no comparison between week-end cable messages and these lettergrams. The cost of sending a cablegram is 3s. per word, and it is natural to expect people to send week-end cablegrams when they can have twenty words cabled for 18s. I can well understand that this system has been largely availed of in the United States of America, where the telegraph lines are in the hands of private companies, and the rates are very high. In Australia, however, the telegraph rates are very low, and, that being so, I do not think that these lettergrams will open up a new avenue of revenue. If they do, I shall be very glad, more especially if the system means the employment of lines at a time when they are not being used to any extent, and does not result in a lot of the day business being lost. The Ministry have brought down the scheme, and with them must rest the responsibility for it. I am prepared to support it , but, if it is found to be unprofitable, I doubt very much whether the Postmaster-General, having granted the concession, will be able to do away with it. I was speaking, the Attorney-General said that this new system was to be in troduced practically by regulation, and that, if it were found unprofitable, it could be abolished without introducing an able member for Barrier the view that the Postmaster-General will find it very difficult to do away with this system, even if it should result in a loss of revenue.

I believe that business men will make use'of these 'letter-telegrams. A friend of mine, who read in the press of the Postmaster-General's i ntention, asked me about it, and I told him that I had received a notification issued by the honourable gentleman. He said that he would send a lettergram at once to one of his travellers in another State, but it was found that the system could not be introduced without an Act of Parliament. Australia is a country of magnificent distances. Under this proposal a forty-word message may be sent after 6 p.m. from Melbourne to Cairns. It would have to be repeated at Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, Bowen, and Cairns, so that it would pass through .a good many hands. I think it is usual either to pay higher wages for night work or to require those on night duty to work shorter hours; so that, if this sy*tern is availed of to any extent, and i nvolves the employment of a larger night staff, it must considerably increase tlie expenditure of the Department.

They have none of the powers, and none of the responsibilities, and none of the safeguards attached to Assistant Returning Officers under the Act. They are a sort of a peripatetic Presiding Officer, and are to be sent with a sealed ballot-box throughout the country to take the votes of certain people. The idea is really too ludicrous to be. entertained for a moment. They are appointed to go round the country and collect votes I Mr W. H . IRVINE -Let me put this point to the Leader of the Opposition. Supposing we have in an average country electorate 500 persons who desire to record their votes by post, and who would be entitled under the postal voting provisions to do so, how many peripatetic Assistant Returning Officers are to be appointed to collect their votes? If the area to be covered was only, say, from 5 to 10 miles, you would need a large number, but where the area is enormous and remote, how can it be conceived to be practicable to send Assistant Returning Officers around to collect all these votes -eac h carrying a sealed ballot-box? How are they to identify the voters? No provision is made for identification in the proposal. In the existing postal voting provision which we desire to reinstate there is the most elaborate machinery for safeguarding all these things. Section >It 111 of the Act of 1909, one of those which we desire to reinstate, provides(1) The Returning Officer shall number all applications for postal vote certificates and postal ballot-papers in consecutive order, and shall number each postal vote certificate with a number corresponaing with the number on the application. (2) The Returning Officer shall initial on the back all postal ballot-papers issued.

The provision is as follows: Assistant Returning Officers may be appointed to exercise within or lor any portion of a Division, subject to the control of the Divisional Returning Officer, : i l ! the powers of tlie Divisional Returning Officer except the powers of that office or under P«rt X . of this Act; but no Assistant Returning Officer shall be appointed in or for any portion of a Division in which less than ioo electors are enrolled.

Section 124 provides(i) In particular he shall(i) Appoint a Presiding Officer to preside at each polling place at which he will be continuously present.

We believe that the sick and infirm should be given the opportunity to vote. their having the postal vote? you were not against postal voting per se. rect in saying that. We are not opposed to the sick and infirm being enabled to vote, but not under the provisions of the old Act , which have been so open to all sorts of fraud, and under which fraud has been so extensively committed. In 1906 a very high church dignitary contravened the Act . He was in good health, and on polling day he was almost brushing his shoulders against a polling booth, yet he recorded his vote by post. . I asked the Section Home Affairs Department to institute a prosecution, as I thought he should be punished as an example to the whole of Australia, but the Department would not do it ; and when I asked whether I could institute a prosecution, they would not allow me to do so. So there we had fraud not only committed, but also condoned by the Department itself. fraudulent. It was a contravention of the Act .

Ifi t is a good provision in the one case, and the .Government endorse it, why is it not equally good in tlie Senate's amendment? Therefore, there can be no objection to the amendment on that score. many of the authorized witnesses specified i u section 110 are State servants, and unquestionably many State servants have been found to be biased. In. the States, the government has been controlled by persons hostile to the Labour party, and, as public servants would not give offence to their employers, they found it convepient of witnessing applications where they knew or thought that the electors would vote for the Labour party. not compulsory to witness a signature.

Under paragraph c of section 111 of the principal Act , the witness has to satisfy himself in one direction, and it should be equally possible for him to satisfy himself in another. The Attorney General said that it would take a very large staff to carry out this provision. I would remind him that, in the Electoral Hil l introduced this session, it is provided that every elector shall sign the butt of his ballot-paper, and that when we complained that that would cause unnecessary trouble, expense, and delay, the Honorary Minister, who was in charge of the B ill , said, "" We do not care what expense we incur, a3 long as we can secure the purity of elections."" MrW . H .

The amendment provides a basis upon -which we might come to an understanding. one of the reasons why many persons desire to vote by post is that a certain section, which invariably supports the party opposite, does not care to mix in the polling booths with those who constitute what is not very elegantly described as "" the common herd.''' snobbishness should be mercilessly suppressed. appears, but it should not be countenanced by the National Parliament of Australia. There are persons who will not enter certain polling booths because voters of a different class of society frequent them. I say this because it is well to be frank and open about the matter. The electors at large would, if I am not very much mistaken, declare that this spirit must be suppressed. and just persons would be willing to give all possible facilities for 'voting to the infirm and sick; but the honourable member for Hunter has justly pointed out that the Australian population is by no means unhealthy or diseased. in fact, the most healthy section of the English-speaking world. sick and infirm in Australia is not great. Moreover, the sick and infirm are'to be found mainly within the cities, partly because the population there is thickest, and partly because the sick are drawn from the country to the city hospitals and similar institutions. reside in the country districts. number reside in the big centres of population. Those who have been for any length of time in public life know that it is a very easy thing to pull a measure to pieces, and the Attorney-General set up I understand that one of the a man of straw.

436,Mr Groom,,56,Postal Voting Restoration
437,Mr Archibald,"seems to be a wide difference between the Government and the Opposition regarding the postal vote. parently, do not wish to confine postal voting to the sick and the infirm, but the Opposition objects to healthy and able bodied persons voting by post. Government have not yet justified their proposal, which means that a section of the community, perfectly healthy and well, shall be allowed to vote by post, while other electors must adhere to the secrecy of the ballot and vote under proper safeguards. Without reference to the proved cases of undue influence and wrong-doing, it has been established that there is, at best, an element of danger in postal voting, so great an element, in deed, that the Queensland Liberal Government abolished the system. We all agree that no one should be debarred from voting; and with a sufficient number of polling booths, and safeguards in the case of absentees and the sick and infirm, no one need be denied the right. A t the last election some sick persons were unable to vote; and the proposal now is to afford them the opportunity. The amendment may not be worded quite correctly, but for this the Government are largely responsible. Contrary to the desires of the Opposition, the Government took the extraordinary course of introducing a oneclause measure, and gave no opportunity for proper amendments to be made. the proposed amendment of the Act is not complete, however, it would be an easy matter for the Government to make it so, and they are assured of the support of the Opposition. There is, for instance, some confusion about the titles of the officials. The present officials are the Divisional Returning Officer, the Assistant Returning Officer, and the Presiding Officer, and there would be no difficulty in amending the proposed clauses so as to make it clear by which of these officers the duty of collecting the votes has to be undertaken. That duty will consist in going round to the homes of the sick and the infirm, just in the same way as an officer now goes from bed to bed in some hospitals and takes the votes. I have not heard any honourable member on the Government side condemn that practice of voting at the hospitals, and yet they, apparently, are not prepared to extend the principle to the homes of the sick, where it could be just as easily applied. In objecting to the proposed amendment, the Attorney-General exaggerated much more than did the Prime Minister, although one would expect a degree of exactness from a gentleman with his legal training. The The Government, aphonorable gentleman spoke of 1,000 people being sick within the radius of some polling booth; but that is quite a preposterous number, and he might as well have made The it a million. If there is a desire to meet the case of the sick and the infirm, let us get at the actual facts. In the fardistant places we do not find many sick people, and, in any case, the honourable member for Hunter expressed his willingness to limit the operation of the proposal within a certain radius. That would not be a bad idea; but even supposing the whole extent of every polling district were permitted, a very limited number of sick persons would be found, and they could all be visited in a day. There are many more sick and infirm in the metropolitan districts; but, on the other hand, there is every facility for visiting them with ease. As to the cost, it will only mean that of a few days' extra work of the gentleman appointed Presiding Officer, to use the term now applied. The proposed amendment is not so impracticable as some honourable members have sought to make out. If we could ascertain the number of persons sick on a given day, we should find that it was not so very large. The seriously ill are mostly in the hospitals, and as to the infirm, If their numbers are pretty well known from the' records under the Invalid and Old age PensionsA c t . As a matter of fact, the majority of the old-age pensioners vote in person, so that there would be very little trouble entailed on their account. Further, very many of our infirm citizens are in institutions where polling facilities are already provided. Altogether the proposal is not at all impracticable, nor would it prove very costly; indeed, I do not understand the Government to object to any reasonable cost that might be in curred. The alternative suggested by the Government presents drawbacks in the country of which the Prime Minister appears to be unaware. It is extraordinary that he should discover objections to the amendment, while he has not a word to say about the difficulty of carrying out the postal vote proposals of the Government. In many cases in the western district of Queensland and New South Wales, and in parts of Western Australia, an election would be over long before the certificates had been sent out and the postal votes returned.",56,Postal Voting Restoration
438,Mr Spence (Darling) [9.29],"Ther eproduced in the amendment before us? doubt, the proposal needs amendment in order to fully attain its object. What is aimed at is to meet the case of the sick and the infirm, the only persons whom we think should be permitted to vote by post. The applications nave to be sent only to the officer who has to go around and visit the home; and with the increasing number of polling booths there should be no great difficulty in carrying out the idea. It has been proved that under the system proposed by the Government witnesses cculd not be found, and thus people would be prevented, by their circumstances, from exercising the franchise. Under the amendment before us, the officer would have no doubt as to the identity of the applicants, because the sick would be in their homes, and the infirm would be well'known to their neighbours. It is for the Attorney-General and tlie draftsman to make the proposed amendment fit the conditions. When the excessive number of postal votes polled in Victoria, as compared with other places, was quoted, we were told that the position arose from the fact that the people of the. State had been accustomed to that system of voting. This, however, did not explain how it was that people who are perfectly well, and many of them wellto-do, with motor cars, and polling places all round them, were permitted to adopt this easy method. If such a loose system is to be permitted, why not conduct the whole election by post, as in the case of various organizations? The Government, however, would not go so far as that, because it would do away wholly with voting by ballot. In postal voting there is no guarantee that the ballot-papers are sent on to their proper destination; and, in any case, people who are well ought not to be permitted to vote by post. away from a polling booth. but, if it be a fact, then it is a disgrace to the Department. postal vote was exercised chiefly, not in the booth! country, but in metropolitan districts. MrP IGOTT -There were postal votes 'in the honourable member's own electorate. ought to talk to somebody who knows nothing of the subject. A few postal votes were recorded in country electorates, but nothing like the number in the metropolitan district. The Ministerial party are upholding the postal voting system, which is really a provision for facilitating fraud aud the use of undue influence. They have not the courage to abolish voting by post altogether, and let everybody vote by ballot. The absent voting provisions introduced by the late Government worked exceedingly well, and met the case of every healthy person. All that this Parliament has now to do is to make provision to enable the sick and infirm to vote-person s who are unable to attend a polling place on election day. If the Senate's proposal is not complete enough, it can be made complete The Attorney-General simply indulged in unfriendly criticism of it, although he knew that in a very few minutes tlie Parliamentary Draftsman could draw up all the amendments necessary, and that they would be passed by a unanimous Committee. If the Government reject this proposal, they will have to bear the blame of preventing the sick and infirm from voting. It was almost impossible for any layman to amend the Bill that the Government brought in. It contained only one clause re-enacting the sections of an Act that had been repealed. What chauce was there of introducing proper amendments into such a measure? The Senate's amendment would seem to a layman „ to cover the ground, and certainly seems .to be perfectly safe. Its authors have been careful to avoid the appointment of partisans. They provide for the appointment of honest, trusted men, who know the district, and whom everybody has known for years. The ballot-box in which the postal votes are placed must be kept sealed, and can be opened only by a Divisional Returning Officer. Instead of making this proposal perfect, as they could do, the Government simply criticised it, and are apparently determined to restore a system which experience has proved to be full of dangers, and a fruitful source of wrongdoing. Why should we make provision for healthy persons to vote by post who are In Victoria the too lazy to walk 10 yards to a polling 100 miles away from a polling-booth"". pens.

We' cannot be expected to consider a proposition which honourable members opposite are not able to explain, and when they are unable to tell us what is required to make it an effective proposition for the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth. Reading the daily press and speeches made by Ministers, I came to the conclusion that the only object the Government had in submitting their B ill was to give the sick and infirm the right to vote. In one of the leading dailies, a week or two ago, it was stated that the abolition of the postal vote had deprived 75,000 women in Australia of the right to vote at the last election. have been made by Ministerialists during the last six or twelve months. the honourable member for Gippsland makes the remarkable admission that the great majority of the people who utilized the postal vote in the 1910 elections consisted, not of the sick and infirm, but of commercial men living in Kooyong and electorates of that description. no desire to make any charges against enthusiastic people working on behalf of parties, but the heavy postal vote in Kooyong and Fawkneri n 1910 was coincident with the fact that in those two constituencies there was a greater number of domestic servants employed than in any Other two constituencies. to vote? tioneering tactics that were adopted in Kooyong, and in a certain portion of the electorate of Fawkner, in connection with that election.

I do not believe that that is so. Many honourable members on this side I know the elecrepresent rural constituencies in different parts of Australia , and they defended the action of the Fisher Government in abolishing the old postal voting system.

488,Mr Hannan,"There is a greatthe effect of the rural workers' log on agricultural constituencies, no one in this House does. of the effect of tlie misleading statements' and misrepresentations made by honourable members opposite during the last election campaign. this debate ha^ enabled us to obtain from the party opposite an admission of which I hope a great deal of notice will be takenI refer 1o their statement that the postal voting system, as we know it, was utilized, not by the sick and the infirm, but by those generally connected with the. trade and commerce of the community. If we have to go to the country, I trust that we shall do so on the question of the postal vote. But those who did honourable members opposite the honour of returning them to this House in a majority look to them to appeal to them again on some larger question than that involved in the measure which the Attorney-General placed before the House -a few weeks ago. They expected them to bring down legislation which would give the country that financial stability which they were led to believe had been destroyed by the Labour party. Instead -of any such legislation, however, we find the Government placing before us measures such as this, and saying that they -constitute a sufficient ground on which to send members of both Houses to the -country. If this Parliament is not to run its full life, I hope that the appeal to the people will be on the question of the jpostal vote. I certainly shall be able to tell my constituents that the Labour party dn the National Parliament did their best -to place on the statute-book a B ill to give pass legislation to give facilities for the reasonable facilities for the sick, the in-firm, and the absent to vote. We find that both parties in this Parlia(lnent are now agreed that the privilege -of voting by post should be given to the sick and the infirm. But what is the position? We sent up to another place -a B ill providing for voting by post,'and providing, also, the machinery necessary to enable the system to be carried out. That measure has been returned to us -amended in such a way that it contains absolutely no machinery clauses. Almost -every member of the Opposition who has -.spoken has emphasized the necessity for ^safeguarding the system, but where, I would ask them, is there in the amendment made by the Senate' anything to make fraud impossible? The Attorney General has pointed out very clearly that We are well aware no machinery is provided in the B ill as amended to enable this provision to be properly brought into operation. I have carefully examined the amendments, and I am pleased that find that they provide no penalties in respect of any contravention of the law. I invite honourable members to consider the absurdity of the Opposition in making such amendments. TheB ill , as amended by another place, .contains no punitive provisions. The proposal in regard to travelling booths is impracticable, and, in any event, would prove too costly. Section 109A of the principal Act contains a long list of eminently-qualified and reputable persons who may witness the recording of postal votes, but under the Bill, as amended by another place, the only person who may witness a postal ballot paper is the Assistant Returning Officer -who , as the Attorney-General has pointed out, is in no way under the discipline of the principal Act-and if the voter so desires, "" a relative or other person "" may be present. I would' ask the honourable member for Maranoa, who has been particularly severe in his condemnation of justices of the peace, who "" the other persons "" are likely to be. Do not these words leave the door open to fraud? Might not a person with fraudulent intent take with him as a witness a person having no proper qualification to witness postal votes? It should be very clear to the country, as it is to honourable members, that the attempt of the Government is not to voting of the sick and the infirm, but to throw down the gauntlet with a view to securing a fight in the constituencies on the postal vote. If honourable members opposite were desirous of legislating for tlie benefit of the sick and the infirm, they would have approached the amendment in an amicable spirit, with a view to making it acceptable. I never knew the Attorney-General to advance arguments weaker than those that he used to-night. He and the Prime Minister, instead of employing sound arguments against the amendment, found fault with its drafting, and tried to prove that it would be ineffective. The first point they took was that it left the collecting of votes to the Assistant Return-",61,Postal Voting Restoration

It would be easy to alter the amendment to provide that tlie Returning Officer shall instruct the Presiding Officer appointed to the nearest polling boothto do the work. one knows that that is what is intended.

Among the large body of persons named in the old Act as authorized witnesses it is much more likely that there may be some by whom fraud might be committedthough I do not say that fraud would be committed by any of them-tha n it is that fraud would be committed by any Presiding Officer. But evidently what the Government want is, not an amicable settlement of our differences, but a fight. I admit that it is-. But Ministers consider themselves pledged to the restoration of the postal voting system in its entirety, and are not prepared to compromise in any way. It hasbeensaid that no penalties are provided for a breach of the Senate's amendment; but 1 would point out that among tlie oldThe Attorney-General provisions for postal voting there are no ; fewer than twelve sections providing machinery for the workingo f the postal vote, and this machinery could easily be modified to make it applicable to the proposed arrangements for recording the voting of the sick and infirm.
