It forms a natural border in the west of my electorate of Stirling. Many happy days are spent by Stirling residents-and, indeed, residents from across Perth-enjoying both the beach and the surrounding amenities. I cannot think of a more beautiful coastline anywhere in Australia. With the summer months approaching, the volunteer surf lifesaving staff at Scarborough Beach are doing increasingly important work, because they save lives. These dedicated people are vital in our community. As the vice-patron of the Western Australian surf lifesaving association and someone who has long been associated with their activities-particularly with the Scarboro Surf Life Saving Club and the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club, which is a little further north-I could not imagine the beaches without them. So it is with great anger and frustration today that I rise to talk about what can only be described as antisocial behaviour at its worse. I am deeply appalled by the actions of a few alcohol fuelled hoons last Sunday at Scarborough Beach. So violent was their behaviour against volunteer surf lifesavers who were trying to assist an underage drinker that they caused the surf lifesavers to fear for their lives and they were forced to abandon their posts. They were verbally abused and had empty bottles thrown at them. This is totally unacceptable behaviour towards any person, but to direct it at volunteer surf lifesavers truly beggars belief. Thank goodness there were no serious incidents in the water at that time, because quite frankly somebody could have drowned. It is critical that the hard working volunteers are able to carry out their duties on their beaches during the summer months unimpeded by hoons and, quite frankly, idiots. It is the actions of a few people who spoil it for the majority of the law-abiding citizens and families who use the beaches in Stirling. It is even more distressing that this sort of behaviour is occurring more frequently. Crime is without a doubt one of the top issues of concern to my local community, and I am proud of our achievements-including $150,000 for CCTV cameras to be installed on Scarborough Beach. These will hopefully help to identify the hoons who use it as a racetrack and to prevent antisocial behaviour. I am pleased to be working with Liza Harvey, the new member for Scarborough, who secured during her own election campaign a commitment that an elected Liberal government would provide the local police with two quad bikes that could be utilised for beach patrols during the summer months. I welcome and wholeheartedly support the new state police minister, Rob Johnson. He has met with the police commissioner, Karl O’Callaghan, about the possibility of installing a new mobile policing unit at Scarborough Beach. I have written to the minister and offered my full support. We must do everything we can to stamp out this antisocial behaviour. Kokoda Trail Today as in 1915 men are dying so that the nation may live. There will come a new dawn, bringing with it peace and freedom for the peoples of the world, but we can reach it only by striving bravely through the storm and the blood and the grief of war. This was our darkest hour, the time of our greatest peril and our greatest generation. The first among them were men who stood tall in the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range. Our official war history, penned by Colonel F. Kingsley Norris, contains a stirring description of the track they fought along: Imagine an area of approximately 100 miles long … Cover this thickly with jungle, short trees and tall trees tangled with great entwining savage vines … through the oppression of this density cut a little native track two to three feet wide, up the ridges, over the spurs, around gorges and down across swiftly flowing happy mountain streams. Where the track clambers up the mountainsides, cut steps-big steps, little steps, steep steps-or clear the soil from the tree roots … Every now and then leave beside the track dumps of discarded putrefying food, occasional dead bodies, and human foulings. Fighting was tough. Success came at an enormous price: 625 Australians were killed in action on the track and more than 1,600 were wounded. Casualties due to sickness exceeded 4,000. Their sacrifices will never be forgotten. Every year there are fewer voices left to tell this story. It is important that this story is passed on to the next generation of Australians. That is why I have organised a special event, to be held at the Bankstown Town Hall on 18 November, for school students and members of the public to hear more about Kokoda.

The cost of entry will be a gold coin donation to raise money for Legacy. It is hard for us who are born at a luckier time to truly understand what they endured or what was at stake. Events like this help. Another way is to make the trek from Owens Corner to Kokoda. Next year with my friend and colleague the member for CookI will lead a group of young people along the track: young people from the beaches of Cronulla and young people from the streets of Bankstown-young people who have clashed in the past but who have more in common than they realise. Kokoda is the place to realise this. It is a place where character is formed and mateships are forged. It is a place where many lives were lost but something special was gained. It is a place that explains who we are as a nation, what Curtin called ‘forever the home of the ANZAC people’-a nation worth fighting for. Greenway Electorate: Richmond Road dent-the human cost and the twisted metal wreckage smashed against fences, light poles or tangled with other cars. On Richmond Road in my electorate of Greenway last week I witnessed such a sight and the memory is still with me. Something has to be done about Richmond Road, not just at the intersection with Knox Street or the corner of St Marys Road, not just moving the speed zones from 80 kilometres to 60 kilometres an hour or from 70 kilometres to 90 kilometres and back to 80 kilometres an hour and not just having a speed camera that everyone knows is there and that people slow down for and then speed up after once they are beyond its reach. Real improvements need to be made to this road, which is the major thoroughfare between Blacktown and Richmond. Richmond Road needs to be upgraded to the standard of Windsor Road, upgraded to a dual carriageway to meet the needs of current and future users of the road. It is currently a goat track and has been for many years. I have had many complaints about Richmond Road. Almost every intersection has been a site for accidents, a number of which have been fatal. When a fatality occurs there is not just the loss of life; there is also the impact on the family, the extended family, the neighbourhood and the community. When is the New South Wales government going to stop taking the people of Western Sydney for granted and give them a decent road? How long do people have to wait for something to be done? Over 12 months ago I called on the state government to upgrade Richmond Road. Some roadworks are being done, but they are not enough and are not happening quickly enough. As the member for GreenwayI travel the road frequently-daily when I am in the electorate-and have also experienced near-misses. In the next few years, land bordering the 27 kilometres of Richmond Road from the M7 overpass to Richmond will have an influx of new residents as suburbs like Marsden Park, Riverstone, Windsor Downs, Llandilo and South Windsor expand into populated suburbs. On behalf of my constituents in Greenway and all the people who travel Richmond Road, I call on the New South Wales government to take responsibility and to find a way to secure infrastructure funding to upgrade Richmond Road. This has to happen as soon as possible. Plans need to be put in place without delay, as one more accident is one too many, as the loss of one more life is one too many and as another family, another community and another neighbourhood impacted is one too many. Lindsay Electorate: Filipino Community in my local community. Filipinos are the fifth largest ethnic group in my electorate, with more than 1,300 people speaking a Filipino language at home. They represent a greater proportion of the population in the Penrith local government area than in the greater Sydney region as a whole. Accordingly, we have a vibrant local Filipino community that is deeply committed to embracing the values of Australia while at the same time working to preserve and promote their culture. A focal point for the local Filipino community has been the Philippine Language and Cultural Association of Australia, a not-for-profit organisation established in Penrith. PLCAA have driven a number of successful events over the past 18 months in Penrith and in the greater Western Sydney region to help educate young Filipinos about their cultural heritage and to extend to the broader community an opportunity to learn more about the Philippines. Australian Filipinos appreciate the value of knowing their Filipino heritage and to assist their development as individuals so they take an active role in the community-and they are indeed taking an active role and making a strong investment in the education and development of young people in my community. Earlier this year, PLCAA organised a youth forum to help foster leadership among young Filipinos in our local area, at which I was honoured to be the guest speaker. In May this year the group opened a Saturday morning Penrith community Filipino school for young people aged 17 to 22 at the St Marys Senior Citizens Centre. Students are taught to converse in the Filipino language as well as traditional dances, music, crafts and cooking. The activiMAIN COMMITTEE",84,Constituency Statements

248,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.39 Am),"I rise to talk about the important contribution of Filipino Australiansties at the Saturday school are complemented by the Read Philippines Project, which was launched in Penrith in September last year. The project promotes greater understanding of Filipino culture through donations of Filipino and English language books and audiovisual material to the Penrith City Library. I acknowledge the hard work of all the members of the PLCAA, who have proven to be excellent ambassadors for the Filipino community and exceptional contributors to our broader community. I acknowledge the efforts of Penrith City Council in supporting the local Filipino community-in particular, former mayors Pat Sheehy and Greg Davies. Much of this activity has also been encouraged and supported by the Philippines Consulate General in Sydney and personally by Consul General Maria Theresa Lazaro, who has attended many of the events held in Penrith. I would like to express my gratitude to the Consul General for her generous support. Finally, I would like to note that the PLCAA are also leading the charge on a campaign for a social security agreement between the Philippines and Australia. This is something I have written to Minister Macklin about and will continue to advocate on. Cook Electorate there are many things that MPs in this place can do. But, at the end of the day, we should never kid ourselves because the real answers to the issues and challenges in our communities are in the communities themselves. As members in this place we have a role to play in supporting and enabling our communities to provide the leadership, energy and innovation that will make all of our communities a better place to live and raise a family. I am pleased to report today on two initiatives in my southern Sydney electorate of Cook, in the Sutherland shire, where we are working to make that type of approach a reality-and earlier the member for Blaxland made a reference to one of them. Next July, I will be joining the member for Blaxland and young people from the surf clubs in the shire for a Kokoda trek. The trek follows on from something commenced by my predecessor, Bruce Baird, to build a relationship between the Sutherland shire and Bankstown. It is all about building trust and providing a very different future for the relationship between our communities, based on mutual respect and a shared commitment to our nation, its heritage and its values. Like many members, I was very moved by the Australian Story program last year about a young man who was very prominent in the revenge attacks in Sutherland shire and climbed the flagpole at the Brighton-Le-Sands RSL and tore down the flag. But he was transformed by his Kokoda trek. On that trek he learnt many lessons about what it means to be an Australian. That young man is now a shining example of what can be achieved through that process. The other thing I would like to draw the chamber’s attention to is the Cook Community Classic, which will be held on Sunday, 2 November. This is an initiative which brings together the four surf clubs in Bate Bay to support the charitable work of four very important youth charities in the shire-Camp Kookaburra, Kids Break Free, Jacaranda House and the Rainbow Club. All of these organisations do important work for young people in the Sutherland shire. The Cook Community Classic is a major surfboat marathon, a ski event, a surf carnival, a community fun day where everyone can get together and raise money to support the clubs, which provide real stability to young people in the shire. There are over 2,000 nippers in the shire who get out there every Sunday and learn the values of thinking about others and providing service to the community and getting all the benefits of fitness and health. They also go out and sell raffle tickets. I would encourage all in the shire to get out and support that event on Sunday week because every single cent raised is going to support those surf clubs and those charities. Those charities focus on supporting people with disabilities, young children who come from families with mental illness, kids dealing with homelessness problems, particularly young women, and kids dealing with substance abuse problems and general antisocial behaviour. It is a worthy initiative and I commend it to the House. Sydney Electorate: Schools Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.45 am)-I want to draw the attention of the parliament to some very important local events in my electorate. Four of my local schools are celebrating quite exceptional milestones. North Newtown Public School and Forest Lodge Public School are celebrating their 125th anniversaries, and Glebe Public School and Our Lady of Mount Carmel school in Waterloo are celebrating their 150th anniversaries. Reaching these milestones is a terrific achievement of course, but the day-to-day care and education that these schools give are an even greater achievement. These schools, along with others-Ultimo Public School, Darlington Public School and even my own daughter’s school, Darlinghurst-were all built at a time when there was a great push to provide education to inner city children, who were in those days often very poor children. The history of these schools servicing some of the most disadvantaged communities, as well as, these days, some of the wealthier communities, is quite interesting. This SaturdayI will be launching the sesquicentenary celebrations for North Newtown Public School. Parents and teachers have been heavily involved in the preparation for this weekend’s event, and it is a terrific example of MAIN COMMITTEE",85,Plcaa S Vision Is To Develop The Ability Of Australian Filipinos To Communicate In The Filipino Language To Make
249,Mr Morrison (Cook) (9.42 Am),"There are many things that government can do and, more specifically,a school community that comes together for a common purpose. As part of the celebrations I have been asked to open a new school playground that has been made possible through federal government funding. Glebe Public School will celebrate their 150th anniversary in the first week of November. I am also very pleased to have been invited along to help them celebrate and I look forward to catching up with their local school community. Glebe has a particularly first-rate before and after school care program called Centipede, which has expanded the kids’ horizons by introducing a number of new sports that perhaps they would not otherwise have had access to. As I said, Forest Lodge Public School is celebrating its sesquicentenary and Our Lady of Mount Carmel is turning 150 this year, and I am going to join them next week for their 150th anniversary. Obviously the inner city has changed and the school communities that these schools serve have changed enormously over the years, but each of them continues to meet and exceed the expectations of their school communities and parents, and they provide wonderful care and education for our young people. I wish all of those schools and all of their students, their parents, their teachers and their school leaders all the very best for these important celebrations over this weekend and coming weeks. Cowan Electorate: Mrs Damiana Martinet electorate of Cowan, and the tragedy that has befallen Mrs Damiana Martinet. On 30 March 2007 Damiana underwent a straightforward operation to remove a brain tumour. She awoke well but some hours later developed a haemorrhage in her brain stem and cerebellum which caused her to become unconscious. According to neurosurgeon Dr Emil Popovic, Damiana has a devastatingly severe neurological deficit-in other words, she can do nothing for herself, not even breathe. She can apparently hear and understand everything but all she can do is blink her left eye. Her condition is called locked-in syndrome, and I imagine that it would be hell on earth. To be able to understand yet not be able to move or talk, to be able to feel an itch but not be able to scratch it-it is hard to imagine anything that is worse than this. The tragedy is not only Damiana’s story but also that of her husband, Alain, and daughter, Patricia. Both are now full-time carers. Alain, who is in his 50s, gave up his job as a sales manager, and Patricia, who is in her 20s, gave up a promising career as a junior corporate lawyer. They have no social lives; they have only a routine of looking after Damiana 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Every three hours, day and night, Damiana must be turned. The care she receives at home ensures that she does not suffer constant chest infections, airway blockages, pressure sores or bladder infections. In hospital the care was never constant and Damiana suffered from all these problems. She has been breathing via a tracheotomy tube since April 2007. The cost to the family of consumables is $40,000 per year. With the support of the state government and the family, the cost of home carers and domestic help is around $200,000 per year as well as the disability pension, two carers pensions and a carers allowance. This all demonstrates that care for Damiana constitutes a significant amount of money. The alternative that the Martinet family are seeking is treatment by the Special Access Scheme. They seek access to unapproved therapeutic goods in the form of treatment by Dr Geeta Shroff of India. Dr Shroff has offered to come to Perth and personally deliver treatment using stem cells. The family submitted an application under the Special Access Scheme, category B, seeking permission to have the treatment here. On 10 October, the family’s application was rejected; however, the neurosurgeon will apply again under category A, which deals with terminal illness or the likelihood of premature death. This is the Martinet family’s one hope for any sort of future. Any improvement in Damiana’s life will greatly help the family and I ask the Minister for Health and Ageing to do what she can to assist this family. I recently wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing and I also spoke to her last week to seek an appointment. I now have a meeting with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing in November. On behalf of the Martinet family, I again strongly urge the minister to assist. Asbestos rise this morning to talk about asbestos. There is no known safe level for any carcinogen. This means that it is not known at what minimum level of asbestos fibres in breathing space a person will be safe. In fact, there are known cases where trivial or bystander exposure has led to fatal disease. No-one argues that having more asbestos fibres resident in the lungs is better than having less. Whilst anyone could have amounts of asbestos fibres in their lungs right now, no expert in the world can tell me that one extra fibre entering my lung right now will not be the one to kill me. Consequently, every single such fibre must be regarded as guilty until proven innocent. The precautionary principle entails such a presumption of guilt. I would now add the principle of outcome responsibility. If you by accident step on a dog’s paw, almost instinctively you will say sorry to the dog. If he is injured, you will try to get the dog to a vet or otherwise help them back on their feet.

251,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services) (9.51 am)-Ihasn’t anyone from the industry ever apologised to sick people, to people at risk of asbestosis, particularly those exposed in their younger years who are older now and to governments whose duty it is to police these dangers? By the mid-1960s the harm that asbestos caused was well known but asbestos kept being manufactured. In fact, 80 per cent of all the ACM manufactured around the world was manufactured between 1960 and 2003. How did they get away with this? They did it in a very cunning way. They used the campaign that generated promotable villains. They said: ‘It’s because you smoke; it’s because you don’t wash; it’s genetic. It’s not white asbestos; it’s that nasty blue asbestos.’ They were brilliantly chosen villains but none of them changed the fact that all asbestos of whatever kind is carcinogenic. Most research now shows that you do not need a high level of long term exposure to contract asbestosis. A few high-level exposures at home may be enough. ILO statistics show that 100,000 people are dying from an asbestos disease around the world per year. That is in the order of one every five minutes. Some 50 companies in the US have sought legal protection from bankruptcy and there are thousands of legal cases on the books. We need to move away from the fraudulent risk assessment of ACMs, all of which condemn many people to further exposure, and to move to what I call a prioritised removal program. Whilst to prioritise will mean some risk assessment, the paradigm shift is towards removal and away from maintenance. It is high time we stopped bequeathing this horror as a time bomb from generation to generation. There are children not yet born who will die in agony as a result of our lazy and opportunistic decisions. Politics lacks courage here and industry does not want to know. This is one of the great remaining ugly secrets of the 20th century haunting and stalking our children and us into the 21st. (Time expired). Moncrieff Electorate: Mr Austin Canty of Moncrieff. I have lived, I must say, in relative terms, a very good life. I raise this matter because recently I received a letter from a 34-year-old constituent in my electorate. His name is Austin Canty. He wrote to me seeking desperate help to assist him with his conditions. Ever since he was born, Austin Canty has endured cerebral palsy. When he was 16 he was also diagnosed with dystonia, a disease which has no cure at this point in time and which presents him with incredible pain. He wrote to me because he is seeking assistance and support and for the Australian government to work to ensure that a website is set up on dystonia, to help find a cure and to help alleviate his pain. To read Austin’s letter is to be touched by a person who, despite incredible lifetime adversity, is doing what he can to help others. Austin Canty’s family moved from New South Wales to Queensland seeking warmer weather in the hope that, in that warmer weather, he may in some way see the alleviation of some of his pain. As a result of his dystonia, a disease of the brain, he is on heavily prescribed medication. He is a difficult patient to deal with, as he himself acknowledges. He has said many times that he feels as if he has been a guinea pig while they have researched and attempted to find out what they could about dystonia. He is required regularly to travel to New South Wales because there is not the level of expertise and specialisation in Queensland that he seeks. His rehabilitation specialist in New South Wales has provided their personal phone number to ensure that he has access to them at any time that he needs it. He has had great support from friends and family. His parents, now ageing, are both pensioners and he has realised that it is exceptionally difficult for them, although of course they must have such magnificent hearts and such magnificent motivation to support their son. His former specialist, Professor Lance of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, who recently retired, attempted to do what he could in researching dystonia, but what is clear is that this is a relatively young man who does need support and help. He has written to the Prime Minister, to the Queensland health minister and to me as his local federal member, and I am certainly pleased to rise in the chamber this morning to talk about this young man’s experiences and to provide whatever bipartisan support can be made available to ensure that there is more research on, more support for and more understanding of dystonia and the unbelievable pain that it forces on those afflicted with it. I would urge the Rudd Labor government to work towards ensuring that resources are provided to this young man so that he can enjoy the life that lies ahead of him. I seek leave to table a copy of the letter that he sent to me. Leave granted. Landmines this House, the former member for Cowan, a friend of mine who is now the patron of the Australian Network to Ban Landmines. Graham Edwards reminded me yesterday of the cause inside the AusAID Mine Action Strategy and the need to increase and continue funding to this very worthy cause. I am reminded, too, that several constituents in my electorate have approached me to support such increased funding, and that is what I would like to do today.

253,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.57 Am),"Yesterday I had the privilege of coming across a former member ofThe Australian Network to Ban Landmines welcomes the fact that the Australian government committed over $100 million to mine action in the decade from 1996 to 2005 and $75 million in the period 2006 to 2010. What they are calling for is for $100 million to be granted between 2011 and 2015 for this very important cause. The Rudd government, as people here will be aware, has made a very welcome commitment to increase overseas development aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015, and this will make an increase in the commitment to the AusAID Mine Action Strategy affordable. Funding for mine action has support from the Australian population and across all parties in the federal parliament, but I would remind members-as I have been reminded by my constituents-that, while the annual number of casualties from landmines and explosive remnants of war continues to decrease as a result of the impact of the 1997 Ottawa convention, the total number of landmine survivors continues to increase. Indeed, the last Landmine Monitor report stated that there are an estimated 470,000 landmine survivors in the world today that need ongoing assistance. Further, there are 84 countries affected by antipersonnel mines and unexploded ordnances, with an estimated 200,000 square kilometres of contaminated area needing to be cleared. Funding to assist landmine survivors provides services to people with disabilities, generally in countries where such services are often highly neglected. I support this very worthy cause. I support the Australian Network to Ban Landmines, the AusAID Mine Action Strategy and an increase in funding to support this very worthy cause. stituency statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 October, on motion by Mr Byrne: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (10.00 am)-I am pleased to rise to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008. Before entering parliament, in one of my past lives I was closely associated with radio, both commercial and community, in my role as the Chief Executive Officer of the Association of Independent Record Labels. We had real concern about the capacity of commercial and community radio to act as a communication channel for local Australian artists. I also served on national committees in various areas of community radio and worked with community radio stations all round Australia on the promotion of Australian music through that medium. When discussion first began some 10 years ago about the introduction of digital radio and how that would affect the operation of radio in Australia, we had mixed views, I have to say. On the one hand we recognised that digital radio provides many additional benefits to listeners-in particular, better quality of sound, better reception and a more efficient use of spectrum-but we were concerned that, in the switch-on of digital to run alongside analog, the capacity of the new technology be used to increase diversity and the interests of smaller broadcasters be protected through that changeover period. This bill deals with the introduction of digital radio to operate, as it will, alongside analog radio, and essentially it eases many of the concerns that I had in those early years. Mainly, at this stage, it extends the deadlines for the introduction and adds provisions for different sectors of broadcasting for different periods and for different reasons. It extends the deadline for broadcasters in the mainland state capital cities by six months, to 1 July 2009, it treats Hobart as a special case and it introduces special provisions for community radio. The current switch-on deadline for the six capital cities is 1 January 2009 and, to broadcasters who do not meet that deadline, sanctions will apply. Those sanctions can be quite harsh and they include the cancellation of their rights to broadcast in digital. I am very pleased to see that ‘use it or lose it’ provision reinforced in this bill. Spectrum is limited-it is extremely limited-and, while we must provide flexibility for businesses to make the adjustments that they need, we must not allow broadcasters to hold valuable spectrum unused for unreasonable periods of time. But for a range of reasons it has become apparent that many broadcasters will not be able to meet that deadline. This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to extend the deadline for the commencement of digital radio services by six months, to 1 July 2009. It gives additional flexibility to commercial broadcasters to resolve any further infrastructure issues that relate to the rollout of transmission equipment as they prepare for the launch of the new digital services. It should be noted, though, that the ABC and the commercial radio sector have announced that the national switch-on for digital radio will take place on 1 May 2009-before the 1 July deadline. It is important to note that the extension of the deadline will not disadvantage broadcasters that choose to switch on early; it simply provides greater flexibility for those that require the additional time. MAIN COMMITTEE",88,Plcaa S Vision Is To Develop The Ability Of Australian Filipinos To Communicate In The Filipino Language To Make
254,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! In accordance with standing order 193 the time for conThat extension to 1 July 2009 applies to the capital cities on the mainland. Hobart is treated differently and given additional time again over the six months. That is not an unusual response to Hobart’s circumstances. In the switch-on for radio and the switch-over for digital television, broadcasters in smaller regional markets are given additional time to make the necessary changes for conversion to digital. Hobart is classified as a regional licence area in a number of other contexts, including the rollout of digital television and for advertising market purposes. That is because its population is roughly the same or smaller than other markets classified as regional, including, for example, Geelong, Wollongong and Newcastle. The costs for broadcasters in Hobart, should they be forced to commence digital radio services at the same time as the mainland state capitals, would be much higher than their competitors in the capital cities on the mainland. Hobart’s commercial radio broadcasters stated that, because of the higher costs of operating in small markets, they would not be in a position to commence digital radio services at the same time as larger mainland capital cities. This bill effectively removes Hobart from the capital city category and allows it to commence digital radio services at the same time as other similarly sized markets. Finally, there are special provisions for community radio-and it is quite right that there are. Community radio in Australia is a particularly vibrant sector. We have one of the better community radio sectors in the world, well known for its diversity, local content and grassroots participation in the media sector. In a country like Australia, where diversity in media content is a priority, community radio plays an extremely important role in providing a voice for many people who would otherwise not have one at all. But it often struggles. These community based organisations survive extremely well in Australia, but technological changes such as this one will make it difficult for organisations that are constantly fundraising to support their ongoing operations let alone expensive upgrades of equipment, the skilling of volunteers and access to transmitters under the new formats. The digital radio framework for the introduction of digital radio services in Australia was included in legislation introduced into the parliament in 2007. The framework required that joint venture companies could be formed by digital radio broadcasters for the purposes of holding a relevant digital radio multiplex transmitter licence and managing the transmission of digital radio services in Australia. In line with that legislation, the community broadcasters formed representative companies in each of the state capital cities with dual functions of coordinating the sharing of transmission capacity reserved for community broadcasters between individual community radio licences and representing the community sector should it choose to take up the option of joining the relevant joint venture company. In the tight fiscal environment leading up to the May budget, the government deferred funding for the community broadcasters to participate in digital radio to the 2009-10 financial year. So community broadcasters were unable to purchase shares in joint venture companies. Under this amendment, community radio broadcasters will have an opportunity, should they choose, to purchase shares in the joint venture company in line with the intention of the original legislation passed in 2007. Community broadcasters, though, will not be forced to join the joint venture company. The legislated reservation of transmission capacity remains unchanged by this investment, so broadcasters of all kinds are able to broadcast digital radio services regardless of whether they are part of the joint venture company. Digital radio has the potential to bring significant benefits to radio listeners through a greater number of channels, but it is important through the change of process that we ensure that we see an increase in diversity and not just an increase in the number of channels. The potential for both broadcasters and listeners to benefit from the introduction of digital is enormous. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to smooth the transition. I commend the bill to the House. supported by the coalition. I do, however, have a few reservations and criticisms of the bill. The amendment contains support for the introduction of digital radio transmission in Australia, a topic of great interest to me and one I have followed for a long time. I would like to talk a little bit about the introduction of digital radio services and what that might mean to regional areas-a topic I have been fortunate to investigate in a previous parliament. In September 2001 I handed down the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts report called Local voices: inquiry into regional radio. The report contained our findings from an inquiry into regional radio throughout Australia. That covered both analog and digital transmission. Chapter5 detailed the opportunities and challenges which lay ahead with the introduction of digital radio to Australia. Even though the inquiry focused on radio services in regional areas broadly, it was well recognised that the introduction of digital broadcasting was logical and, indeed, the next step for Australia’s radio sector. MAIN COMMITTEE",89,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Digital Radio Bill 2008
255,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.09 Am),"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008 isSome of the opportunities, particularly for regional areas, included an increased number of services and improved diversity of programming as well as digitally generated text services within the radio set. I do not know if it is generally recognised that a digital radio has a little screen on it that digital services can be transmitted to. You might be listening to ABC Classic FM or 4MBS Classic FM in the community network and the piece of music that is being played and the name of the conductor will come up on the screen. It can have lots of other uses, such as for weather reports, stock reports and so on. It is a very interesting medium. Digital radio also has a higher quality sound than AM or FM transmission. It has the added benefit of being able to compress the signal and send down the wire-so to speak-and then split it out again in your radio set. So you can fit a lot more into the spectrum than you can in either AM or FM. Broadcasters will be able to expand the content they offer to listeners and cater to niche audiences throughout the nation. For example, our national broadcaster submitted at the time of that inquiry that flexibility of the digital spectrum meant it would be able to channel-split-that is, effectively broadcast a number of different programs from the one frequency. It could air different livestock or weather reports for specific communities within its broadcast footprint. As a fierce advocate of diversity of content-and this is a potential feature of digital radio-I find this aspect quite appealing, particularly in a media climate where there seems to be a contraction of new, fresh and local program content. You all in this parliament know me. I have been quite a critic of the way regional radio has been dumbed down over the last decade. Digital radio gives us an opportunity to revitalise regional radio. I believe people living in regional and rural areas are hungry for live and local content, and it is something that has been reiterated by me from time to time-both in my parliamentary and coalition policy committees. In my home town of Bundaberg, we are fortunate to have a number of community radio broadcasters, which have done a great job in sourcing and broadcasting local and niche material. Doing so has made these broadcasters an integral part of the community. They reflect local views and allow the wider community to have a conversation with itself on a daily basis. I am not just referring to talkback shows and interviews with local leaders and whatever. I mean that it has the capacity to transmit the sort of music that people want. The sort of music that people on the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast might want-and this is recognised by the ABC, who have a separate transmission subunit for those two areas and down into northern New South Wales-might be quite different from the type of music people in perhaps Townsville, Tamworth or Roma might want. Again, digital radio-whether it is in the community or in the commercial field-gives a chance for greater diversity and selection. In the Local voices report that I referred to we also recognised that a number of issues need to be resolved before digital radio is introduced to Australia. We said it was crucial to have regional areas well placed to receive these services. It seems to me-and I am not being unduly critical of ACMA or the department-that a lot of the time we stumble around trying to get the capital city programs going, whether it was colour television or digital television, and then say, ‘We’ll try to catch that up three or four years down the track.’ I suppose there is a good side to that as well in that it allows country stations and particularly community radio stations, which have a lot more challenges, to get ready for the expense involved in introducing it. This bill amends the start-up date to 1 July 2009-in other words, to the middle of next year. Apparently, this extension has been brought about because of difficulties the broadcasters have been having with access and with certain digital transmission equipment. If this is the case then I support the measure strongly because it is more important to get the switch-over right than to expect broadcasters to meet a schedule that is clearly impossible. I also note that the bill makes provision for Hobart to be classified as a regional radio market for the purpose of the introduction of digital transmission. I support that as well. Tasmania has a population of only about half a million. It is a big expense. The functionality in Tasmania will be similar to a region-perhaps it will be a bit bigger than an individual region. Nevertheless, the Hobart commercial radio community have asked for this amendment. I think it is reasonable. They do not anticipate that they could meet the deadline, so I think it is fair enough to cut a bit of slack in their case. The final measure contained in the bill relates to the community radio sector and gives it the wherewithal to share in the ownership of digital transmission in the form of the infrastructure that is available via joint venture companies. The earlier explanation we used for digital radio was that it had pipes and that you could send five or six signals down the one pipe. If you are sending that into a country area, who is going to manage it? Who is going to split it up and say who does this and who does that? The previous government and the current government believed that this should be done by joint venture companies-in other words, the various commercial players should come together and make provision for the community broadcasters to participate. This is where I am going to be critical. The current government made no provision for that in this year’s budget, so the commercial guys know that it has to be introduced soon, particularly in capital cities, and that they have to go ahead and get the joint venture companies together. The vast majority of community stations, not havMAIN COMMITTEE ing the financial capacity to join them, have to stay out of the mix for the time being. They just cannot afford to be in it. So you have the commercial guys being forced to go ahead and the bill making several provisions for the community broadcasters to come into the system down the track. That is annoying for the commercial broadcasters who have gone to all this trouble to set up their mechanisms. They will have to all of a sudden restructure their companies. The bill is quite specific. It says that they cannot overcharge for their shares, they have to ensure that the price does not exceed the amount worked out under a prescribed formula; they have to, within 30 days of receiving a request from a community station, invite them to join; and they have to keep the offer open for 120 days. It says in another part of the bill that the community broadcasters have to get a minimum of two-ninths of the shares-and I am not quite sure how that works where you have a series of community stations. There are a lot of complications to be worked through and if the money had been upfront, allowing the community broadcasters to be able to participate fully from day one, we would have had a much smoother and much more certain system. There would have been certainty out there about what the face of digital radio would have looked like, first in the capital cities and then in regional areas. It would have been quite clear. No matter how hard ACMA and the department work on this, until the government open up the purse strings it is going to be a bit of a dog’s breakfast. The first 12 months will be a period of uncertainty rather than certainty. Section 5.38 of the Local voices report talked about the estimated cost of establishing digital radio transmission in Australia. We took evidence from the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia and they put the conversion at that time-bear in mind that this is some years back-at between $75,000 and $150,000 per station depending on location, size of station and service area. I suppose those figures would have gone up in the normal course of inflation and perhaps some of the equipment has become a bit cheaper over time as well, so I do not know where the balance is now, but you can see that the average community station has no chance. There might be one or two around that can do it but the majority have no chance of coming up with that sort of amount. They are clearly going to have to be subsidised. Clearly, a lot of the infrastructure costs associated with this would not be affordable for most community stations around the country. In fact, a direct quote from the committee’s 2001 report is: Given the financial circumstances of many regional community stations, it is difficult to imagine them being able to embrace digital radio unless assistance is provided by the Government. Governments were warned, the coalition was warned and the Labor Party was warned that far back. It is no good them saying, ‘We didn’t realise the difficulty.’ Of course they realised the difficulties. The government’s failure to provide funding to broadcasters, as I said before, has left the community radio sector with nowhere to go in terms of switching on to digital-no funds to purchase their hardware or infrastructure, as I also said, and no ability to access infrastructure. They are in a pretty parlous state. The fact that the government did not provide the necessary funding assistance makes the option of acquiring a share of joint venture ownership also difficult and it is very important that they have that particular connection. As I said, there would be levels of resentment because they cannot participate fully from the beginning and that will be an inconvenience to the commercial broadcasters. The committee’s report also stated: The costs associated with introducing digital radio for broadcasters are significant although it may be possible to achieve some economies through the sharing of infrastructure. Again, until you give the stations an opportunity to know what they are going to get, how can they even talk about joint ventures either as community broadcasters or more widely with their commercial colleagues? We did make provision for this in our last budget as the coalition government. We provided $2.7 million over three years for ACMA to undertake planning and licensing activities so our national and community broadcasters could make a start on digital. The government has made, I think, about $11 million available next year but, as I pointed out, that hiatus is going to be a bit of a dog’s breakfast until we give the community operators a chance to know what sort of support will be available from the government. I am a very strong supporter of radio services. I think the fourth estate in its various manifestations is an essential plank of a vibrant democracy. I rail against things like excessive networking and the combining of news services, which rob regional areas of local voices-in fact, that is why we called the report Local voices. Digital radio gives us another opportunity to enliven, enhance and create a new platform for people not just in the cities but in country areas to improve, as I said, with agricultural or Country Hour type broadcasting on the radio, a number of services that a farmer might have in his tractor or down on the workbench in his shed, places where he might not otherwise be able to have, say, a television set. This is a very good medium, and it is very important that it gets out to people in a vibrant and usable form. MAIN COMMITTEE There has been a hiatus during the last 12 months with the community stations, who play an important part in some areas. RecentlyI was in Dubbo on an inquiry into Regional Partnerships, and in the course of that we had discussions with the community station 2WEB. It really has picked up a big part of the broadcast responsibility in that area and, I might say, has attracted the ire of some of the commercial broadcasters. I was enormously impressed with that station in particular. There are others too. Stations 2MBS, 3MBS and 4MBS are great services being offered by community stations and they will be able to offer an even better service under digital broadcasting, especially if they are given the opportunity. Perhaps these stations should be given an even higher level of subsidy. They are community stations that operate on a similar basis to the ABC’s FM network. They provide a community classical music network. Some would say they are not quite as esoteric as the ABC. There is a more popular classics twist to what they do, and I find a lot of people listen to that. I know people leave radios on overnight and want soothing music to listen to on 2MBS, 3MBS and 4MBS. I appeal to the government to look, when they are doing this subsidisation of community stations-and I trust they will-to those stations that provide specialist service in quality broadcasting to see that they get some assistance as well. Finally, I support the bill-but with those reservations and with that request for early subsidy to the community stations. Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008. BeforeI get into the detail of the bill, I will make the comment-and I take on board the comments from the member for Hinkler-that community radio particularly is a very important part of our community. Certainly the development of community radio stations over the last decade and more shows their worth to the community. In my speech on this bill I will specifically look at and concentrate on some of those issues surrounding the community radio stations in my electorate. But before I talk about those things I will give some background to the bill. The bill states: The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008 (the Bill) will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to: extend the deadline for commercial broadcasters to commence digital radio services in the mainland state capital cities by six months to 1 July 2009, remove the requirement for digital radio services to commence in Hobart by the extended deadline of 1 July 2009. Broadcasters in Hobart will have the opportunity to commence digital radio services at the same time as other markets of comparable size, such as Geelong, Newcastle and Wollongong, and retain an option for community radio stations to take up shares in the joint venture companies managing the transmission of digital radio services. The measures contained in this Bill are not expected to have any direct, or indirect, financial impact on Commonwealth revenue. I would like to discuss the final measure in the bill that directly relates to community radio. The second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister states: The final measure in this bill amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and gives the community broadcasting sector an opportunity to participate in the ownership of the transmission infrastructure that will be used to broadcast their digital radio services. The government is supportive of the community broadcasters’ participation in digital radio and considers that community broadcasters play a vital role in promoting diversity, local content and grassroots participation in the media sector. Community radio is an integral part of communities such as Forde. Like many community radio stations, the stations in Forde are in need of funds. Community radio stations find it difficult to keep up with their commercial counterparts, particularly with the advancements in technology. The government decided to take a cautious approach to the introduction of public radio by reprofiling the community sector’s funding to commence in the 2009-10 financial year. As a consequence, the community sector was unable to apply for a share in the joint venture companies, formed in 2008, that own digital radio transmission infrastructure. This amendment will restore to the community broadcasting sector an opportunity to participate in the joint venture companies, in line with the original intent of the legislation introduced in May 2007. The benefits of digital radio to the sector and to listeners are enormous. My electorate of Forde is fortunate to be served by two community radio stations-BeauFM, in Beaudesert, and BFM, in Beenleigh. In a lot of ways, they are more dominant than the commercial radio stations that cover that area generally. In fact, the listening public in the area of Forde find themselves in a bit of a black hole when it comes to commercial radio transmission, and the community radio services certainly provide a wonderful community service. MAIN COMMITTEE",90,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Digital Radio Bill 2008
256,Mr Raguse (Forde) (10.28 Am),"It is with real pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the BroadcastingI talk frequently about the remoteness of some areas in my electorate-and if I mention Duck Creek Road again, I am sure a few people will raise their eyebrows. But it is interesting that even areas like Duck Creek Road get the transmissions from community radio. This is an area which, for a whole range of reasons, does not even get regular newspaper and mail services. So the wonderful thing about community radio in my electorate is that it is pervasive and it is out there. It reaches communities like Duck Creek Road, Mount Tamborine and Canungra. There have always been difficulties with community radio acquiring analog transmissions. This bill will offer organisations like BeauFM the opportunity to expand their audience. I am a former media proprietor. In fact, I owned a couple of newspapers in that region. I had a very good relationship with community radio. In fact, I became a regular financial sponsor. I take on board the member for Hinkler’s comments and concerns that there is not enough funding from government. Many organisations would like government to provide more funding. That is interesting, coming from an opposition member, because the opposition think a commercial approach to most things is important. But I adhere to that view in this case because the private sector can provide certain support where it can, as I did when I was a business proprietor. The wonderful thing about community radio is that it lends itself to being very much a part of the community and being supported in many ways. My interest in community radio goes back a long time. I have been in different roles over the years as a media person and a businessperson. I have been there and I have made comment on a whole range of things. Community radio gives the community a very direct level of news service. While the media and new services are important in my organisation, it is also very important to support a community radio station and to be able to get out a local message. BFM in Beenleigh has taken on a training responsibility. A little later in my speech today, I will mention the opportunities we have in community radio to train young people and give them an opportunity to gain more skills in the media area. BFM, the Beenleigh station, has lots of young members and has had overwhelming success in looking at ways to allow others to receive benefits from the programs that they offer. It is a fully operational FM radio station that is set up at the Beenleigh Police Citizens Youth Club and broadcasts to the local Beenleigh community. The station is a tool for the youth development programs that run at the Beenleigh PCYC, and all funding for the station has to be generated from BFM businesses. That is one of the models I have just spoken about where businesses are involved and generate a level of revenue. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day and offers greatest hits from all eras. Of course, one of the most difficult things for any radio station is to provide a program that people will listen to. While I am a great fan of Slim Dusty, many community radio stations tend to overplay certain genres of music. Community radio, in some cases, gets it right more often than other radio stations do. I know there is always a tussle within these organisations over what sorts of programs they run. Regular listeners to BFM take great pride in monitoring the development of their announcers. As I said, they have a training program, which is a great way, not only for youth but for other people with the desire, to be involved in broadcasting. I am sure a number of us in this chamber have had the opportunity to be interviewed on air or have made regular visits to a radio station. Visiting a community radio station is always an enjoyable experience, probably because it is the nature of community broadcasting to be less concerned about getting leverage from the issues, particularly political issues, in our communities. As with BeauFM, many of the businesses in Beenleigh have BFM playing as background music. So it is a wonderful thing that we can continue to support community radio through the amendments we are making with this bill. I would like to make mention of a few people who have been important in the development of those community radio stations, particularly BeauFM, which has been around since 1996. It started as a very small operation in an old caravan. Their known location was fairly mobile, because they used to move the caravan around, but they now have a very well established station with a couple of studios. As I said, it is all done on a voluntary basis through the support of the community and businesses, who see it as an essential service. I will make two points about the notion that it is an essential service. Firstly, we should look at the responsibility at local government level to consider how they might better support local radio. In the region I come from, while the local council at times provides funds for advertising or sponsorship of public announcements, I think it would be legitimate for local authorities to commit more funding to their local community radio station by making them the public announcer for events or whatever other information they want to put out. Secondly, one of the reasons the community radio network was established was to provide an emergency response. People probably do not realise that the capacity to respond in an emergency is one of the things that community radio provides to an area. While it is not called on very often, in my area we know that they are geared up to transmit in times of an emergency. It is a very important reason why community radio should exist. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to thank a number of people who have been involved over the years. Jim Dennis, who was a presenter for many years, helped to develop the radio station from its beginnings. Jim had always been passionate about good quality radio and, can I say, he was one of the people who turned Beau FM into a station of some note for news and local commentary. Councillor Dave Cockburn in the last 10 years has been heavily involved in getting Beau FM to the point at which it currently sits. While he has his responsibilities as deputy mayor of the Scenic Rim Regional Council, he still gives an enormous amount of his time to supporting broadcasting and a whole range of other things. Doug Drescher has been a long-term member of the station and one of the people who helped get the station established. I have mentioned the importance of training. One of their noted presenters is a fellow called ‘Nugget’, who in the region is well known. The name Nugget might suggest that he plays a lot of Slim Dusty, but he mixes it up. He plays lots of different things and is a very good, much revered announcer. he has put a lot of work into the radio station. And Alf Sander, who just turned 90 years of age, is still a very active on-air announcer and provides some wonderful soundtracks for people who like listening late at night. I should also commemorate the late Rex Rodgers as he was very much a part of establishing the radio station and put in a lot of work over the years. BeforeI close, I would like to sum up by saying that I support this bill and certainly the aspects that support the development of community radio. I think community radio is a vital part of many communities, particularly those that are outside of capital cities. In regions like my area it is absolutely necessary, even to those people in Duck Creek Road, because it is an important service and one of the only services they tend to get in that region. When I mentioned training I should have said that there is a great model for training in community radio in the Smithfield high school just north of Cairns. In a former role, when I was heavily involved in media, it was one high school that I visited just to see what they were doing with their community radio licence. There is an amazing amount of training that they put through that high school, training of a very high level. In closing, I support this bill. The role it plays and support it gives to local communities is very important. With that, I commend this bill to the House. rise to speak in support of and in conclusion on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008. I acknowledge the contributions of the member for Hinkler, the member for Parramatta and the member for Forde. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2008 makes amendments to the legislation introduced in 2007 that provides a framework for the introduction of Australia’s first digital radio services next year. Digital radio will launch in 2009. It will operate alongside existing analog services and promises a range of new and innovative features that will enhance the radio services so valued by Australians. The first two amendments in this bill relate to the commencement date for digital radio in the six state capital cities. Under current legislation, commercial radio broadcasters in these markets are required to commence digital radio services by 1 January 2009. Failure to do so could expose them to sanctions, including the cancellation of their right to broadcast in digital. Due to a range of reasons, including delays to the rollout of transmission equipment, broadcasters are unable to comply with this deadline. As a result, the commercial radio sector and the ABC recently announced that the national switch-on for digital radio will take place on 1 May 2009. Accordingly, the bill will extend, by six months, the deadline for start-up to 1 July 2009. This will ensure broadcasters are not in breach of current provisions for late commencement and do not have their right to broadcast in digital cancelled. The bill will also remove Hobart from the list of markets subject to the new deadline. After consultation with Hobart’s commercial broadcasters, who expressed strong concerns about their readiness to launch at the same time as the mainland state capitals, the bill will allow digital radio services to start in Hobart at the same time as other, similarly sized markets, such as Newcastle, Geelong and Wollongong. The final measure in this bill amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and restores to the community broadcasting sector the opportunity to participate in the joint venture companies formed in 2008 that own digital radio transmission infrastructure, in line with the original intent of the legislation introduced in May 2007. The government is supportive of community broadcasters’ participation in digital radio, recognising the vital role the community sector plays in providing diversity, localism and grassroots participation in the Australian media. The benefits of digital radio to both broadcasters and listeners are enormous and the government looks forward to a successful launch of Australia’s first digital radio services on 1 May 2009.

Having three social security offices in the division of Mallee and my own office not far from the one located in Swan Hill, there is an enormous amount of activity for my staff in assisting people through the plethora of programs that are offered. SoI will be listening with great interest to debate on this bill. As the member for Dawson is now here, I reserve the right to perhaps continue my remarks on another occasion. ployment Services Reform) Bill 2008. The bill will create a fairer, more effective compliance framework for our nation’s unemployed. Long-term unemployment is a challenge and addressing it requires a sensible and concerted approach by government and industry. It is not an issue that is going to go away overnight. Indeed, the proportion of people on unemployment benefits for more than five years has increased from one in 10 in 1999 to almost one in four today-an increase from 74,000 people in 1999 to more than 110,000 almost 10 years later. The goal of the bill is to increase participation in the system, to get more long-term unemployed people into jobs, into training and into the work community. This new system will be fair, taking into account the individual circumstances of job seekers in rural and regional areas. That is applicable to many parts of my electorate of Dawson-for example, where issues such as transport difficulties may impact on the ability of job seekers to meet their participation requirements. This bill is not about keeping a system that punishes the long-term unemployed. Instead, it is about putting in a system that will get people back into work: off benefits and into our workplaces. Despite what those on the other side may say, this government is committed to fairness in the social security system. This government remains committed to mutual obligation. We believe that those who can work should work, and those who are unable to work should be adequately supported to be in a position to be able to enter the workforce. We believe that this principle is reflected in the fairer and, most importantly, more effective compliance framework proposed by this bill. Some, when talking about the unemployed, cannot resist taking a cheap shot at them and their circumstances instead of looking at the circumstance and the issue holistically. Some prefer to rely on preconceived stereotypes about the unemployed. We on this side of the House will not do that. We will instead look at the facts and deliver a system that will work for those who are unemployed. The government believe unemployed people need to be given every opportunity to enter the workforce not just for the sake of fairness to the taxpayer but for their own benefit. The simple fact of the matter is that work is rewarding and unemployment is not. I reiterate that point: we in the Rudd Labor government have a very clear mandate and we have very clear views on the benefits of being employed over the lack of benefits of being unemployed. It comes to issues such as self-esteem-that is, a person’s perception of their value to the community, themselves and their families and their individual selfsufficiency in being able to work and provide for themselves, for their families and for the ones that they love. The compliance system that exists within the bill encourages commitment rather than the current, punitive approach used. That is an approach that saw too many people cut off from their benefit and from the employment search cycle. The previous system had a number of flaws that this bill will address. A key element of the new system is a no-show, no-pay clause, which aims to instil a work-like culture to employment services. In the bill, if a job seeker without a reasonable excuse does not attend an activity that they are required to attend, Centrelink will impose a no-show, no-pay failure. Centrelink will also impose a no-show, no-pay failure, for example, if the job seeker does not attend a job interview or if they attend the interview but deliberately behave in a way that would foreseeably result in a job offer not being made. This is fair. The important thing to remember in this bill is that the extent of the penalty that a job seeker who is on government benefits receives will be in the hands of the job seeker. The job seeker’s actions will determine what happens within the system. It is important to note that in this bill we have not scrapped the eight-week non-payment MAIN COMMITTEE",95,Financial Impact Statement

261,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (10.47 Am),"I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Emperiods. They have only been retained for job seekers who commit serious failures. A job seeker commits a serious failure if they refuse a suitable job offer or if they have been wilfully and persistently non-compliant. Again, this is also fair. With the issue of fairness aside, the other issue here is that the previous government’s tactic in addressing non-compliance quite simply did not work. In 2006-07 there were around 16,000 eight-week non-payment penalties applied. In 2007-08 this had doubled to around 32,000 eight-week non-payment penalties. These statistics show that what was in place was not working. These figures are proof that the Liberal government presided over a harsh and counterproductive compliance regime. We understand that wilful non-compliance is different from when a job seeker is experiencing circumstances beyond his or her control. We want a system with incentives to seek work. We want a system that has jobseekers actively participating and searching for work the entire time they are unemployed. We do not want them to be off the radar for two months, missing out on services aimed at getting them a job, as happens now. In conclusion, the government is determined to maintain a strong but fair compliance regime to encourage people to look for work and improve their chances of employment. The new system will provide a stronger safety net for vulnerable jobseekers while reinforcing the idea that jobseekers who are capable have a personal responsibility to actively seek work and participate in activities to prepare them for work. The reality is that there are many circumstances that come past everybody in life which are beyond their control. From time to time, life circumstances-bereavement, the closure of industry or change in modes of production, or global economic crises, things beyond the control of everyday human individuals-mean that people are buffeted from pillar to post and they lose their sense of confidence. When they have lost their job or if they take time away from work through the shock of or depression caused by bereavement, or the loss of a loved one from an unforeseen accident, this can destroy a person’s confidence and their ability to do jobs well, thus affecting their performance. I believe that the role of government in society is to help people like that and to give them a helping hand. I believe the emphasis and the purpose of this bill is to be fair, reasonable and just to people such as that, people who are genuine in their circumstances and who, for one reason or another, are not participating in the workforce. It is this government’s intention to encourage people who are genuine, to give them self-confidence and to bring them back into a productive workplace that increases their self-esteem, increases their self-worth, gives them dignity, respect and, God willing, a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work. But this government does not go soft on people who deliberately and wilfully choose not to participate in the role of work and the productivity of this nation. It is absolutely essential that we show very clearly that we will have no quarter with people who wilfully refuse to attend interviews and people who wilfully act and behave badly in interviews with the express intention of not wanting the job. We need to show that there is a role for government to be very firm and to bring disciplinary measures to pass. So, given all of this context, I commend this bill to the House. (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 and the changes to the job seeker compliance regime. Labor’s proposed changes to the compliance regime comprehensively roll back the Welfare to Work reforms introduced by the coalition government, and this only reinforces the Labor Party’s weak approach to tackling welfare dependency. We have to ask ourselves why they are watering down the compliance regime. We know this is for base political purposes. This is because they wish to pander to the electoral advantage they can see in keeping people on the welfare teat. They see this as something that will help them electorally and at the ballot box. The new system provided for in this bill is inherently flawed. And that is not surprising, as Labor are traditionally soft on people who just do not want to work. We know that, while that is only a small proportion of people, these people need sufficient incentive to work. In fact, as the shadow minister for employment participation and the member for Boothby, Dr Andrew Southcott, has pointed out, it will be the most lenient system that there has been since unemployment benefits were introduced in 1945. Labor’s no-show, no-pay principle means that, for each day of a mutual obligation activity that a job seeker misses, they are docked a day’s worth of benefit. For a single person on Newstart allowance, that is around $42.90 a day. It is all very well to dock somebody’s pay for a day, but that is not how the world works. If a worker repeatedly fails to show up for work without a valid reason, they will lose their job. It is the long-term disincentives that matter. It is ironic that the Labor Party want to quarantine welfare payments for truancy but they are happy to keep paying people who repeatedly fail to show up for work for the dole activities. What sort of message is that sending to the next generation? In fact, when I was previously a schoolteacher many years ago, I worked in a school in a very low socioeconomic area whose principal-one Mr Ted Sleight-said to staff: ‘We are here as cycle busters. We are here as cyMAIN COMMITTEE",96,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill
262,Mr Randall (Canning) (11.00 Am),"I rise to speak today on the Social Security Legislation Amendmentcle busters because coming through this school there are generations of children that are on the same cycle as their parents whereby they do not wish to engage in the workforce and they continually want to stay on the welfare system and this is inculcated in their children. We as teachers have got to show them a better way.’ If teachers in schools have to show them a better way, the government have to do the same. Under the model outlined in this bill, job seekers can miss six days of work for the dole activity or six job interviews over the course of six months before they risk any substantial penalty. In any case it is unlikely that the eight-week suspension period for non-compliance will ever be invoked because the comprehensive compliance assessment conducted following serious breaches gives Centrelink a wide breadth of discretion. In fact, it is a discretion so huge that it can mean that any of the following options is available: a job capacity assessment again, a review of the employment pathway plan, an eight-week non-payment period-that is there but whether they use it is another thing-or, finally, Centrelink are not obliged to take any action at all if they wish. Labor’s leniency on perpetual welfare cheats was confirmed when the Minister for Employment Participation, the Hon. Brendan O’Connor, wrote to job network providers in April encouraging them to go easy on those who breach mutual obligations. So you get a direction from the minister to go easy! That was followed up by a letter from the department reminding providers that they have a discretion when there has been non-compliance-in other words, again to go soft. There is also the risk that the changes will bring greater administrative costs to employment service providers, who are already under pressure because of the changes that Labor have made to the job network and training services, which I will go into later. The coalition is unapologetic for its stance on welfare cheats and those who simply do not want to work. The coalition government designed the mutual obligation system with the aim of reducing welfare dependency, encouraging people into the workforce and giving them the necessary support to do so-it is often called the carrot and stick method. Our compliance measures were not designed to be punitive but were instead designed to encourage job seekers to return to the workforce and use available resources to better their opportunities. Welfare to Work was an incentive for people to re-engage. There was a clear link between receiving an income support payment and contributing to society through an employment related activity. I remember talking to a number of people in my electorate who said: ‘I really didn’t want to get involved in this. How dare they send me off to work so I can receive my payments!’ But they said, ‘Once we got into the workforce and realised that the minimum number of hours that we did were not onerous, we actually wanted to work more.’ They enjoyed being back in the workforce because of the people they met, the health and welfare it had brought to them through getting out and mixing with others, and the fact that they got more money. The eight-week non-payment period acted as a deterrent for those who did fail to meet their end of the bargain, and despite what those on the opposite side of the chamber may think it was not unreasonable. Job seekers who missed three appointments, interviews, Work for the Dole activities or other mutual obligation activities over the course of 12 months without a valid reason could have their payments suspended for eight weeks. That certainly is an incentive to turn up and engage. In Canning, the overwhelming majority of those people receiving income support payments do the right thing, meeting their obligations and actively seeking employment. But there are, as I said, a small percentage of Australians who just do not want to work to receive a benefit from the taxpayer. Following long periods of unemployment, there are people who simply become welfare dependent by choice. The longer they are out of work, the harder it is to get back into the workforce. That is why early intervention programs are so important. Under the new system you can be on the dole for 12 months or more before Work for the Dole kicks in-this is compared to six months under the previous government. The coalition introduced Work for the Dole and it had almost 600,000 participants. Mutual obligation was designed to discourage those long-term unemployed from skirting their obligations-and it worked. In fact, in June 2006 there were 205,000 people who were deemed long-term unemployed. Two years later, in August 2008, that number had decreased to 146,000-quite an achievement. The coalition remains committed to ensuring all unemployed persons have the programs, assistance and support that they require to get upskilled and job ready, and this philosophy was instrumental in getting the unemployment levels in this country down to four per cent-and in Western Australia we know it got to under three per cent, into the twos. Locally in my electorate, instead of Labor taking it easy on those who blatantly breach workplace obligations, perhaps the government should give greater assistance to those who really deserve it. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House of the changes that the coalition made to social security legislation last year, particularly those relating to grandparent carers that extended participation exemptions to principal carers who are relatives but not parents of the children-in other words, grandparents who took the place of parents as principal carers or other relatives who took care of the children. MAIN COMMITTEE As I have said before, this should have been called the Margaret Saunders amendment, because Margaret Saunders from Pinjarra in my electorate was forced to leave her full-time job in her 50s when, because of a severe drug habit, her daughter became unable to look after her children. It is these sorts of people the government should be making sure there is flexibility in the system for. Margaret again contacted me this week regarding the government’s announcement of bonus payments to pensioners, carers and children. In Margaret’s email she said to me: ‘What really hurts is that grandparents looking after their grandchildren were overlooked again. Yes, some of us will receive the bonus for the kids, but a lot won’t.’ Margaret is certainly putting in her fair share, contributing to the community. She has a degenerative spine condition and the two young grandchildren. She takes them to school, makes lunches for them, runs them to sport and does everything she can, as she did many years ago for her own children. Regarding the bonuses, Margaret makes an extremely valid point. The mother of her grandchildren will receive a bonus as a disability pensioner, and her 19-year-old granddaughter also has a baby, so she gets a bonus and then becomes her mother’s carer, so gets another bonus. While Margaret will receive some money for the children she is caring for as a grandparent, she is not entitled to the carers bonus that recognised foster parents will receive. It is an inequality and it should be addressed. Margaret is one of up to 50,000 grandparent carers who believe they are perpetually overlooked. While the exemption from workplace participation was a step in the right direction, together with childcare and immunisation assistance, these people deserve the same level of assistance as foster parents receive. While I am on this social security topic I would also like to mention a recent event I attended in my electorate. Year 10 students at Armadale Senior High School held a ceremony and made a commitment not to collect dole payments in the future. On No Dole Day the students pledged that when they complete their high school studies they will not accept the dole, as they will do everything possible to get their careers underway through further studies, training or employment. This is a fantastic initiative of a group called the Beacon Foundation which makes young people really think about making a go of it. The innovative program is designed to break the cycle of welfare dependency and addresses the issues of youth unemployment. When I was re-elected as member for Canning in 2001, youth unemployment was around 17 per cent. While that number has come down to a single-digit figure, it is still a strong priority to get young people into jobs. Nationally this year 7,000 students signed the No Dole charter, with 55 schools participating. What a great example to set for young people. Let us not forget it was the coalition’s economic management and workplace reforms that, as I said previously, resulted in lower unemployment levels. In March 1996, when I was first elected to this place, the unemployment rate was 8.4 per cent. Under the Howard government, unemployment fell to 4.2 per cent, the lowest level since 1974. On the coalition’s watch, 2.1 million new jobs were created. In Canning, unemployment was at a low 4.1 per cent in June this year, which is just over half what it was when I became the member in 2001. Despite the worsening labour market under the current financial conditions, Labor has slashed funding to employment services by $279 million to 2012. Not only is funding being cut but services are being consolidated by combining seven contracts into one. Providers will now have to offer the following services: Job Network, Personal Support Program, Job Placement Employment and Training, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, Harvest Labour Services, Work for the Dole and Green Corps. They are all going to be lumped together for providers. That is a lot of work for any one provider, and no doubt many aspects of these programs will suffer. As I have spoken about before, I think it is a terrible waste and tragedy to axe Green Corps as we know it now, and I know that those who are involved in the program agree with me. In fact, I attended a launch in Mandurah a few weeks ago and they were all talking about it. Last week I met with a local Green Corps coordinator who is desperate to find a way to keep Green Corps operating in its current form. It was designed to be a youth training and development program and it has been extremely successful in securing outcomes for young Australians as well as for the local environment. Now Labor is merging it with Work for the Dole and other services in a scaled back form. Green Corps provides young Australians with far greater skills than practical horticultural skills; it gives them certification. In many cases the experience helps shape these young people’s directions and gives them the confidence they need to get ahead in life and their future careers. In fact, the City of Mandurah council is on its 17th Green Corps program. Tragically, this will end some time next year. It has done a great deal of good for the local environment, as I said, and also for the many young people who have entered into Green Corps. One of the great tragedies of the Labor Party messing with this program is that young people entering the program now will not get the same opportunities because they will be lumped in with all of these other programs including Work for the Dole. The age demographic will change, payment to the young participants will change and the whole ethos of the program in the community will change. I know that there are many people in my electorate who are very concerned about the way the Labor Party has essentially undone Green Corps in this country. MAIN COMMITTEE The government wants us to believe that this bill is fair. I heard the previous speaker, the member for Dawson, waxing lyrical-it certainly did not bring a tear to my eye, but it probably brought one to his. The fact that he was suggesting that people after bereavement could not work may have some validity in the short term, but eventually those people should go back to work. It is probably better for their health that they re-engage rather than sitting back disengaged from the community and the workforce. It is actually healthy to work. I find it appalling to use those examples for long-term unemployment, but then again I suppose you get that from the dripping wet Left. It is certainly not fair for people who want to do the right thing and re-engage and for those who believe that the work ethic is honourable. The Minister for Employment Participation has already signalled his leniency on perpetual welfare collectors, but he was right about one thing. Those who can work should work and the government should do all it can to get people back into the workforce as soon as possible. Going light on those who abuse the system and delaying mutual obligation activities for the newly unemployed will only increase a dangerous cycle of welfare dependency. In the coming economic circumstances, where the Labor Party has already predicted in its budget that 134,000 jobs will go and many commentators are saying 200,000 people will be out of work, getting people back into the workforce, particularly the long-term unemployed, should be a priority, rather than making it easier for them not to engage. ployment Services Reform) Bill 2008. It is the very relevant and important changes that this bill will bring to Australian job seekers that have prompted me to speak on this bill today. It is the bill’s focus on individual circumstances, which provides greater flexibility for job seekers in regional and rural Australia, that has also compelled me today to speak on this bill. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 aims to amend the current Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and introduce the government’s budget 2008 announcements and welcome a new $3.9 billion employment services package and the introduction of a new compliance system for Australian job seekers and providers. This is a bill that is aimed at restoring balance into a system that the previous government had taken-in my respectful opinion-too far. In the light of their failed Work Choices regime, the previous government had engineered a system that was too harsh on vulnerable Australians and counterproductive to the goals that they were trying to achieve in the first place. To illustrate the need for change, I note that an alarming trend had surfaced from the previous government’s approach to helping Australians find work. The previous government believed in punishing first and asking questions later. They believed, without any input from the recipients, in a blanket, one-size-fits-all approach to employment services, payments and penalties. In 2006 there were around 16,000 job seekers subject to the most severe action imposed on job seekers-that is, the eight-week non-payment penalty, eight weeks of no pay. But by 2007 this figure had nearly doubled to 32,000 people on an eight-week non-payment period. Within 12 months the number of people nationally serving the eight-week non-payment period had doubled under the current system. In fact, in my own electorate of Flynn in Central Queensland there was a 44 per cent rise from 2006 to 2007 in the number of people serving this eightweek non-payment period. The eight-week measure was meant to act as a deterrent for people not to abuse the system but, unfortunately, this deterrent clearly proved inadequate and the government must now work at improving the ‘carrot’ side of the equation and not simply-and, in my opinion, cold-heartedly-focus on the ‘stick’ side of employment reform. Surely an effective system should result in an actual decrease in the number of serious penalties being applied. Surely, if the current system had been as adequate as the former government would like us to believe, we would have seen the number of serious breaches decline and the number of eight-week non-payment periods decline as more and more job seekers saw fit to work in the system and return to the workforce. But we have seen the opposite occur under the current system. We have seen a sharp increase in a very small period of time in the number of people serving a non-payment period and so we have seen a clear need for action and a need to amend the system to reflect the set of circumstances that we now face. The current system of providing employment services was introduced in 2006 and replaced a decade-old welfare system. Today’s employment market is vastly different to that of 2006 and, given recent economic pressures, it is set to become even more different. It is important that a degree of flexibility is built into the system and that, as different pressures and forces are placed on our labour market, the system is able to respond to these changes without falling apart at the seams. I believe that the new bill achieves this by empowering those who work within it on a daily basis to make judgements and decisions with the best interests of the job seeker at heart. Over the past decade, the employment market has shifted. We have witnessed unemployment fall. We have seen skill shortages in vital areas. However, this has not been to the benefit of all job seekers. Today’s unemployMAIN COMMITTEE",97,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill
263,Mr Trevor (Flynn) (11.16 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Emment figures include a significantly higher proportion of long-term unemployed and highly disadvantaged Australians. In 1999, one in 10 people receiving a benefit from Centrelink had been unemployed for more than five years. Today, almost one in four people receiving a benefit from Centrelink has been unemployed for over five years. This is an increase from 74,000 people in 1999 to over 110,000 people nearly ten years on. With the changing demographics and make-up of the unemployed, today these figures represent some of the most disadvantaged in our society. Some are battling with not only unemployment but also mental illness, literacy problems, poor education and homelessness. Our job is to design and implement a better system to help these long-term unemployed and vulnerable Australians into the workforce, and I believe that this new bill will encourage just that. While the employment market and the make-up of the unemployment figures have changed, one aspect of the system has always, and will always, remain the same-that is, the Australian community strongly expects that those who receive taxpayer funded income support look for work. This is at the very core of our nation-giving others a fair go while supporting those whose luck seems to have faded. We will never alter the system so that it does not reflect this very basic of Australian understandings. What we do need to do, though, is ensure that the system remains relevant and focused on getting job seekers back into the workforce. It is often said that the most demanding of all jobs is actually looking for one. We need to support those of us who are looking for work, but in a fair, balanced and productive fashion and not simply applying a one-size-fits-all approach. The market is full of different industries, different regions and different types of employers and employees, and they do not deserve anything less. Just as there are many differences in the makeup of the labour market, we need to implement a system that recognises the many different individual job seekers and the skills that they can bring to the workforce. We need a system that encourages their commitment and engagement, rather than the current punitive approach. This bill will affect approximately 620,000 people who are receiving Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment or special benefit and currently have a participation requirement. To improve the system we simply must better align it to reflect the ethics and characteristics of the workforce. A key part of this reform is the introduction of no-show, no-pay failures. The no-show, no-pay failure is introduced by this new bill and is aimed at job seekers who, without a reasonable excuse, fail to attend a prescribed activity-for example, training or work experience. Just like in the private workforce, if an employee fails to turn up for work for a day then they will lose a day’s pay, and in this case if a job seeker fails to attend a certain activity then they will forfeit one-tenth of their fortnightly payment for each day they have not attended. A no-show, no-pay failure will also be recorded against a job seeker who refuses to attend a job interview with a prospective employer. The new bill also, for the first time, makes arrangements for people who do attend a job interview but behave in a manner that would result in the prospective employer not wishing to make a job offer to the candidate-for example, the candidate stating during the job interview that they do not want the position. Previously, the system did not take into account job seekers’ deliberate attempts to not be employed and they focused only on the actual attendance of the job seeker at the interview. This meant it was possible for certain job seekers to avoid penalties by attending a job interview but behaving in such a manner that it would be unlikely they would be offered employment as a result. The loss of a day’s pay should act as an immediate deterrent for job seekers that choose not to attend activities that will improve their employment prospects. In an effort to remain fair, payments such as rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance or youth disability supplement will not be affected should a no-show, no-pay failure be recorded; however, all parts of a job seeker’s payment will be subject to the reduced rate. Another important aspect of this new bill is the introduction of what has been termed ‘connection and reconnection failures’. A connection failure will be recorded against a job seeker under the new system if they fail to attend an appointment-for example, an appointment with their employment service provider-and do not have a responsible excuse. Instead of imposing a harsh penalty for a connection failure, the new system will require job seekers to attend a reconnection requirement. A reconnection requirement could simply be another interview similar to the one that they had previously missed. The emphasis here is clear: this new bill is designed to encourage job seekers to communicate with their service provider and with Centrelink. Better communication will lead to a stronger connection between the two parties and result in a better chance for the job seeker to obtain employment or new skills. A penalty will be imposed on a job seeker that fails to attend their reconnection requirement. This penalty will be similar to the one imposed on job seekers that have a no-show, no-pay failure; however, for a reconnection requirement failure the job seeker will lose one-fourteenth of their fortnightly payment for each day that they have failed to reconnect with the system and do not have a reasonable explanation. Unfortunately, there will always be serious cases in which the system will have to deliver serious penalties. The bill retains the penalty for serious failures by job seekers-that is, the eight-week non-payment period-but with a MAIN COMMITTEE different approach. A serious failure is regarded as a job seeker refusing an offer of suitable employment or missing three appointments or six days of activity. It is made at the request of the employment service provider and is aimed only at those who have wilfully and persistently not complied with repeat attempts by the system to have them re-engage with the system. There are many differences between the eight-week non-payment period penalty in its current form and the one that the government through this bill will introduce. Previously the system was centred on a three-strikes mentality. The first recorded failure would see a job seeker’s payment reduced by 18 per cent for a period of 26 weeks, while the second failure within a two-year period would see payments reduced by 24 per cent, again over a 26week period. The third strike would incur the eight-week non-payment period. Under the previous government’s system, during this eight-week non-payment period the job seeker was not required to have any contact with the job market or employment service provider. They must simply sit and wait for the period to end. There is no communication during this period, no connection and no chance of improved training or employment prospects. My government believes that there are better things for a job seeker to do than simply wait out an eight-week non-payment period at home. It is often said that the devil preys on idle minds and this, I fear, is what is happening to our job seekers who are caught up in the unproductive web of the eight-week non-payment period. Under the new bill the eight-week non-payment period will be retained. It will be applied to the most serious, wilful and persistent cases but unlike currently a job seeker will be able to restore their payments back by participating in an intensive activity. An intensive activity will usually involve 25 hours a week for up to eight weeks in an activity such as Work for the Dole. This is the main point of difference and one that I feel very passionately about. There is no use in a person sitting at home and further disengaging from society and the workforce when we can present an opportunity for these job seekers to participate, to reconnect with the system and to potentially learn new skills or establish new networks simply by participating in an activity such as Work for the Dole. As I stated earlier it is the greater flexibility of the new system and its focus on individual needs that will be beneficial to rural and regional Australia. This bill empowers those experts that are employed in this field and work in the front line to make decisions that will benefit their clients. Under the new scheme, employment service providers will have the discretion to decide to report non-compliance to Centrelink. Providers will be empowered to make this decision and act only if it is in the best interest of the job seeker to do so. Instead of reporting non-compliance, the employment service provider may choose to negotiate with the job seeker to find alternatives or to make up any non-compliance. Again, this will result in better communication and a stronger connection between the two parties. For the long-term unemployed, I know that the path to employment is often difficult and full of hurdles. Whatever the hurdles that they face, they deserve a system that supports them and encourages them every step of the way. We need a holistic approach to job placement, one that takes into account any barrier to employment and removes hurdles faced by job seekers, whether they are personal issues or training gaps. The benefits of employment and participation in the workforce are immense and cannot be overlooked. So much of a person’s identity and social outlook can stem from participating in employment. The workforce belongs to all Australians-even those who have felt defeated and have given up. This is a bill that will support these Australians and this is a government that will introduce reform to tackle disadvantage head on. The end result will be a system with a heavy focus on communication, on participation, on engagement and on connection, and it is because of this focus that I commend the Rudd Labor government for its leadership on this issue. I also commend the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 to the House. morning. Von was Townsville’s loss and Canberra’s gain when she came here-sorry, Von; I am embarrassing you-and we worked well together when she lived in Townsville. The provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 really need to address the issues of those who are smarties and who, in fact, want to use the system not to work but to get around the conditions that the government places in terms of mutual obligation. It also needs to address those who do not understand their responsibilities or do not have the capacity to understand their responsibilities, and they need to be helped. I have always thought that we should not be penalising people who are in that particular position. It is very hard to develop one-size-fits-all legislation, rules and policy for Centrelink, because we do not live in a black-and-white world; we live in a grey world. I just wish that we as legislators could find a way to allow our public servants to take more responsibility in making decisions in the interests of their customers. The problem is, of course, that if one public servant makes a decision here and one makes a different decision over there then that is a risk and causes some problems and conflict, but private business handles this okay. Managers in private business are able to make decisions depending on circumstances, and we should be able to trust the members of the Public Service to also make decisions and be assured that there will be no criticism for taking those decisions. MAIN COMMITTEE",100,Social Security Legislation Amendment Employment Services Reform Bill
264,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.34 Am),"Let me first of all welcome Von Harrington to the Main Committee thisLike most members of parliament, I have seen many examples of the smarties. The member for Hinkler told me just the other day about an example where a fellow wanted to continue to be on income support. He had an orchard and wanted to tend his orchard, but he wanted income support at the same time, so he was saying that he could not get a job. Apparently that became public in Bundaberg, and the fellow who lived next door to this guy rang up and said, ‘I’ll give him a job,’ but then he would not take it because he wanted to tend his lemon trees or whatever they were, but he still wanted his income support. None of us believe that the Australian taxpayer should be funding that kind of scenario. Then you see people who trawl the websites of businesses, get details from them, put them on the form which they send in to Centrelink and say: ‘I’ve asked for jobs at all these places. I pass the activity test,’ or whatever it is; ‘please pay me my income support.’ Centrelink does not have the resources to follow up to see if that actually happened, and none of us as members of parliament would want that to continue. I take exception to the member for Flynn, who said earlier that people should not have to wait at home doing nothing during an eight-week non-payment period. I do not think he quite meant that, because clearly nobody has to wait at home doing nothing if they are not being paid income support. They can still be out there looking for a job. The people who do not actually want a job are the ones who wait at home doing nothing. SoI think the member for Flynn would really agree with me that we would expect people who do not have a job and want income support to actually be looking for a job. The social security of this country is a policy issue that my coalition colleagues and I take very seriously. Substantiating this claim is the former government’s well-measured policy decision in 2006 known as the Welfare to Work reforms, one of the major reforms that we instituted in the 11 years of the Howard government. Our reason for these reforms was a clear and sensible one then, just as it is still a clear and sensible one now. You see, we believed then and we still believe now that Australians who are struggling to find employment should be able to turn to an Australian government that will help them in such an obvious time of need. We also believed then, as we do now, that a person should be entitled to receive a regular welfare payment, contingent upon certain conditions. These conditions are ones such as proof that he/she is actively seeking employment and attending workshops and meetings, when required, that might better his/her chance of gaining employment. It is quite sensible. We also strongly believe in the added social security benefit of maintaining such conditions upon welfare payments. For example, if a person contributes to the facilitation of their own job seeking, he/she is then contributing to his/her own future financial stability and nonreliance on social welfare payments. Welfare to Work is clearly a good thing. It is a good policy. Statistics alone show this. These Howard government Welfare to Work measures are working at reducing dependence on welfare in this country and assisting those Australian people who are struggling to find stable employment. The scheme is still working. Not only is it working but it is working remarkably well. It is a very good scheme. In June 2006, for example, we recorded 205,212 long-term unemployed people in Australia. By August 2008, because of the Welfare to Work policy, that number had dramatically fallen, to 146,533 people. That is a reduction of 58,679 people. Those 58,679 people can now have meaningful employment that allows them to live more comfortably. It also allows them to pay tax, of course! Those people have now instilled in themselves a sense of pride and self-worth and have gained meaningful employment that allows them to break the often vicious cycle of welfare dependency. However, unfortunately, there is one fundamental difference between the former Howard coalition government and the current Rudd Labor government. It is as simple as this: the Rudd government is attempting to introduce changes to the sensible penalties for those who treat the Welfare to Work scheme as a handout scheme. The Rudd Labor government must surely be well aware that Australian people who are deemed physically and mentally capable of doing so are better off gaining meaningful jobs than being reliant on welfare payments each fortnight. But, if indeed they do agree with the coalition opposition that employment is better than welfare dependency, why do they wish to introduce changes to a system that is currently and effectively encouraging and facilitating self-help job seeking for unemployed Australians? Why would the Rudd government wish to protract the financial instability and welfare reliance of some of the country’s most vulnerable people? Considering that this Rudd Labor government claims to be deeply concerned about providing opportunities for struggling Australians, it seems to me these amendments, which will relax the responsibilities of welfare recipients regarding welfare payments, are peculiar and ill thought out proposals. The coalition will ultimately support this legislation, but we do have concerns and they have been noted accordingly. Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (11.43 am)-I rise to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008. It is part of a package of reforms being enacted by the government as part of our agenda on workforce participation and productivity. Two of the government’s ambitions in this area are that all working-age Australians MAIN COMMITTEE have the opportunity to develop the skills and qualifications needed to enable them to be effective participants in and contributors to the labour market, and of course to help those individuals to overcome barriers to education, training and employment. The government is working on a number of fronts to meet these ambitions and the role of this bill is to introduce changes to the Employment Services’ compliance system to ensure that Australia’s job seekers meet their participation requirements and maximise their chances of being in the workforce. The bill brings about a range of possible responses to encourage participation and, importantly, the specific response will reflect the assessment of a job seeker’s individual circumstances. I think this new framework provides a flexible and, importantly, fair response by the government to Australia’s job seekers. The changes presented in this bill will replace the current compliance arrangements which, I think, are counterproductive, nondiscretionary, and contain an irreversible eight-week non-payment penalty. The bill is an important component of the new $3.9 billion Australian Employment Services that will commence on 1 July 2009. The new Australian Employment Services will help address the needs of today’s labour market, which is defined by skill shortages, historically low unemployment and a growing percentage or proportion of disadvantaged job seekers. Over the last 10 years the proportion of job seekers unemployed for more than five years has increased from one in 10 to one in four. These people are from the most disadvantaged in our community, many suffering from language, literacy and numeracy difficulties, poor educational attainment, disability, mental and physical health issues, and homelessness. The approach of the previous government included the use of an irreversible eight-week non-payment penalty for some job seekers. In my own electorate in the last year about 80 people found themselves in this situation, and I note the possible consequences of this irreversible eight-week non-payment period. They are severe, and they have the potential to extend well beyond that eight-week period. Homelessness Australia reports that up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eight-week breach lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. Thus the approach adopted by the previous government created more crises, more homelessness and more disengaged people from the Employment Services. The new Employment Services are designed to encourage compliance by introducing a work culture atmosphere. A work culture atmosphere will successfully support job seekers. Like any workplace, the new services will function on a no-show, no-pay system. This is the key I think to creating a balance between participation and penalties for job seekers. Those who do not participate without a reasonable excuse will incur a no-show, no-pay failure. This failure, though, incurs a penalty of one-tenth of the fortnightly payment for every day that they do not attend. Further, if a job seeker fails to attend a meeting with their Employment Services provider, they will incur a connection failure which calls for a reconnection requirement. That is, the job seeker is required to attend another meeting with their Employment Services provider and, if a job seeker continues to fail to reconnect, they will incur a penalty which is one-fourteenth of their fortnightly payment. So a significant change to the current non-payment penalty is that job seekers have the opportunity to re-engage and immediately participate in an appropriate activity. I think this is a balanced approach which will not send job seekers into situations of crisis. Rather, these deductions in their payments are designed to create a clear incentive for job seekers to participate in a positive way with the system, to re-engage with service providers, to attend training activities and participate in Work for the Dole events. All of these activities are designed to increase job seeker skills. The current system’s eight-week non-payment penalty will be retained but only enforced in situations of serious failure and continuous non-compliance. To safeguard those job seekers experiencing genuine periods of hardship, this will be assessed by a new comprehensive compliance assessment. It is not the intention of the Labor government to follow in the footsteps of the previous government and to allow non-compliance and associated penalties to increase. Nor is the government interested in creating severe hardship for those already struggling to find a secure foothold in the community. As part of the new Employment Services this bill also replaces the current activity agreement with a more suitable employment pathway plan. That allows Centrelink and Employment Services to create specific pathways which suit the circumstances of individuals. Under the current system job seekers go it alone for an initial three-month period before service providers are required to actively address their needs. For those new to unemployment, those with vocational and nonvocational barriers, navigating this space on their own is pretty daunting and very difficult. So the new plan’s assessment process is designed to quickly identify job seekers’ unique needs and skills and to actively establish pathways which overcome barriers to employment. MAIN COMMITTEE Job seekers assessed as the most disadvantaged will receive the most assistance. To help with this process, employment service providers will be measured on the social outcomes attained by disadvantaged job seekers. These include improvements in language and in literacy and numeracy. Increased opportunities to participate in work experience and training will also be available to disadvantaged job seekers. Programs that assist all of these groups will be implemented as part of the new employment services. This is of particular relevance in my electorate of Bennelong because constituents in these groups often contact my office for assistance in managing the complexities of Centrelink. We help mature age job seekers-and, of course, these include people with caring responsibilities-with reskilling and retraining opportunities. For job seekers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and for refugees, these programs include assistance which addresses specific language difficulties. To assist with this process, employment service providers will offer specialist assistance from staff of similar backgrounds as well as staff of mature age. Parents are another group of constituents that regularly require the assistance of my electoral office staff, and the new services also offer more appropriate services to parent job seekers. So opportunities to reskill in areas of shortage and to participate in work experience will be available to parents and mature age job seekers, and I think these changes will be of great benefit to them. To address the skills shortage as well as the global economic crisis we are experiencing at the moment, the Labor government announced last week it would increase the commitment to the Productivity Places Program by offering more than 700,000 new places to be created over five years.

Water ister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts attempted to rewrite history and at the same time tried to account for his approval of 100 billion litres of water to be taken out of the Murray River to provide water to Melbourne via the north-south pipeline. Does he not know that we have recognised that mistake in South Australiarecognised the need to wean Adelaide off the Murray? This minister thinks it is a sensible idea to go the other way and take water out of the Murray for Melbourne’s water supply. It does not matter whether or not it is coming from savings elsewhere; the savings should go back to the river. We made the same mistake in South Australia where, through the Loxton rehabilitation scheme in my electorate of Barker, some 42 billion litres of water was saved annually so that it could be put into the Murray River when it is needed most. These savings alone could be enough to save the Lower Lakes. I point out that these savings of 42 billion litres annually occurred under funding from the Howard government. The water was recovered and then sold off by the state Labor government. The minister went on to suggest that when the Howard government came to office in 1996 it had warnings about climate change impacts on water allocations within the Murray-Darling Basin. One might ask: from whom? Not from the climate change office-that did not exist at the time; not from Kyoto, because that did not occur until 1997; and not from the Murray-Darling Commission, because they had not done any work on it and really did not make strong comments about this until many years later. So who gave these warnings? This is simply the minister rewriting history through figments of his own imagination, and he should return to the House to correct this fallacy. On several occasions the government has claimed various figures for water purchases under the $50 million water purchase program. I have heard and seen ‘34 gigalitres’, ‘32 gigalitres’, ‘27 gigalitres’-a gigalitre being a billion litres-but, as we have learnt during budget estimates this week, the actual water purchase is less than one gigalitre-although I think Minister Wong got her zeros wrong when she claimed 850,000 megalitres or 850 gigalitres. She was only 1,000 times out! The minister also claimed that only 1½ of one per cent of the $10 billion was committed in the 2007-08 financial year. Of course, this was a 10-year program. You would not expect all the money to be spent in the first year. But guess who was in power for most of the 2007-08 financial year? Rudd Labor. Who stopped the referral of powers to the Commonwealth? Labor in Victoria. Who still has not paid the irrigators at the Yatco Lagoon for a commitment made 15 months ago? Rudd Labor.

266,Mr Secker (Barker) (12.49 Pm),"In the matter of public importance debate on Tuesday this week, the Minwin for the Murray and a win for the community, but Labor will not pay their obligation to a contract with the people. This is an outrage and should be corrected today. For a small, in relative terms, investment by the federal government of about $2 million, we are saving five billion litres of water every year. That is a bit over $2,000 per megalitre, which is-funnily enough-about the going price for buying water. So it is a very important initiative. We have already done the work under the Howard government’s $10 billion Water Initiative. We have returned the wetlands to their normal wet and dry cycle and have saved water out of the Murray as a result of things that were done 60 or 70 years ago. It is time for this government to honour that commitment. It is time to fix up the problem that they have created by not paying out what they should have. Hindmarsh Electorate: Multicultural Aged Care Inc. today, which I would have dearly loved to have attended. The participants of that event deserve our appreciation and collective thanks. Today is the AGM and official opening of the new premises of Multicultural Aged Care Inc. I expect that all members here or their acquaintances have had one or more loved ones age and in their latter years become in need of more care than either their spouse or their broader family are able to provide. We all know of the symptoms of ageing. Many people age well and maintain independence. Others require levels of help on certain occasions and others still require almost constant care, whether it is physical support or protection from the consequences of the onset of dementia. Few things cause me more concern for my own parents as they age than the care that they will need as they get older and the services that will be available. Those of us who engage with the aged-care sector hear of people who perhaps migrated to Australia many years ago and who managed to master the English language, or been capable of speaking English over a period of decades, reverting in their old age to their native tongue. From that time on, many simply cannot communicate with or understand those in their presence, including the best-intentioned staff of aged-care facilities. The thought of living in a world in which one is cut off from their surrounds, those amongst whom they live and the very people who are there to care for them-cut off by language and confusion that would leave most of us paralysed-is a terrifying one. So those organisations, such as the Multicultural Aged Care group, that are providing the cultural and linguistic support, directly or indirectly, for the elderly in need of particularly sensitive care deserve very special appreciation and our heartfelt thanks. Within and around my electorate of Hindmarsh there are several such organisations. Several have developed services for and a clientele from the highly substantial Italian and Greek populations that live in Adelaide’s inner western and inner north western suburbs. For example, the Society of Saint Hilarion Inc. has three residential aged-care facilities in Adelaide’s western suburbs, two within my electorate of Hindmarsh, that specialise in caring for people of Italian background. We also have St Raphael’s and St Martin’s, which prides itself on specialising in people from multicultural backgrounds. We are also fortunate to have the Ridleyton Greek Home for the Aged and St Basil’s of Croydon Park, both of which service the very large Greek population in Adelaide’s west, including the area from where I come from, which houses thousands of people of Greek background for whom English is a second language. To aid these and other organisations around the Adelaide metropolitan area, we are fortunate to have Multicultural Aged Care Inc. Multicultural Aged Care was first incorporated in 1992. Its vision statement reads: ... that all older people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds will lead the lifestyle of their choice. The MAC, Multicultural Aged Care, community has been implementing programs in support of agencies that care for people of diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds for over 15 years. But its work is not exclusively agency focused. Multicultural Aged Care has worked with all players in the development and delivery of the services that are required for aged-care residents. Necessarily, it has also been working closely with community organisations on the development of their capacities to care for elderly people and also with governments, peak bodies and mainstream organisations concerning the needs of elderly people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Multicultural Aged Care Inc. is today holding their annual general meeting and the official opening of their new premises in Mile End, South Australia. I sent a note to be read in my absence at the event this afternoon in Adelaide. I will state here just a little of what I wrote to be read to those celebrating their achievements and the opening of the new premises of Multicultural Aged Care Inc.: To the CEO, Rosa Colanero, and Evelyn O’Loughlin, Chairperson of the MAC board, I do regret being prevented from attending your meeting and celebration this afternoon, as the care for our mothers, fathers and grandparents who have come to this MAIN COMMITTEE",105,Adjournment

For their care and your ongoing work may I say thank youand congratulations on your achievement today. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Community Development Employment Projects (Question No. 300) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 2 September 2008: Where Community Development Employment Projects providers are predicting their own outcomes, what percentage of them has predicted that they can place into full time employment: (a) 10 per cent; (b) 20 per cent; and (c) 30 per cent or more, of job seekers? Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: CDEP providers do not predict their own outcomes. Employment targets are negotiated between the providers and the department. The target figure takes into account the local labour market conditions with a focus to encourage improved employment placement outcomes. Community Development Employment Projects (Question No. 302) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 2 September 2008: Have financial viability checks of all Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) been done since CDEP was reintroduced? Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: My Department will undertake updated financial viability checks for current CDEP providers. The process is expected to be completed by the end of January 2009. Community Development Employment Projects (Question No. 309) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 2 September 2008: Of those Community Development Employment Projects participants who were participating prior its rollback, how many are now in employment? Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: As at the end of June 2008, according to CDEP data around 500 participants had a CDEP Placement Incentive payment claimed for them by one of the 16 transitioned providers. Of this group, for over 70% a 13 week outcome payment had been claimed, and, for over 40% a 26 week outcome payment had been claimed as at 14 October 2008. CDEP providers can claim a CDEP Placement Incentive payment for participants who move off the program and into employment. 13 week and 26 week outcome payments are made to CDEP providers for placing and supporting CDEP participants in employment for 13 and 26 consecutive weeks. Australian Securities and Investment Commission: Unclaimed Moneys (Question No. 322) Mr Broadbent asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 15 September 2008: (1) In respect of AMP shares from 1 January 1998: can he confirm that many of the people who received shares did so as a result of AMP policies based on trust deed arrangements. (2) Where AMP trust deed-based policies existed, did the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC): (a) examine all trust deeds to confirm beneficial ownership of the shares; and (b) require each trustee to provide proof of their identity. (3) Were the shares of uncontactable shareholders retained by Computershare for six years, then sold, and the monies forwarded to the ASIC Unclaimed Monies Unit. (4) Do monies held by the Unclaimed Monies Unit attract interest. (5) Must claimants of monies held by the Unclaimed Monies Unit submit: (a) proof of their identity; (b) certified copies of trust deeds; and (c) a written agreement from all trustees, before their claims will be considered. (6) Are there any circumstances where claimants of monies held by the Unclaimed Monies Unit are not required to submit the information in (5); if so, what are the criteria. (7) Does the Unclaimed Monies Unit assume responsibility for the function of trusts once monies are lodged with it. (8) Will the Unclaimed Monies Unit extend its authority over all trusts including those involved in the original public float of AMP, in order to confirm beneficial ownership of shares (1) This is a matter for AMP to confirm. (2) (a) The shares and dividends were transferred to ASIC in period between January 2006 and March 2006. When ASIC assesses a claim it requests that the claimant provide a certified copy of the trust deed. (b) When ASIC assesses claims, all trustees must provide proof of identity. (3) Computershare is the share registry service. The AMP shares would have been listed in the shareholder’s name when transferred to ASIC. ASIC then sold the AMP shares and the proceeds from the sale of the shares are held in trust by ASIC along with any unclaimed dividends. (4) ASIC holds unclaimed monies that it is responsible for administering in the Companies and Unclaimed Monies Special Account. Unclaimed monies are held on trust for their owners, however, ASIC is permitted to invest the principal amount and earn interest on it. The owners can reclaim the principal sum they own but they are not entitled to claim any interest it has generated. (5) ASIC has standard requirements for assessing claims for unclaimed monies. Where ASIC is aware of the existence of a trust, the trustee is required to complete a statutory declaration, provide a certified copy of the trust deed that lists the trustees, provide personal identification of all trustees, and provide proof of the shareholding in AMP. (6) No. (7) No. ASIC does not administer the trust but holds the monies subject to the terms of the trust. (8) ASIC will continue to require proof of the beneficial ownership of shares where they are held on trust.",106,Adjournment
