The reason is that the seasonal mortality pattern in America has proved to be with sea dumping of nuclear wastes. I am glad remarkably stable. Monthly statistics go back to the to say that that report came down against it, beginning of the century and 33.1 per cent is higher but it left the Japanese Government with the than any previous year on record.
