Isi t a fact that the presentplant for refining sugar is out of date and has recently sustained many breakdowns? 2. Is it a fact that the present shortage of sugar is due to the inefficiency of the relining plant, and not to the coal shortage, as alleged? 3. Isi t a fact that the refinery is, in some instances, charging the same price for raw as for refined sugar? I then informed the honourable member that in regard to Questions 1 and 2 the information desired would have to be obtained from the Sugar Board, which has control of the sugar industry. More precise particulars were desired as to what refinery is referred to; and that information would be obtained in regard to Question 3. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following additional information:If the Yarraville Refinery is refered to, the following are the answers:. 1. The Yarraville plant is not, generally speaking, out of date. It can easily cope with tlie Victorian and North-West Tasmanian demand for sugar, and frequently is able to send supplies to South Australia and Western Australia. Only one breakdown (lasting one week) has occurred for -some considerable time. 2. The coal shortage is entirely responsible for the present sugar shortage. When the Yarraville Refinery resumed after the recent breakdown a quantity of refined sugar was still in stock, and if the coal strike, which deprived the refinery of coal for six weeks, had not occurred, the refinery could have supplied all requirements by working at only 80 per cent, of its capacity. * 3. No. Raw sugar, which has been in demand during the last fortnight, has invariably been supplied at the net prices stipulated in the Sugar Agreement, viz., £32 10s. 6d. to manufacturers and wholesale merchants, and £33 3s. 9d. to retail merchants and housewives. It is possible retail grocers have sold raw sugar to the public at the same price as refined Bugar (thus making a very excessive profit), but this is not a matter within the control of the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Sugar Board, or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. the report of the Tariff Boardi n regard to the proposed bounty on seed cotton, and move That the report be printed. should like to have an opportunity to peruse the report, which is of vital i mportance to the Queensland cotton industry.

The honourable member for Swan is evidently attempting to provide a way of escape for the Government in stead of endeavouring to assist the cotton growers. I have appealed to the Government so often to make an early and favorable decision that I feel justified on this occasion in asking that the cotton-growers be more generously treated. I may have of asking the Government and the Minister to reconsider the whole question of the bounties to be paid to the cotton-growers. I strongly object to the Government deciding on the amount of the bounty before the Tariff Board's report had been circulated.

I had not an opportunity to speak at that stage, because the Minister was making a statement by leave of the House. On the motion for the adjournment, however, I expressed disappointment because the Government had declined to give what the cotton-growers had asked. know what the board had recommended, as I had not had an opportunity to study the voluminous report, which was not available to honourable members, and which I hundred pages of foolscap matter. Before this motion is agreed to, ample opportunity should be provided ' to consider the board's report, and so decide whether the Queensland cotton industry should receive further assistance in order to place it on a proper basis. I understand that the Tariff Board has also made a recommendation in regard to the spinning of cotton yarn. Raw cotton produced in Queensland should be used in I am surprised that a the manufacture of cotton yarn instead of raw cotton being imported for that purpose. If we are to grow all the cotton necessary for the manufacture of cotton goods used in Australia we shall have to produce 120,000,000 l b. per annumEast year we produced a little over 17,000,000 lb. Owing to the bad season, rigid grading, and indifferent prices, the cotton growers have not been able to produce cotton at a rate which has shown a reasonable profit, or return a living wage to those engaged in the industry. The cotton growers are therefore looking to the This is the only opportunity national Parliament of Australia to give them a fair deal. Although the Tariff Board has recommended the bounty the growers asked for, this Government has flatly turned down its recommendation and proposes offering something which is quite inadequate. I am strongly opposed to such niggardly treatment being meted out to those engaged in the production of cotton, many of whom will be forced off their holdings.

[ 3 . 3 2 ] I understand that there is a provision in the agreement that £75 shall be granted to the Statesf or every m i grant received, and £1,000 for every migrant settled on the land. Although the word "" States"" is employed, I assume the Minister in that the scheme is applicable to the territories under the control of the Commonwealth. The right honourable the Prime Minister stated that up to 50 per cent, of the assistance to be provided could be granted to Australians-and by "" A u s tralians "" he meant, I presume, Australian citizens. I was delighted to read that statement, because thousands of young Australians are anxious to play their part in the development of this country. The object of the bill is to populate and develop Australia, and it promotes settlement in those parts that need settlement most, it w ill serve a great national purpose. The parts that need the most attention are the great undeveloped areas outback, on which the Government would be wise to concentrate its efforts rather than on the congested metropolitan districts. The north and north-west of Australia can absorb all the surplus population of Great Britain, w i th benefit to them as well as to the Commonwealth and the Empire. The honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said that £1,000 was insufficient to meet the cost of settling a migrant on the land. I agree that that statement is correct in regard to the southern States, where settlement schemes have failed in the past committee (Consideration rebecause of the high capital cost of land.

AlthoughI agree that £1,000 per settler is insufficient to provide for settlement under those conditions,I, nevertheless, claim that such an amount is adequate for settlement in the outback, where the Government has hundreds of thousands of square miles of laud, the initial cost of which would not be a burden upon the settlers in the pioneering stages of development. settler were placed on such land, and could invest almost the whole of his capital in improvements and stock, there would be nothing to prevent him from being successful. I have just returned from central Australia, where I travelled many miles east and west of the telegraph line, and conversed with men who were almost penniless four years ago, but who can sign their names to substantial cheques to-day. They went there without capital, their only assets being their hands and the will to conquer. Many thousands of square miles of that country are still in their virgin state, and if a man Australia are destined to be among the of the right type were given a start there with 500 sheep he could not fail to make good. When I made that statement previously the truth of it was questioned, but I have been confirmed in my opinion by seeing the results achieved by men who started with from 100 to 200 sheep each. Surely the outback places need development more than do the city areas. Although the bill specifically refers to the States, I hope that the right honourable the Prime Minister will not overlook the large number of persons who are anxious to take advantage of the scheme in the outback. If there is any question about the availability of suitable Australians, I can guarantee to supply, within three weeks, one hundred Australian settlers under the scheme, and I can further guarantee that there will be no failures among them. the absence of debt on the land. There is nothing to prevent the Government from settling at least the first batch-of migrants in those parts, and, if it did so, it would strengthen the weakest link in Mr Nelson. the chain of Australian defence. The failure experienced in connection with the soldier settlement scheme was not due to the unproductive nature of the land, but to its high capital cost. So much money was absorbed in the purchase of land instead of stock and improvements, that the overhead charges became too great a burden for the soldiers to bear. I know men who, in the last five years, have become fairly prosperous in Central and Northern Australia, although, when they settled in that country, their only capital was an axe and, as I have said, the will to conquer. I realize that from an agricultural point If a of view the land may not be equal to that in the southern States, but it is equal to the best pastoral land in the Commonwealth. There is sufficient evidence to convince the most sceptical that successful settlement could be accomplished there. Even the most severe critics of the Northern Territory admit the great sheep-calrrying capacity of the Barkly Tablelands. Numerous properties are for sale in that area, and they could be purchased at a lower price per square mile than would be charged for an acre in the southern States. The northern, north-eastern, and north-western parts of most important wool-producing areas in the Commonwealth. When I was about a hundred miles east of Alice Springs recently, I saw horses that were averaging £30 a head in the Adelaide market. A l though this country is said to be unsuitable for cattle, I saw cattle that had been raised there that were fetching £7 10s. a head at Alice Springs, despite a period of drought that had not been equalled in the last 30 years. There is no other part of Australia where two months after rain, fat stock can be sent to market. If the opportunities for migration and development in this locality are considered in an unbiased manner, it will be realized that there is no more promising field for the absorption of settlers from overseas. It is futile and unnecessary to dump migrants down in Their success will be assured by the cities in competition with industrialists. I am satisfied that the sum of £1,000 would he more than sufficient to meet the requirements of each settler in the initial stages. Within a few weeks I could obtain hundreds of persons who would be willing to settle in Central and Northern Australia if adequate government assistance were forthcoming. After all, who have greater rights to the privileges to be conferred under the migration agreement than the Australians? Many of them are prevented from going on the land at the present time merely because there are numerous applicants for every block available in the southern States. There is plenty of room in the north for all who are land hungry. am convinced that I could not do better than settle my own sons on the land there. It would be unprofitable to pay the prices asked for land in the south capable of yielding up to 18 bushels of wheat to the acre, because the capital cost would be too high. The only alternative is for settlers to push back into the interior. Several men who have done well witb sheep in outlying parts of the Commonwealth have asked me to endeavour to secure the services of young men who would be willing to put their heart into this enterprize if they were given some interest in it. At one time these landholders could obtain the assistance of aborigines, but now they are almost unable to do so, and those that are obtainable are unreliable. Some of them are endeavouring to get helpers through the "" Big Brother"" movement. I am sure that, if the Government investigated the possibilities of successful settlement in those vast areas they would find a means of absorbing the whole of the migrants to be brought out under the present scheme for a number of years, to the great advantage of Australia and the Empire generally. It is true that the North Australian Commission has the responsibility of settling the northern portion of the Northern Territory, hut the development of the great area south of the 20th parallel of latitude, which is not under the jurisdiction of that body, is equally important. If the necessary money were advanced for settlement there, millions of sheep could be raised within five years. Preference should he given to Australians who have been unsuccessful in obtaining land in the south and elsewhere. I hope that the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) will give serious aspect of the problem of migration. The principal agreement mentioned in the bill contains so many anomalies that I doubt if the Prime Minister has studied it, and certainly I defy any honourable member to understand it. I believe that it has been signed by some of the States, but it is gratifying that Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, is alive to the interests of his State, and has declined to be a party to it. It is an insult to the intelligence of the people of AusI tralia. Honourable members should note that the agreement was made in Great Britain, where it was signed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and by Sir Joseph Cook, the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Australia. What do the authorities in Great Britain know about the conditions of land settlement in Australia? This responsibility properly belongs to the Governments of the various States. The agreement provides that loan moneys to be made available under it may be utilized for the construction of sugar mills, butter factories, tramways, and other public works tending to assist in the development of rural areas. Surely we can provide for all these undertakings out of our own revenue. Our credit should be sufficient to meet all our needs. If the Sydney City Council decides to extend any of its public undertakings, it obtains the permission of the State Treasurer, and issues debentures which are taken up by the people of New South Wales, on the security furnished by the council. The people of Australia should be warned that they are being deluded in connection with these migration schemes. I have to admit that, till a few days ago, I had not studied the agreement carefully, but having informed my mind concerning the migration proposals of the Government, and the conditions of the principal agreement, I am entirely opposed to the whole scheme. Our Constitution provides that all proposals for expenditure of publio moneys shall be made by means of message from the Crown. The agreement overrides that valuable safeguard, and for that reason it is unsound and dangerous. May I remind honourable members that it is quite possible that the life of some of the materials used in the construction of public works may be shorter than the actual term of the loan? No one doubts the ability of the Prime Minconsideration to this ister, but it is obvious that, in the pressure of other public duties he has not",19,Development And Migration

The commission could then make its own arrangebe built for immigrants, or tramways or ments with the shipping overseas for the passages of immigrants to Australia and for any loans that i; desired to obtain abroad. Why should it ibe necessary for the commission to ask the approval of the Secretary of State for works such as the construction of tramways and tlie building of cottages? Such a procedure takes away from this House a measure of responsible government. The British Government, taking {full advantage of the inexperience of Mr West. this Government, has driven a hard the commission is to be appointed, why not give it power to carry out all works built railways in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia out of loan moneys, it was not necessary to ask the approval of the Secretary of State for the Dominions. The agreement I will prove ineffective. Surely we are capable of conducting our own affairs. really insult our intelligence. There will be considerable delay in obtaining the authority of the Secretary of State to certain expenditure, and, if the Prime Minister is wise, he will reject the agreement altogether. If we borrow money in the ordinary way, we shall know where what the expenditure will be under the agreement. It is an absolute puzzle to me, and there are more flaws in it than in any other agreement in existence. There is really nothing definite in its provisions. The British Government has submitted this scheme to relieve itself of some of its responsibilities respecting its unemployed by giving them an opporLoans obtained under tlie tunity to live in Australia under decent conditions. I am at a loss to understand the attitude of honourable members who are not opposed to the agreement. It will not be possible to alter it, as the honorwill admit. We must take it or leave it. The scheme has evidently been I can inform the honourable member for When the Labour Wentworth ( Mr Marks) that if his conhad voted for it , his seat would be in jeopardy. Every page of the agreement contains something to which serious objection can be taken. If cottages are to companies bridges constructed, the Public Works Department, or the commissioners to be appointed under this bill, should do the work.

43,Mr Gtjllett (Henty) [4.17],"I debe made clear that the existing agreement is not necessarily final. I should like to have the Government's assurance that, should good reason be shown for amending the principal agreement, no opposition to its amendment would be offered. Subject to the approval of all the parties to the agreement, it is desirable that there shall be power to amend it. In my opinion, the new commission should, so far as possible, be given a free hand; it should not be handed a charter already finalized. If it is to be the body that we desire it shall be, it should he authorized to recommend a revision of the agreement, if necessary, subject, of course, to the consent of all the parties thereto. But apart from that aspect of the question, the agreement is capable of considerable improvement. Without detaining the committee long, I shall direct attention in two ways in which I think it could be improved. The agreement sets out that at least one-half of the new farms to be provided by the State Governments under this scheme shall be allocated to migrants. That proportion is altogether too high. I object to so large a proportion of the farms being placed in the hands of totally or relatively inexperienced men, while there are experienced men in this country seeking land. from the point of view of the taxpayers,. both of Great Britain and Australia. amended at any time with the consent of all the parties. final agreement; it is the only agreement with Great Britain referred to in the bill; under it the commission will be. required to operate. I should like the Government to make it clear that no objection will be offered to any amendment of the agreement shown to be desirable or necessary. Instead of providing that one-half of the farms to be provided under this scheme shall be set apart for new migrants, the Government should consent to a variation of the agreement in favour of landless Australians. My second objection to the agreement is that, despite what has already been said, Britain's contribution in interest is nominal compared with what the Australian taxpayers will be called upon to pay. £17,000,000 payable in interest during the first ten years, the British Government will pay £7,000,000; but assuming that these loans will continue for 30 years, the total interest bill will be £51,000,000, of which £44,000,000 will be paid by the Australian taxpayers. It will, therefore, be seen that Australia, in addition to repaying the whole of the principal amount, will pay the greater part of the interest. In those circumstances, it does not seem equitable that the migrants should be entitled to one-half of the farms to be made available. member suggest that wo should place our own people on farms in connection with which the British Government will pay a proportion of the interest bill? the agreement should be that for every £1,000,000 advanced by Great Britain, Australia shall absorb a certain number of people; not that they must necessarily settle on the land. We should merely undertake to absorb them into this community, and to do the best we can for them. The offer of Australian wages and condi 1 tious is sufficient to induce Britishers engaged in secondary industries to come to Australia; it is not necessary to add to that inducement the promise of a farm Such a condition is undesirable on easy terms. Britain's aim is not necessarily to settle numbers of her people on the land in Australia, but to enable them .to come here to enjoy a greater measure of prosperity than is possible in the Homeland; to create a market for her manufactures; and to provide a greater measure of defence in this portion of the Empire. The British Government should not stipulate-and it would not, if it realized the true position-that one-half of the farms to be created with this money must be made available for British migrants. Our aim should be to developAustralia to the greatest extent possible, because by so doing we shall be able to absorb more people from the Old Country. To that end the most suitable persons should be placed on the land. I am sure the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) will agree that, among our own people, will be found a greater proportion of capable potential land settlers than are likely to be found among those who come here from Great Britain.

If we embark upon a scheme for the general settlement of Australia,. and provide work and sustenance, we shall be able to absorb a greater number of British people than would be possible by any other means, and the British Government would, in that way. obtain a much better return for its outlay. There is one other point that I shall make to prove to honourable members that the agreement is capable of amendment. is that the agreement does not provide that the money which is to be made available to the States shall be expended upon works other than those which would, in the ordinary course, be embarked upon by those States. The object which the British Government had in view in making available the sum of £7,000,000 was Ihe encouragement of a greater public works expenditure than has been undertaken by the States in recent years, and the absorption of a much larger number of British migrants. ment, the States may merely substitute this cheap money for that which it would ordinarily utilize. That is the reason for the acceptance of the agreement by the States. One State proposes to go ahead jpith the completion of two railway projects which have already been carried * to a state of partial completion, and, in any case, would have been completpd within two or three years. that is a distinct weakness in the agreement. and the Australian Government will receive in return for their contribution is not very clear. Without this artificial stimulus, migrants who were brought tralia in the years immediately prior to the war was practically equal to that which the -States are to be heavily subsidized to bring out during the next ten years. The net gain in migrants last year was 37,000; yet, under this scheme, the average number per annum is fixed at only 45,000. Although, in its main features, the agreement is a first class one, it is susceptible to substantial improvement. I should like the bill to contain a provision under which the commission would be able to function either in the Wr. terms of this agreement or subject to any amendment thereof. At a later stage, I shall, therefore, move that the following words be added to the definition of "" principal immigration agreement """" or any amendment or variation of such agreement."" ter and Minister for External Affairs) [4.26] -The agreement is open to amendment at any time, and can be improved in any manner that is acceptable to the Commonwealth Government and the British Government. Althoughi t The extraordinary feature represents a very great advance upon any previous proposal, and is based upon the correct principle that the number of people brought to Australia shall be dependent upon our development and our powers of absorption, I have no doubt that the experience which the commission will gain will enable it to suggest alterations that will prove acceptable to the Commonwealth Government, the British Government, and the States. Under the agreeStates have accepted the agreement. made it perfectly clear that there is no bar to the amendment of the agreement if it is found possible to substitute a better one.

I remind honourable members that the agreement took on its present form after a consultation between representatives of the Commonwealth and the the number of assisted States, at which a number of suggestions to Auswere advanced by the States. Those suggestions were submitted to the British Government, which was induced to accept them. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) argued that better results would accrue if land settlement were confined to the Australian-born, who have had a thorough experience of local conditions, and, on that, account, would be more likely to prove successful than men who were born in Great Britain and had not a knowledge of our conditions.

While it may be perfectly true that immigrants who are attracted by the opportunities and possibilities which Australia offers, and are equipped both in spirit and in means to make a success of settlement add to the wealth' of the country, the statement, as a general unconditioned proposition, is fallacious and wrong. An increase of population, comprising people dissatisfied with their conditions and disappointed at the non-fulfilment of the promises held out to them-people who are individually unsuited for the task of beginning a new life in a new country, would be a source of weakness and not of strength to the nation. think it was the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) who said during the course of the debate on this bill that tlie worse asset the nation can have is the discontent which proceeds from lack of opportunity and lack of employment. The argument of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), that the burdens of government would be lightened by adding placing them on the shoulders of more taxpayers, has no point when applied to the solution of the problem we are considering, the result of artificially in the honourable gentleman those stimulating immigration. the area of the country into which immigration is to take place, which is the standard by which the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) would measure the relative growth of populations, is no true guide. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) had pointed out that the natural increase of our population was gratifying and satisfactory, but the honourable member for Lang argued that the statement of the mere nercentage increase was insufficient, and that the increase must be considered in relation to the area of the countries to which the comparison applied. Such a contention is weak almost to the point of imbecility, because in making a comparison of this nature we must primarily of a country, and the type of immigrant. If we compare Holland, almost every acre of which is intensely prolific, with Australia, nine-tenths of which in our present state of social advancement is totally unfitted for closer settlement, Mr Brennan. especially by persons not acquainted with our special conditions, we see at once that the test of acreage or area is utterly misleading. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster) has spoken of the gratitude we owe' to Great Britain, and here, of the sacrifices we should be prepared to make for that country, particularly in connection with this agreement. Tho honourable gentleman says that during the dark days of the war the Mother Country upheld civilization. In his view, and apparently in the view of other honourable members who have spoken on the same lines, it preserved the liberty and institutions of Australia, and, indeed, the very lives of our people. I do I not admit for a moment that we can afford to approach this business agreement on sentimental lines, nor do I "" admit the facts as stated by the honourable member. If I understand the position rightly, Australia itself also did something to preserve the liberty of the world in that great war; and I venture to remind the honourable member that he to our numbers aud enters this Parliament as a trustee for the Australian people, and not for the people of any other country; that his first duty is to Australia. I admire Furthermore, qualities of mind and heart which make him turn affectionately to the land from which he came, and perhaps he will be able to appreciate and understand the sentiment, which I , although Australian-born, feel towards the older civilization and land of greater culture from which I have the honour to draw my ancestry. But while that is so, the fact remains that in this House we are either Australians by adoption or Australians by birth, and our first duty is to consider the paramount claims of the people of Australia, whose representatives we are. I am painfully brought to remind the honourable member that if we had only secured for the development of our country one-tenth of the money which we recently wasted in the great tragedy of consider the productivity the war, what a great boon it would have been to our own people, what an inspiration and example it would have been to the rest of the world, and how much it would have done to preserve the common principles of humanity everywhere ! But the honourable member is an Englishman. He is certainly none the worse, and probably all the better, for that. He might have been a Roosian, A French, or Turk, or Proosian, Or, perhaps, Itali-an; But, in spite of all temptations To belong to other nations, He remains an Englishman. I ask the honourable member to view this matter from the stand-point of Australia. This agreement is recognized throughout Britain-rightl y recognized, I think, because the people of that country take a close view of what it means-as one that will have the effect of relieving that country of financial responsibility for those of its people who are unemployed, principally because of the war, but also because of social conditions out of which unemployment must constantly grow so long as the country is pawned and pledged to a few millionaires who hold as serfs millions still drawing the dole. While I have a sympathy with and affection for the masses of the British people, I have no sympathy with or respect for those who are at the back of this agreement, and would rid themselves of their selfcreated problem by transporting to Australia those persons who, through no fault of their own, have been rendered paupers in their own country. There may be something in the claim that, in order to maintain Australia and preserve the White Australia policy, we must promote immigration, but I do not think there is very much in it. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) says that no one can deny that New Zealand and Australia are absolutely dependent upon the Motherland. I deny it absolutely, and I say, further, that the only gesture of offence that has ever been made at Australia arises out of the price we pay for imperialism, and directly out of our imperial connection. It is just as well to be candid. A few years ago Australians could honestly discuss this question; but now, if one ventures to suggest that we do pay a price for imperialism, his remarks are attributed to lack of loyalty. There is no lack of loyalty in honestly discussing in one's own Parliament the forms of government which suggest themselves as being the best and safest. I merely say at this stage, as one who has no quarrel with the imperial connection, that the time will unquestionably come, as it is coming in Canada and as it must come in other advanced civilizations as population grows, when the people of the dominions will be bound to consider whether their safety and, indeed, their salvation are not involved in an independent existence, except in so far as their independence may be limited by membership of leagues of nations on a common footing, rather than by alliances within the empire such as history has rendered us familiar with. Possibly the greatest menace to our White Australia policy is not our comparatively small population, but our engaging in such enterprises as chasing after commercial advantages in places where we ought not to be compromised. One unsavoury enterprise such as that of sending an Australian warship into the pacific waters of China, ia order to protect the threatened-if they were threatenedinterests of British and Australian capitalists, is infinitely more inimical to Australia's interests as a peaceful nation than the smallness of our population, even if our numbers were less than they are. Therefore, when the honourable member for Herbert declares that the teeming nations of the East are casting envious eyes on Australia, he is merely indulging in provocative language: There is not an atom of proof of the statement that the Japanese people, our friendly neighbours, are casting envious eyes on Australia, or that, if the doors were thrown open to-morrow, which, of course, I do not recommend, there would be, in fact, any rapid influx of Japanese into this country. The reason for that was Avell stated on the floor of this House by another speaker, the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), who showed that there was no territorial congestion in Japan or in any of the countries inhabited by coloured races. It was pointed out by him that in the hinterland of Manchuria and in the neighbourhood of Korea, not to speak of the neighbouring islands, there are rich tracts of practically unoccupied land still awaiting settlement by the Japanese or other people. What is true of Japan is true also of India and what was until recently the Chinese Empire. In fact, honourable members can point to no nation which, territorially, has such an excess of population in proportion to territory that its people must either emigrate or starve. In Japan, China, and other eastern countries, there is intense local congestion of population, but so there is in Fitzroy and Collingwood, and the industrial suburbs of all Australian cities. This congestion is a result of the drift of population from the rural areas to the cities, and does not signify that the country is overstocked. The population of Great Britain has doubled within a comparatively short period, yet her agricultural areas are greatly undermanned and under-developed, because there, also, the population is congregating in large cities. What the honourable member for Darling said in respect to Japan might be said with equal truth of every one of the teeming countries with which we are constantly being threatened by pessimists on the Ministerial no evidence, at present, that these people will be forced by necessity to emigrate to Australia and menace its integrity or its sacred policy of racial purity. Again, at the risk of being thought a little heterodox, and even disloyal-some honourable members have made that charge against me-I that the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) was on sounder ground when he said that he had no prejudice against the peoples of southern Europe. I agree with endorse the ancient civilizations of those peoples, their eminent place in art and literature, and the respect which they have undoubtedly earned amongst the nations of the world. I have no hesitation in saying that immigrants from southern Europe, equipped with capital, migrating of their own volition, determined to settle upon the land, knowing where they can get land, and understanding precisely the uses to which it is to be put, are preferable even to men of our own race-Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen-who, under-developed by conditions of long unemployment and hardship, are driven by the stern hand of necessity to emigrate or starve. I go further, and endorse the splendid sentiment expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoolie ( Mr A. Green)-who deserves credit for his courage and longsightedness, and whom nobody can accuse of disloyalty-that Mr Brennan. future of Australia would be more soundly based, if , following the example of America, it drew its population and civilization from the best of the white nations of the world, always bearing in mind the desirability of preserving our racial purity. By so doing, we would establish a more distinctly Australian sentiment. Having no ill-will towards our own forbears or people of other nations, we would be able to judge with more detachment and independence, our own interests, and would gradually build up a stronger and better nation than if we continued to draw upon only Celtic and Anglo-Saxon sources for our population and inspiration. We have been told that we must increase our population if we are to hold this continent. I have previously asked, on the floor of this chamber, who has established the best title to this country. No nation side, namely, that there is can claim from necessity a right to invade this country. Whe, then, has a greater right to hold it than have we? Historians know that this fertile continent lay unused for many centuries during whioh the primitive sailing crafts of various nations cruised about its shores. Those early navigators think took away with them nought but unfavorable reports about the inhospitable nature of the country, and no people could be induced to settle here until the flag of Great Britain was planted on Australian shores, and the pioneers of the honourable member, and British blood came here to make their what he said as to home. The sacrifices which have built up Australian civilization to what it is to-day were made by people of the same stock, and I give them all honour for it . Who was it bore the brunt and burden and great adventure of early settlement on the gold-fields and elsewhere? Who went into the back-blocks and opened up the pastoral and arable lands and converted what appeared to be an arid desert into smiling corn-fields? Who but people of the same stock as those who now occupy it bore all the hardships of pioneering this country? And who has any moral claim to the ownership of it other than those who are already in possession and have established in it a system of government and a standard of civilization unequalled in any other part of the world ? No nation can establish any moral right to invade Australia in violation of the White Australia printhe ciple, and I am happy to believe that no nation is making even a menacing mighty continent which they have pregesture.

I take strong exception to the honourable member's statement that sentiment has nothing to do with the subject. We cannot pluck this affection for our own people, this love of country and race, out of our hearts. though we can, but we cannot, and are hypocrites if we say we can. We may think, when all is going smoothly, that we can do so, and may regard ourselves as citizens of the world, but let the tocsin ring, and it will be found that we are not. When that happens, Britons, wherever located, are found shoulder to shoulder on the one side, and the world, even if it be a world in arms, is on the other. Britain may sometimes be in the wrong, but is that a time when we should desert her? What is the fundamental principle of unionism? It is ""unionism right or wrong""; and it should be ""our country right or wrong."" Britain is not wrong in our sight. How could she be? We might as well expect a mother to declare her child in the wrong. Remembering, then, that national or racial sentiment is the light that guides us through the morass, let us consider the other point raised by the honourable member, that the area of this country has nothing to do with the subject. It has a great deal to do with it. Let us consider the position of Holland, with a population of 6,000,000. That number might man every dyke, might guard every frontier; but it is not sufficient to protect, are members of it are indeed in a happy unaided, the liberties of a continent almost the size of Europe. itself imposes upon us added responsibilities. fended in order that it may be developed. It is useless to talk as if this were a mere claim a continent as our heritage, we question of ethics. We speak of peaceful penetration; but how did we get possession of Australia ? Where are now the legitimate owners of this country? Most of them have disappeared from the face of the earth. We are here by the grace of There God and the arm of strength, and, when it comes to the pinch, it is our strength and the grace of God that must protect us. We have to consider our present position. The bill gives effect to an agreement between the British Government and the Government of the Commonwealth, and some subsidiary agreements that may be entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of certain States. It relates to a policy of assisted migration. From the time when this country was the precarious camping ground of a mere handful of hardy pioneers to the present We may speak as day, when it is a great and splendid civilization, our development has gone hand in hand with a policy of immigration. We have now nailed to the mast our White Australia policy. The honourable member spoke of the imperial connection rather contemptuously. I ask honourable members opposite how they propose to maintain this policy, and make good our claim to hold this continent unless we belong to the great federation of British nations? The honourable member spoke as if the world were governed by abstract ideas of what is right. Yet what has been the cry of the nation to which the honourable member belongs? It is that the weak have been ground under the iron heel of the strong. That cry has been made by the people of the little nations ever since the world began. It is no small thing to us to be able to say that we belong to the greatest and most powerful federation of free nations the world has known. What is the ideal of unionism? It is to establish one big dominating body. There is magic in numbers, a power not to be found in any abstract idea of right and wrong, and when the federation is composed of men of character and of high ideals, those who position. The policy of a White AusAreai n tralia imposes upon every part of the Empire, including Australia, certain This country has to be deresponsibilities and risks. It is our duty to lessen these risks. Since we ought to make every effort to induce people of the right type to come here. Of course, by no hocus pocus arrangement can the population of this country be doubled in five or ten years, though some spoke as if this could be done",29,Development And Migration
61,Mr Bbennan,Undoubtedly .,30,Development And Migration
62,Mr Hughes,"When we speak ofby a great stream of migrants, tbe like of which the world has never yet seen. to Australia must be limited in accordance with well established principles. Nations are like men, they can absorb only a certain amount of pabulum, and any excess above that quantity produces surfeit. Every nation can absorb only a certain number of migrants; how many it can absorb at a given time, or over a given period, depends on the state of the body national. I doubt whether Australia 120,000 migrants a year, even if everything in this country turned as smoothly as a well-greased wheel; but, whether it could or not. there are obvious limits to the number of migrants to be brought to this country. migration is possible, we ought to encourage it . It is gratifying to know that the natural increase of the population of Australia is very rapid; it appears to be necessary to emphasize that fact, because many persons defame this country. There are two kinds of defamers. One says that the condition of this country is like that of a man in a fever, that our prosperity is hectic, that our people are degenerate, that wagesare too high, and that our prosperity cannot last. In short, they do what they can by exaggerating the effects of droughts and strikes, to make this country appear undesirable in the eyes of persons oversea. The best and surest way to attract migrants is to make this country a good country to come to ; but we must remember that not all the persons who want to come here are able to come. English are a home-loving people, and only a small percentage of them seek homes oversea. Most of us are the progeny of the hardy and adventurous spirits who came out here years ago; but it must be recognized that most English people would rather stay at home than come here. If we wish to attract migrants of the right kind we must create conditions that are an irresistible magnet to them. If the stream of migration to this country is not so great as it should be. those who keep on saying that conditions in this country are not sound, that our prosperity will be pricked like a bubble, and that this is a country of strikes and disasters, are partly to blame. But. on the other hand, what are my ""honourable friends of the Opposition saying? Whenever they have the opportunity, they declare that there is no The number of migrants opening for migrants in this country, which is filled with unemployed persons. Both those statements are lies. No other country has so few persons unemployed, and it is of no use suggesting that because a man cannot obtain a job by standing at the top of Bourke-street, the possibility of obtaining work in Australia has been exhausted. This is a very desirable country to live in ; the conditions are better for the worker than in could absorb more than any other country, and it offers greater opportunities for every one. It is, with the possible exception of New Zealand, the healthiest country in the world, and it offers to the British worker who comes here with nothing but his hands and the But to the extent that energy of his race, more than any other country offers him-it offers him all that the character of its people has made of this country, and that character is the heritage of the British race. Therefore this agreement, for the reason that it is designed to bring selected British migrants to this country, is a good thing, and I hope that this committee will not contemplate the ide.a of rejecting it . I am not at this moment inquiring into the terms of the agreement. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) spoke of the imperial connection, and endeavoured to make light of it . I am not surprised at that, for he has never done anything else. Let us suppose that the imperial connection is not vital to usand at our present stage of development I say, most emphatically, that it isand that we sever it ; migration would The then become absolutely imperative, for there would be cast upon us, ipso facto, a burden of responsibility so crushing that no 6,000,000 people could carry it. We are able to hold this country because we are a part of the great confederation of nations known as the British Empire, and for no other reason; but, if we break away from that partnership, we must provide for bringing huge streams of migrants to this country, so that when the time comes, as come it will, we shall be able to give a good account of ourselves to those who knock at our gates. The honourable member, viewing this matter, quite naturally and properly, from the stand-point of the worker, demands that no assisted migrant shall be brought to this country unless employment is waiting for him. I agree w it h thatj but I point out to him that this agreement provides for that. agreement does not contemplate bringing here large numbers of men for whom no preparation has been made. I do not believe that under it many persons will be brought to this country; but in principle, at any rate, it is right to bring men and women of the British stock to this country to participate in the great work which has been undertaken by men and women of that race. The honourable member said something about countries such as Korea and Manchuria in which there is plenty of room. He ought to know that one of the reasons why Korea and Manchuria have not been more thickly populated is that their climatic conditions are unfavorable. Fortunately for us, this country has a climate which imposes no hardships upon its inhabitants. heat or cold. But that is not true of either Korea or Manchuria, and that explains why, in spite of the opportunities given to Japan, no progress has been made by Japanese settlement in either of those two countries. As to the future of this country, upon which the honourable member dwelt for a moment, we believe in the greatness of its destiny; but we believe, too, with all our heart, soul, and strength, that it can only realize it if it proceeds along the well beaten path on which we and our forefathers have travelled since this country was first colonized by the British. perial connection, if ""connection"" a proper term to apply to an arrangement which leaves us free to do as we please, gives us an assurance of safety, and enables us to develop our heritage more freely than we could without it. I hope that we shall never follow the example of the United States of America, for that Is an example to avoid. The people of that country opened their gates to the whole world, and all the world came into a melting pot wherein there has been no proper fusion, and a hotch-potch of nations has been made out of a' nation. The greatness of America was built by the Anglo-Saxon race, which is now in the minority in that country. ""We in this country are more .British than Britain herself main so. I believe that the progress and the safety of this country depend wholly upon the purity of our race. There Mr Hughes. is one unfailing spring into which we can The dip our cups again and again to fill up this country with men and women of the same race that made it. For that reason I feel sure that this committee, and the people of this country, will approve of the agreement. In saying that, I do not necessarily express approval of every detail of it, but I am replying to the amendment of the honourable member for Batman, who attacks the principle of it . It was in defence of that principle that I rose to speak. The effect of the amendment of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is to repudiate the agreement entered into between the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth Government, and approved of by five of It has no extremes of the State Governments. It would nullify years of negotiations. I have already addressed myself adversely to some of the features of the bill, but I am, and always have been, wholly in favour of the principle of migration from the British Isles. After listening to speeches from both' sides of this chamber, I am convinced that the best migrants we can obtain from oversea are boys from the British Isles, at the plastic age when they can adapt themselves to Australian conditions and imbibe Australian sentiment. To attempt to transfer a full-grown man from, say, London to a rural part of Australia is The imto attempt almost the impossible. It is be futile to expect men who have grown up in a city atmosphere, such as that of London, to prove successful as migrants on ready-made farms. However, if it is proposed to continue to bring out adult British migrants, the terms are generous, indeed, from Great Britain's point of view. In a short period of time the migrant will be an Australian citizen, owning a farm, established and improved by means of capital borrowed from Great Britain at a reasonable rate of interest. Britain, for ten years, will share the interest burden, bear a definite proportion of the cost of the migrant's training, and also pay a proportion of any loss sustained. Nevertheless, I urge Long may we rethe Government to be very cautious regarding the proposal to establish the migrants on these lines, since ready-made farms are, to a great extent, a delusion.

71,Mr R. Green (Richmond) [5.58],"of absorbing a considerable number of migrants from overseas. I should prefer to use a stronger term if parliamentary usage permitted it. Australia can support an immense population, and if peopled by the right class of migrants, it w ill be one of the best countries in the world. I disagree with the right honourable member for North Sydney that migrants from European countries could not be assimilated into our population. I visited the United States of America on several occasions prior to the adoption of the ""quota"" system now in force, and I had ample evidence of the ability of that country to absorb a steady immigrants. saw after about twelve months' residence in Boston, had taken out naturalization papers and had come to New York to welcome ' ' new chums "" from his own country. That man had absorbed the American spirit, and was in every respect a good American citizen. We should have the same experience in this country. I deprecate the attitude of those who declare that we cannot provide work for those already in Australia. however, if it would be wise to encourage migrants only on account of their suitability for land settlement, though it is quite misleading to suppose that because a large number of persons apply for a particular block that may be thrown open, there is not ample land in Australia suitable for closer settlement. numbers apply for a certain block because they know that if they are fortunate enough to get it their future is assured. Not many skilled agriculturists from the Mother Country emigrate to Australia, because of the demand for their services in Great Britain. I strongly favour the introduction of people of the Nordic race, because they will make good Australian citizens. Instead of raising artificial barriers to the introduction of suitable immigrants, we should do all that is possible to encourage the right class of people to come here. This migration movement is really a step in the direction of transferring Britain overseas. Australia can support millions of people, and if they are endowed with qualities of enterprise and initiative, they will make this a very desirable place to live in . If we are going to hold Australia, we must populate it with our blood brothers from the other side of the world. The gratuitous insult offered to the people of Australia by the amendment of the honourable member for Batman is unworthy of any one who calls himself an Australian. SinceI missed my chance to speak on the second reading of the b ill , I am pleased that the debate on this clause has taken such a wide range, though I do not wish to deliver a second-reading speech. I was pleased to hear the remarks of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes), who, as we all know, is a great flow of foreign imperialist, and rightly takes advantage On one occasion, I of every opportunity to advocate the a foreign migrant who, strengthening of the ties that link the dominions, to the Motherland. I agree with h i m that sentiment rules the world. He also made a strong point when he said in reply to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), that if migration is a matter of great importance to-day, it would be a hundredfold more important if that connecting link between the dominions and the MotherI doubt, land were ever severed. Australia has been built up under the protection of the British Navy. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) referred to the increase of population in Australia. On looking up the figures yesterday, I was staggered to see that, since 1871, the average increase of population in Australia Large has been about 68,000 a year. Those are amazing figures. We are going ahead faster than people realize. The points that we should consider are-I s immigration necessary-is this b ill necessary-ar e there any other ways of populating the country? That brings me to the consideration of the world's population today. What are known as the coloured and yellow races have increased, and are increasing, tenfold as compared with the white races. Australia must do something if we are to have the right to maintain the White Australia policy. The honourable member for Batman dealt w i th China and Japan. I have a f a i r l y good knowledge of those countries, but not to the extent that the honourable member for Henty has. The honourable member for Batman was quite wrong in his reference to the emigration of Japanese to Korea and Manchuria. When I was discussing the White Australia policy with one of",34,Development And Migration
72,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [6.13],"the members of the Japanese Cabinet, he informed me that the Japanese were going there to a certain extent, but that the country was not suitable, being too cold. The honourable member for Henty has been to Korea, and he was quite right when he told me the other day that the Chinese, owing to their great numbers, are going, like a cloud of locusts, right through Korea and Manchuria, and leaving no ground worth having for the Japanese. people cannot live on the wages ruling in Korea or Manchuria. I have no fear of Japan attacking Australia for the purpose of filling this country with her people, but we must not forget that, unless we quickly populate Australia with people of our own colour, -\ve have no right to occupy it. In other words, we cannot inhabit this great territory if we do not do something to fill its empty spaces. The honourable member for Batman said that we could not compare America with Australia, and he did not agree at all that a greater number of people would bring about greater wealth. I do not agree with his contention. The more people that we bring here the more we shall have to provide with food and clothing, thus helping both our primary and secondary industries. wniit to be iu the position of America, whose white people are being submerged by her coloured people. . We must bring people of our own colour to Australia. The honourable member for Henty also states that the dividing line between the Labour party and honourable members on this side on the question of immigration was very fine indeed. agree. for Henty, agree with the attitude of honourable members this extent-that population of a country is a certain perDunn, of the New South Wales Ministry, centage of unemployed, but beyond that, every worker in the community should be employed before we bring immigrants here from the Motherland. provide for the requirements of our own people before we bring others here to take their jobs. So, after all, there is little between us. Like the honourable member for Henty, I hope that, in the future, we shall have the hearty co-operation of the Labour party in populating this country with people of Mr Marks. our own colour and speech. I agree with the honourable member for Henty that we cannot succeed in our policy of immigration without the help of honourable members opposite, and of the hundreds of thousands of those who believe with them politically. But the Government is wise in bringing in the bill, because something attempted is something done, and little has been done up to the present. But there are other fields that we might Besides that, the Japanese have attempted to explore before that of immigration. We should first try to improve pre-natal and post-natal conditions to save the lives of mothers and infants; and by segregating the mentally and medically unfit, so that they may not marry and bring children into the world, to prevent the filling of our asylums. There are such matters that might first be considered. It may be said that the Commonwealth has no power to deal with them; but have we any power in respect of immigration? We cannot go far without the help of the States. Of course, the matters that I have mentioned come mainly within the scope of the States. In attempting to aid migration, we must remember that there are other avenues in which thousands of lives can be saved every year. We do not Take cancer research. The Commonwealth Statistician's figures show that, in the next ten years, 70,000 of our people will die from this accursed and awful disease. If we tried to save the lives of infants and adults, it would help to solve the great population problem. However, the Government is to be commended for introducing this bill. With that I We cannot side-step it. Markets should I, like the honourable member come before migration, because, when people are placed on the land, there must opposite to be markets for their produce. I noticed always in the floating in the press, the other day, that Mr sent a cable from London showing that our method of marketing is still at fault, and that our grading, labelling, and packWe must ing are still far from satisfactory. The same thing applies to our trade with China and Japan. We cannot sell Australian goods there because those of California are more attractively placed before the public. All these things need attention. Yet this agreement is good, and we should go on with it. Those who say that an attempt is being made to bring Britain's unemployed to Australia are wrong. ment of people from overseas with little When I was in England last, I entered or no training in agriculture.

There is only one portion of the agreement I like, and I want a definite statement from the Prime Minister that before any vigorous scheme is embarked upon to bring people to Australia, the developmental and preparatory work w ill be taken in hand, and that even prior to that our own unemployed w ill be absorbed, and provision will be made to meet the requirements of those Australians who are desirous of going on the land. members will agree with the note sounded by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) that Australia should first and foremost look after its own, and that something should be done to reduce our infantile mortality. Statistics show that the number of deaths in Australia is about 40,000 or 50,000 annually, and that one-fourth of this number are in fants under twelve months old. I think we ought to devote a large amount of money in an attempt to save infan t life, and other lives as well. About 140,000 babies are born each year, but of that number 10,000 die before they are twelve months old. If we could save the lives of half that number we should be doing the very best thing for Australia. I shall vote for the amendment, because I do not think that the agreement is in the best interests of Australia from a financial, immigration, or developmental point of view. No one admires Great Britain more than I do. Listening to the remarks of honourable members on the Ministerial benches, one would think that they came from a different stock from honourable members on the Opposition benches. As a matter of fact, in every sense of the term, we on the Opposition benches are as truly British as honourable members on the Government side.

But this agreement is a gilt-edged Britain has made a splendid arrangement for herself. Australia, by absorbing 45,000 people for ten years, w ill be doing a good t u r n for the Mother Country. I do not desire bad feeling to be engendered by unduly large numbers of persons coming into Australia from the other side of the world, flooding our labour market, and taking the land which our own landless farmers' sons ought to have. Therefore, I must vote for the amendment. I believe that the rejection of the agreement will prove beneficial to Australia. I rise to support the amendment.

According to the figures published in the Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire, 6,715 migrants came to Western Australia in 1924, and in 1925 the number decreased to 3,688.

In Tasmania, 226 arrived in 1924, and 125 in 1925. were 8,721 and 8,803 respectively; whereas in New South Wales 6,211 arrived in 1924, and 8,792 in 1925.

During 1924, the British Government contributed £133,162, and the Commonwealth £143,917 towards the cost of migrants' passages. loan by the United Kingdom amounted to £98,157, and by Australia £98,442, or a grand total of £473,678. For the ten months ending the 30th October, 1925, the grants by the British Government amounted to £158,196, and by the Commonwealth Government to £168,157. The advances on loan by GreatB r it a in amounted to £56,754, and by the Commonwealth to £56,992, making a total of £440,099, or a grand total for one year and ten months of £913,777.

The term ""pommy"" is regarded by some as being disrespectf u l , but it is not used in an objectionable sense. The men of the American Fleet which visited Australia some time ago were sometimes called ""gobs,"" but the term was not regarded by them as being disrespectful. It meant "" God's own boys."" We have read a good deal of the conditions which obtained in Americai n the days of slavery; but those who have studied the question and have also investigated conditions under which the poor in London and the big cities of England live, have admitted that the slaves in the southern States of America were in a more fortunate position than are the poor of England. British citizens had their freedom, but in many cases they had to starve. According to Mulhall, the deaths from starvation in GreatB r i tain have been larger than in the whole of Europe. Some time ago, it was disFor Victoria, the figures closed that the Sutherland family owned 1,753,000 acres of freehold land in Great Britain, which is more than Tyson of Under a Queensland ever owned, even though he held a larger area of leased land.

Huge fortunes are being made by this and other British manufacturing firms, whilst their employees are working for a miserable pittance. The advances on The Roman Emperor Hadrian employed his soldiers in constructing homes, and in doing so allowed his men to become skilled artisans, and some such useful work should be undertaken by the unemployed in Britain. In travelling through the South Sea IslandsI found that the native huts were in a much better condition than many of the dwellings in which the poor of London, Glasgow, and Liverpool are compelled to live. Great Britain must take care of her population. A t a time when Britain had an enormous country population, barefooted men of the finest possible physique decimated the flower of the French armies at Crecy and Agincourt. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN When( Sir Granville R y r i e ) I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the bill . Dr. MALONEY I shall do so. I am referring to the physique once possessed by the British people, and I am endeavouring to show how desirable it is that migrants of good physique should be sent to Australia. The men who left Australia during the Great War were of fine physique, and in the words of the Latin adage, "" A healthy body means a healthy m in d . "" A committee dispatched to Calcutta to investigate the conditions under -which jute is manufactured reported as follows: An Indian jute worker, the report states, is paid about £12 10s. a year. His employer exploits him to the tune of £100 a year. In other words, profits amount to eight times the wages bill. The tables of dividends given by the investigators recall the fantastic wealth of Arabian Nights stories. In 1920 the Kinanison Mill made a dividend of 400 per cent. It yielded a comparatively modest 100 per cent, in 1924. The dividends of three other mills for that year averaged over 130 per cent. For every £ 1 invested a return of £ 4 was made. The workers in the industry, who were grossly underpaid, were undercutting the British workers in Dundee. During a period of ten years, the average dividend for all the companies has been 90 per cent. Who are these employers to whom vast wealth comes so easily? About GO per cent, of the shares are held by Indians, but the effective management rests in the hands of British capitalists. It proved difficult to trace the European holders, owing to dividends being remitted care of a bank. Messrs. Johnston and Syme discovered in the Gouripore shareholders' list an item of 3,465 shares held "" for Mackay and Company Limited, account Lord Inchcape."" Australia has no reason to love that name, and it will have less reason for doing so when Lord Inchcape controls all the shipping of this country. It may interest those who honour me by reading my speeches in Hansard to know what the tradesmen receiveButchers( women and girls) receive 3s. 4d. per four-day week. Boys are paid 2s. 2d. in the roving departments, 3s. Sd. in the spinning departments. Weavers' wages range from 9s. a week; hemmers and sewers get 7s., and tenters 12s. That is what the English workers have to compete against. The British tariff permits goods made under those conditions to enter British ports without penalty. This is how those poor human beings liveHousing is horrible. Two-thirds of the workers live in ""bustees,"" one-story blocks of mud and plaster on wicker and matting, with thatched roofs; no windows, chimneys, or fireplaces. Bents from "" these foul ant-heaps of pestilence"" are from Is. to Is. 4d. a month. The remaining third live in compounds; rent from 4d. a week, no taxes. It seems to me, in this civilization, that the time is coming when Dr. Maloney. no head of a family will fear the landlord's knock. There were some landlords who, at the time of the land boom, received 12s. a week for their houses, and those same houses now bring in 25s. a week; but who, after the great debacle, were glad to pay 2s. 6d. a week to any one who would live in their houses and take care of them. In the terrible time of high rents, nothing was more dreaded by the mother of a family than the landlord's knock on a Monday morning. One of the lessons of the terrible war through which the world passed a few years ago, is that health is one of the greatest assets a nation can have. Therefore, it is the duty of every government to promote the health of the people. My statements do not mean that I would prevent Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, or Welshmen from coming to this country. I should loathe myself if my lips formed words with such a meaning. But our first duty is to the people of this country. The Australian baby is the finest immigrant we can have-ou r health statistics prove that-bu t are our babies getting a fair chance? We have treated the old-age and invalid pensioners fairly well; but how little have we done for the babies and children, who are more helpless than the old-age pensioners! Every old-age pensioner can do something for himself, but babies of one, two, or three years of age are almost helpless. Only one State in Australia has risen to the civilized plane where it is recognized that a child has a right to a pension. That is the State which you, Mr Deputy Chairman, have the honour to represent. A widow in that State-Ne w South Wales-as o has the same right. Where else in the wide domain of British nations can that be equalled? I should like to see Australia garnering the great lesson that is to be learned from the method that was employed to populate the waste land of Siberia, on a Mercator's projection in which Australia can be hidden. How did Russia populate that awful place? It sent whole village communities there, with their blacksmiths and storekeepers, and even their ""pubs,"" and supported them for a certain period. Why cannot we bring the people of English villages to Australia, place them on good land, and provide them with slowly-advancing water and firewood? One-tenth of the money spent in settling individual soldiers on blocks of land would more than keep such a community u n t i l it could supnort itself. Men and women brought out in that way would be able to live among their own friends. sterile portion of the north of Asia was settled in that way from 150 to 200 years ago. we gave all migrants a pension for a year or two after they arrived. honourable member makes that suggestion out of the kindness of his heart. My reply is that it might assist, but there would haye to be a condition attached that the migrants should not accept less than the standard rate of wage in the occupation followed by them. It happened to my knowledge that a blacksmith, who worked eight hours a day for 50s. a week in England, received 15s. a week for ten hours a day at Kondinin, in Western Australia. I object to migrants coming here when, as in one instance I have in mind, there were over 1,000 applicants for a block of land. When there are three blocks for every two applicants, we of the Labour party will be willing to open our arms to migrants of any European race, but preferably to those from the British Isles. It has been proved by statistics that Australians are more British than the people of Great Britain, and we should keep them British for the sake of the future greatness of this country; but if we cannot obtain suitable migrants from Great Britain, we should take them from other European countries. Here is what happens even in merry England : Six hundred thousand workers die in England yearly with hardly a second shirt to pawn. Two hundred and ninety-one persons get weekly £800 each. Dustmen and engineers rub along with £3 a week and less. Ex-Queen Alexandra gets £190 per day. Aged 80. Working women at the wash-tub get 3s. a day (if lucky to click a job), and block ornaments for Sunday and Christmas dinner. I "" b l o c k ornaments"" when I lived for five weeks in London on 10s. a week. They are waste pieces of beef, which are sold by the butchers at a very low price, and the average worker is glad to get them. I do not wish to have that experience again, nor do I wish any other human being to have a similar experience. I have already shown in this House what chance the white man has in SouthA f r i c a . On the 1st December, 1924, a proclamation, The almo9t authorized by act of parliament, declared that all skilled artisans in the building trade must be paid 2s. 9d. an hour for a 44 hour week. The penalty for breaking the law was £500 fine or two years imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment. In the following February a council, consisting of the I presume that the large employers and contractors, was formed under the act, and it met the representatives of the skilled trades in the building trade. A f t e r taking into consideration the climate and other factors in South Africa, that council raised the wages as high as 3s. 4d. an hour. I have compared the prices of commodities in Melbourne, as set out in the Melbourne Herald, with those ruling in Capetown and Johannesberg, which are the large cities of South Africa. With the single exception of flour and wheat the prices are lower in South Africa than they are here, and rents are considerably lower. Before that act was passed, half castes, who are very intelligent men, were employed as tradesmen, and received up to £ 2 a week. The negro was the unskilled worker, and he received up to 18s. a week. A white man landing in Capetown or any other coastal town thus had to face a very difficult situation. When I was there, there was not one white plasterer among 112,000 people in Capetown. I was told that there were two white bricklayers, but, although I was six weeks in Capetown, and looked assiduously for them, I could not find them. 1 asked Senator Whiteside about that when he was here. He was formerly employed on the Brighton tramway, and he left this country when the land boom burst. He went to South Africa, and in after years was appointed Commissioner of Railwaysi n that country. I do not know of any other tramway man who has risen to such a position When he was knew what it was to eat those here, he would not have any fuss made of him, and did not wish to be invited to a parliamentary reception. I asked him whether all persons, whether white, coloured, or black, employed in those skilled trades would be paid those wages, and he replied emphatically that they would.

Clause 5(1) Tlie commission shall consist of four members, who shall be appointed by the Governor General. . . . direct the attention of the PrimeM in ister to the desirableness of providing for the representation on the commission of the trade unions and primary producers. If one member of the commission were representative of the industrial section of the community, he would be in a position to advise that body of any danger to be apprehended from the flooding of the Australian labour migrants from overseas. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who has given this matter careful consideration, stated that unless the Government could ensure the co-operation of the Labour party the scheme would not succeed. Other thinking men take the same [147] view. If the Government is in earnest in its desire to formulate a workable scheme, and one which will appeal not to one section only but to the whole of Australia, it will see to it that the commission comprises representatives of both trade unions and primary producers. It would be unwise to appoint a commission representing wholly city business in terests. One member of the commission should have a thorough knowledge of economic problems and a personal experience of the subdivision of land, so From time to time that the commission could be safeguarded against mistakes in connection with the purchase of estates.

If necessary, I shall move an amendment having this objsct in view. should like to know why it is necessary to appoint a commission of four members. In my opinion, three would be ample to carry out the investigations in W h a t is meant by "" real connection with the formulation of migration schemes. A small committee is likely to do better work, particularly in view of the fact that under a later provision in the bill there is .authority for the commission to appoint experts to advise it in connection with special In other words, the problems. If , for example, there was Lhe need for improved harbour accommodation or railway communication in some remote portion of the Commonwealth, the commission would call in outside experts and rely upon their advice.

W it h regard to the suggestion of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the commission should consist of three instead of four members, I can only say that the Government has given that matter the fullest consideration. I entirely agree that the objective should be to keep the personnel of the commission as small as possible, but after considering the subject f u l l y, and bearing in mind the nature of the work which the commission will be called upon to do, the Government has come to the conclusion that four is the most suitable number. It is extremely probable that schemes will be submitted from all the State Governments. A t present we have under consideration proposals from Western Australia, Victoria, and South Australia. It is desirable that all these schemes should be examined without delay, and that we should have an opportunity to obtain the views of the various State officers concerning them. may be advisable to divide the commission, allowing two of its members to proceed to Western Australia, and two to go to South Australia to carry out this work. The Government believes that, more than one member should be available for such investigatory work. I can assure the committee that the Government has given the fullest consideration to the personnel of the commission, and Let me believes that four is the ideal number. I trust, therefore, that the committee will not accept any amendment to reduce the number. The GovernThe Prime Minister would be wise to agree to the.suggestion made by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley). Public feeling is tending in this direction.

It . is probable that the Government w ill appoint some military officer as chairman of the commission, as was done in filling the chairmanship of the Public Service Board.

It will meet the difficulties which Ihe honourable member has in mind, and the form is, I think, preferable. ment of the right honourable gentleman affect the work of .the commission ¥ will lay down a general programme, and an amendment such as I have suggested will not in any way interfere with its work. For the information of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), I suggest that the proposal which originated with the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), and owing to his modesty percolated through the chamber until it reached the Prime Minister will meet the position. It is evident that the proposal of the honourable member for Henty gives the Minister greater power than that of the honourable member for Wannon. His suggestion is to enable the commission to entertain proposals made to it by the Minister; but the proposal of the honourable member for Henty is to restrict the commission to all those matters approved b "" the Minister. In the one case the Minister has a voice in making suggestions to the commission, but in the other the Minister has the power of veto. I believe in parliamentary control expressed through Ministers, and if the two contending members will accept my arbitrament as final I think the suggestion of the honourable member for This Henty preferable, and, on behalf of Ihe members of the Opposition, whom I have not consulted, I shall accept it . afraid that the decision of the right honf v orable the Prime Ministeri n this matter will make the bill a bad one, for. it will take from, the commission the power to make examinations of its own volition. The amendment of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) givps a certain amount of control to the Minister. be made to the Minister, who could instruct the commission to report on them. Under the bill the commission may do just as it likes, without being subject to any control. There is a vital difference between the amendment of the honourable member for Wannon and the proposal of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). We may appoint very estimable men to this commission, and afterwards find that they are not what we thought they were. They may not desire to carry out the wishes of the Government or the Parliament. There is nothing in the bill to compel the commission to do what the Parliament or the Executive Council wishes. I support The commission the amendment of the honourable memfor for Wannon, and I would go even further and give the Minister control of the "" powers, functions, and duties "" of the commission. between functions and duties? a. difference. I have had more experience than most honourable members of administering a public department, and I know the responsibility that is thrown upon members of Parliament by commissions. I remember the protests of honourable members about the taking over of the timber mills in Queensland.

162,Mr Gregory,"There is decidedlybelieve that the commission provided for in the bill will be a good commission, but this committee should provide against the possibility of unsuitable men being appointed. The Government should be supreme. I hope that the Prime Minister will agree to an amendment which will give the Executive Council power to direct the commission to make investigations. I thought that the Government had changed its attitude regarding the appointment of the commission, the suggestion of tbe honourable member for Henty would be more logical than my amendment, because it would give the Minister direct responsibility and the power to determine matters for himself before having inquiries made. Ministry does not intend that, and, therefore, I hope that the Prime Minister will accept my amendment, which is inserted in the. right place, the kernel of the bill. The amendment provides that the commission shall derive its power of investigation from the Minister, l t assumes that the Minister starts by submitting matters to his commission. seems to me the correct course. I do not wish to revive memories or open old sores, but I have had sufficient experience of commissions never again to make a commission supreme over a Minister. The Minister, if he desires to do TO, should first place a proposal before his Government, and afterwards set the commission time of the commission would not be wasted in examining the wild-cat schemes of the different governments, which, under power to move the commission to investigate almost anything. I can conceive of the commission spending a lot of time in the prickly pear country, where it can learn nothing new. That country has gone beyond the need for investigation ; it remains for scientists to find a remedy. There is so little between us that I hope the Prime Minister w ill agree to allow the Minister to step off with his right foot and take control of the commission, after determining by consultation with his Government the matters needing investigation. The Commonwealth is undertaking great obligations-the obligation of giving birth to the commission, and the obligation of negotiating the agreement with the Mother Country and submitting it to the States. The Commonwealth is looked upon as the jumping-off ground. I should like to be a Minister having such a magnificent field of investigation; it would appeal to me as the most alluring field in the Commonwealth. Buti f I found that my commission was somewhere in the wide field enumerated in clause 1 ( i i ) of the main agreement, I should not feel so elated. I hope that without my pleading the matter farther, the Prime Minister will accept my amendment. ment restrict the commission to the consideration of questions submitted by the Minister? I know that the not make the commission the tool and plaything of the States. The amendment provides that the proposals shall come from the States, and filter through the heads of departments. The Commonwealth Government w ill determine the matters that w ill be submitted by the States to the commission. That ter and Ministerf o r External Affairs) [11.11] -There is a fundamental difference between my point of view and that of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. He suggests that under the bill power should be given to the Minister to direct the commission to carry out certain investigations; in fact, that the Minister should, to a great exin motion. Thus the tent, be responsible for originating the inquiries. For many reasons that would be totally opposed to the ideas of the Government in framing the bill, and printhe bill, will have cipally because the Government wishes the commission to initiate its own inquiries, and try to open up new avenues of investigation. I agree, however, to the other amendment, because, in the event of the commission tryin g to go too far, there must be some power to stop it . But the commission must decide the line upon which its inquiries are to proceed. If numerous schemes were submitted from all quarters, the present Government would not take advantage of any power it might have to instruct the commission to inquire into them. However, human nature and governments are what they are, and I can imagine this unfortunate commission spending the whole of its time investigating various schemes referred to",54,Paiiis

For that reason I should object to providing, as one of the first duties of the commission, that it should investigate schemes submitted to it by the Government. has the Minister under the bill regarding the commission's operations? be allowed to investigate problems for it self. I recognize that, possibly, it would be advisable to give more ministerial control than is now provided, and the amendment to be considered subsequently provides that "" the commission shall not undertake the consideration or investigation of any matters under paragraph a of the last preceding sub-section u n t il the approval of the Minister thereto has been given.""

Amendment negatived. [11.17] I raise the question of the desirability ' of paragraph a i i . being so wide as it is. I propose to submit an amendment slightly altering its form, and I hope, also, its effect. The paragraph as it stands provides that the commission may investigate "" the condition and development of existing industries, whether primary or secondary, in the Commonwealth, and of the possibility of establishing new industries therein."" It appears to me that it is possible to establish any industry provided that we are prepared to assist it sufficiently, either, perhaps, by means of a tariff on the one hand, or a bounty on the other. I take it that the point at issue would not be the possibility of establishing new industries so much as the advisability of their establishment. I have no desire to cramp unduly the powers of the commission; and it must be obvious to everybody that if it is to carry out its work properly, it should have sufficient power and data to enable it to do so. I do not think that it should have power to investigate the condition and development of any existing primary or secondary industry. That would result in a conflict with powers already delegated to the T a r i ff Board. Under section 15 of the Tariff Board Act 1921, the Minister may refer to that board for inquiry, and report the following matters:(a) the general effect of the working of the Customs tariff and the Excise tariff, in relation to tlie primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth; (b) the fiscal and industrial effects of the Customs laws of the Commonwealth; (d) any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of primary or secondary industries in relation The right honourable to the tariff. Section 17 of that act states that the board may, on its own initiative, inquire into and report on any of the matters referred to in sub-section 2 of section 15. I was then referring to The powers to be given to the proposed commission under this bill appear to be wider even than those conferred upon the Tariff Board. Whilst the desire of the Government may be to secure co-ordination, the actual effect, I submit, of this It seems to me that the particular clause, w ill be to duplicate inquiries into primary and secondary industries, and they may be a nuisance and a hindrance to the people engaged in them. Does the clause confer on the commission authority to make inquisitorial inquiries into such matters as capital, methods, costs, and profits, as well as other confidential aspects of industry? If it does, then inevitably it w ill mean an increase in the staffs of many business concerns. Already many business firms and companies have to employ a staff to answer inquiries made by public officials. I am not, for the moment, offering any criticism in regard to that matter; but if further inquiries are to be made by the proposed commission, then larger staffs will have to be employed by many business firms and companies. If the information is required, it ought to be obtained in some centralized way, and it should be available through that means, not only",55,Paiiis

I am aware that, in the final clause, there is power to make regulations which are not. dissonant from the terms of the bill. If the clause ia altered as I propose, it will not be necessary for inquisitorial inquiries to be made. ister aud Minister for External Affairs) [11.26] I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member. I do not think that his apprehensions are well founded. He has suggested that inquiries of an inquisitorial nature may be undertaken by the commission to determine all the facts in relation to existing industries. clause merely provides that the commission shall have the power to inquire into the condition of primary and secondary industries. Surely, if the commission is to advise as to the best lines of development to be undertaken, it should have the right, from time to time, to investigate the position in relation to certain existing industries. I assure the honourable gentleman that, if the amendment which 1 have foreshadowed, and which I intend to move at the end of this clause, is accepted, any apprehension which he has will be removed, because the commission will not be able to undertake an investigation without the approval of the Minister who, in turn, will be responsible to Parliament. If there is any duplication, or if there is any inquisitorial investigation which, so far from promoting the development and increasing the trade of Australia, is likely to hinder it, Parliament will have power to prevent it. Consequently, I ask the honourable gentleman not to press his amendment. Amendment negatived. Paragraph v of sub-clause a states that the powers and functions of the commission shall include the exercise of the prescribed powers of control and supervision of work. In this proposed power, I see the possibility of a definite conflict between the commission and State administrative authorities. If honourable members will turn to the principal agreement, they will find that, under clause 1, the State Governments are invited by the Commonwealth to submit full details of will, It h in k ; answer any proposed undertakings. These undertakings may include the acquiring or resuming of alienated land, the clearing or preparing of land for farm settlement, the construction of roads, bridges, &c, the construction and equipment of developmental railways, tramways, &c.; the construction of hydro-electric and water conservation works; the provision of irrigation farms; advances to settlers for the purchase of stock, equipment, housing material, &c.; advances to farmers or other rural employers for the erection of cottages for employees; the construction of sugar mills, butter factories, & c ; afforestation, and other undertakings. There is a long list of matters in relation to which the commission, under the agreement, may make inquiries. ParaThe graph v of sub-clause a might come into direct conflict with established State activities that form part of great national undertakings entered into by the Commonwealth and the States. For instance, the Commonwealth proposes to expend the sum of £20,000,000 on developmental roads. Some of the roads to be constructed in accordance with that policy might lead direct to a settlement conceived under this scheme. It is possible that the Migration Commission may be given prescribed powers of control and supervision over loan moneys the subject. matter of other agreements. Thus we might have a direct conflict between a State functioning as the agent of the Commonwealth in carrying out one great national undertaking and the same State carrying out an agreement between the Imperial and the Federal and State Governments. I should like to get some idea of the powers contemplated under this paragraph. It may be difficult for the Prime Minister to meet my desire; but I can see in this paragraph a fruitf ul source of disagreement and the possibility of a definite conflict, particularly as work of this description has to be approved by the Commonwealth on behalf of the Imnerial Government.",56,Paiiis

Paragraph v i of sub-clause a is the final, blank cheque. the development of Australian industries; sub-clause b deals with an entirely new phase. It commences "" In relation to migration to Australia."" Paragraph ( 1 ) seems innocuous enough, but I ask the Prime Minister whether it is possible for schemes already commenced by State Governments, but which are of doubtful value, to be taken up under this agreement? It is possible that we shall have three different parties in the one fieldthe new Council of Scientific and Industri a l Research, the Tariff Board, and the new body to be created under this bill. I should be glad to have the Prime Minister's assurance that the Government w ill not take over partly-developed State schemes and allow this new money, which is intended for definite development, to be spent i u connection with "" wild-cat"" schemes. ter and Ministerf or ExternalA f f a i r s) It is impossible [11.39] -The purpose of this commission is to ensure that we shall not embark upon any "" wild-cat"" schemes.

It seemed to me that without such a safeguard, if the commission had an unrestricted right to range over every industry in the country, primary and secondary, and over every kind of public work, there would be a distinct danger of it's clashing w i th the Tariff Board, and particularly with the Public Works Committee.

There is, however, a possible objection to the amendment. What machinery w ill be provided to enable either or both Houses of Parliament to consider a scheme opposed by the commission and the Commonwealth Government? As the provision stands, it would rest with the Government to bring the scheme before Parliament, so that if the Government supported the commission, Parliament would be powerless.

It should be the duty of the Government in such cases to bring the matter before Parliament. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [11.54] -The honourable member suggests that a scheme supported by a State Government, but opposed by the commission and the Commonwealth Government, would not come before Parliament for discussion.

There are many proposals which the Government refuses to bring before Parliament. It is open to honourable members to censure the Government for not taking certain action, and it is unreasonable to suggest that, in this instance, every proposition opposed by the Commonwealth Government and the commission should be the subject matter of a debate in this House. think the case will be met by providing that the commission shall not override Parliament. time being in charge of the affairs of the country must be responsible for submitting to Parliament proposals which it thinks Parliament should consider.

I feel sure that it is not the Prime Minister's idea that the commission shall be interminable. The chairman will be appointed for seven years, and therefore I propose that the operation of the bill be limited to that period. Some members of the commission will be appointed for five years, and at the end of that period they may be appointed for another five years. That would give that portion of the commission a life of ten years. A t the end of seven years the chairman may be appointed for another seven years, which would give him a life of fourteen years.
