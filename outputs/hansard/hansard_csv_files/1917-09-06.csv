13,Mr Ttjdor (Yarra) [2.38],"I makemotion, because .this being Grievance Bay, the sitting would in any case have been devoted to the discussion of grievances, and this among them. . Every honourable member will admit that the present industrial crisis ia the greatest with which Australia has been faced. WhatI ask is that the Government should intervene to obtain a just settlement of the strike. It is not my intention to do more than the Prime Minister, in many statements to the press, has said that he would do; that is, to touch very briefly upon the original cause of the dispute. The Prime Minister in his frequent utterances has been pleased.to say-that the men who are-at present connected with the Labour movement in Australia are men who have had no experience in industrial troubles. My remark applied to those who are responsible for the strike; that is quite a different matter. more spontaneous uprising by the people than that which has recently occurred. The trouble experienced by the Defence Committees, at any rate in this State, has' not been to get the men to go on strike, but . to keep them at their work. .That has been the experience throughout Australia. cult to make us believe that. care not whether or not the honourable member believes me, but there are thousands of people in the country who will take my word in preference to his. allowed a secret ballot 1 unions do not think satisfactory. matter should be dealt with fairly. I do not desire that we should do anything to fan the flame, as is being done by the newspapers at the present time. On Tuesday the Argus, in the course of an alleged account of the proceedings at a union meeting, stated that it was the intention of municipal employees to throw Melbourne into darkness. The Prime Minister, in a statement published ih to-day's press, states"" In Sydney the gasworkers have endeavoured to throw the city-into darkness. Melbourne is threatened with the same .calamity."" The secretary of the Municipal Employees Union wrote to the Argus denying its statement, and one would have thought that that journal would have had the common honesty.to publish the letter amongst the strike news, but the Argus, which pretends to be fair, inserted the letter at the bottom of a column amongst the telegrams. That letter was as follows:. Sir,I wish to contradict a report appearing in your issue of yesterday, stating that at a meeting of the Municipal Employees Union on Monday night, it was suggested that the Victorian strike committee should at once cut off the supplies of gas and electricity. Nothing of the Kind took place. The meeting discussed a totally different matter altogether. Neither gas nor electric power was mentioned. Neither was any discussion raised as ts whether the men would cease work or not Trusting you will insert tbese few lines so as let the public know the facts of the case Yours, &c, D. H. GRAY, Secretary. To that the editor attached this footnote "" Tho statement, to which Mr Gray takes exception was communicated to us by an officer of the union."" It is known that the State Government boast that they have spies attending union meetings, and are. able to know what takes place at those meetings. No union would allow spies at its meetings; but, unfortunately, ths unions do nob.know these men who are betraying them.

40,Mr Tudor,"The honourable memberwho started this trouble will drop the trade unions of Australia like a hot potato. They are a rabble. just made by the honourable member were often made in years gone by. Bogus unions have been formed before. A t the time of the London dock labourers' strike in 1889', I was working in London, and well remember the action then taken by Tom Mann, Ben Tillett, and John Burns to secure new and improved conditions for the workers. Their efforts were spoken of by such organizations as the Cotton Spinners' Association and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers as "" the new unionism."" The members of those associations declared that they were fighting for the old system of trade unionism. We may be sure that some people will always -consider that those who have anything to do with any struggle to improve the conditions of the workers should be denounced. The New South Wales Railways Commissioner sought to compel the men to adopt a system that had never before operated in their particular branch.

I know something of both piecework and day-labour work as carried on in factories, where there is a continual speeding up of workers. Some employers would make their employees practically mere cogs i u the machine. They grind as much as possible out of their men, because they know that, as a rule, a 6d. advertisement will bring others to take the place of those who in the struggle are knocked back. The object of the card system is to compel men to work at top speed. takes place, and that the men go too slow, what would the honourable member do ? ployers would do in such a case; they would pass out the men every time. As a matter of fact, that is done. There are in this Australia of ours many men who dye their hair because it has grown grey, knowing that it would be difficult to secure employment if they were thought to be old. I could bring here men who have had to do that in order to hold their own in the struggle, for employment. I contend that the employees had a right to object where this speeding up 1 was being insisted on. All that we ask. the Government to do is to intervene with the object of bringing about an equitable settlement of this industrial trouble, which is affecting all Australia-. member suggest what the Government should do? He must not forget that, as the political leader of the Labour forces in Australia, he has a responsibility. sponsibilities. In answer to the honourable member, let me say that I would have the Prime Minister do precisely what he did last year in. connection with a lesser industrial dispute In reply to a question put to him a few days ago, the Prime Minister said that he would not interfere with this dispute unless requested by both parties to do so.

Surely the Government will not say that they do not desire a just settlement? A r e we asking anything unfair when we ask for a just settlement? There are many employers who believe that they now have a chance of which they intend to take advantage, to crush and smash unionism, and who believe that, after this struggle, unionism will never be able to l if t its head in Australia -again.

70,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nbe termed national, or quasi-national, industrial upheavals. I , therefore, know as intimately as it"" is possible for any man to know, what unionism stands for. I say without hesitation that there is no evidence forthcoming that there is, as the honourable member has asserted, a conspiracy for the purpose of crushing unionism. dant evidence that there is a conspiracy among certain persons in our midst to render government by the people of Australia, as delimited by constitutional means, impossible. To this conspiracy the overwhelming bulk of the unionists now affected are unwittingly lending themselves-no t deliberately, because they are mere pawns in the game. There is no conspiracy to crush unionism, but there is a conspiracy to injure Great Britain, to disintegrate the Empire, and to hamper the Commonwealth in its war policy, to make constitutional government impossible. And the conspirators are those violent extremists, whom I shall group under one heading, and call Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners. A man who shuts his eyes to such obvious facts as obtrude themselves upon, the notice of all citizens must be a fool. The reason put forward for this strike is, on the face of it, a mere pretext. It is Commissioners announced, within twenty-four alleged that this card system is one which, if introduced in Australia* will reduce the workers here to the level of slaves. One honourable member in this House, by way of a question to me the other day, sought to persuade the House that this was so, and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr No man who believes in democracy can Tudor) has spoken about the conditions of labour in America. He has referred to the consequences of speeding up, which, he says, occur there, deducing that all these things arose from the card system or something similar to it, and that if this system were introduced in Australia, conditions analogous to those he has alleged would obtain in Australia. I do not believe it for a moment. Such talk is transparent nonsense. unionists of this country waited on me in a deputation the other day, I told them that I regarded such an assertion as a palpable attempt to bluff the community. I know the unionists of Australia too well to believe that they would tolerate such a thing for a moment. These harrowing stories of men having to dye their hair in order to conceal their age will surely impose upon no one. Every one but a fool knows that the dyeing of one's hair does not conceal one's age. It is the sort of thing that amuses fools, and serves for the purpose of clap-trap on the Yarra-bank and other places. No, sir, this is not the cause of this trouble. We must look in On the other hand, there is abunquite a different direction to find it. The trouble in this country is that there haa been for some time an insidious propaganda in our midst urging the workers not to speed up, but to slow down. In regard to the alleged cause of this strike, I do not say that one side to the dispute is more entitled to credence than the other. I accept statements from both sides for what they are worth; but on the facts as presented by both sides it would certainly appear that, so far from the Government of New South Wales being to blame in the matter, they did all that was possible to. avert it. At a deputation of representatives of the Trades Hall which waited on me in his presence the other day, Mr Hall, a member of the New South Wales Government, dealing with the genesis of the strike, saidThe representative of the amalgamated engineers notified the Commissioners for Railways in New South Wales that unless the hours, their intention not to introduce the card system, the unions would strike. The Government of New South Wales urged the men to withdraw this ultimatum, for a week at least, in order that the parties might discuss the question while the service was still being carried on. This the men refused to do. justify the action of Government employees in attempting to dictate to those who under the laws of a democratic country are entrusted with the management of State utilities as to how those utilities should be conducted. All that these men were asked to do was to continue in their work and discuss the matter amicably with the Government. Even such a thing as that is not entirely consoWhen the nant with the principles of democratic government, but at any rate these men were asked tc remain at work and to discuss the matter while they were working. Yet they declined point blank to do this sensible and obviously proper thing, and stood upon their ultimatum and left their work. Whatever virtue there is in Socialism is to be found in the substitution of the whole community for the individual.

76,Mr Hughes,"No doubt subsequent reflection of the consequences of this indiscreet revelation of the true nature of the struggle im pelled h i m to deny the accuracy of the report, which I quoted from the Herald of the 7th August. He saidI have not said on any occasion that this was a test between the Nationalist party and the Labour party. I refer Mr Fuller to my statement that, so far as the Government is concerned, it was not so much opposed to granting the conference's request that the men should refuse to work on conditions, but that the Government, backed up by the Chamber of Commerce and the Employers Federation, was attempting to crush trade unionism. the honourable member under the standing order has expired. MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [3.34] The Prime Minister states that the men who commenced this dispute are disloyalists, who seek to bring about the downfall of Great Britain and her Allies, and are engaged in initiating a "" goslow "" policy. Every one knows that the dispute arose in the Randwick tramway workshops. The railway and tramway men who are now out on strike have contributed £160,000 to the patriotic funds, a larger sum than has been contributed by any other section of the community. contributions have not been made like some of those of the big merchants and manufacturers. Prices Board shows that some of the latter have given £250 and like amounts to patriotic funds, and then charged their donations against the goods they were making and selling, passing on the cost to the general public while taking credit for patriotic spirit. The men at Randwick have contributed out of their wages, and their donations cannot be equalled, man for man, and proportionately to their means, by those of any other section of the community. the men worked on .Sundays and at night after their-usual working hours to provide furniture for the Randwick Military Hospital, and this they d i d free of' cost. Yet they are said to be disloyal and lazy, men who would not do a day's work if they could help it ! Every considerable family among them is represented at the Front. These facts are a sufficient answer to the statements of the Prime Minister. What is the question now at issue? The Prime Minister knows it as well as any man in the country, but it does not suit him at the present time to acknowledge the fact. The trouble goes to the very root of trade union organization. The principle that combined workmen shall have the opportunity to negotiate as to the terms and conditions under which they shall sell their labour in the market has been attacked. When Labour becomes unable to do that the edifice of trade unionism w ill crumble to the ground. No one knows this better than ^the Prime Minister and the Minister for tlie Navy., In a manifesto issued to the soldiers in the trenches, the Prime Minister said that if the Nationalist party were returned, not one stone in the temple of labour would be disturbed. Now, however, the Commonwealth and State Governments have joined to crush trade unionism in Australia. We have been told of the twenty-four hours' ultimatum given by the men who are now out on strike. The PrimeM in ister has adcepted the statement of the Attorney-General of New South Wales to this effect, but he has not given publicity to the oflicial statement of the Strike Committee, which is an absolute denial of that of the A t torney-General of New South, Wales. As a matter of fact, a card system was These introduced into the Randwick workshops twelve months ago, when the men were called upon to fill up their own cards. The evidence of the They made such a strong protest against this to the management, that the system was withdrawn; and it was re-introduced on the second occasion without notification or warning. There is a dispute as to the exact intention of the system. On behalf of the strikers it is said that a system, involving the use of a series of six cards, has been introduced which, if not actually the Taylor speeding-up and Furthermore, sweating system of America, is an approximation, imitation, or modification of it . It has "" been said that the New South Wales card' system has nothing to do with speeding up; but Senator Gardiner, when addressing a meeting of the tramway men at Waverley on the 12th August, produced ,a card-that numbered "" 6 ""-and read this question from it 6. Are there any hands in your section who are not satisfactory? The questions were to be answered by so called sub-foremen, about 300 of whom have been lately appointed. These are",27,Honourable Member Tha T Is Card System During The War Nothing
77,Mr Speaker,"The time allowed tonot men in whom the workmen have confidence. Their job was refused by those who are looked upon as decent unionists and decent workmen. It is those who are Considered sneaks by their fellows who have become sub-foremen, and these had to fill up the secret cards, which were not to be seeu by the men, stating, among other things, whether the work of the dozen or twenty men in the section of each was, or was not, satisfactory. Before Senator Gardiner's statement was published in the press, the Sydney Morning Herald's representative waited on the Chief Railways Commissioner regarding it , and asked for an explanation. This was published in the Herald on the 13th August in the following terms: Mr Frazer denied the statement. The card system, he said, provides only for a record of work done, and time taken on each job, and 1 does not make any provision whatsoever for answering questions as to the men being unsatisfactory. Senator Gardiner then called at the Herald office, and produced the card from which he had read, which had been printed at the Government Printing Office, Sydney, and bore the imprint of that office. The Herald next day printed what he had said, which proved that what the Chief Commissioner had said -was not true. Having thus been absolutely bowled out, the Chief Commissioner repliedYes, that was one system which had been got together, but that is not the system which we were introducing. system which had hot been introduced. Mr J. H . CATTS -He said that it was one of a number of systems which was being considered, but that it had not been introduced. the Chief Commissioner said that he knew nothing about such a card, and then, when bowled out by the presentation of it in the newspaper office, gave another explanation, so qualifies the denial of the effect of the system, as urged by the strikers, as to strongly support the claim for a tnorough inquiry. Remembering the negotiations that ' have taken place during the past twelve months, the statement that the men left work within twenty-four hours is absolutely untrue. A change was being introduced into their working conditions, and, surely, when a large and respected body of workmen unanimously object to such a system there is reason for inquiry into it. If the fears of the men are groundless why shirk an inquiry? The Arbitration Court is in existence to determine the conditions of employment, and the men have stated officially over and over again, and still say, "" Give us an inquiry, choosing your own tribunal, and if we cannot make out a case for the withdrawal of the card system, and if the decision of the Judge is against us, we shall return to work immediately?"" The Government refuse that fair request. fore the Government ? Mr J. H . CATTS -A t the very commencement of the dispute, and it is before them now. ,' Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes.

85,Mr Rodgebs,"There should have been-work. The Prime Minister has referred to the stoppage of work by large numbers of men who have no cause in this dispute, and the Minister for the Nav$_has made a statement to the same effect. union leaders, those Ministers know perfectly well that where "" black "" labour is introduced into an industry for the purpose of strike breaking, and where the goods handled by that ""black"" labour are sent into another industry, uniformly the strike follows those goods. Those gentlemen have been, times out of number, parties to strikes against the introduction of "" scab "" labour. The Prime Minister referred to the New Zealand dispute. Of course, some men were prevented from leaving tbeir work because, as the honourable member as an old strike leader knows, strikes must be conducted by obedience to orders. Those men who are directed to remain at work must do so, and those directed to cease work should stop immediately. That was done in connection with another strike when the PrimeM in ister was one of the leaders. Some men ceased work and others remained in their employment when they were ordered to do so. The request at that time that the wharf labourers and others should remain at work, was not in order that they could better help production by remaining at work, but because they could better help the industrial dispute by so doing. The Prime Minister knows that such things happen in the management of every strike. 1913. Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honourable member knows that he has carried out the doctrine to which I refer, time after time. the partisan attitude of the Commonwealth Government in connection with this dispute, and the use of the machinery created for the conduct of the international conflict for the purpose of crushing unionism within Australia. I have some matter to place before the Housei n reference to those aspects, but as my time has expired, I shall defer my further remarks to a later hour. Minister for the Navy) [3.40] -As the honourable member for Cook mentioned my name several times during his short speech, I should like to say a few words on this very important matter. Not one of the reasons stated by the honourable [66] member for the extension of the strike applies in regard to a great deal of the labour that is on strike. The honourable member said that! the men l e f t their work As old because they were asked to do this and to do the other thing. There are 2,000 men out of work at the dock to-day for no earthly reason. They left their work at a minute's notice. They were not asked to handle anything that was "" black."" They were attending to the ordinary work of looking after the transports, and sending men to the Eront. They dropped their tools' at a moment's notice without rhyme or reason. It is too late in the day to begin to raise these gags; they are not true, and they ought not to be repeated. The reasons stated by the honourable member are not those for wbich the men went out on strike. Just what the reasons are I do not pretend to know. I was not even paid the compliment of being told that the men intended to leave their work. Do honourable members know that the men are.still refusing to man a hospital ship? Last! evening they agreed that! they would load by union labour a hospital ship now at Port Melbourne, and to-day the stokers are out on strike, and will not permit the work to proceed. trying to get them to return. not work. many similar instances. I do not wish to dilate on the existing state of affairs-it i It did not happen in is sad enough and tragic enough-bu t I do say that, union or no union, the men had no right to hold up the transports, i Whatever their feelings may be as to local disputes, they are not justified, in any I had hoped to refer to circumstances, cr from any consideration, in preventing the transports leaving for the Front. Honourable members opposite know, as well as I do, that there is no excuse for what has been done. Everything in reason has been done to induce the men to do this work, but without avail. For what reason have they acted in this way ? The reason is that they were ordered out of their employment by an official, who simply told them to cease work; and cease work they d i d , on the instant. That is how the general cessation of work at the docks has happened. There was no notice or intimation that they were about to strike. They were simply ordered out of work, and out they went.

What is the strike for? The honourable member for Cook says it is a strike for the right to negotiate as to the conditions under which the men shall sell their labour. Sell tlieir labour to whom?

Mr J. H . CATTS -Has the honourable member seen the system ? the cards aspublished, and I see nothing in them but a record of work done.

Every striker is a The Leader of the Opposition asked the Government to intervene, and to effect a just settlement of this dispute.

101,Mr Josephcook,"I have neverthan the present trouble, and for the Government to intervene and take the matter out of the hands of any State Government would be, in my judgment, to do an unwise and an unjust thing. The Minister for tbe Navy has made a very noisy speech, which gives us very -little hope that the Governmenx will do anything to try to bring the strike to a cona class of people who believe in the In-, clusion. If we may judge by the speeches of the Prime Minister and his colleague, it would appear that the Win-the-war party, having succeeded in. smashing the Labour party politically, hope to smash it industrially. They hope to break up the unions. There are two classes of industrial unions. The one may be spoken of as* the genuine trade unions, while the other is the bogus production calling itself labour, but fighting the genuine trade unionists all the time. I regret that the Prime Minister is not present. He seems of late to come into this chamber 'as little as possible. He attends to answer questions, and then leaves. The explanation, I suppose, is that he is unable to bear the criticism of the Opposition, although it may be that he realizes that he occupies a most inconsistent .position. Ministerial supporters aTe welcome to both the Prime Minister and his first lieutenant, the Minister for the Navy. If the situation were not so serious, it would be amusing to them to find that they have as their leaders two honourable gentlemen who, in the olden days, used to teach the working classes of Australia the principles of trade unionism. If the workers err at all at the present time, it is because of the teachings they had from the lips of the Prime Minister and the Minis-, ter for the Navy (Mr Cook) when they were leading the trade union movement.'

We cannot educate the people and expect them, with their education, to submit to injustice. We must have our schoolmasters; we must see that every child in the community is educated, and, since we do that, is it reasonable to expect that educated people will put up with conditions that belong to a by-gone age? This trouble has arisen because of the determination of the New South Wales Government to introduce the card system. We need not trouble ourselves with the question of whether or not it is the Taylor system, or a modification of it, that has been introduced'. The outstanding fa'ct is that a card system, to which the men object, has been introduced during war time. Mr Beeby, a member of the New South Wales Government, came to Melbourne to tell the Prime Minister everything concerning the impending dispute, and if the Prime Minister had pointed out to him that the Federal Government could not support the State Ministry in making such an important change during war time, I do not think the State authorities would have taken up such a strong position. I take leave to say that the Prime Minister was fully aware of every action that the New South Wales Government was taking, and I cannot believe that he did not encourage Mr Beeby to go on.

'venture to suggest that a much truer description of it would be that it is an effort on the .parti of those who desl'royed the Labour movement as we have known it in Australia to go further, and to destroy the trade union movement. I have listened with attention to the 1 speeches delivered by honourable members of the Labour Opposition in the hope of hearing some reasons for the strike, or some words in .justification of it . I am not surprised that we have heard nothing of the inner history of this strike from those who have addressed themselves this afternoon to that task. The new masters of the trade union movement have the same contempt for a Labour member in Parliament that they have for the old leaders of trade unionism in this country. The honourable gentlemen who profess to expound the inner working of this strike are little, if any, more in the confidence of the men who made the strike than are honourable members on this side. The whole design was made in the City of Melbourne as part of the anfi-conscription campaign a long time ago; and I think that this is the thir d occasion on which the movement has got away from its leaders. It was not intended that this strike should take place this month; it has come a month before its time. certainly never could have been intended to have it fought on so flimsy a pretext as that, when an employer asked his employees to say how .they spend the hours for which he pays them, such a request sliould be regarded as an invasion of the sacred rights of Labour. whole of my working lif e I have had, myself, to fill in just such details as the railway men are now asked to fill in . The Labour paper which I managed is still managed under the. same system, and more details are required from its workmen than the Railways Commissioners are asking from their employees. new unionism has been opposed by the best men in the trade union movement since first it showed itself in Australia. It preaches a doctrine of utter destruction to the. industries of any country-the doctrine that a man may loaf, may take the wages of an employer, and not earn them, and that the more a man loafs the more it is to his credit. are responsible for this strike, and responsible for the destruction of the Labour movement as it existed before last election, preach this doctrine openly, and it is preached in tlie processions in Sydney to-day as part of the strike propaganda. This pretence of honourable gentlemen not very closely associated with the Labour movement except in its political offices, that this is not 'being done, is idle talk at this time of day, when everybody interested in the preservation of the trade union movement knows that, unless this new element can be scotched, the movement is going to lose the whole of its power. When they talk about the National Governments of Australia being determined on the destruction of the trade union movement, I say that the only thing that can save the movement for the effective work it has hitherto done is for the political leaders-hardl y the political leaders, but the political heads-of the Labour party as it exists to-day to set themselves determinedly to crush out the new element instead of becoming its ready mouth-pieces in a crisis sucb as this. What is this strike about? This strike in New South Wales professes to be about the introduction of a card system by which a return is made of the time spent on the various jobs. The honourable It member for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts) most ingeniously tried to convey the idea that this matter had been in .negotiation for twelve months. Mr J. H . CATTS -S o it had. During the accurate. It is twelve months since the Railway Commissioner asked the men to do what men in other engineering establishments have been doing all along-to fill in their own cards-bu t at that time they refused to do so; and u n t i l a few months, or weeks, ago the proposal had not been revived. Therefore, to say that This there had been agitation and negotiations for twelve months is an unfair misrepresentation of the facts. Mr J. H .

108,Mr Lamond,"T h a t is absolutely i n1766 how unreal are the reasons given for this strike, the objection first taken was that the men .were not allowed to fill in the cards themselves; that is, the first public objection taken in New Soutn Wales to the proposal that sub-foremen should fill in the cards, was that the men had not been allowed to fill' them in themselves. The Commissioner said to the men, "" Twelve montlis ago you refused to fill in the cards yourselves "" and' from that time, on a new story haa been told. But nexion with the trouble is that the leaders doned all pretence that the proposed system is the speeding-up system of America. As is shown quite clearly in the negotiations of the Lord .Mayor of Sydney with the State Government, the condition on which the men now talk of going back to work is not the withdrawal of this iniquitous system of speeding-up, but an inquiry into all the grievances of all tlie meu who have come out. What State enterprise 'can hope to live, if a Government give in to that sort of proposition-if on the flimsiest pretext a dozen men may stop work somewhere, and immediately' all the other associated unions come out and refuse to return until a Royal Commission, or some other body, inquires into all the grievances that all the leaders can produce for investigation f I point out again that not only are these new leaders of the Labour movement set on the destruction of the indust r i a l movement as we have known it , but, main on strike when they might have 'they are making ifc impossible for any extension of State enterprise to be considered. They have done more in the past year, in the State of New South Wales-thos o men who are controlling the trade union movement to-day-to undo the work that the Labour movement has done in securing the nationalization of indusbries, than all the enemies of nationalization have done in the twenty-five years of the existence of the Labour party. In supporting the men who have the conduct of this strike, those who are pledged to the introduction of nationalization are assisting to make it impossible for further industries to be nationalized. If successful, this doctrine that a man may take the wages of another and loafthat a man may make a solemn agreement to-day and break it to-morrowwill reduce our nation to a level below Adjournment (Formal) -: :-REPRESENTATIVES.] Industrial Crisis. I do not. To show that of any other civilized community. What basis are we to have for our association with other men when the pledged word cannot be accepted ? What basis have we for association with bodies of men, ior the conduct of industries, for social intercourse, for anything in the world, if the written agreement given to-day is to be flouted without concern to-morrow ? The doctrines that these men are preaching in cessantly throughout the Labour movement are doctrines entirely subversive of the striking fact in conall human intercourse. The duty of trade unionists who respect honour-wh o beof the men have abanlieve in a fair return for the benefits they enjoy at the hands of society to-day-is to set themselves the task of rooting out of the movement every element of this new propaganda that has been brought into Australia during the past seven ""or eight years. to get any hold. / the party for five of those years. ber for Illawarra would have been out defending the strikers to-day if it had not been for the conscription issue.. I speak with f u l l knowledge, that but for the conscript-ion issue we should not have been considering this strike at all. Those honourable gentlemen who, by their approval, have incited those men to regone back with honour and dignity, overlook two facts. First of all, they overlook the fact that this country is at war, and that it is still on. the knees of the gods whether we shall retain this country. Then they overlook the fact that, by encouraging these men to go out on strike, and keep out, they are producing misery in the families of the best of the unionists. Who are the men who, in these industrial upheavals, always lose their jobs, if jobs are lost? The men who are edging on the strikers take care to get back to their jobs. The man who shouts loudest at the mass meeting is the one who goes back, helter-skelter, as in the last tramway strike, and rushes the office for his job. The men who w ill pay for the mistakes of these new leaders are the best men in the unions, together with their wives and families.

114,Mr Lamond,"I venture to say, andkept to the f r o n t instead of the personal advantage of some of the leaders being kept in view, the strike would have been over in a week. I am inclined to believe that while the overwhelming majority of the trade unionists of this country are entirely opposed to those who are trying to paralyze the arm of the nation in this war, there has been, throughout the industrial organizations, a persistent and consistent propaganda directed to one object, and to one object only-the object of provoking any trouble anywhere that w ill add to the difficulties of the Government in conducting the war. The best evidence that honourable gentlemen on the other side could have given of the sincerity of their protestations of loyalty at this time would have been to tell the men what the inevitable effect of their action must be. Why was it necessary that the State Government should give an answer to the men in twenty-four hours? Opposition this afternoon gave no reason for the strike at all. member for Cook( MrJ . H . Catts) gave some reasons; but neither of these gentlemen attemped to say why it was necessary that th© Railway Commissioners, should come to a decision in twenty-four hours. Mr J. H .

The remarks of the honourable member for LUawarra( Mr Lamond), from beginning to end, may have been absolutely correct, and, as such, we might possibly agree with them. But the honourable member presents a most remarkable spectacle. He could not enter into the debate without making some imputation on honourable members on this side. Whatever may have been the faults and errors of trade unionism-and there are. many-the y do not commence to-day; they date back for many years. They are part of the weak"" ness of the individuals composing the unions But the honourable member for Illawarra never assumed the virtues of unionism unti l it provided him with a job, nor did he find any vices in it u n t i l he lost that job. We have had denunciations of trade unionism for twenty years past. The right honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Joseph Cook) left it because he thought that it was being improperly manipulated, and other men from time to time have denounced it , but we have not The Leader of the heard from the honourable member for Illawarra a single word as to its vices or The honourable follies until he came to be separated from it .

127,Mr Anstey,"I had no wish to makedoes. The Prime Minister says that it is not the product of an industrial dispute, but that it is a conspiracy brought about by men who are Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners, whose objects are to bring danger to the country, and to do things that are inimical to the Commonwealth and its anxiety to carry on the war to a successful issue If the Prime Minister believes this, why has he not done his duty, and brought these men to justice? This Government has refrained from taking any action against these men who are supposed to be tiie enemies of the country and the Empire, and who are supposed to be preventing the Government from doing what it wishes to do in connection with the war. No one knows what that is. No one has seen any action towards winning the war on the part of the Government since it has been elected. is right; the Government ought to take action against these men. action, but it has refrained from doinj; so Either the statement that the men who have instigated this strike are inspired by Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners cannot be true, or the Government stands condemned of treachery to the community and the Empire by remaining inactive. The Dean of Sydney seems to have put the present position accurately -and his contention is unanswerable; at least, it has not yet been answeredwhen he said that if the employer is entitled to put conditions on the men, the men have not a less right to resist. The Age, in a leading article in which it condemns the men, admits that what incited this strike was the action of the New South ""Wales Government in producing the cause of the dispute. trate. arbitration. If it was a case in which a body of men held up the Government by asking for the imposition of a new set of conditions, the primary cause of the trouble would be theirs, but it is admitted on all sides that the primary cause of this trouble was the action of the State Government. If ever there has been need for clear and definite action on the part of the Commonwealth Government to intercede with a State Government it is present now. In fact, when the present dispute arose the. Commonwealth should have demanded of the State Government that it should do nothing to precipitate this country into an industrial crisis at this time. If it be true that, behind all this, there is a veiled and shadowy figure of some unnamed conspiracy, the Government likewise stands condemned. Surely the conspirators are known. They cannot be like those German agents who walked abroad and distributed money everywhere, and yet could not be discovered. We were told that German influence had been eliminated, and that the last tentacle had been cut, but it was a deliberate lie, or it was an act of treachery on the part of the Government that no action was taken against those"" German agents who were supposed to be walking abroad and distributing this money broadcast. We have to face the present position and deal with it with something more than words. If men are conspiring to do what the Prime Minister accuses them of doing it was an act of folly on their part to declare a strike at this time of the year. Tn the history of the Comnfonwealth there has been no proposition put up by the employing class or by a Government representing the employing class against the working classes and against which it was believed the latter would rebel that has not been put up just about July or August. That was the case in the big maritime strike, and again in 1893; it was the case also in 1903; it waa likewise the case in the agricultural implement makers' struggle. Whenever anything is put up that the working' classes are likely to dispute it is always done in July or August. I see no evidence of any conspiracy in this strike, but I do see evidence of mad folly. The right honourable member for Parramatta, in stating that 75 per cent, of the men are absolutely loyalists in regard to the interests of tbeir country, has answered the statement that these men are the mere tools and instruments of individuals. As a matter of fact, the men on strike are absolutely leaderless. I have never seen such spontaneous action, such a spontaneous uprising of the working classes as has occurred on this occasion. There has been a clear break away from everything. As the Prime Minister has said, the trouble has always",36,Honourable Member Tha T Is Card System During The War Nothing

The history of all Parliaments shows that every party some day becomes the minority. The grievance discussion might, perhaps, in any case, be ended before the dinner adjournment; but, in my opinion, it would be better to let it proceed unchecked, and, should it then be necessary to keep the House sitting all night to get the Government business through, I promise to stay to keep a quorum.

The latest regulation is of such a character that no man can stand on the public platforms of the country in safety. He does not know in what manner he may be infringing the laws, or to what penalties he will be subjected. We have been told that the men on strike are causing immense injury to recruiting. I assure the House that the principal injury to recruiting is not caused so much by the action of any men in this country as by the statements which are reaching the people in hundreds of letters sent from the Front. The mail to-day has brought me two or three letters mentioning several cases. Here are particulars of several cases that came before Brigadier-General Graham-Thomson. One man was asleep in his dug-out when the sergeant-major came in and kicked him. He absented himself for forty-eight hours. He was charged with being absent without leave and with having struck a superior officer in the execution of his duty. It was admitted that the kick was administered before the offence was committed, but he received two years' imprisonment. The prisoner's letter continuesThere are 250 prisoners here, 75 per oent.

Wo. 4769, of the 6th Battalion, was tried by court martial on the 13th July, 1916. He Was charged with drunkenness and with having fallen out of the march, and received twelve months' imprisonment. He was put into a cell, and StaffSergeant Barry called him out, and bashed him on the head with a trenching implement and when the man came to his senses he found a gag in his mouth. These sort of statements are contained in hundreds of letters that are coming to Australia, and are doing more to injure recruiting than any action of the indusMr Anstey. trial workers. No. 858, of the 6th Battalion, was charged with seven offences(1) Drunkenness, (2) absent without leave, (3) striking an officer, (4) insubordination, (5) breaking out of camp (6) refusing to obey orders, (7) refusing to parade, and the same officer who gave the other man twelve months for falling out. on a march to Armentieres awarded this man forty-two days' No. 1 field punishment.

That discontent arises largely from the fact that the profiteers are governing the country. Bodies of workmen throughout Australia who have adopted peacef ul processes, who have approached the Arbitration Court and the Wages Board, and have followed the ordinary processes of the law in order to improve their conditions, and, who in many cases have loyally abided by the awards of those tribunals, have found that when they get an increase of 6d. or ls. per day on the one hand, the profiteer on the other hand takes from them, their wives, and children, An additional 3s. per day. do not rely on my own knowledge in making that statement. the words of the Prime Minister before he went to England as to the conditions in this country. pamphlet which he was about to issue in connection with the referenda, he stated that the bitter enemies of tlie country were the men who were seeking to make profits during this time of war. fiteering is the fundamental cause of the widespread discontent. not a conspiracy, because there is no organization in it . outburst of popular resentment. all the countries engaged in the war Australia has experienced the smallest relative rise in prices? mit that.

That It is the soundest policy that could be pursued by any Government to-day. I urge its adoption by the Government in the present crisis. I see quite plainly what is happening. The most bitter men' in this Parliament are not our old opponents, such as the right honourable member for Swan( Sir John Porrest), and the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine). The most bitter and vindictive and the most foolish are those who were our old associates in the Labour party.

Honourable members opposite may say that a man has not offended against the laws of the country because he is a loyal citizen, but by his very actions he is building up a spirit of resentment amongst the workers engaged in the struggle. If this trouble continues, we may reach a point when the Government will have to take up arms to suppress the strikers, and when that happens in a time of war the consequences may be something that all would be very anxious to avoid. We ought not to discuss in this Chamber who is right and who is wrong in the present dispute. It may be that the men are wrong, and -if they are, ought ir not to be the duty of the Government to endeavour to bring influence to bear on the Government of New South Wales, and say that no matter who is right and who is wrong, there must be a conclusion to this conflict?

I earnestly urge the supporters of the Government to bring influence to bear on Ministers, and* I appeal to the Government not to pursue a vendetta againsb the workers, but to put aside all questions of right or wrong, and endeavour to bring this trouble speedily to a conclusion by I say, even telling the Government of New South, Wales that a settlement is necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth.

It waa as follows:I \ am informed that owing to serious, civil disorder with which the local police were powerless to deal, it was found necessary by the State Government to send additional police from Adelaide, and subsequently others from Sydney. I am further informed that in order to meet with any development, a special train was held in readiness to despatch further police to Broken Hill.

I may briefly state the facts which led me to put this qutestion. RecentlyI visited Sydney, and subsequently went to BrokenH ill . In passing through Adelaide, I was told, in the course of conversation with some soldiers from Mitcham Camp, that it was a positive fact that a picked body of men was held in readiness for despatch to BrokenH ill . employees of the South Australian Government also told me that a special train to convey the men to BrokenH ill was held in readiness at Mitcham Camp. has a direct contradiction of the statement as to the special trainT I presume he accepts it . else. I certainly accept the statement made to me by men in Mitcham Camp, who had no reason to tell me an untruth. One of their number .actually informed ' me that he was thinking of applying for inclusion in the contingent, as he desired, to revisit BrokenH ill . I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement made by these men. There is another question to which I desire to refer. This afternoon I asked the Postmaster-General whether it was a fact that a telegram sent on the 17th August last by the secretary of the Barrier branch of the Coal and Shale Miners Federation to Mr Willis, general secretary of the federation in Sydney, asking what action should be taken by the Barrier miners, was not delivered u n t i l Monday, 20th August, the day after the BrokenH ill miners went on strike. I in quired further whether the Postmaster General would inform the House of the cause of the delay in the delivery of the message. The answer I received was that inquiries were being made, and that a reply would be furnished as soon as possible. While at BrokenH ill , the secretary of the Barrier branch of the Federated Coal and Shale Miners informed me that he had sent this telegram to Mr. Willis. That telegram was kept back; it was not delivered promptly to Mr Willis. It evades the quesMessrs. Willis, Thompson, and Kavanagh were arrested in a provocative manner, and the men at BrokenH ill received no reply to their message. On the other hand, a news telegram from Sydney was allowed to reach BrokenH ill stating that It is only a denial the coal mine employees all over the country had been called out by the Strike Committee sitting in Sydney. The telegram to Mr Willis did not reach him until the BrokenH ill miners had gone out on strike. member is certain of his facts?

Mr Innes informs me that he telegraphed a reply stating that the SouthI cannot do much Australian police were responsible for the trouble in BrokenH ill . The telegram, as it reached Mr Brookfield, however, stated, "" Police not responsible for the trouble."" That also calls for some explanation. Coming to the present industrial trouble, the fact which confronts us is that the New South Wales Railways Commissioner tried to impose new conditions on the railway men. The men offered, and are still offering, to return to work simultaneously with the appointment of a t r i bunal to deal with the whole matter, but the Government of New South Wales, backed up by its friends, is still holding out.

I , too, believe there has been a conspiracy, just as I believe 'that Mr Fuller, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, was right when he stated that there was a strike promotion committee in New South Wales. I think, however, that both Mr Fuller and the Prime Minister know more about the strike promotion committee, and the conspiracy to cause this general upheaval, than any other men in ' Australia. I believe that this upheaval is a direct result of the conscription agitation in Australia -that it is the result of the. failure to secure conscription, not for the purpose of winning the war in Europe, but for the purpose of "" w in n in g the w a r "" against labour in Australia by diluting skilled labour and bringing down the strength of the industrial organizations. That, in my opinion, was the real purpose of asking the people to vote for conscription. Ever since that conscription campaign failed, there has been a newspaper campaign unions in Australia. been told that the insatiable demands of labour must be met by organization on the part of employers-that the cessations of work from time to time w ill have to stop, and that labour must be taught that it does not rule the country. That is the-kind of business that has been going on; and we have had the mouthpieces of the employers speaking in similar strain throughout the length and breadth of the land. Mr Beeby has, metaphorically speaking, been dragging his coat all around New South Wales, and inviting the unions to tread on the t a i l ; he has talked about the trend of industrial organization, and the development of one big union, which, according to him, will attempt to dictate to the Government of the country.

Foster Fraser is a keen observer-reader s of his books do not agree with him in all his statements-bu t I should like to read Borne of his observations regarding American methods for honourable members to take as they may think fit. I have a very large acquaintance with Americans who have visited this country, and have had the honour of knowing every American Consul who has been in Melbourne over a very long period of years. Foster Fraser says on page 48 of his book, Industrial 'AmericaBut it is the American idea that the harder a man works the harder he can work, and working under a stimulus like this, an American working man will often do double, and even treble, the work of a British working man, but though it is at an increased wage, it is not a double or treble wage, and that is where tlie American manufacturer scores. He says that an English workman w ill not hurry, bub that he has seen an American workman run to get a hammer. Yet after twelve months the English workman in America will acquire the hustling methods of the American workman. Mr. Fraser saysI t is a hard system-no t so hard at Baldwin's, for Baldwin's among American works is almost an ideal place. Baldwin's is a big engineering works, but they see there that they get every ounce of effort that the men can give during the ten hours that they work each day.

With a careless smile he said, "" Have a smoke, and we'll take a car ride along to the cemetery.""

It is a l l . very well to ask, "" What about the men at the Front ?"" I know how the voting there was faked. The soldiers never had a chance to give a fair vote. Let me read from a letter which I received this very day. I see by a paper that Webster made a speech Mr from the Post Office that they may put the referendum again before the people. Well, all I can say is that Hughes and his mob will get a shock. I suppose they are going on the result of the elections; but a great many of the soldiers took no interest in it, and voted any way, and some said "" Good old Billy Hughes"" -w e say "" old Billy Hughes.""

I * have one, which I shall show to any honourable member who wishes to see it , signed by no less than eighteen men of the 1st Battalion in France. Members on this side have had to fight against everything; even the blasphemy of vile religious bigotry has been uttered from the pulpits.

No one has spoken more strongly against the Kaiser than I have. I have said at meetings which I have addressed in furtherance of voluntary enlistment that the day had come when not only should men give their lives, but the men who had caused the workers to die should pay the penalty, and I hoped that the Kaiser and every kinglet and princelet who had caused the If that were markedly war would be hung in the streets of Berlin. Are such words as those likely to be welcomed by the Kaiser? I would die willingly if I could cause that brutal destroyer of human l if e to disappear.

On that land there was first built a* brewery, and the fumes of beer almost enshrouded the House of God. But that was not sufficient. James Service and Company, wine and spirit merchants, next erected preo mises there, and the church was then clouded in the fumes of wine, beer, and spirits.

A further sum of £6,000,000 may therefore be raised under the Acts already passed. The following are particulars of our war expenditure:War Expenditure out of Loan and Revenue up to 30th June, 1918. Out of loan Out of revenue less Sinking Fund Total expenditure on [account of tlie war, including estimate for 1917-18 Includedi n the above estimate of expenditure out of loan in 1917-18 is an amount of £26,000,000, which is due to the British Government for the maintenance of the troops at the Front, and the supply to them of munitions. The estimated expenditure by the B r i tish Government in respect of the Australian Imperial Force up to 30th June, 1917, is £28,500,000, and up to the 30th June, 1918, a further .amount of £29,750,000.

The amount required for war loan expenditure, if everything were paid, would be about £91,000,000. Parliament is, however, asked for only £80,000,000 of authorization at the present time.

The Government is acting in complete accord with the financial institutions, which have promised their valuable assistance. It is believed that the new war loan will be very successful. The Government has given a good deal of consideration to the question whether it would be advisable to alter the terms and conditions for the future, pr to adhere to the terms and conditions of the former loans. We have decided to do £.s I have stated, namely, to adopt the same terms and conditions as previously.

It may be looked upon as inconsistency on my part to raise objections to the proposal to exempt the interest earned by investors i u the Commonwealth war loans from income taxation, but the experience that I the last flotation convinced me of ,the inequality.of the system. Freedomf r o m payment of income tax means nothing to the small men, but it means an enormous amount of money to the men who would otherwise be liable to pay income tax at the highest rate, and, instead of our borrowing the money at 4-§ per cent., it w ill really mean 5 per cent, in many instances, and in some cases as much as 6 per cent. I would much rather the Treasurer had asked us to agree to the payment of 5 per cent, interest, making the interest liable to income taxation. It would have been much fairer than the present system, which gives the big man so much advantage over the small man. Certainly the rate of in terest received by the big man is the same as that received by the small man, but, as the income tax rate on the highest grade of incomes is 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 , the Treasury w ill lose a considerable amount of revenue by the exemption from liabilit y to pay income tax of the interest earned by the big man on his investment in Commonwealth war loans. There is another way of looking at the matter. We have already borrowed £80,000,000 in Australia. That means that about one-twelfth of the available capital of the Commonwealth is not liable to the payment of income tax, and before we are through this war we w ill exhaust practically one-sixth of the area available for the taxation of income. It w ill i m pose a very much heavier burden on the remainder of that taxable area. In giving consideration to the matter of warsaving certificates, I fixed the rate of in terest at 5 per cent., and provided for no exemption from the payment of income taxation, for the very reasons that I am JOHN FORREST) pronow advancing, but my successor has extended that freedom to those certificates, and the consequence is that the man who I take puts £1,000 into the certificates derives a much greater advantage than does the man who invests £20 in them. I am quite satisfied that a little increase in the rate of interest would enable us to raise tlie whole of the money that we require for war purposes without there being any necessity to grant an exemption from income taxation; the taxation will create a very serious situation in the future. In any case, it would insure equality of treatment to those who subscribe gained in connection with to our loans. I feei sure that when we make allowance for the reduction in our income tax revenue, which would otherwise be paid by those large institutions that have put so much money into our war loans, we shall find that the actual rate of interest paid on our scrip is at least 6 per cent. I am anxious to know whether this authorization w ill commit us to float the f u l l £80,000,000 with the freedom from liability to pay",56,Warloanbill No 2

CATTS I am referring to the use of the Naval and Military Forces, paid for by loan moneys, in connection with industrial disturbances. quorum in the House. [Quorum formed.] MrJ , H . CATTS -The soldiers at the military camp at Menangle, in New South Wales, were ordered to line up on parade, and were directed to cheer blackleg railway men as they passed with their trains. A paragraph of a letter which I have received from the secretary of the Picton Labour League, dated 23rd August last, reads as follows: During the strike the soldiers at Menangle Ctimp were formed into a parade, and an officer addressed them, and requested the men to say which side they favoured, the Government or the men. Those in favour of the former were to assemble at the railway line when the trains were passing, and "" cheer "" the loyal train officials. Out of about 1,000 men, only about 100 carried out this miserable instruction. The Picton Labour League is situated close to this camp, and kept informed of what is going on. Then we have the administration of the censorship under the War Precautions Act, and paid for out of loan moneys. I am informed by one of the newspapers that instructions were issued under the no questions asked in the Federal Parliament in regard of the Naval and Military Forcesi n connection with this industrial dispute may be referred to in the newspapers of this country. The public are nob allowed to know how the Naval and Military services are being usedi n connection with industrial disputes. Then, under the same War Precautions Act, how is the Postal Department being administered? hy the strikers' defence committee in Sydney, that practically the whole of the correspondence which they post from time to time, is being opened in the Post Office, and that Government action is being taken to forestall all their instructions. Telegrams have been similarly interfered with. A Labour delegate from Western Australia who arrived in Melbourne within the past few days, and has since proceeded to Sydney, states that out of I ask tlie 100 telegrams despatched to him at Perth by Mr Morris, the general secretary of the Wharf Labourers Union, in Melbourne, only one was delivered. That one referred to the order of Mr Justice Higgins that the men should . resume work. The other ninety-nine telegrams were absolutely suppressed. Although the Government accepted money for rendering this service, the service was not rendered. Last week Senator O'Keefe discovered that similar methods were being adopted in Tasmania. Wires intimating that the wharf labourers at Launceston, Burnie, and Devonport had ceased work were lodged with the Postal Department, and the officials of the union were expecting replies from Melbourne. But all their messages were confiscated. It is most objectionable that loan moneys should be applied to the utilization of war legislation for party purposes in connection w i th industrial disputes. to have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.] MrJ . H . CATTS In Committee it is my intention to move the insertion of a new clause, which, if carried, w ill make it impossible for these moneys to be expended on the utilization of OUT Naval and Military services in connection w i th War Precautions Act that industrial disputes. There are other purposes, however, to the use to which I think the large amount which w ill thus be saved may be most usefully applied. I have in my mind the case of a soldier named Jamieson, No. 1729, 2nd Reinforcements, 20th Battalion. He served through the Gallipoli campaign as a member of what was known as the "" Suicide Club ""-that is to say, he was one of the bomb throwers. A f t e r the evacuation of the It is stated Peninsula the men returned to Egypt, and whilst a number of them were on leave there they had a little jollification.

On.the 10th August-that was after I had waited for more than three months without getting any acknowledgmentI wrote again, and then obtained a reply. If the Minister representing the Minister for Defence is taking any note of the Jamieson case, which has been acknowledged by the State War Council and every one who has heard the particulars to be a great injustice, I may mention, to show that the Recruiting Committee is finding that the case is doing considerable damage to the cause of recruiting in that district, that there is a letter from the organizing secretary to Mrs. Jamieson, asking her to make a statement to them. : been reported under the Defence Act? Mr J. H . CATTS -This man Jamieson was put in gaol for ten months for the use of insubordinate language. the Chair to the state: of the House. [Quorum formed.] Mr J. H . CATTS -If the Government are able, with their large numbers, to maintain a quorum for transacting business,' I will explain this case to the Acting Minister for Defence. For the use of insubordinate language, after the evacuation of Gallipoli, Jamieson was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. After the expiration of ten months he was allowed out of gaol on condition that he went back to the Front. From the pay due to his wife and five children the Government are making a deduction at the rate of 5s. for each day of his detention in gaol. Here is a photograph of his young family. It is impossible for the family to exist on the amount now being supplied by the Government without getting assistance from relatives. It is p. case which ought to be immediately put right. It has now been for three or four months in the course of negotiation with the Department, and it is about time that a. decision was reached. If the law is "" a hass "" in this case, the Government ought to put an ^amount, on the Estimates, and have the matter cleaned up. It is not another case, I wrote"" to the authorities in beyond the power of the Government to Sydney on the 16tb June. Having refind some means of rectifying a case of ceived no reply, 1 wrote again on the [68] gross injustice, even though it has been done in accordance with -the law. Another case is that of Mrs. Burnie, of 217 Wilson-street, Newtown. There are three sons at the war. The mother has been paying off the cost of a house, which she bought as a home for the family. It is not in the name of the sons, but in the mime of the mother, who is a widow. Two sons have been wounded and the mother asked that the third son t should be allowed to return home, as she was in financial difficulties, and was in danger of losing the home. The request was refused, and she now finds that she is being pushed by those, from whom she borrowed money in connection with the purchase of the house. It has been stated by the Prime Minister time after time that if cases of this kind are brought under notice, steps will be taken to see that the women .are not unduly harassed during the absence of their soldier sons and relatives at the Front. I complain that this matter was brought under the notice of the Prime Minister's Depart1 call the attention of ment, and that I received no acknowledgment of my letter. It seems to be the custom of the Prime Minister's Department to ignore correspondence from honourable members. Other correspondence of mine has been before the Department for months, and, though I have written several times, I can get no reply. The Prime Minister is loud in his assurances as to what the Government will do to protect the women during the absence of their bread-winners, and I think this case requires particular attention. It was pointed out to the Department that this woman was threatened that, if she could not meet an account of £30 for interest at the end pf this month, the person to whom the money was owing would take action to deprive her of her interest in the property. It is necessary that this matter shall not be delayed in the way which is customary in the Prime Minister's Department, but that action shall be taken immediately to afford relief. tion to the state of the House.

I refer to the case of non-commissioned officers, in regard-to whom I received certain replies to some questions which I asked the HonoraryM in ister yesterday. I asked1. Whether it is correct that the Staff Sergeants-Major on the Instructional Staff in Australia were paid extra duty pay of ls. 6d. COOK -The honourable per day up to 30th June, 1917? 2. Is it a fact that when that extra duty pay was abolished these officers were promised a war bonus of 9d. per day? They have no relation 3.

CATTS -On the point of bers of the Instructional Staff employed in Australian Imperial Force Camps. 2'. Yes. i 3. The war allowance is being paid. The comment I wish to make with regard to this matter is that this extra duty pay, for some reason or other not specified, has been withdrawn. In July last a circular was issued inviting officers of the Instructional Staff to accept the war bonus of 9d. per day. It is peculiar that this circular was issued alike to men on the permanent staff and men on the acting staff, and although the 9d. a day is now being paid to the former, it is not being pjaid to the latter, and for some considerable time these men have felt that they have been unfairly treated, especially as I in the early stages of the war almost to a man they volunteered for active service. dealing with home service men.1 I understand",70,Maloney We Should Have A Branch Office At Sydney I Find That

I preI desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Minister for Defence a matter which affects his Department. will hand me the statement, I w ill attend to it . I think it would be simply read it , and leave it at that. The statement is as follows: I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence what appears to be an injustice that is being done to the non-commissioned staff officers in our Military Forces. Up to a short time ago, these officers were allowed what was termed extra duty pay, to the amount of ls. 6d. per day; but, during the month of July, an order was issued cancelling this extra payment. In its stead, a circular was issued, to be signed by those concerned, substituting what was called a war bonus of 9d. per day, which, up to the present time, has not been paid. This reduction in pay' has caused great dissatisfaction amongst those concerned, but the men have no means of objecting in a body, inasmuch as that anything done in a concerted manner is treated by tbe MilitaryI Forces as a mutiny; but I can assure the Minister that there is absolute unanimity, in their resentment. These officers are, perhaps, more valuable to the Commonwealth than any other arm of the service, as, in one way or other, the whole of the Forces are a reflex of their In 1910 Bkill, ability, and their work as instructors. That their work has been a credit to them is borne out in the splendid record that our men have established at thc Front, and aDy extra payment that they may have received has been more than justified. In a majority of cases, A t that time there was a they are prevented from going away on active service, as it is imperative that their services should be retained; and, even in cases where they are allowed to enlist, they are compelled to do BO at a lower grade than officers' whom they have trained for their commissions. Jf any body of men iB entitled to generous treatment by the nation, it is those who have, as I have pointed out, been responsible for the splendid record our men have created. I hope that the Minister will give this matter his sympathetic consideration, with a view to restoring to those officers the extra duty pay, or wonld suggest that they be granted warrant rank, witn extra pay commensurate with their value to our Defence Forces. In the case of commissioned officers, the rate of pay is both liberal and generous, and it is only bare justice that these officers at least should not have their pay reduced Question resolved in the affirmative.
