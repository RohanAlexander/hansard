Casion Upon Which, In This House, I Have Referred To Anything Of A Personal Nature Affecting Either Myself Or Any Other Honor","gentleman was. able member. I have never, either inside .or outside this House, made any claims or pretensions on account of war service, or anything of the kind; nor have I reflected on the war service of any other honourable member. But I feel that I should say something in defence of my reputation on acoount of the observations that were made yesterday and the day before by the honourable member for BallaratI desire merely to say that I volunteered for active service in the Australian Imperial Force. A few days before I had arranged to go into camp, however, I was ordered into the Navy to undertake special work for which the authorities considered that I possessed my reputation. In view of the source of special qualifications. The Naval Board considered that I could do that work only if I held commissioned rank. Accordingly, I was appointed a LieutentautCommander, and was assigned to the Intelligence Branch. After some months had elapsed I applied for leave to resign my commission BO that I might go overseas with the AJ.P. That leave was refused, and I was directed to remain in the position that I then held. I discharged, both in Australia and overseas, the duties that I was ordered to discharge. Those are the facts of the matter, and that is all I desire to say concerning what I did during the time of the war. a personal explanation, on the ground that I have been subjected to misrepresentation in certain remarks of the honourable memnot have troubled the House with this matter, but that I thought it desirable that I should diselose the spirit of reckless irresponsibility that appears to have prompted the honourable member in the attack that he made on me, and the remarkable inaccuracies of which he was guilty. The honourable member made three specifio statements concerning me. He said that I enlisted in 1917, that I waa in the infantry, and that I left the infantry to go to Paris. I enlisted, not in 1917, but in 1916. I was never in the infantry; my training was confined to the artillery. I was never in Paris between 1915 and 1919. pardon. I met him there in 1919. I should have taken more notice of these charges had they oome from what I regarded as a respectable source. Makin) -Order! The honourable gentleman is not in order in reflecting upon another honourable member by inferring that he is "" not respectable "". I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw that remark. have no wish to resort to retaliation is this matter; but I am under some provocation because of the savage personal assault that has been made upon me and these charges, I have no wish to enlarge upon my slight and safe service with the A.I.P., except'to Say that I am in the",11,Setup

Should not the Minister, before he proceeds, state in what way he has heen misrepresented ? the Chair to determine whether a statement that is about to be made is a personal explanation in the parliamentary sense until it has heard something of it ; but to make sure that a breach of the Standing Orders should not occur, I asked the Minister whether he had been personally misrepresented, and he assured me that he had been. those circumstances, he must be allowed to proceed without interruption, unless it should appear that what he is saying is not a personal explanation. me, by nods, winks, blinks, or other dumb motions, to convey my meaning, I should be most happy to oblige the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) by doing so, but I aim not capable of making a statement without employing some form of vocal expression. As yon are aware, Mr Speaker, no honourable member is more moderate, more kindly, more discreet than I . I always refer in the most gentle terms to my opponents. But there are times when even the worm will turn. For many years I have been described, by the honourable gentleman opposite, as a coward, a cur, a mongrel, a coldfooter, a pro-German, an enemy of the British Empire, a. disloyalist, and a man who did not take part in the Great War. Those attacks have never come from the real fighters. Honourable members interjecting opposite are anxious that a personal explanation shall not be made by other than those who sit on their side. I will get at them some other time if they prevent me from doing so now. ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the Minister is in order in menacing and threatening honourable members of this House? not be in order if he threatened or menaced any honourable member of this House. The Chair will see that every honourable member is protected from threats or menaces. My desire is to allow every honourable member to take full advantage of the privileges that members enjoy unI rise to der the Standing Orders. If the Minister exceeds his privilege in the present instance, I shall immediately call him to order. would think of doing in this chamber is to threaten.

It is for the Chair to determine what is correct conduct and behaviour on the part of honourable members; but the nature of the business brought before the House is not for the Speaker to determine. oured to treat the Chair with respect, and if you, Mr Speaker, consider that my question contained any reflection upon yourself, I withdraw it unreservedly. It was certainly not my intention to give you offence. honourable member's assurance. the allegation that I had employed a nonsoldier in my business when a soldier had applied for the position. I wish to add to the explanation I then gave by saying that the ex-soldier whose application was rejected was at the time in a permanent position in semi-government employment, and I advised him not to take the risk of throwing up that position. While I was speaking yesterday, the Minister for Defence interjected that if I persisted in my lino of conduct he would make my military record known to the House. Por his information I may say that my record is contained in ChaptersI . and II . of the Official History of the Plying Corps. vilege, I should like you, Mr Speaker, to rule whether, when a remark is made, which, in the opinion of the presiding officer occupying the chair at the time, should be withdrawn, if the member concerned is unconscious of having offended, he is entitled to ask what remark he is required to withdraw ? withdraw a remark could not have any good effect if the member who was called on to withdraw did not know what he was withdrawing. a ruling from you, Mr Speaker, upon a point which I think comes within Ihe scope of members' privileges. A short while ago, when speaking on the second reading of the Wine Export Bounty Bill, I proposed to read a short extract from a letter I had received. I did not intend ro give the name of the writer, though as a guarantee of good faith I was prepared to tell it privately to an honourable member opposite who thought that it should be mentioned. The honourable member for capacity of Deputy Speaker, ruled that it was notcompetent for me to read a portion of a letter unless I was prepared to give the name of the writer of it. Accepting that ruling, I did not read the paragraph iu question. Yesterday, however, the honourable member for Ballarat, in hi? capacity as a private member, read a letter, or portion of a letter, in this House, and intimated that, in his opinion, the House would not desire that he should give the name of the person who wrote the letter. It appears to me that the honourable member for Ballarat did something in his capacity as a private member' which, as Deputy Speaker of this House, he prevented me from doing. I ask you, Mr Speaker, for your ruling as to whether it is competent for an honourable member to quote from a letter withoul giving the signature. order. I submit that this question should not be put to you, Mr Speaker, because it is intended merely as an attack upon a member who was temporarily occupying the chair as Deputy Speaker in your OF RULINGSabsence. A Deputy Speaker might similarly be asked to rule in some decision of yours. That proceeding, I consider, is most irregular. The point now raised by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) should have been taken at the time the incident occurred. honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) is that I have been asked to give ,a ruling.

36,Mr Speaker,"My reply to theapprized of the incident to which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr cannot undertake to answer hypothetical Paterson) has referred, anything that T may say on the subject is, of course, not to be regarded as a reflection upon any ruling of the Deputy Speaker. Under the Standing Orders a Minister may not quote from a document unless he anuounces the source or origin of it ; but it is competent for a private member to read from a letter or another document without naming the author of it. I ask whether it is the practice for Mr equally to the rulings of Mr Deputy Speaker to give rulings except' upon points which actually arise during a debate, and at the time they arise. If that practice is not followed, we may occupy a great deal of time in the academic discussion of points of order. mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland during the debate. rulings should be sought at the time when the incidents to which they relate occur. If an honourable member desires a direction in order to assist him to comply with the Standing Orders, the Chair should give it. whether it would he proper for you or for the Deputy Speaker to give a ruling inconsistent with one previously given without honourable members having an opportunity to discuss it? take care of itself. The occupant of the chair must decide questions of order as they arise, according to the Standing Orders and the precedents available for his guidance. explanation, I desire to say that I asked for your ruling, Mr Speaker, in order to guide us in the future and not to attack any honourable member. Laterfurther reference to the questions asked me this morning by several honourable members with regard to the practice of the House. As I said then, I am always pleased to assist members wherever possible in the matter of procedure, hut I prefer to adhere to the [64] practice of personal consultation. I questions based on a ruling of the Deputy Speaker, or a temporary chairman who may be relieving me"" in the chair; but Standing Order 287 states that if any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the Speaker it "" must be taken at once, and in writing, and motion made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and the debate thereou adjourned forthwith until the next sitting day"".

48,Mr Cubtin,"I desire to ask themade into the complaint ofi'^he person who communicated with the honourable member for Fremantle. Frequently persons who desire to exploit the public, blame the tariff when the tariff is not to blame at' all. When the matter has been inquired into, the Government will consider what action shall be taken to prevent exploitation. for Defence drawn the attention of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs to a complaint made by the Southern Cross Roads Board in connection with the purchase of a cylinder block for a Fordson tractor? The original cost of this part was £24 10s., but owing to the increased duty the price is now £35 12s. The Acting Minister, in his weekly notice, allowed this duty to be waived. Defence has brought many matters affecting Western Australia, under my notice, and I cannot recall them all. If the honourable member will place his question upon the notice-paper, the information he seeks jwill be obtained. Minister stated that it was proposed to hold an inquiry into certain allegations of bribery affecting members of the Public Accounts Committee. Does the Prime Minister consider that it would be fair to the honourable member for Reid( Mr tenced to death at Port Darwin yesterday. Coleman) to open such an inquiry in his absence? bers will understand from the document I read yesterday, this matter was fully discussed by the Public Accounts Committee itself. The implications are directed against not one member only of that committee, hut against all the members with the exception of one. The memhers of the committee agreed that it was necessary to take steps to vindicate their honour, but it was considered that Mr the maintenance of vice-regal residences Coleman could leave Australia, and that his interests would be safeguarded in common with thoseof other members. I . have no intention of allowing''one hour's! delay longer than is necessary in clearing up this charge. The Government proposes to appoint a royal commission, and the Attorney-General has been asked to secure, if possible, the services of a judge to conduct the inquiry. Home Affairs aware that four aboriginals have been sentenced to death in Northern Australia? Is he aware that the offence for which they were sentenced to death was of a purely tribal character? Has the Minister ever witnessed a trial of any of these unfortunate, ignorant, savage or semi-savage people, and the abject lack of knowledge they display regarding the proceedings? Is it not a fundamental principle of our judicial system that when a person is incapable^ of understanding the nature of .the proceedings he shall not be put on trial? Is the Minister aware that the offence for which these four natives stand condemned to death is in reality regarded as a virtue under their own tribal laws? Will he supplement the present drastic white man's code of law with a code based on the sympathetic understanding of ignorant tribesmen, and with justice based on knowledge and humane understanding? Will he in this case advise the Executive to temper justice with mercy, and reprieve these unfortunate persons whose conduct is sanctioned by tribal laws of centuries standing? four aboriginals were convicted and senI have communicated with the trial judge, and on receipt of information from him, the Government will take what further steps are necessary to temper justice with mercy as the honourable member has requested.

57,Mr Scullin,"The subject of the new Estimates. The matter raised by the honourable member for South Sydney is one of those which have been brought under the searchlight. It is not proposed to make any change, however, in the existing arrangement while the present representative of the Crown occupies his position. Whatever changes are made, and I think some will have to be made in view of the country's financial position, will be postponed until a new Governor General has been appointed. year the Public Accounts Committee recommended that an appeal board should be set up to deal with applications by rural lessees in the Federal Capital Territary regarding rent assessments. In view of the fact that many of the lessees are finding it extremely difficult to carry on under present conditions, will the Minister for Home Affairs state when it is proposed to give effect to the committee's recommendation ? been proceeding for some time with the New South Wales Government with a view to obtaining the services of the chairman of one of the New South Wales Land Boards to serve on an appeal board for Federal Territory lessees. Success has crowned those negotiations, and I hope that in the near future the board will be constituted and appeals heard. Minister, in reply to a question relating to the possible ratification by the Commonwealth Government of the proposed treaty with Egypt, said, as I understood, that he had no information from the British Government regarding the progress of negotiations. I desire to ask him whether that is a fact. If he has not been kept posted, will he make representations to the British Government, and insist that he be kept daily and, if necessary, hourly, informed regarding a matter of such vital importance to this country? day that the Government had received no information from the British Government regarding the progress of negotiations. We have been kept fully informed. I stated^in reply to a question asked a few days ago by the Leader of the Opposition that we had been kept posted on the progress of events, and that we would convey to the British Government our views regarding what was necessary to safeguard Australia's interests. I am pleased to be able to inform honourable members that certain changes of a satisfactory nature both to the British Government and to Australia have been made in the agreement. My statement to the Leader of the Opposition was that I had not received information to the effect that the negotiations which are proceeding have been finalized, and that until such information was received no treaty would be agreed to. I also said that before any treaty was agreed to by this Government, or any agreement ratified, honourable members would be given an opportunity of discussing the matter.

All the provisions of the Cotton Bounty Act 1926, shall remain in force in respect'of the payment of*'bounty unfrom other countries, and they in turn are der the last preceding sub-section, and shall, so far as applicable, extend to, efi-jn and be deemed to authorize, the payment of bounty upon cotton yarn manufactured in Australia the materials used in the manufacture of which consist, to the extent of at least 90 per centum, of Australian-grown cotton, and, in the remainder, of cotton imported by the manufacturer prior to the first day of April, One thousand nine hundred and thirty, This amendment is submitted as the result of representations made by the cotton-spinners, who desire to maintain the rights enjoyed by them under the 1926 act, with respect to undelivered seed cotton or cotton yarn at the date of the passing of the new act. The old act would have operated up to the 15th August, 1931. It prescribes that claims must be submitted monthly, and unless the cotton is not only produced and graded in Australia, hut also delivered at an appointed place, and a claim actually submitted immediately before the expiry of the old act, the producers cannot receive bounty The Parliament, I feel sure, does not desire to deprive the spinners of any rights enjoyed by them under previous legislation. Sub-clause 3 of the new clause has been included in order to continue the rights earned under the old act, but reduces the maximum percentage of foreign cotton yarn from 49 per cent, to 10 per cent. This is to enable foreign cotton bought before manu(Capricornia-Acting facturers had any knowledge of the Government reducing the rate of bounty under the new hill to be made up within a reasonable period without the manufacturers being penalized.

92,Mr Forde,"In November last ayarn wherever it can be obtained. Of course, there are quite a number of types of this yarn that are not obtainable in Australia, and these still come in free and at 10 per cent., but the yarns that can be spun here are protected against the imported yarns, and the knitters who ask for 100 per cent, protection for all the goods they manufacture cannot object to buying Australian-grown and spun cotton yarn. It is true that they did have some difficulty for a time during the tranwas made that the price of yarn to the sition period. I find that there is a tendknitter would not be increased. It was ency on the part of certain knitters still to import their yarns from other countries. In order to get over that trouble I couvened a conference in Sydney early in January, representative of the knitters of Australia, and of the spinning mills. We talked the matter over, and certain concessions were granted to the knitters It was arranged that yarn on order before the 22nd November should be allowed to come in, provided it was entered in Australia hy the 21st January. Other slight concessions were also granted, and they met with the approval of both the cotton spinners and the knitters. There is naturally a transition period during which somebody must experience a little difficulty when changing over from imported yarn to the Australian article, hut that difficulty has been largely overcome, and I appeal to the knitters to give first preference to the Australian-spun yarn. A government standing for a. comprehensive policy of protection for the building up of both primary and secondary industries, and one that has placed on the tariff schedule duties that give the knitters effective protection, expects that the knitters will give first preference to Australian-spun yarn. I can assure the honourable member for Corangamite that this difficulty, which seemed to be acute at the time, has, as the result of the conference to which I have referred, largely disappeared. I am glad to hear the Minister's explanation, but in this case he seems to have been deceived by the spinners. I attended a conference held between the spinners and the knitters at which the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Fenton) was present. This took place two days before he left for London. months later than the conference to which I have referred. has been disastrous to a group of knitters in Maryborough,' which is part of my electorate. It may result in the dismissal of a considerable number of factory employees. The honourable member of Ballarat( Mr McGrath) was present at the conference, which I attended, and a definite promise also put on record by the Minister at the time that the duty would not apply until the local spinners were able to supply sufficient yarn to enable the knitters to avoid the use of imported yarn. ners have large quantities of yarn on hand which they are not able to sell, because of the large importations that were made prior to the duty becoming operative. Certain people want to import their raw material and also have 100 per cent, protection. Maryborough knitters wanted no duty at all. On the 9th AprilI asked the Acting Ministeri f the price of yarn had been raised to the knitters, and he replied in these wordsThe slightly increased cost of yarn cannot prejudice the spinning mills as the latter make the yarn, nor can it be seen that it could possibly have the effect of closing a weaving or knitting mill. Experience has shown that knitters who ask for effective protection for what they produce are sometimes not prepared to patronize the local spinner, but try to buy their requirements of yarn in cheap-labour countries. Will the Acting Minister be surprised to know that the Maryborough knitting mills imported its machinery and started its factory when no duty at all was operating? It would be very glad to have no duty if it could obtain the manufactured article of the spinners duty free. The manufactured article of one industry is the raw material of another, and in this case the manufactured yarn is the raw material of the knitters. The Maryborough factory, which once employed from 450 to 500 men and women, has dismissed a number of them because of .the .operation of the. tariff. This was done not'Only because the factory wishet",19,Cotton Industries Bounty

97,Mr Crouch,"I will show that theto obtain Australian yarn, but simply because the spinners w ill not supply it . The Minister stated a few moments ago that there were large supplies of this yarn available. I have received the f o l lowing communication from the Maryborough knittin g mills:In the past we have imported quantities of union yarns, i.e. mixtures of cotton and wool and cotton yarn, from England, but now that the tariff has been placed on this class of yarns, since the introduction of this tariff, which we are unable to import same. There are only two spinners of union yarns in Australia, and one of them, Geo. A. Bond and Co. (In Liquidation) state that they are not at present making up union yarn. The Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, the only other spinner, will make u[> union yams, but stipulate that a minimum quantity of at least 2.000 lbs. must be ordered. That statement is confirmed by the following letter from the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills to the Maryborough K n it t i ng M ill Referring to your further letter of the 14th March, we note that the count you require is l-9s. worsted count. In reply thereto, we have to state that we can supply you with the yarn referred to at 34d. per lb. (On cones-f.o.r . Melbourne). In view of the unusually coarse, count and hence the extra internal mill work involved in the production, we would require a minimum order of 2,000 lbs. weight; delivery against which would commence four weeks from our confirmation of such order. The Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, which has a monopoly of the production of this yarn, refuses to supply unless the knitting mills w ill take 2,000 lb.

Thus, the Austral Mills can put out of business competing knittin g mills by refusing them supplies of yarn.

If this continues, despite the promise given to me and the honorby -the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, a great in j u r y w ill be done to Australian factories and workers. As another illustration of the methods being adopted by the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills to destroy their knittin g competitors, I quote the following increases of yarn prices over the price guaranteed to the Tariff Board which have been made since the tariff was introduced-l-10s . to l-12s., I d . per l b . ; l-14s. to l-16s., l ^ d . per lb.; l-18s. to l-20s., 2£d. per lb.; l-24s., 4d. per l b . ; l-28s., 5d. per l b . ; l-30s., 3£d. per l b . ; l-36s., 4d. per lb.

I ask the Minister to insert, in lieu of the word "" a reasonable p r i c e "" the words "" the prices current on. the 30th November, 1929"". On the 3rd A p r i l I asked the Acting-Ministerf or Trade and Customs whether evidence had been produced to him that the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills were taking undue advantage of the tariff to charge higher prices to the spinners.

101,Able Member F O R Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath),"is a big tax on a country enterprise. asked the Acting-MinisterIsi t a fact that when the Customs Duty on cotton yarns was recently raised, a promise was made by the Australian firms manufacturing yarns that they would not raise their prices to the spinnners? To that the Minister repliedNo. the yarn manufacturers (i.e. spinners) was the event of the customs duties and increased bounty recommended by the Tariff Board on the 0th March, 1929, being granted, and subject to the then existing costs of production not being increased by circumstances or conditions beyond the control of the manufacturers, they would uot increase their selling pi-ices. However, the increased bounty recommended by the Tariff Board, viz., i d . per count velop cotton fields in Queensland, and per lb. (instead of the present bounty of Jd. per count per l b . ) , was not granted, and slightly increased prices would, therefore, be permissible in view of the terms of the undertaking. No such qualification or limitation was suggested to the honorahle member for Ballarat and me when we interviewed the Minister for Trade and Customs. promised that the prices for the. knitting mills would not be increased; nevertheless, increases have taken place which are sufficient not only to create unemployment, but to wipe out a factory that has heen providing work for 450 people. ber say that workers in the Maryborough knitting mill have been thrown out of employment as a result of an increase of cotton yarn by Id. per lb. ? ment has been caused by the increase in the prices of yarn and by the refusal of the spinning firm to supply in parcels of 500 lb. honourable member, I am certain that he has been misinformed. I shall have his statement investigated. ter's offer. If the investigation discloses that unemployment has resulted from (1) the requirement to order in parcels of 2,000 lb. instead of 500 lb., and (2) the increase in the price of yarn by from Id. to 5d. per lb., will he promise to take measures to rectify the position? I bounty will prove futile, because the industry cannot be established in AusI tralia without continuous spoon-feeding from time to time. The National City Bank of New York, in its bulletin for February last, states that cotton prices are lower than have prevailed in recent years, and iu many instances are below' production cost. I have seen the cotton fields in Egypt, and I am convinced that Tlie undertaking given by unless we reduce our wages to ridiculous rates, the cotton industry must depend always on some form or forms of artificial stimulus. It could not conform to Australia labour conditions without spoon-feeding to an extent that would prove an undue tax on the Commonwealth. If , by artificial means, we deat the same time destroy factories in other part's of Australia, what will be the net gain? The price of cotton goods has been so increased that people find it more profitable to buy artificial silk goods, and the Minister will not succeed in fostering the cotton industry unless He he imposes almost prohibitive duties on silk and artificial silk. A woman will always buy artificial silk, or silk stockings, in preference to cotton, at the same price. The increased charges which the Minister is causing will. completely destroy the market for cotton stockings. Not only will this create unemployment at the Maryborough mill and other knitting factories, but eventually these enterprises will be compelled to discontinue, because cotton cannot compete with silk and artificial silk at the same price. I wrote to the Acting Minister on the subject a long time ago, and he promised to give my request for a duty on silk importations favorable consideration. Since then I have heard nothing further. I also asked the Acting Minister to meet a deputation from the manager of the mill and to discuss with him the duty on artificial silk.

I know something of the secondary industries of Australia. visited many woollen mills and factories, and I know that firms such as David Jones, of Sydney, have had to dispense with a considerable number of hands because of the financial depression throughout Australia. That firm recently put off 150 hands. The drop in the prices of wool and wheat has been responsible for taking £31,000,000 out of circulation in Australia. In addition, various governments of Australia have been compelled to cut down loan expenditure from £40,000,000 to £20,000,000, so that Australia is at present facing a loss of £50,000,000 in circulation. position must drastically affect the purchasing power of the people. I visited the woollen mills of Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat, and the managers informed me that the retailers would not buy the quantity of goods that they purchased previously. As a result the woollen mills have had to put off many hands. The Maryborough Knitting Mills have suffered severely in competition with other and more recently established modern equipment. The duties on knitted piece-goods were increased from 30 per cent. United Kingdom, or 2s. 6d. per lb., and 50 per cent, foreign, or 4s. per lb., to the ad valorem rates plus the fixed Piece-goods, piece-goods knitted, blouses, apparel, socks, stockings, towels, wadding and cotton wool, cotton yarn, raw cotton including linters, and edible oils. So that protection was given not only to the knitters, but also to the whole of the industry. The Government stands for giving adequate protection to the knitter, but it would not he fair to allow him to import his raw material and to buy in the cheapest market, while at the same time the cotton-grower and spinner of Australia would be selling their The Tariff Board recommended products at less than payable prices. That would be absolutely unreasonable. The right of the spinner to protection is as great as that of the knitter. The Knitters Association of Australia agrees that the increased duty is reasonable, and has I have passed a resolution approving of it. to do so. able member's opinion. There are doubtless individuals who would have 100 per cent, protection for what they produce, and yet purchase in the cheapest markets the commodities that they require.

That, however, is not the That view held by the Knitters Association, which believes in supporting the Australian product. I admire the honorable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) for having interested himself on behalf of the Maryborough knitting mills.

At the present time, Minister now proposes that a further profor every person employed in a spinning mill 50 are employed in knitting mills, and that will always be the proportion. Yet account is not taken of the fact that these new duties are having the effect of putting knitters out of employment.

There is a knitting mill of considerable size in Footscray, an industrial suburb of Melbourne. out to install plant for the manufacture of boys' jerseys. months, very little good resulted. Experiments were then carried out with a mixture of imported yarns, with the result that the output since last July has totalled 50,000 of these garments, and they have been sold at a price which appears to me to he very low. They cannot obtain this particular type of mixture in Australia. One of the two spinners cannot supply it, and the other will not be able to do so before next July, and the mill is still obliged to import this yarn. The new rate of duty has had the effect of adding from 4s. to 6s. a dozen to the cost of the jerseys it are a very good article, and are worn mostly by the sons of workers. I suggest to the honourable member for ""Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), that before agreeing to such a duty he should make sure that it will do good rather than industrial and economic harm. I have no hesitation in repeating what I said on the second reading, that this new duty was not needed, and that in any case 10 per cent, would have been ample to enable the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills Limited and Bonds Limited to trade successfully.

Compare this with the protection of 7£ per cent, which was sufficient to enable Canada to build up a thriving cotton-spinning industry. Both the Acting Minister and the Prime Minister have assured us that prices will not be increased as the result of the new duties. It is a fact, however, Two years ago it set that one firm which turns out 50,000 boy's jerseys a year has increased the In the first twelve price from 4s. to 6s. a dozen. By the time the retailer has finished with them, the price tp the consumer will be increased by is. a garment. These jerseys are the kind worn by every working boy in the colder parts of Australia. The Acting Minister said that when the spinning industry gets on to its feet, and captures the market, there will be no need for prices to remain high. I am sorry that I cannot accept his assertion. In nearly all cases the price of goods is increased by the amount of duty imposed, and that increase is a permanent one. One of the biggest knitters in Australia told me that the average increase in the manufactures. These garments cost of all garments he was making would be ls. Id. a garment, as the result of the new tariff. Imagine the effect of that upon industry in this country. It must eventually lead to an increase in the basic wage, and every industry in the country will be affected. Existing protection will then become ineffective, and will have to be increased. The Government has promised that it will take steps to prevent any undue increase in prices as the result of the tariff. I do not suppose that the manufacturers as a class are-, more grasping than any other section of the community, but they cannot control the cost of labour, nor of material, nor of transport. In other words, the Government has no power to control prices if , by its legislation, it brings about a monopoly. I again appeal to the Acting Minister to be moderate in this matter, and not try to force the pace. For every £1 Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.23].",25,Cotton Industries Bounty

I am refuting the statements of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that large profits were made by Bond& Company, and I have shown that for the last period under review the company made a loss of over £4,000. possibly be said that that loss was due to bad management, inflation of capital, and undue overhead costs. These factors were in operation during the whole period, and the accountant reported that one important reason for the decline in profits during the latter period under review was the large overhead cost due to smaller factory output, this being caused by insufficient production, and increased competition by cheaper yarns imported from other countries. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted certain passages from the accountant's report, but he did not quote the part which said that the output from the company's mills had been reduced because of unfair competition by cheap yarns imported from other countries. It now transpires that the profits made during the earlier period under, review were not even so large as has been stated. The liquidators of Bond and Company have proved to the Income Taxation Commissioner that the reputed profits were fictitious, because the weaving and hosiery section of Bond's business-established under a separately registered company-ha d been paying the cotton mill company much more than the fair market value of the yarn delivered.

144,Mr Gullett,"I ask for an unconmeat. The honourable member did not stick to the facts, and now that I am stating them he is uncomfortable. It is advisable that I should make the position quite clear. The whole case made against the Government by the honourable member in this connection has fallen to the ground. The position of Bond and Company in relation to spinning costs and prices is consistent with the position of the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills as disclosed by the latter company to the Tariff Board. The honourable gentleman's speech was typical of the wailing utterances of ardent free traders. I shall investigate the statements made by the honorahle member for Corangamite, for the Government has no intention of supporting unjustifiable increases in prices. If certain companies are not abiding by the undertaking they gave to the Tariff Board, steps will be taken to oblige them to do so. This industry is being treated fairly and equitably. Knitting mills which are receiving substantial protection must have some regard for the welfare of the spinning mills. Surely they will not expect to buy their yarn in the cheapest markets and at the same time request increased protection. Hot long ago these mills were given the alternative of an increased fixed duty or an ad valorem rate. The duty on knitted blouses, for instance, was increased from Is. Id. to 2s. 6d., and similar increases were made in other lines. Seeing that the knitting companies enjoy such substantial protection they should be prepared to use yarn made in Australia. During the luncheon adjournment I telephoned the Maryborough knitting mills to ascertain whether they had dismissed some of their employees, and was informed that they had done so, and that the action was partly due to the prevalent depression. The Maryborough knitting mills were established years ago by Mr Harvard Shirts Cuttle and Mr Schemp. Mr Cuttle died and I Schemp, after carrying on the concern for a while, withdrew from it and started a spinning mills in Ballarat, into which he and others have put £50,000. I understand that he left the Maryborough mills because he was not satisfied with the manner in which the business was being conducted. He is confident that he will make a success of his Ballarat undertaking. nected with the Maryborough mills. mills has not altered since November. The Acting Minister should go back to that date. mills were prosperous under the management of Mr Cuttle and Mr Schemp, and they continued to be prosperous until Mr Schemp withdrew. Since then they have not been so prosperous. Other concerns have won their way into the market. I intend to visit the Maryborough mills with the object of investigating the whole position, and I shall give sympathetic consideration to any representations made to me for I am anxious to help the industry. afraid that this will prove to be an expensive ""yarn,"" and that the working people will have to pay for it. I was amused to hear the Acting Minister say that he intended to make an investigation with the object of remedying the existing troubles. How can he possibly do that? I suppose that these proposals of the Government will benefit only 7-J per cent, or 10 per cent, of the people, while 90 per cent, of them will have to foot the bill. This absurd policy of prohibitive protection bears very heavily upon the working classes.

But this Government has done more than any of its predecessors to advance prices, for it has placed an embargo upon the importation of certain goods. This policy must undoubtedly lead to the creation of monopolies. Surely we cannot regard without alarm the fact that S.S.S. galatea has gone up from 9d. or lOd. pre-war to 22d. to-day.

Finlay's 80-in. sheeting has increased in price from ls. 6^d. to 3s. 2d. a yard. I ask the Minister to tell us how many mills will make cotton yarn in Australia if these proposals are agreed to. I well remember ' when Mr Cuttle established the Maryborough mills. He endeavoured to counteract the tendency towards the centralization of our factories, and established a most up-to-date concern in a country district. But the same kind of thing happened that will always happen when an effort is made to support a small industry at the expense of the general community. Prices increased and economic difficulties followed. I do not know where this policy will take us, hut I am certain that it will bring the working community to desperate straits, and because of that it is most reprehensible. I do not intend to say a single word in support of manufacturers who do their utmost to get the highest possible duty and then import their raw material from other countries. I entertain no illusions about the Australian manufacturers. They are no better and no worse than the manufacturers of other countries. If they are given an opportunity to exploit the community they will do so. I support this proposal because I believe that it will result in the development of a good industry in Australia. the figures disclosed by the honourable member for Corangamite seem to indicate that the statement of the case presented by the Government is only partially true. If there is practically a monopoly of yarn manufacturers in Australia, and if they are not only fixing the price, but also practically holding a pistol at the head of other manufacturers by dictating how muc3i cotton yarn they must buy, their action is reprehensible in the last degree, and no government should protect them in such an immoral course, of conduct.

It must be apparent to any thinking person that this bounty will place an additional burden on the people. tually disappear. Minister has anything to do with the matter. When the original act was introduced I pointed out how impossible it was under Australian conditions to develop this industry. We were told that it could be carried on hy families on areas of 5 acres, and that it would not hurt children if they were allowed to assist in the cultivation of cotton. Now we are asked to pay this bounty at a time of depression when on every envelope that passes through the post office is printed the words "" Grow more wheat."" The Acting Minister told us to-day that the present depression in responsible for the difficulty experienced by the people engaged in the cotton industry. That depression is due to the increased cost of producing wool and wheat and the fall in the prices of these commodities, and that increase has been brought about by the policy adopted by various governments in the past. The wheat-farmers' costs have doubled since 1914, and the action of the present Givernment will further increase the cost of wheat-growing. The five economists who volunteered to submit a report to us as to the effect of the tariff on our export industries estimated that the tariff had increased their operating costs by 9 per cent. I should say that, since the present Government has been in office, that burden has doubtless been raised to 11 per cent. We are now called upon to increase the cost of articles of clothing commonly worn by' workmen. Shirts made of 27-inch cotton gabardine, under 6 ounces to the square yard, have been coming in free of duty under the British preferential rate, and the foreign duty has been 15 per cent, ad valorem. in country districts. The present cost retail is 5s. l i d . in the cities, and 7s. 6d. these goods will cost 10s. 6d. in the cities, and 13s. 3d. in the country. That means an increase from 7s. 6d. to 13s. 3d. in the cost to the country workman, and to the man who is asked to grow more wheat, although the cost of production to-day is greater than the value of the wheat. It is time for Australia to take a stand against such folly, for it is foolish administration to cripple one's owu country. Australia cannot afford many white elephants, particularly at the present time. I recently asked the Minister in charge of the bill at what price Australian-grown sugar is sold to retailers, and he replied "" £37 6s. 8d. per ton "". I also inquired the price at which the surplus sugar was sold, and the answer I received was "" 1929 season, £13 3s. 4d. per ton "". Therefore the retailers in Australia were charged £24 3s. 4d. a ton more for their sugar than the price at which the surplus was sold outside this country. member supported the Bruce-Pago Government when it endorsed that policy. cost of living in Australia has been brought about by the enthusiasm of honourable members opposite for high duties.

Denim trousers, of 28-in. cloth, were priced wholesale under the previous tariff at 4s. 6d., and were sold in the city at 4s. l i d . , and in the country at 6s. 9d. Under the present duties those prices have been increased to 6s. l i d . , 7s. 6d., and 10s. 6d. respectively. That is only part of the extra burden that has been placed on the farmer, who is asked to grow more wheat. The last Government had come to the conclusion that the policy of protection had been carried too far, and more than.once I heard Mr Bruce say that he and the Tariff Board had discovered that in attempting to protect the raw material, the yarn, and the woven cloth we were so loading the costs that not one of the stages of the industry could be carried on successfully, and that we would have to realize that the whole was greater than the part. The attempt of the Government to grasp the whole of this industry is suggestive of the greedy boy who grasped so many nuts that he eould take none out of the jar. I say to the Acting Minister, ""Let go half the nuts, my hoy, and then try."" Later we shall be dealing with another bill to help a much more important primary industry. This bill proposes to take from the Commonwealth exchequer between £800,000 and £900,000 to assist the cotton industry; the other bill to assist the wheat-grower proposes that the Commonwealth shall bear only 50 per cent, of any liability incurred, and the States concerned shall bear the balance. Will the Acting Minister agree to apply the same principle to the bill now before the committee, so that the Commonwealth will provide 50 per cent, of the cotton bounty and Queensland the other half? That might take away from the Minister some of the glory that he expects to get from the passage of this measure; but if the fifty-fifty basis is sound in connection with wheat, it is sound in connection with cotton. The Commonwealth is paying a huge bounty for the production of our galvanized iron and wire netting, and the policy of protection generally is paid for by the whole of the people, regardless of which State benefits. Why depart from Mr Prowse. that principle in connection with wheat growing? It is a more important industry than cotton cultivation is ever likely to be. It is the bread-winner of the Commonwealth, the bulwark of the nation's financial stability, and the decision to make the States concerned pay portion of the assistance to it is a departure from an established principle. support the bill. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) did not mention the name of the firm which supplied him with the price-list from whicb he quoted. RecentlyI visited manufacturers in Victoria, and they assured me that they would not take advantage of the new duties to increase the price of cotton goods. Unusual circumstances surround the cotton-growing industry. Queensland has millions of acres of land admirably adapted for the production of this crop. The industry is struggling to compete against the cotton producers of other countries, and in order to help it to its feet the Government is offering a bounty, which will expire in 1936. The Commonwealth has paid bounties to many other industries. been failures. 1 bounty of £3 per ton for the production of sugar by white labour placed the sugar industry oh its feet; to-day it is one of the most important industries in Australia, employing many thousands of people, and paying out in wages millions of pounds annually. Will any honourable member deny that that industry was worth fostering? Through Central and Northern Queensland and westerly to the Northern Territory are millions of acres suitable for cotton cultivation, and nobody will deny that the Australian product is equal, if not superior, to the imported. This Parliament is justified in giving to the cotton-growers some assistance in their struggling years. I refuse to believe that the prices of cotton apparel have been increased in Victoria. Buti f the manufacturers break their pledge to the Government that they will not increase prices, this Parliament will have no option but to withdraw the. increased duties.

We should take a national view of this matter, and I as a well-wisher of Queensland and of Australian industries am prepared to assist the cotton industry until it is sufficiently established to take care of itself. I desire briefly to emphasize the statement of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) that cotton growing in Australia can never be an economic success. opinion I remind the committee that iu 1926 this Parliament appropriated £900,000 for the assistance of the cotton industry, the payments to be spread o.ver a period of five years.

His answer was"" The growers, at least, seem to think that there is "". When the bill went to a division I and four others votedagainst it. Notwithstanding the statement by the then Minister( Mr Pratten) that there was a reasonable prospect of the industry being self-supporting within the five years over which the bounty was to extend, the industry is now, only four years later, asking for increased assistance. furnished that the industry has any better prospect of success now than it had five years ago. tection alters the whole complexion of the industry. growing of cotton. asked to holster up the secondary industries, but we are to subsidize also the production of the raw material. history of the industry seems to prove that it has not the slightest prospect of ever being self-supporting, and in my opinion the sooner it is wiped out the better in the interests of Australia. . . ringah) [3.15] -On e or two points have not yet been adequately met by the Acting Minister's explanation.

In support of that honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) showed indisputably that there has beeu a considerable increase in the cost of the raw material, particularly union yarn, which is necessary to keep the knitting industry in existence. The honourable member has cited chapter and verse to show the various increases in prices. They vary from Id. on certain kinds of yarn to 4£d. and 5d. His statement is proved beyond doubt by the correspondence that he has received from a manufacturing firm. The evidence is unmistakable and inescapable. In addition, the honourable member has shown that these particular manufacturers have a monopoly, being the only manufacturers of the yarn that the knitting factories require, and that not content with charging increased prices they go further and refuse to accept from the knitting factories orders for less than 2,000 lb. of yarn. There are only two spinning firms in Australia which make this yarn. Bond and Company are not at present making it, but the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills are No evidence has heen making it , and it is the action of that particular firm to which the honourable member for Corangamite has referred. In addition, that firm has a branch establishment engaged in the knitting industry, which is competing with the legitimate knitting manufacturers.

He has now a clear case before him. It is as clear as the peak of a mountain that the prices of cotton goods are considerably higher than they were two years ago. ber speaking of the manufacturers or of the retailers? am speaking from the point of view of the consumers of this country. I am not at the moment concerned with the view of the manufacturer, distributor or the retailer. The'fact remains that the cost of cotton goods is infinitely higher to-day than it was a couple of years ago. No other necessary of life has increased in price during the last two years to the extent that cotton goods have, and I predict that in the next year or so there will be a still greater increase in prices. The Prime Minister has been repeatedly asked in this House what action he intends to take to protect the consumer in the event of prices being increased as the result of the recent tariff schedules, and he has replied, with ever increasing emphasis, that if any authentic cases could be brought under his notice he would take speedy action to counteract them. He said that, if necessary, he would be prepared to remove the tariff protection that had been given, but it was pointed out to him that if that were done we should, in many instances, punish the just as well as the unreceive some benefit from that industry just manufacturer. The most extraordinary and outstanding feature of the Government's administration is its neglect to protect the workers and the general public from an increase in prices consequent on the recent tariff revision. The interests of the manufacturer and the grower have been considered, but this Government, whose first duty should be to protect the workers of this country, has shown an almost callous indifference to them by refusing to prevent its own supporters, and Nationalist supporters in industrial areas, from being exploited in respect of their necessaries of life. The Tariff Board recognizes the necessity for protecting the interests of the consumers, because in its report of June, 1929, it saysWith a view to protecting the consumer the Tariff Board, in dealing with every application for increased tariff protection, seeks from the applicants an assurance that, in the event of the desired protection or additional protection (as the case may he) being granted, advantage of such protection will not be taken to increase the selling prices of their goods. The calling for this assurance follows logically on the argument almost invariably presented by the applicants that the protection is needed to enable the Australian factories to increase their output and work to full capacity, an argument which is quite sound. Generally speaking, it should follow that, if by securing I the local market to the Australian manufacturers the output of their factories is increased up to the full capacity of their plants, then production costs should be lowered and reduced selling prices should result, assuming that the prices previously obtaining were not unprofitable. This being so, in addition to the assurance against an increase in prices, the board, where the circumstances appear to warrant it,' also calls for an assurance that, if as the result of the granting of the protection, costs of production are so decreased as to make a reduction in selling prices possible, consumers will be given the advantage of such reduction. The board has under consideration the desirability of the establishment of a system of following up assurances given, in order to ascertain how far the promises made have been fulfilled. Clearly the value of any assurance given is discounted unless some effective check such as that suggested is in operation. I commend that statement to the Acting Minister. The Tariff Board clearly intended that advantage should not be taken of tariff assistance in order to exploit the consumers. When £900,000 of the taxpayers' money is being put into an industry, surely the people generally should in the way of obtaining goods at reduced prices. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) showed that the price of jerseys worn by children had since the tariff revision increased from 4s. to 6s. a dozen. I am glad that at least one or two Government supporters have made some protest against the excessive charges which those who have received tariff assistance are already levying upon the workers of this country. It is not an unusual sight to see the wife of a working man dragging five or six children from shop to shop in order to obtain goods at the cheapest and lowest prices.

It is time that someone was concerned about him, because the Government apparently is not. The late T. P. O'Connor, M.P., who represented a Liverpool constituency for a record number of years, on one occasion started a newspaper which he called The Star; and he announced that the barometer by which would be judged the effects of the politics of the country would be the material condition of the wharf labourer begging outside the dockyard gate, the charwoman in St. Giles, and the seamstress who sweated in Whitechapel. If we were to judge the policy of this Government in relation to the tariff by the material condition of similar units of society in Australia, what would be the result? We should learn that there is less employment offering for those who seek work on the wharfs; that the charwoman who is struggling to clothe, feed and rear a large number of children is much worse off because of the increased cost of living; and that other sections are similarly affected. I have no objection to the industries of this country being given a fair deal. But while I am prepared to do that for the manufacturer and the grower of cotton, I , in return, demand a fair deal for the general public and the workers of this country. They will not get that under this bill. am not astonished at the tone that the debate has assumed. Very little has been said about the clause; practically the whole of the afternoon has been spent in a discussion of the effects of tariff duties generally. The tariff has been blamed for high prices, and for much of the difficulty in which the country now finds itself. I shall leave any comments that I have to make on the tariff to the occasion when it is being debated on a motion that relates specifically to it, and shall confine myself to the clause, which contains nothing about duties or high protection, or the effect of giving a particular group of manufacturers a monopoly of the Australian market, and consequently the power to exploit the people. I agree with a great deal of what has been said this afternoon. I can see no I reason why the manufacturers of Australia should be considered as a class apart from the general community. But that matter is not before the committee. The bill provides simply for the payment of bounties to cotton-growers and those who are engaged in the manufacture of cotton yarn. I can see no justification for the payment of a bounty to the manufacturers of cotton yarn. I supported the second reading of this bill because I believed that it was desirable to assist materially the development of the cotton growing industry in Australia. That industry will be located in the rural areas of the Commonwealth; thus this proposal of the Government will be of assistance to a primary industry that may be of very great importance to the future life of this nation. At the present stage of Australia's history in connection with the payment of bounties I consider that an experiment in relation to cotton-growing is as much justified as have been those hitherto made with other industries. I point out to the committee that the principle of paying a bounty for the production of cotton is not new to this Parliament, but was applied by the Government that was in power prior to the advent of this Ministry. The amount of bounty which it is proposed to pay may be an arguable matter, but that question is not relevant to the clause being debated. I agree that, broadly stated, a bounty is the only practical form of assistance for rural industries. I cannot see that the imposition of duties will assist to promote rural industries and, therefore, rural settlement. As the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) has stated, some years ago, when the previous government was asked",33,Cotton Industries Bounty

That is all that is now proposed. I would not give a hounty to the manufacturers of yarn. justification for regarding one or two factories as a national industry. If it is desirable that they should be assisted let them be assisted through the instrumentality of the tariff. That ought to be sufficient for them. But there can be no argument against the payment of a bounty to the growers of seed cotton. Do honourable members opposite propose to vote against the payment of that bounty, and to repudiate the contract and compact that was entered into with the men who have invested their all in this industry and have endeavoured tp develop it? gone out of business. The speech delivered by the Acting Forde) proves that, as a result of the bounty and of the efforts of the State Government in Queensland, the industry is now in such a position that, in the view of experts, if that measure of support is continued for the period specified in the bill, it will then be able to stand on ment of Great Britain and the Egyptian its own feet. told five years ago. members that "" Art is long, and time is fleeting"". These industries are difficult to establish. It is not questioned that in respect to both cotton and sugar the State of Queensland is confronted with an extraordinarily difficult problem. We have to look to that State chiefly for the production of those two commodities. Each year we import cotton goods to the value of £11,000,000, and that fact is materially associated with our adverse trade balance. If we increase our population but yet make no attempt to develop the cotton industry, our imports of cotton goods will rise in value to £20,000,000 and ultimately £50,000,000 annually. They now amount to about £2 per head of population. Every unit that is added to the population means the addition of £2 to our import figures; and in the fullness of time, unless we make an attempt to establish this industry, we shall be crippled by adverse balances. I believe in a commencement being made in its priI can see no mary section, the production of seed cotton, but can see no justification for giving a bounty to the manufacturers of cotton yarn. Although honourable members opposite have criticized that proposal, they have not moved for its exclusion. I challenge them to say whether the time has arrived when this Parliament should deliberately decide that the cotton industry shall go out of existence. If they are not willing to say that, they must vote for the continuance of the bounty. Progress reported. BOOK-ALLEGATION S OF BRIBERY[3.50] I move That the House do now adjourn. This morning the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) asked me a question regarding the progress of negotiations between the GovernGovernment. I informed him that we had been kept closely informed by the British Government concerning what was taking place. Just before the Easter adjournment the reports received were very favorable; but I have now received information that the negotiations finally broke down yesterday, owing to the British Government being unable to satisfy the Egyptian demands with regard to the Government of the Sudan. The negotiations commenced at the beginning of April, and when they were adjourned immediately before Easter such a measure of progress had been achieved towards an agreement on a clause to provide for the adequate protection by British troops of British communications through the Suez Canal that there appeared good reason for hoping that the negotiations would be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.

Yesterday I read a report of the proceedings of the Public Accounts Committee with regard to its inquiry into the claim by the "" A "" class broadcasting stations. In that statement the following appeared:it is necessary for me to ask whether any individual member has been approached. Messrs. O'Halloran, Francis, Gardner, Guy, Hoare and Yates intimated that they had not been approached in any way. As it might, however, be inferred that the other members of the committee whose names are not mentioned had been approached, Senator O'Halloran, the Acting Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, desired me to make it clear that Senator J. B. Hayes and MrI wish to correct a mis-statement which Chifley were not present at the meeting of the committee at which members were asked hy the Chairman whether they had been approached. When those gentlemen were informed of what had taken place, they stated . that they had not been approached by any one. am sure that honourable members have heard with regret the announcement that the conference between the British and Egyptian Governments has concluded without result, This, apparently, leaves the position as it was some years ago, when a re-arrangement was effected allowing Egypt a modified form of independence, subject to four conditions. broken down over the discussion on one of these four matters, the result being that no agreement has been reached on any of them. It is hoped that ultimately a friendly arrangement will be arrived at between the British Government and tbe Egyptian Government, because it is very important, from the point of view of Australia, that friendly relations should prevail betwen Egypt and the Empire, having regard to Australia's interest in the Suez Canal. The Prime Minister hag assured us that the Government recognizes the importance of the Suez Canal to Australia, and that representations made on behalf of the Commonwealth have been inspired hy that consideration. Althoughi t is regrettable that negotiations have broken down there is no reason why they should not be renewed when a suitable opportunity presents itself.

You are, I believe, the only one standing out."" I said, ""Oh, where did you get that information from?"" He said, That information came from the Chairman."" I said, ""That seems very funny.""
