TER BOMBER. don cable message in yesterday's press stated that some members of the Royal Australian A i r Force in Britain had received white feathers in letters from Australia accusing them of remaining in England in order to dodge the war. We are told that this has caused angry discussion in every mess in Britain. As tlie procedure is a repetition of the dastardly enemy tactics used against Australian Army heroes at Tobruk, and on other members of the Australian Army who were serving in the Middle East at the time, will the Attorney General, who has personal knowledge of the perilous nature of the duties that are performed by these gallant lads of the Royal Australian A ir Force, provide, by regulation if necessary, a maximum penalty for such treachery by would be accomplices of the enemy? Will the right honourable gentleman also see that the censorship shall do its duty and render a service to Australian citizens by outwitting traitors in their endeavour to destroy the morale of these gallant Australian lads, instead of aiding and abetting them, as the practice would appear to be to-day? the honourable member's protest. My colleague the Minister for Air has made a statement on the subject. I shall confer with him in order to determine what may be done to put an end to such dastardly tactics. for Air say whether the Lancaster bomber which crashed at Evans Head some months ago is yet serviceable, and, if so, will he make arrangements for it to give displays in connection with the Victory Loan? bomber is not yet ready for service. It will be ready very soon, and will be used in connection with the war loan campaign as on a previous occasion. PAY-AS-YOU-EARN TAXATION-OPINIO N BY PROFESSOR BAILEY. for Home Security) -by leave I submit the following statement on behalf of the Treasurer:My attention has been drawn to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 24th March, under the heading ""When Lawyers Differ"". The suggestion in the newspaper is that the opinion of Professor Bailey on the question of the tax lag has only just been obtained in order to counter a contrary opinion given by the Solicitor-General. I state quite definitely that the Solicitor-General has at no time given an opinion on the tax lag, and that he has not been asked at any time for snch an opinion. As to whether or not the opinion of Professor Bailey is of recent origin, I need merely say that the opinion released for the benefit of the press generally clearly set out that it had been given in January last. The Solicitor-General was on leave at the time, and in his absence Professor Bailey, who is attached to the Attorney General's Department in a consultative capacity, was asked for an opinion as to the effect of pay-as-you-earn provisions on uniform taxation. Professor Bailey, it may be recalled, was one of the advisers to the Commonwealth GoI entirely agree with vernment in the matter of the uniform taxation legislation. In his consideration of the matter that had been referred to him, Professor Bailey found it necessary to give his attention to the question of the deferred liability, or "" l a g "", in taxation. The opinion released to the press during the week was that which had been given by him nearly three months ago.",8,Appropriation Act No 2 1043 4 4 No 22 Of 1944

The system of releases recommended by the Coal Commissioner applies, not only to those men who were called up recently, but also to those who have served in the Army for a considerable time. There is a shortage of man-power, but the system of releases is not being extended to those who choose to remain in the Army. Releases are made under stringent supervision in order to obtain increased coal production. The fact is that, soon after the South Coast miners resumed, production declined because of the absence of a number of key men, despite the fact that every effort was made by the employees to maintain production. There has been a substantial increase of production lately, and the last three weeks have been the best we have had this year. that, for the winning of coal, one must have experienced men. In that respect I am not prepared to take the responsibility of acting other than in accordance with the advice of the Coal Commissioner. General seen an editorial which appeared in the publication Iron and Coal Trades Review of the 7th January to the effect that in England coal production declined from 4,200,000 tons a week in 1942, when the mines were under private control, to 3,900,000 tons a week under State control? If so, will he inform the House whether, in view of the strike at the Commonwealth-controlled mine at Coalcliff, which proves that the Government cannot control the mines member may not debate whether or not the Government can control coal mines. He must ask his question. General give instructions that no further mines shall be nationalized in Australia ? has referred to two aspects of coal production. I have not read the article pubact provides for lished in a certain magazine of January last regarding the production of coal in Great Britain. I ask the honourable member not to draw any adverse inferences regarding Government control from the one-day stoppage which occurred at Coalcliff. Regarding coal production generally in New South Wales, I have obtained some figures which may prove enlightening: In the fortnight ended on the 5th February, the production was 397,145 tons; and in the following two fortnights, 376,485 tons and 365,830 tons respectively. But for the fortnightly period ended on the 18th March, that is, during part of the last three weeks, production, including that from Coalcliff. reached 403,000 tons. Eor the first half of the present fortnight, although there have been some set backs, production was estimated at between 210,000 tons and 215,000 tons. the Army seen the reported statement of the Consul for China, in the press on the 25th instant, that Chinese labourers formerly employed at wolfram mining in Central Australia are now working for the Civil Constructional Corps at the award rates of from £5 10s. to £7 2s. 6d. a week? Do these men receive, in addition, the rations and quarters to which Civil Constructional Corps workers in camp are entitled under their award? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that Australian soldiers shall be paid rates at least equal to those given to these Chinese workers?",12,Strike At Coalclif F Colliery

Prime Minister seen a report in yesterday's Melbourne Herald bearing the heading: ""Wanton waste in Allied Works Council alleged "" ? Has the Acting Prime Minister noticed that, according to the report, Mr Theodore, Director-General of Allied Works, declined to meet the workers of the Civil Constructional Corps when he was on a recent visit to Alice Springs, and that the business of the deputation was to place before the Director-General specific instances of waste at that' place ? Will he direct the War Expenditure Committee to investigate these charges, and will he inquire from the Director-General his reasons for refusing to meet the deputation? report to which the honourable member refers. I have not noticed the other points raised by the honourable member; but I shall consider his representations regarding the alleged refusal of the Director General to meet the deputation. Minister for Supply and Shipping seen a statement in last week's Queensland press that organizations of graziers in that State expect a transport crisis which will adversely affect meat production, because there is little prospect and expenditure of the Allied Works of the rubber control authorities being able to meet the urgent minimum demands of thousands of primary producers for more tyres' and tubes? Will the Minister order an investigation into the statement of the secretary of the United Graziers Association, Mr P. Brown, that thousands of Queensland claims are months old, and that many graziers who applied for tyres and tubes in 1942 are still without them? matter. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) asked me a question on Thursday on the same subject, in the course of which it was stated that primary producers holding priority No. 4 licences could not hope to obtain new tyres. I have been advised that that is not correct. As far as truck tyres are concerned, there should not be any difficulty in meeting priority No. 4 requirements, but because there is a general shortage of car and utility sizes, there may be delay in filling priority No. 4 applications for tyres of that kind. This aspect of the matter is constantly under review, and as the crucial importance of primary production is appreciated by the department, the honourable member may rest assured that every effort will be made to adjust the position so that tyres and tubes for cars and utility vehicles will be made availablo to primary producers. Later: the Deputy Prime Minister been directed to statements by Mr J. C. Arrowsmith, secretary of the Civil Constructional Corps Workers' Committee, in yesterday's press that thousands of pounds worth of tyres had for months been lying in the open at Alice Springs exposed to sun and rain? Has he seen Mr Arrowsmith's further statement .that he had been anxious to put this and other evidence of wanton waste before the Director General of Allied Works, Mr Theodore, when he was in Alice Springs but Mr Theodore had refused to receive a deputation? In view of these statements and the criticisms of the Auditor-General, will the Deputy Prime Minister bring before Cabinet the matter of holding a searching investigation of the activities Council?

The chief of these are-greate r benefits to dependants in case of death; greater benefits for family of injured employee; increase of the maximum aggregate total of weekly payments; compensation for injury sustained travelling to and from employment; the widening of the scope covered by industrial diseases; and greater benefits for specified injuries. The maximum payment to dependants in case of death has been increased from £750 to £800, plus an additional payment of £25 for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. The present minimum payment is £400, or three years' pay, whichever is the larger. The bill varies this provision by increasing three years' pay to four years' pay. The definition of dependant has been widened. In broad terms, it may be said that the benefits being provided are much more generous than those at present in force, and that the field of employment to which the measure will apply has been extended. In future, all Commonwealth employees will be covered except those in the defence services and those known as "" outworkers "". I am informed that approximately 100,000 employees will come within the range of this legislation. It is of considerable importance, therefore, that we should have a clear appreciation of the variations in the conditions that will apply to Mr Bolt. employees as compared with those applicable to persons in the employment of the State governments or private employers. A consideration of the facts will show how wise it will be for employees to take steps to obtain Commonwealth Government employment-if they are blessed with the faculty of foreseeing illness or accident! It is undesirable, in my opinion, for employees who are working in close proximity to each other-som e in a Commonwealth Government undertaking in one building, others nearby in a State government enterprise, and others still close at hand in private employment-to be subject to differing conditions in relation to compensation for sickness and injury. To illustrate the difference in the conditions that will prevail, I point out that deafness in one ear will carry, under Commonwealth legislation, a compensation of 25 per cent, of the maximum amount provided, which is £800. Therefore, a Commonwealth employee who lost his hearing in the course of his employment would receive £200. If such a disability overtook a man in the employment of the Victorian Government or a private employer in Victoria, he would receive only 10 per cent, of the maximum amount, which would be £75. That applies also to Queensland. In New South Wales, on the other hand, £200 would be payable. best thing to do would be for the State governments to increase their rates of compensation. have reviewed their legislation on this subject in recent years. If the honourable member for Batman implies, by his.interjection, that uniformity is desirable in this matter, I share his view. It will be absurd if , in such a district as, say, Footscray, in Victoria, a Commonwealth employee were to receive a compensation of £200 for a certain injury, whilst a State government employee or a person in private employment nearby were to receive less than half that sum for the same injury. A person who loses one eye receives-in Victoria, £300, or 40 per cent, of the maximum amount; in New Commonwealth South Wales £375, or approximately 46",17,Chiflet

This could well be listed as a subject for disprovision in respect of the injury of a cussion at a Premiers Conference, with a view to achieving uniformity throughout the 'Commonwealth. In other important respects the proposals in this bill differ from State legislation, which also differs as between the States. Commonwealth legislation will approximate more closely to that of New South Wales than to that of any other State, but even so there will be important differhowever, is merely a general observation, ences. For example, under legislation of the Commonwealth there is no limit on the income which may be earned by an applicant for the benefits that are provided. In New South Wales, an income in excess of £750 per annum would be a bar. In Victoria, the limit is £400, in Queensland £650, in South Australia £520, in Western Australia £500, and in Tasmania £365 in respect of occupational diseases and £8 a week in respect of injuries resulting from accident. These differences raise considerations to which this Parliament will have to direct its mind at some time. I use the word ""benefit"" with some diffidence, because I do not imagine for one moment that a man who has lost the sight of both eyes receives real benefit by being given the £800 in compensation. The point that I make is, that substantial benefits by way of compensation are provided in respect of those who happen to be employed persons, irrespective of the income earned in any one year. On the other hand, if a farmer, a self-employed person whose net income on a yearly average may not be higher than between £6 and £10, has the misfortune to lose an arm while manipulating the complicated machinery which is part and parcel of modern farm life, he may not receive any benefit; whereas a man whose income may be three or four times as high will be entitled to the benefits provided if he is in the category of an employee under this scheme. cannot legislate at present in respect of It gives a comparison of the principal industrial compensation of any kind provisions in the various States with except in relation to its own employees. corresponding provisions under existing these substantial benefits are provided by the amendments now proposed. way of compensation, irrespective of the amount of income earned, this Parliament has not yet seen fit to make any self-employed person, or, perhaps, a housewife. I do not analyse, at the moment, the question of whether or not it has the necessary power to do so. I have no doubt that quite commonly housewives in the performance of their domestic duties sustain injury, possibly quite serious injury, yet no provision exists for compensation in their case. That, upon which we may have to reflect in more detail as our social security programme becomes broadened in certain directions. man has noted the position in respect of the cover for injury sustained while travelling to or from work. Has he also found a similar provision in any State act? lines has been made in some State legislation, but my recollection is that there is a proviso that the injury shall not have been the result of any default, misbehaviour, or negligence by the employee. The Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini), who is in charge of the bill in the absence of the Treasurer, might later supply further enlightenment on that point. . This proposal broadens very considerably the field of injury and accident, thus constituting an important extension of existing legislation. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) stated in his second-reading speech that provision was being made for the incorporation in the act of certain machinery amendments. Doubtless the Minister for Home Security will make some reference to those in committee.

It is interesting to note that the original act was passed in 1912. It was amended in a comprehensive manner in 1930, and it next comes before Parliament in 1944. On each of those occasions it has been the duty of a Labour government to try to ensure something like justice for Commonwealth employees. was prepared, not by the Labour Government, but by the previous Administration. prepared, but it was not passed during the life of the previous Administration. Lots of legislation is prepared that is never carried into effect. I prefer to judge by results, not by preparations. This bill proposes to confer a number of benefits on employees in addition to those already provided in the act. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) that the bill provides benefits greater than those provided in most of the State acts. The honourable member made a comparison between the conditions of Commonwealth employees and employees in outside industry working almost side by side. He complained, apparently, that Commonwealth employees in certain instances are entitled to £200 compensation, whereas, under the Victorian Compensation Act, employees are entitled to only £75 for schedule for lump sum compensation. similar injuries. torian employees had grounds for increased. One anomaly, however, recomplaint. ber's suggestion was that, because an emdeducted. That should not be. It often ployee under the Victorian compensation happens that, as the result of an acciact received only £75, the Commonwealth dent, a man is incapacitated for months, employee should not receive £200. This during which time he draws weekly payseems to me to be just another reason for ments for compensation. Then his injury conferring on the Commonwealth.Parliais assessed at a certain disability, and he ment greater powers, so that it may pass is awarded a lump sum, but when he goes a comprehensive compensation act to to collect it he may receive only half the cover all employees, irrespective of the amount fixed in the schedule. I have in State in which they reside or the emmind the case of one man who had drawn ployer for whom they work. If such an £147 10s. in weekly payments. That act could be passed there would be a better chance of employees obtaining justice. In some directions, this bill could with justice confer greater benefits than have been provided. I have in mind the weekly rate of compensation for an incapacitated employee. The bill provides that such a man shall receive compensation at the rate of two-thirds of his weekly earnings, with a maximum of £3 a week, plus £1 for his wife, and 8s. 6d. a week for each dependent child. Under the act as it now stands, the maximum weekly rate of compensation is £3 10s. a week. That rate was fixed in August, 1930. Since then, the basic wage of Commonwealth employees has increased by £28 a year, and margins for skill, responsibility, &c, have in many instances been increased by amounts varying from £5 to as much as £50. In callings where the risk of accident is rather high, the margin for skill has increased by £28 in some instances and by as much as £36 in others. I suggest that the increased earning capacity of the average employee should be taken into account in assessing compensation. If that were done, the Government might leave the tiwo-thirds provision as it is, but raise the maximum compensation receivable to £3 10s., or even £4. This would enable the incapacitated employee to have something more than a mere existence. The honourable member for Fawkner referred to the increases provided in the' Certainly, the schedule has been greatly improved. Many more injuries have I suggested that the Vicbeen covered, and the amounts have been mains. ""When a lump sum is paid in compensation for an injury, the .amount",19,Chiflet

He lost his employment because there was nothing for him to do in the service in view of his ling has always been difficult, and the injury, and he had to fend for himself. The Government has placed before the House proposals which are reasonable and sound, though they do not give so much to the workers as I should like. We should not mould our legislation upon what has been passed by the State Parliaments. It is the duty of a National Parliament to set a standard for the States. The fact that the Victorian Parliament says that no employee receiving more than £400 a year shall obtain the benefits of the Workers Compensation Act, is not a reason why this Parliament, in these enlightened days of 1944, should follow its lead. Certainly, in that respect the Commonwealth Government has not set a salary limit over which its employees shall not receive compensation. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to set the standard for the States to follow. employer. trouble has been that, instead of setting the standard, the Commonwealth Government has time after time trailed in the wake of State governments and outside employers, and employees have been compelled to fight for the little they have been given. It , however, is making, in this bill, a reasonable effort to give its employees something like a fair deal when incapacitated through injury. I hope that in committee the Government will give consideration to my two suggestions. the Opposition) [4.12] I have no quarrel with the main principles of the bill; indeed I support them.

I have risen today to direct attention to one matter which I admit puzzles me a little. Clause5 of this bill proposes to introprincipal act. The problem of how far compensation may or may not be payable when a man sustains injury while travelbill seeks to dispose of that difficulty by the broad method of including the travelling time of a worker within the period in respect of which his industry is responsible for him. In many cases that may be a good thing. I would not quarrel with it. Various workers' compensation acts the world over have tended to enlarge the area in which there may be liability, and in more than one act there is provision for travelling time, but there is an innovation in the bill. I am indebted to the research of my colleague the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) for the reference to the act of New South Wales in which there is a provision imposing liability where the worker sustains injury during his travel to and from work, but in that act the words are these. . . where a worker has received injury without his own default or wilful act on any of the daily or other periodical journeys referred to in the sub-section. . . . He loses the right to compensation if the injury he sustains in the period of travel arises from his own default or wilful act. Section9 of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act of 1930 contains the phrase, "" if personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of his employment""-the classical phrase used in all such legislation-and there is a proviso that, if it is proved that the injury to the employee is attributable to his serious and wilful misconduct, he shall not be entitled to compensation.

The amending clause is clause 5, which proposes to insert the provision about travelling to and from work, after section 9 of the principal act. It will become section 9A, but the proviso about serious and wilful misconduct is a proviso to section 9. It is by no means clear that it will automatically operate as a proviso to proposed section 9A. shall be so. cleared up. it would not apply. that matter so that the Attorney-General may be able to examine the clause to see whether he agrees with that prima facie criticism. The proviso to section 9 should definitely apply to proposed section 9A and I have no doubt that that is the intention of the Government. The second comment that I make is that the proviso excludes injury attributable to serious and wilful misconduct. That is a very much narrower exclusion than is the exclusion in the New South Wales act in relation to"" accidents sustained during travelling contained in those words ""without his own default or wilful act"". Let us consider the fairly common case of a man who is going to work on a motor cycle, and let us suppose that on the way to work he negligently drives his motor cycle and has an accident in which he sustains injury. Under the New South Wales act he would not be entitled to compensation because he would not have received the injury without his own default; but, under the Commonwealth legislation, assuming that the proviso to section 9 is made to operate in respect of proposed section 9A, he would still be entitled to compensation, because negligence in driving a motor cycle would stop far short of disentitling him. It is well known to those familiar with compensation problems as they have been discussed from time to time that mere negligence does not amount to serious and wilful misconduct. Many a workman has sustained injury through his own carelessness and has still obtained compensation, because no one could say that careCompensation BiU 1944. lessness,, as such, amounted to serious and wilful misconduct. Consequently, this clause may very well have the effect, as I think it will, of entitling to compensation a man who sustains injury on his way to work although that injury is directly produced by his own carelessness. I agree with the 'honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) that the burden which industry has to sustain in respect of injuries to employees has to be fair, and, as far as possible, generous. I do not for one moment believe that the Commonwealth should lag behind the States or measure its pace according to the pace of perhaps the slowest of the States. I have a liberal approach to this matter, but I am not at all satisfied that the provision in the New South Wales legislation in regard to this matter is not more sensible than our own. Eor myself, I should like to see the provision about travelling limited by some such expression as that used in the New South Wales act. in the New South Wales act regarding injury in working time? course of employment"" are pretty well standard words throughout all these acts. "" In j u r y by accident arising out of and in the course of employment"" has become almost a universal phrase in these matters. Wales added this liability, which is not a prima facie liability, about travelling time, because a man is not at work while he is travelling, it represented an extension, and the Parliament of New South Wales put upon that extension the limitation that the employee should not be entitled to compensation for an accident while travelling if that accident arose from his own default or wilful act.

"" Default"" may be much too fine a word. It may deprive a man who has been guilty of some technical breach; but at the other extreme, "" serious and wilful misconduct"" seems to me to be such a strong expression that it would make it almost impossible to exclude from the scope of the bill any travelling accident. -I s not the Leader of the Opposition discussing a point that could be better raised in committee? now, because I desire to take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Attorney-jGeneral to a point that may be worthy of investigation. I ask him to be good enough to heed what I say. It is of no use raising these matters at the last moment in committee.

The bill provides also for comlaws relating to Commonwealth empensation for injury sustained by Comployees into line with the trends of recent monwealth employees travelling to amendments of State laws dealing with and from their place of employcompensation to workers in industry. ment. This provision will be brought After the outbreak of war, the industrial into line with legislation in ceractivity of Commonwealth departments tain States. In New South Wales was considerably enlaxged, and the necessity to widen the provision governing compensation for injury caused by industrial processes became increasingly apparent. Furthermore, the benefits originally provided were measured in the light of the onset of the financial depression, and should now be placed on a more generous basis. That has been the trend of recent amendments of State laws, and this bill provides for the granting of increased benefits under several headings. First, it provides for greater benefits to dependants in the event of the death of the breadwinner. In such circumstances, payments to dependants have been increased from £750 to £800, with an additional payment of £25 for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. The present minimum payment is £400 or three years' pay, whichever be the greater. Under the bill, four years' pay will be allowed, and the definition of "" dependant"" has been widened. The bill also provides for greater benefits for the family of an injured employee. At present the act provides for the payment of two-thirds of the weekly wage of an injured employee, with a maximum of £3 10s. a week, but with an additional 7s. 6d. for each dependent child under fourteen years of age. It is now proposed that the maximum payment to the injured employee shall be £3 a week, with an allowance of £1 a week for the wife or housekeeper dependent upon the employee, and 8s. 6d. for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. The total weekly payment shall not exceed the employee's remuneration at the time he was injured. The weekly payment to an employee suffering total and permanent incapacity will continue indefinitely. If the injury is not total and permanent, the employee is now entitled to receive in total payments not more than £750. With the amplified weekly benefits now proposed to be granted, it is deemed desirable to increase this amount to £1,000, so that the maximum period during which",24,Chiflet

I appreciate the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr as such by the taxation authorities, which Menzies), who pointed out that under clause 9 the compensation would be payable unless the injury was caused by a serious and wilful act of the employee. I suggest that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) before he considers altering that provision altering it. The point taken by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr sums? Spender) is sound. the whole way. familiar with the practice in New South Wales. gross negligence. the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition, I consider that the New South Wales provision is too restrictive. If the injury resulted from the default of the worker in the course of his journey to or from his employment, compensation would not be payable under the New South Wales act. That is too restrictive. The honourable member for Warringah rightly pointed out that some manner of default on the part of the worker may not be a culpable act in the sense that it should deprive him of his compensation. For example, an employee, after working overtime, may be hurrying home to his evening meal. If , as the honourable member for Warringah stated, he commits a breach of the traffic regulations and sustains an injury, that breach should not be sufficient to deprive him of compensation. He may commit a breach of the law through a mental aberration resulting through heavy and continuous work. Therefore, I am glad to know that the Attorney General has decided, after consideration, not to alter the provision. I ask the Government to take into consideration the exemption from income tax of weekly payments by way of compensation. Cases have been brought to my notice recently of claims by the taxation authorities for taxes based upon weekly compensation payments. payments are income? I think is unfair. The compensation people receive under this measure is intended to recoup them for medical and hospital expenses, and, also, in a sense, for .the suffering they are called upon to bear. The payments are not made merely for sustenance. member in mind payments in lump weekly payments at the moment. I also ask that steps be taken to provide that persons who are injured through the action of Crown employees shall be compensated. Recently a young lady, who had suffered severe injuries through having been run down by an Army lorry, sued the Commonwealth Government for compensation, but lost her case because it was held that, although the driver of the lorry was a soldier, he was driving the vehicle without authority. The young lady not only suffered serious injury, but she also incurred a loss of about £200, because she had to pay both her own and the Crown's legal expenses. The case brought her to the verge of bankruptcy. If she had been injured by a vehicle driven by a private individual she would have been entitled to compensation under the third party insurance laws of New South Wales, for the accident occurred in that State, but, because the vehicle was driven illegally by a Commonwealth servant, she was unable to obtain any redress whatsoever. Another case brought to my notice concerned a civilian, who was knocked down by a vehicle owned by the Postmaster-General's Department and driven by an employee of the Postmaster-General. Because negligence was not proved against either the driver of the vehicle or the Commonwealth no compensation was payable to the injured person. In this instance, too, if the injured person had been injured by a civilian, compensation would have been payable under the third party insurance scheme. On the other hand, if the civil servant had been injured, he would have",25,Chiflet

107,Mr Morgan,"I am dealing withbeen compensated under this act. I urge the Government to amend the law to meet cases of this description. I welcome the introduction of this hill, because a great need has arisen, in the last three or four years, for an enlargement of both the schedule of industrial fliseases and the schedule of specified in which I welcome, because it affects juries for which compensation is payable. Since the war the number of Commonwealth employees engaged in the production of munitions has increased from between 10,000 and 12,000 to, perhaps, 300,000 or 400,000. These people are engaged in industries which are extraordinarily dangerous because of the likelihood of explosions, or the effects of years medical treatment has been sharply cbemicals. The introduction of this bill is therefore overdue. I am specially interested in the subject, because I overhauled the then existing law of 1929. However, a serious political and parliamentary accident occurred about that time, which resulted in the removal from office of the Government of which I was a member. During the following year I assisted the present Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) to pilot through the House the bill that I had drafted. Seven or eight years later, I had fhe privilege of introducing a bill to liberalize the conditions relating to the compensation of seamen, and on that occasion I enjoyed the co-operation of the same honourable gentleman. I am glad that dermatitis is being included in the schedule of industrial diseases, for, owing to the increased use of oil and grease and various corrosives, derand especially of the memorandum that matitis has become much more prevalent. The greatly increased use of diesel and crude oils has led to a wide prevalence of skin diseases which are caused by the penetration of oils through clothing and their irritating effect on the skin. I also had included in the list of diseases to which the seamen's compensation act applies, poisoning caused by benzol and, also poisoning by its homologues or their derivatives, preparations or compounds. These diseases, and also poisoning by hydrogen, sulphide or carbon bi-sulphide, poisoning by nitrous or other acid fumes, poisoning by cyanogen poisoning by carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, poisoning by other toxic gas and 173] poisoning by chrome ulceration, are also properly being included in the schedule. It is highly necessary, too, that pneumoconiosis should be placed in the schedule, because the Commonwealth Government is now much more closely associated with the coal-mining industry than formerly. Telegraphists' cramp is another addition individuals who are employed almost solely by the Commonwealth Government. The provision that in future compensation shall apply to medical, surgical and hospital treatment is commendable. Originally ""medical treatment"" was understood to cover all these aspects of medical service, but in the course of the defined, and the need has arisen to enlarge the legal term to cover surgical and hospital treatment. At one stage a maximum sum of £50 or £100 was provided to cover hospital treatment. Because many of the diseases which arise, particularly from industrial causes, are chronic and may need a long course of hospitalization, the patient should be given ease of mind by reason of the knowledge that the whole of the cost of the treatment will be borne by the Government. Paragmph e, of clause 2, proposes to add to the definition of ""employee"" the words "" any officer or employee of the Public Service of a Territory of the Commonwealth "". At first sight, this would appear to include such persons within the scope of those who benefit under the act; but a perusal of the act, has been circulated, proves that such persons are to be excluded . Section 4, 1 as the bill proposes to amend it, will read'-' employee"" means any officer . . . but does not include(a) an outworker; » (6) any member of tlie naval, military, or air force of the Commonwealth; or (c) any officer or employee of the Publie Service of a Territory of the Commonwealth.

The matter should be placed"" beyond doubt. tion is to exclude any employee of the territories of Papua, New Guinea or Norfolk Island, but to include any employee of the Commonwealth who is sent to any of those territories, because the employees of those territories are covered in respect of injuries by the appropriate ordinance of the territory concerned. tion is satisfactory. I am glad that the attempt is being made more clearly to define "" dependant"" by the addition of the words "" and includes a person so dependent to whom the employee stands in loco parentis or a person so dependent who stands in loco parentis to the employer "". That is a distinct improvement on the existing legislation, under which the determination of dependency is left to mutual agreement or to arbitration. I , too, support the point which has already been taken by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan), namely, the assurance of those who happen to be injured as the result of an act performed by a Commonwealth public servant. Many hundreds of thousands of men are in the armed forces, there is a considerable number in the Civil Constructional Corps, and there are very many more in the postal service. The total number of (.'mployees of the Commonwealth by whom injury might be caused to a r-itizen must be approximately 1,000,000. [ have already brought to the notice of the Attorney-General and his department the case of a woman who, while travelling along a road, was injured and subsequently lost her right arm as the result of having been struck by a government lorry driven by a member of the Royal Australian Air Force. She has been keenly distressed for many months because of inability to reach agreement in regard to the compensation that is payable to her. It would appear that there is no formal way in which the matter may be concluded except by a lawsuit. For many months, she has suffered considerably from shock. There should be some provision whereby, when injury has been sustained and the liability of the Commonwealth cannot be questioned, the determination of the compensation payable could bo made quickly by reference to a schedule. I realize that it as not possible to deal with such a matter under this bill. I hope, however, that it will be investigated by the Attorney-General, in view of the large number of people who are now in the pay of the Commonwealth Government, many of them in charge of all sorts of vehicles and activities which could cause injury to members of the public. A simple means of reaching agreement would obviate many of the nervous complaints that now result, from accidents. and Minister for External Affairs) [4.48] -The subject raised by the right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat ( Sir Earle Page) and the' honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) is outside the scope of this measure. The Government, however, realizes the importance of it.

113,Dr. Evatt,"It deals with theI n tlie other cases, a group of Australian soldiers, on duty near homes of two Australian citizens, broke into and took possession of those homes, during the prolonged abseiicc of the owners and looted some of the contents thereof and damaged the rest. I offer the following comments on the cases submitted. On the 4th October last, the Prime Minister laid down the following rule: "" I consider the Army cannot escape obligations to civilians when the Army personnel under authority uses Army vehicles and, in defiance of authority, engages in frolics inflicting damage to civil property"". This minute is sound as stating a general principle. I entirely agree with it. 1 also notice that, in the case of a married couple from Western Australia, a view was expressed in relation to looting by members of the armed forces which, while correct from a technical legal point of view, seems to be in entire conflict with the Prime Minister's statement on principle. I also note that on the 12th June, 1943, Senator Collett made a strong comment upon the case where Army authorities frankly agreed that "" beyond doubt acts of gross vandalism -were committed and almost certainly by Army personnel"". general agreement with Senator Collett's comment. The three cases show that similar questions have arisen in various parts of the Commonwealth. In four States of the Commonwealth, personal injur y caused by a motor vehicle has to be made good through insurance whether the person driving the vehicle is doing so with the authority of the owner or not. In three States -Ne w South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-the act binds the Crown. In June, 1043, the New South Wales Premier drew attention to this position. These State acts show that the moral responsibility of an owner in relation to the use of his car is being rapidly overtaken by recognition of a corresponding legal responsibility which can be and is covered by insurance. In other words, responsibility is gradually becoming a recognized risk of the ownership of a chattel (a motor vehicle) which is 60 potent with harm to the citizen. It makes no difference to the injured citizen whether personal injur y or damage to his peraon or property is caused negligently or deliberately or whether the servants of the Crown causing injur y or damage are acting strictly within or well without tlie scope of their usual authority. Recently a case occurred in which the authorities recommended payment to an alien in the Middle East-quit e possibly an unfriendly alien-for damage caused by the looting of the alien's property by Australian soldiers. In my opinion the moral right of Australian citizens should not be less than that sometimes accorded by international comity to the citizens of other countries suffering loss through acts done by our soldiers in excess of authority. 1 do not think there has been sufficient recognition of the fact that, under the law of England {see 49 and 50 Vic. Chapter 38), in the event of damage to property caused by the riotous conduct of persons in a local area, such damage has to be made good to the injured citizen at the expense of the inhabitants of the. area. The principle of this legislation seems to have been adopted by the State of Victoria in the Unlawful Assemblies Act of 1928, section 34. With regard to the international responsibility of Australia in case of riots, mob violence and looting, my special study of this subject is contained in a paper read to the Australian Law Convention of 1935 (see 1935, AustraUan Law Journal,-Supplement, page 9 ) . The Prime Minister's minute suggests a broad principle of practice rather than of technical law. Buti t is a sound principle and in its practical application one is assisted by some of the analogous coses in international law and also in municipal law. I do not think that we should be deterred from doing justice by vague general warnings such as the red tape argument that if we recognize moral responsibility in any case we shall have to do so in all. Everything depends upon the circumstances of each case. In the I am in case of looting, it is obvious that in some cases damage to Australian citizens has been caused, cither through a failure of some section of tlie Australian civil administration to preserve law and order or of some small section of the Australian militar y authorities to control their troops. Why in such cases should the injured citizen be totally -denied any measure of compensation? I think tlie three cases under review are'""oi great importance. No absolute rule can or should be laid down. But the Commonwealth was a pioneer in compensating its citizens for the tortious acts of its servants, although such liability of the Government was always denied in England and the United States. I do not see why the Commonwealth should lug behind others in adopting towards its own citizens that degree of responsibility which is dictated by the circumstances of each case. The Commonwealth should not act shabbily. We spend many millions in providing social services for our citizens. There the primary obligation is not legal, but purely social or moral in character. The expense involved in adopting a rational, humane and reasonable policy towards Australian citizens who arc injured through war activities would be relatively small.. It would be more than balanced by the removal of that, sense of gross injustice sometimes caused by reliance on too rigid a legalism. (Signed) H . V. EVATT, Attorney-General. 11th January, 1944. D r . EVATT P r o p o s e d new section 9A , w h i c h clause 5 proposes to insert, deals w it h in j u r y sustained by an employee w h i l e t r a v e l l in g to or from w o r k . The view taken by the Government is t h a t the sphere of employment of a Comm o n w e a l th employee should extend from the time when lie leaves his home for his work to the time when he returns to his home. For that purpose, there is to be a hypothetical extension of the course of his employment, which is to be from home to home. The Government considers it is right that that should be done. The method by which it is proposed to be done is by treating the accident as if it were-I words-"" an. accident arising out of and in the course of his employment"". is a direction to look back to the provision dealing with accidents arising out of the supplyment. As honourable members will sec, section 9A attracts all the disabling provisions of existing section 9, one of which is that, in the event of serious and wilful misconduct, no compensation is, as a rule, payable. The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition was to use the old New South Wales provision that, an employee sustaining injury while travelling to or from work becomes disentitled to compensation if his injury results from his wilful act or default. That, of course, would include any negligence on his part contributing to the accident. We prefer to say that he shall be excluded only on the same principle applied as if he were at work. If he is guilty of serious and wilful misconduct he will not recover compensation except in the instances mentioned in proposed section 9. Suppose he wasinjured in an accident while riding a motor cycle. It is not proposed that he should be excluded simply on the ground of negligence, but if he exceeded the existing speed limit of 30 miles an hour that, no doubt, might be regarded rs wilful misconduct. His negligence might be so gross, and his conduct so wanton, and so regardless of the safety of himself and others, as to come within the definition of "" serious and wilful misconduct"". However, it is not proposed that his claim for compensation should be defeated merely because he has been guilty of some default. should be further inquiry into the nature of his negligence. Otherwise, he might be excluded from compensation simply for driving on the wrong side of the road, as the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has pointed out. The Dr. Evatt.

I refer to the fact that it is actually a measure validating an action of the Government under the National Security Regulations. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), in his second-reading speech, said that the main purpose of the bill was to suspend the operation of a certain section of the principal act under which pensions payable to widows would move up or down according to movements of the It is proper that there basic wage. I need hardly remind honourable members that this section has already been temporarily suspended by the useor may I say the misuse-of the Government's national emergency powers. When this country first became involved in war, Parliament, following the usual practice, quite rightly delegated to the",28,Vernment To Australian Citizens
114,Mr Spender (Warringah) [4.55],,30,Evatt
115,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"Executive many powers which normally reposed in Parliament alone. It was never intended, however, that those powers should be exercised by the Executive except where an emergency demanded the taking of prompt action in circumstances in which it was not possible to refer the matter to Parliament itself. In this instance, due, I have no doubt, to political pressure from its supporters' and others, the Government used tlie national emergency powers in order ro achieve, temporarily, a result which it now proposes to achieve permanently. I am sure that the Attorney-General himself is not happy about this questionable practice because, when introducing -mother measure designed to achieve a similar purpose, he filled five pages out of six of his second-reading speech in apologizing for the action of the Government. It is not out of place to remind honourable members that the provision which it is now proposed to repeal was inserted in the act at the special request of the present Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). It is true that that provision was inserted in the statute in 1933 and deleted in 1937. It was restored in 1940 at the special request of the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). We welcomed that proposal, for it seemed that it was going to l if t invalid and oldpension. There can be no real security age pensions and widows' pensions out of i he realm of party politics. But, as it seems that, in actual practice, the section can operate only in one direction and not in the other, the Opposition has no objection to its permanent withdrawal. The bill also proposes to repeal section 41, which reads as follows:41. If a person to whom a pension or allowance has been granted is imprisoned, pension or allowance shall not be paid in respect of the period during which she is imprisoned. I have no particular objection to the repeal of that section, but I do point out the rather anomalous effect of its repeal, and I suggest that the Government, if it has not the time now, should take the opportunity to have it examined when the bill reaches the Senate. When this repeal becomes effective, as I have no doubt it will, seeing that the Government has the numbers in this House, we shall have the anomalous position that the pension of a widow entering a mental hospital and, likewise, the pension of dependants will terminate immediately. If she enters a State benevolent home her pension will be reduced from 27s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. But, if she enters one of His Majesty's prisons, there need be no diminution of pension or her dependants' allowances. Surely, the position should be reversed and the pensioner so unfortunate as to qualify for admission to a mental hospital should be. given first consideration, not last. Apart altogether from ethical considerations, and there are some ethical considerations, it is a fact that a prisoner is, at least, provided with food, clothing and shelter, whereas the Master in Lunacy takes great care when a person enters a mental hospital to ensure that some contribution shall be made from the family exchequer to meet the cost of that person's food, clothing and shelter while an inmate. I believe that I speak for the Opposition when I say that we have no objection to the proposed action to preserve to the pensioners the 6d. a week which would otherwise have been deducted from their pensions. On the contrary, I am more concerned about the security necessary to maintain the whole 27s. of the so long as the financing of this social service and other social services is in the nature of a. treasury dole. We need not delve -deeply into history to find illustrations of treasuries finding themselves unable to fulfil their obligations and being compelled to withdraw in whole or in part some of the obligations imposed by statute. For instance, we have the illustration of the serious reduction of the invalid and old-age pension made in this very Parliament in 1931. In New South Wales, the Treasury found it necessary to withhold the statutory contributions to the Public Service Superannuation Fund of that State. There is considerable controversy about that matter at the moment. Likewise, the Treasury of New South Wales found that it was unable to meet in full the subventions that were granted by the Government of New South Wales many years ago for the payment of dues of aged members of friendly societies, and serious reductions were made. Those illustrations prove the reality of my apprehensions. My fears are not a bit allayed by reference to certain aspects of our national finance and contemplation of existing treasury responsibilities. I find, and my authorities are the records of this House, that in this year of grace the obligation of the Commonwealth Treasury in respect of the invalid and old-age pension is about £23,250,000; child endowment, £11,500,000; maternity benefits, about £2,000,000; and widows' pensions, £3,500,000. Unemployment benefit is now on the stocks and it is not unreasonable to include it in my calculations. Even on a basis of 5 per cent, of unemployment-and that is very much below the historical record-the cost of unemployment benefit will be £10,000,000. The estimated cost of the sickness benefit legislation, now before the House, is £8,000,000. Service pensions for "" burnt-out"" soldiers cost about £750,000. Pensions in respect of the old war, to say nothing whatever about this war, will'cost about £8,000,000. member object to that? not at all. I do not suggest that that is a social service, but it is an outgoing from the Treasury in respect of which there is no incoming. I am merely pointing out the commitments. Those figures total £67,000,000. In other words, when this legislation has been passed, in only a few hours if I am anything of Treasury will be faced with the immediate commitment of £67,000,000. And that is not the full story. We have a repatriation commitment in respect of this war, and who can estimate what the figure will be with the very greatly increased numbers of men and women who will be entitled to the repatriation benefits months ago in restoring widows' penassociated with their service? is speaking in support of this measure living. Most people find it difficult to he is making a brilliant speech. Sir FREDERICK: STEWART I sible. At the time, people protested, and support the maintenance of the 27s. propaganda against the reduction apa week pension, and it is because peared in the press. For some strange of that I am pointing out the insecurity reason, the Government itself was held of this method of financing social legislation. Assuming that the new repatriation obligation will be the same as the old-and that is a modest computationwe must add another £8,000,000. There is another £5,000,000-agai n a conservative estimate-for the hospitalization scheme recommended by the Social Security Committee. The Treasury will be obligated to find for social services of the kind I have enumerated a total of £S0,000,000 per annum. The country which has an income adequate to meet that and all other obligations need not tremble at having to find £75,000,000 for this purpose. Rut what is the position? For the ten years before Munich, which is the proper basis for us to take, because after Munich we expended money heavily in preparing for war, Consolidated Revenue averaged £76,000,000 per annum. pare the total social services with the total national income? disagree. The obligation is being placed on the Treasury to meet these demands. Surely, the correct procedure is to compare the standard or normal income of the Treasury with the obligations that are being placed upon it. will never be reduced. These figures indicate clearly that there can be no security so long as the financing of our social service schemes depends upon a competent and willing Treasury. a prophet, the Commonwealth I look forward to the day when the widows of Australia will be able to depend for their maintenance on a much more secure scheme. bill proposes to give legislative effect to the action of the Government some sions to theiT former level after they had been automatically reduced understand how that reduction was pos-",30,Evatt

124,Mr Morgan (Reid) [5.12],"Thisblameworthy, although the law provided that the reduction should automatically take effect. But the Government acted promptly by passing a national security regulation, which immediately abolished the reduction. Peculiarly enough, some of the persons who had criticized the Government for being niggardly and cruel in its attitude towards pensioners, then abused it for using the National Security Act to correct the injustice. That shows how insincere some people are when they criticize the Government. I commend rlic Cabinet for its prompt action. I understand that it obtained advice from the Crown Law authorities that its action was legal. But whether or not the decision was legal, it was the proper one to adopt. The' bill will now place the matter beyond doubt. The matter that gave me cause for concern was the possibility of pensions being reduced after the war. When the opportunity occurs, the Government should grant increased benefits to all pensioners, and provide for them an adequate liviug allowance. Although a sum of £30,000,000 is being credited to the National Welfare Fund each year, I understand that only £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 will be expended from that source during the current financial year. That will leave an ample margin to enable the Government to grant increased benefits to pensioners. Widows should be given economic security. Many of them are mothers with children, and it is degrading and demoralizing for them to be expected to exist on small allowances. The war makes heavy demands upon the public purse, but when that expenditure slackens the Government should improve the condition of widows and dependent children. One of the first steps should be to revise the ""permissible income"" regulations. At present, a pensioner is permitted to earn up to 12s. 6d. a week before her pension is affected. That amount was fixed 30 years ago when conditions were entirely different from what they are now, and when 12s. 6d. a week had a considerably greater purchasing power than it has now. When the Government appealed to all sections of the community to help the war effort, many widows began to serve in various capacities, and I contend that their pension should not be reduced on that account. They should not be penalized for their patriotism. A sympathetic revision of the ""permissible income"" regulations would confer an immediate benefit on widows. If the Government does not desire to make the necessary provision in this bill, the passing of a national security regulation could achieve the desired end, because the war effort is obviously involved. Probably at the end of this week, the Parliament will go into recess for several months. The Minister representing the Minister for Social Services (Senator Fraser) is sympathetic to the needs of widows, and I hope that he will prevail upon his colleagues to revise the "" permissible income"" regulations. Pensions are affected in another way. If a pensioner accumulates a certain amount of capital, his pension is reduced. Some pensioners desire to purchase their own homes. If they occupy their own dwellings, their pensions are not affected. Some of them have the necessary purchase money at present, but finding it impossible to invest it in a home, they arc obliged to rent premises. Their savings are being frittered away. orable member is digressing from the bill. vests the money in war bonds instead of using it to purchase a home, he is assisting the war effort, but his pension is affected. The Minister for Social Services should have discretion in matters of this nature to rule that a pension shall not be reduced when the recipient has invested money in war bonds.

129,Mr Eyan,"Surely, that is the pursary. that the Government, hy using the National Security Act, and, without seeking the authority of Parliament, can come to a decision that has such a considerable effect upon the finances of the country. The honourable member for Parramatta dealt with this point so I shall not enlarge upon it.. I urge the Government, however, to give attention to two other aspects of this subject. Every honourable member must realize that the amount of pension payable to a widow is meagre, the maximum rate being only f l 7s. a week. In addition, 5s. a week is payable in respect of each dependent child. A widow is also permitted to earn up to 12s. 6d. a week. So a widow with one child, earning the maximum permissible amount, has an income of only £2 4s. 6d. a week. No one will believe that a widow in such circumstances finds life, in any way easy. By the time she has provided a roof for herself and her child, and also nourishment and clothing, she can have very little left. I realize that an increase of the basic rate of pension would involve a large expenditure, because the present basic rate is identical with the basic rate for old-age and invalid pensioners and an increase in respect of one class would necessarily involve an increase in respect of the others. The Government is finding it difficult to provide money for war purposes, so a general increase of the pension rate is hardly feasible. I urge, however, that the amount of permissible income should be increased. In New Zealand, widows are permitted tc earn £1 10s. a week, or £78 a year. The basic rate of pension is also higher in the sister dominion. The Commonwealth Government would not be involved in any greater expenditure if it increased the amount that widows may earn, and in the interests of the widows and their dependent children, I urge the Government to do so. The bill provides that the Commissioner shall have a discretion in regard to the portion of a pension that shall be payable for the benefit of children whose widowed mothers are undergoing terms of imprisonment. This causes me to urge the Government to liberalize the conditions applicable to children whose widowed, mothers are in benevolent asylums or mental homes. A widow in a benevolent home is allowed to receive up to £34 14s. per annum in pension. It is anomalous, therefore, that a widow in a mental asylum is not entitled to any payment whatsoever. Moreover, the Master in Lunacy may call upon, the members of her family to contribute to her upkeep if they are in a financial position to do so. I urge that in such cases the unfortunate children of such widows should be given greater consideration. Their mothers are in the mental asylums through no fault of their own, and I ask that the Commissioner be given a discretion to make payments in aid of the children. If a discretionary oower is justified in the circumstances set out in the bill, it is surely justified in the circumstances I have outlined. I hope the Government will sympathetically consider these submissions. port the bill, the purpose of which is to prevent the reduction of the rate of tbe pension. In view of remarks that have been made in this House recently concerning the necessity to encourage larger families in this country, we should take every practicable step to remove the fears which hinder people from having larger families. In my first speech in this chamber I stressed the importance of an increase of the birth-rate, and said that two factors which militated greatly against large families were the fear of unemployment and the fear that should the breadwinner of the family die, his dependants may be left unprovided for. In my opinion, these fears very seriously affect the size of families, and we should do anything that we can do to reduce the sense of insecurity under which the mass of the people labour in this regard. It should not be necessary for a widow with dependent children to go out to work, but as we are not yet providing such widows with incomes adequate for their needs and the needs of their children, we should at least increase the amount of income which widows with dependent children may earn.

I support this bill because it will be of some slight assistance which may be urged in its favour if the to widows, but I urge the Government to take the earliest opportunity to provide increased pensions for widows, and to increase the amount of income they may earn in order to support themselves and their children. In one respect this bill is somewhat exceptional, for it seeks to put into proper legislative form something that has already been done under National Security Eegulations. I regret that what is being done now has not been done much more frequently in respect of other matters. One cannot help feeling that, had the Government run the gauntlet of criticism in this Parliament, with the delays and deliberation which necessarily are incidental to the passage of a bill through its first, second and third readings, as well as its consideration in committee, certain proposals that are now law and command the obedience of the ordinary citizen outside this House would never have survived the criticism which unquestionably would have been levelled against them, and consequently would not have become law. Nevertheless, I entirely commend the Government for the proposals which it has embodied in this measure. I commend it the more for having done by regulation what, in a manner of speaking, is now being ratified. I recall that on one occasion I had to defend the Government before an assembly of people in consequence of the (reduction of the invalid and old-age pension and, incidentally, the widows' pension-becaus e these are sister measures. The ground of my defence was that, if fluctuation of benefits in accordance with variations of the cost of living are defensible, then the Government cannot be challenged as being guilty of an indefensible act when the burden .changes, any more than when the benefit changes; that is to say, it is no more responsible for the reduction of the pension by reason of the authoritative determination that the cost of living has been reduced, than it is when the cost of living increases and the pension accordingly rises. As a matter of fact, although adjustment of the cost of living provision was .the work, not of a Labour government, but of another government, there is something pension is itself adequate and reasonable. I i i connection with the present bill, there is much in the contention of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Eyan) that the measure of relief given to the widow with dependants is inadequate and somewhat niggardly. I agree with that. Indeed, so far as I am permitted to refer to the subject Fy way of illustration, I should say that that applies also to pensions generally; that is to say,, we cannot argue that the pensions whicb are within the jurisdiction of this Parliament are adequate to the needs of the recipients. Apparently, however, they are the best that we can provide at the present time, concurrently with our enthusiastic conduct of a total war. But that does not make them adequate. I hope that the time is not far distant when the hope expressed by the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Morgan) and other honourable members will be realized -that more adequate pensions will be paid to those deserving members of our society who need them most. After all, in any order of society in which our lot may be cast, there will always be some who will necessarily be dependent for their support upon the organization of society; there will always be the sick and the invalid; fewer in numbers, we hope, as the new order prevails. There will always be the poor. 'There is scriptural warrant for the belief that the poor will always be with us. Certainly the widow and dependent children will always be an integral part of society, just as the sick and the invalid will always be with us in greater ox less degree. The care of these, in my view, will always be a first charge on organized society. If the pension were adequateI consider that, at the moment, it is not, although I am bound to admit that it is better than it has ever been under any other governmentI should say that cost-of-living adjustments were quite justifiable and-, arguably, correct. In those circumstances, we would have to put up with the reduction when the",34,Evatt

This bill also proposes to validate-eve n if the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) disputes the correctness of that term-the action of the Executive, under the National Security Regulations, in suspending the operation of that provision which increased or reduced pensions in accordance with the rise' or fall of the cost of living. As I said before, I have no serious objection to the effect of the step whicli was taken by the Government, though I again record my discontent with the use of emergency powers for non-emergency reasons. It is proposed to repeal section 51 of the act, which provides that when a person is convicted in any court of drunkenness, or of any offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than one month, then, in addition to any other punishment imposed, the Commissioner for Pensions may cause the pensioner to forfeit one month's pension. Another clause is substituted for it. No reference was made to this provision by the committee (Consideration of Minister in his second-reading speech, and it raises some doubt whether this clause, which takes away from the Commissioner power to act in the case of drunkenness, was deliberate. I expect to be reminded that in another clause the Commissioner has the right to withhold a part or the whole of the pension from an unworthy person, and that that procommittee (Consideration revision gives him adequate discretion. I have no objection to allowing a pension to be paid to some person on behalf of an invalid pensioner at the discretion of the Deputy Director of Social Services, but again I draw attention to an anomaly in the case of inmates of a. mental hospital. The act. now provides that upon a pensioner entering a mental hospital his pension shall cease, and shall not be restored until he is discharged. Several reasons have been advanced why this provision cannot be repealed. It has been said that ever since the act was passed, in 1908 it has contained this provision. That is true, but that is no reason why the anomaly should be perpetuated. It has been said that the State governThe circumstances ments have always been responsible for maintaining inmates of mental hospitals, and that the responsibility should not be lifted from them, but the same might be said about widows' pensions. The State governments used to be responsible for the maintenance of indigent widows. It might also be said of the Commonwealth child endowment scheme, and of the provision passed by this Parliament a few months ago rendering the Commonwealth liable for the payment of the funeral expenses of indigent old-age pensioners. It may be said that the provision cannot be repealed because the Minister for Social Services, in 1939, refused a similar request by the Premier of New South Wales.",35,Evatt
134,Motion (By Dr. Evatt) Agreed To,,36,Evatt
135,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"This excuse has a somewhat personal implication, because I was Minister for Social Services on that occasion, and I believe that it is historically true that, when the request was made by the Premier of New South Wales, 1 approved the recommendation that we were not prepared to reopen the . old invalid and old-age legislation in order ro deal with that particular phase. It was also said that to grant to inmates of mental hospitals the pension on the same basis as that on which it was granted to inmates of other hospitals would cost about £1,250,000. That is not ii reason against my proposal. Finally, another argument raised is that the inmate of a mental hospital is not mentally competent to handle the whole or any part of a pension. In answer to that, I direct attention to the fact rhat it is proposed in this very bill that, when a pensioner becomes an inmate of a prison, and, therefore, practically incompetent to handle a pension, the pension, or a part of the pension shall, at the direction of the Director-General of Social Services, be paid, not to him, but to some person nominated on behalf of his dependants. I see no reason why that principle should not apply to inmates of mental hospitals. I urge, as I have urged many times since 1939, that this blot on our pensions law be removed and that the person unfortunate enough to enter a mental hospital be placed on exactly the same plane as a person unfortunate enough to enter an ordinary hospital. gratulate the Government on the introduction of this measure, because I was responsible in the last Parliament for drawing the attention to the anomalies which this bill proposes to remove. Ha*. EVATT -The honourable member was largely responsible for this legislation. so. Only recently I had occasion to approach the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales about two cancellations of pensions. The pension of one lady who was charged with having taken some articles was cancelled. She is more than 60 years of age and had never been in trouble before in her life. The magistrate took such a lenient view of her offence that he only placed her on bond, but the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions took such a harsh view that he cancelled her pension and thereby imposed a fine of £1 7s. a week. A man who got drunk at Christmas time had his pension cancelled. Whilst the amendment of section 51 is satisfactory, I think that section 52 should be deleted or added to. The addition that I would suggest, if the Government be not agreeable to the deletion of the section, is that the pensioner concerned should have the right of appeal to the Minister against any decision made under the section by the deputy commissioner. The section reads52. Notwithstanding that a pensioner has not been convicted of drunkenness, a Registrar may, and, if so requested by the Deputy Commissioner, shall at any time summon any pensioner to appear before a Magistrate to show cause why his pension should not be cancelled, reduced, or suspended for a time on account of his drunken, intemperate or disreputable habits, and at the time and place mentioned in the summons the Magistrate may, if he thinks f it , recommend to the Deputy Commissioner the cancellation, reduction or suspension of the pension. The Deputy Commissioner shall, if he thinks fit, cancel, reduce, or suspend the pension accordingly. That gives wide powers to the deputy commissioner to cancel a person's pension, even though a conviction has not been entered against the person. That power should either be removed or it should be subject to appeal to the Minister. I also direct the attention of the Government to the treatment of inmates of mental hospitals. Instead of denying pensions to the inmates of mental hospitals I think that at least 5s. or 10s. a week should be placed in a trust fund to be drawn on by the pensioner in the event of his recovering and being discharged from the mental hospital. That is the minimum consideration that those people should receive. WhatI think is more fitting, is that the dependants of those persons should be placed on the same footing as that on which this bill proposes to place the dependants of persons who are imprisoned. Those dependants are required to expend money to provide tlieir mentally afflicted relatives with",36,Evatt

I hope that the Minister for Social Services will examine section 52 with a view to either its deletion or its improvement by providing the right of appeal to the Minister against decisions of the deputy commissioner. I deal with the actual provisions of the bill, there are some remarks of a general -character which I intend to make regarding the old-age pension. We are accustomed to considering from time to time in this House amending bills in respect of pensioners, but it is a long time since there has been any general debate on pensions. Honourable members no doubt have either read or glanced at the Beveridge Report recently published in England. I refer them to the opening paragraphs dealing with old-age _ pensioners. Sir William Beveridge saidThe problem of the nature and extent of the provision to be made for old age is the most important and in some ways the most difficult of all the problems of social security. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. ability to earn. Age exceeds in importance all other causes of such inability. In the year immediately preceding the outbreak of war there were in Australia 232,000 old-age pensioners, 44,200 unemployed, and 88,000 invalid pensioners. Since then, other classes of pensioner have been included in our pensions scheme, including widows, but they constitute a comparatively small number. The fact remains that of our population dependent on pensions, old-age pensioners outnumbered, by far all other persons benefiting from Commonwealth pensions schemes -Will the honourable member connect all The cost of pensions compared with the cost of other forms of social security must inevitably increase in proportion to the population. Although the trends of population are well known to honourable members. I should like briefly to refer to them. A3 time passes, more and more people will become eligible for old-age pensions. ' I refer to the position in the United Kingdom where the trends are almost exactly the same as they are in Australia. In the United Kingdom in 1901, the working population between the ages of 15 and 65 years constituted 61 per cent, of the total population, and 6.2 per cent, of men and women were over the ages of 65 years and 60 years, respectively. Thirty years later, the working population formed 66.2 per cent, of the total population, but persons eligible for old-age pensions had increased to 9.6 per cent, of the population. In 1941, the working population had not -Before altered greatly, being 67.5 per cent, of the total population, but persons over 65 years of age had increased to 12 per cent, of the population. According to estimates the working population will remain the same in 1961, at 65 per cent, of the total population, but the old-age group will rise to 17.1 per cent. Expressed in another form, ten people had the burden of maintaining one pensioner in 1901; seven persons maintained one pensioner in 1931; five and a half persons maintained one pensioner in 1941; and four persons will support one pensioner in 1961. Similar figures apply to this country. member consider that people live too long? names, I think that politically a great many do. In Australia in 1931, the old-age group formed 6.1 per cent, of our population. Five years later it had risen to 7 per cent. Three years ago the figure was 8.5 per cent. The burden of maintaining one old-age pensioner in 1926 fell on nine people, whereas in 194.1 it fell on 7.5 people. As time passes fewer and fewer of our people will have to support an increasing number of old-age pensioners. that he has said to date with the contents of the bill?",37,Evatt

First, provision for old age must be satisfactory, otherwise pensioners will undoubtedly suffer. All honourable members will agree on that point, and believe that the scale of pension, which is fairly low, should be raised. Secondly, the cost of old-age pensions is extremely heavy. Every shilling added to the old-age pension increases the Commonwealth 'liability by £700,000 a year. Therefore, any substantial increase of the rate of pensions will add a great burden to our finances. us hundreds of millions of pounds. porary; our old-age pensioners, I am afraid, will always be with us. The facts that I have outlined emphasize that old-age pensions should be placed upon a basis far sounder and stronger than the present one. To-day we are financing old-age pensions from a very precarious source, namely, proceeds of the taxation of incomes. As our incomes fall, so taxation receipts will barely prove sufficient to carry this increasing liability. The"" means test"" restricts the number of old-age pensioners. If an aged person has means exceeding the statutory exemption, he is ineligible for benefits. In principle and in' practice the "" means test"" is wrong. It necessitates a far-reaching investigation of one's private affairs, and most people strongly resent that inquiry. Secondly, it gives rise to anomalies tliat should be abolished. I look forward to the time when the old age pensions will be placed on a sound basis, namely, a contribution which every one will make from the time he begins work until he becomes eligible for a pension. contribution all their lives by way of taxation ? sense. Unless a contributory scheme is introduced, old-age pensions will never be placed upon a proper basis. Year after year Parliament amends the In valid and Old-age Pensions Act, but does not touch the principle upon which the legislation is based. We have not achieved the desirable objective of placing the whole scheme on a sound financial basis. The present method of financing the scheme is inimical to thrift. A person should be allowed to save money during his working life, and still enjoy a pension. Under present conditions, if he possesses more than a certain sum of money, he is not eligible to receive this benefit. Therefore, throughout his working life he is discouraged from practising thrift. That is an anomaly of the present system. The rate of pension can never be properly settled until every one contributes such sums as will enable the country to support the payment of an increased 'benefit, without which no old age pensioners can live under reasonable conditions. Those are the general remarks that I desire to make on this bill. 1 should now like to refer to two anomalies which are not contained in the bill, but which should be dealt with by amendments. The first is the property qualification. member is entitled to discuss only such matter as is contained in the bill, and not what ought to be in the measure. to offer a suggestion, even if the bill does not deal with that particular matter. gentleman would be out of order if he did so. from the standpoint of age, are eligible for the old-age pension are not entitled to receive it. The bilT dealing with unemployment and sickness benefits departs from the ordinary principle that was hitherto followed. Eligibility will rest not upon the basis of property but upon the basis of income. I cite an instance, to illustrate my contention. A man aged 79 and his wife aged 72 are not considered eligible for the old-age pension because the value of their property is said to exceed the statutory amount. They are said to own £1,500 worth of property, although it is not worth anything like that amount to-day.",38,Evatt

If the Government is unable to accept that suggestion I ask it to consider, as an alternative, the incorporation of a clause of the dragnet type such as is in operation in New Zealand, under which the Pensions Commissioner of that Dominion can deal with special cases that are not covered by the existing law. That regulation reads(1) The Commission may in its discretion Owing to the influence and activity of grant a special benefit under this Part of honourable members of the Labour party this Act on account of hardship to any person who satisfies the following conditions, during the last three or four years an nnmcly:(a) Tliat by reason of age, or of physical the pensions rate. or mental disability, or of domestic general elections the pension rate was circumstances, or for any other reason, he is unable to earn a £1 a week.

It is, in fact, the bare minimum which will allow pensioners to eke out an existence. Pensioners' organizations are advocating an increase of the pension to £2 a week, which would be little euough. We all realize that the Government is faced with a difficult problem in financing the war, but nevertheless I hope that it, will give sympathetic consideration to the request, which are being made to it to increase the pension rate. Such an increase is implicit in our national welfare scheme and also in the Atlantic Charter. One of the four freedoms for which we are fighting is freedom from want. Under present, conditions, pensioners are not free from that fear. I hope, therefore, that the Government will do something to reduce the fears of many pensioners in our midst. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) suggested that the rate of pensions could be increased if the contributory principle could be applied to our pensions system. T disagree with that method. I suggest as an immediate means of increasing the income of pensioners that the maximum amount of permissible income, which at present is i2s. 6d. a week, should be increased. Many pensioners are able to earn more than they are earning, and they would prefer to wear out rather than rust out. No one would be injured if they were allowed to earn more than the amount at present prescribed. I suggest, also, for early consideration, that steps be taken to apply a universal superannuation scheme to the workers in private industry. This procedure has been adopted in New Zealand, where private employers are required to set aside a certain proportion of their profits to ensure economic security to their employees on their retirement. Under such a scheme the workers receive a pension as a right and not as a charity. At one stage the Government was inclined to adopt a proposal for the limitation of war-time profits. I suggest that it consider carefully the desirability inmate of an asylum for the insane or a of taking steps, without further delay, to oblige private employers to set aside a proportion of their profits in order to establish superannuation funds for their employees. The Government provides for the superannuation of its servants, and I see no reason why private employers should not be required to do so. A comprehensive measure for the provision of social security on a much bigger scale than anything attempted so far should be introduced without delay. Travelling facilities should be provided for invalid and old-age pensioners. able member must confine his remarks to the bill. the recess the Government will consider in detail ways and means of assisting the workers to obtain a greater degree of economic security. At present, wage earners see ahead of them very little else than poverty, anxiety, economic insecurity, ill health and poor housing. The Government, should take immediate steps to enable the people of this country to grow old gracefully. In their declining years the people of the Australian community should be in a position to enjoy more of the blessings that the Almighty has conferred' upon us than have hitherto been available to them., so that they could give their latter years to such public service as is commensurate with their strength and experience. I am sure that if our older people were in a sufficiently stable financial position they would be able to do a great deal to help the younger generation to avoid the pitfalls they themselves have encountered.

In other words, if the mental incapacity continued for 54 weeks and the pensioner was then released he would be entitled' to only four weeks of pension. I am asking that he be treated not less favourably than pensioners committed to prison. A discretion has now been given to the commissioner or a deputy commissioner to pay the whole or any portion of a suspended pension to the wife or child of the imprisoned pensioner, or to some other person approved by the Commissioner for the benefit of dependants of the pensioner. The purpose of the provision is, of course, that the dependants of imprisoned pensioners shall not be required, to suffer because a pensioner has been sent to prison. Surely if tbe benevolence of this chamber is sufficiently great to cause it to contemplate such a case, it ought to be of such an order as to embrace a case of the kind that I am now advocating. Several reasons have been given for the rejection of the proposal. I beg the tolerance of the House while I recapitulate them. It was urged, and may be urged again, that there has never been any provision for the payment of pensions to inmates of mental hospitals. reason for maintaining their exclusion. It has also been stated that the granting of this concession would involve an additional expenditure of £1,250,000. That is substantially true. According to official records, there are approximately 24,000 inmates of mental hospitals in all States, and it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of them would , be able to qualify under the income and property provisions for an invalid or an old-age pension. That may be. But if cost be a reasonable excuse for declining to make further amendments to the pensions law, the pension might never have been increased from the original rate of 10s., and the cost to the Treasury would not then have been increased from the very few millions of the early years of the operation of the system from 1908. It is claimed that the State governments have always been responsible for the care of mentally deficient persons, and, therefore, that condition should remain. Sir Frederick Slrwart. Equally, the State governments were responsible for child endowment, widows' pensions, and payment of the cost of the funerals of indigent old-age pensioners. But quite recently and rightlyI supported the proposals-thi s Parliament assumed responsibility in each of those realms; therefore, that argument should not deter us from proceeding a step further in this direction. It has been said, and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be repeated, that a request for the re-opening of the invalid and old-age pensions legislation, in order that the exclusion of mentally afflicted persons might be removed, made by the Premier of New South Wales in 1939, was refused by the then Minister for Social Services. It will be pointed out with a great deal of gusto that that Minister was the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). know that it is,, and I am "" beating the right honourable gentleman to it "" . But there is quite a difference between reopening a statute for the correction of a minor detail, and seriously contemplating that detail when the bill is on the That is hardly a tenable table. In any event, I am the last to claim that in the years during which I administered the Department of Social ServicesI was impeccable as to sins of omission or commission. I shall gladly make amends to-night for any dereliction of duty on that account. Another argument is that mentally afflicted persons are not competent to handle money; therefore, this concession of a pension to them is not practicable. How untenable that is, is demonstrated by the statute itself. Already the principal act contains provision for payment to nominated delegates of aborigines, infirm persons, and even reckless and unworthy persons who cannot be trusted to handle their own pensions. Under an amendment that was passed not many minutes ago, the pension is to be payable to the nominated delegate of a pensioner who has been sent to prison. With these examples before us how can we accept the plea that the payment of pensions to mentally afflicted persons cannot be contemplated",41,Evatt
170,Dr. Evatt,That is purely historical.,42,Evatt
171,Sir Frederick Stewart,"Ibecause they might not be capable of handling their own money?

That is identical with the case of a civil prisoner. A mentally afflicted person is more entitled to consideration and sympathy than is one who has so offended against the law as to be sent to prison. But quite apart from ethical considerations, a consideration on this issue is that guests of His Majesty in a prison are at least provided with board_and lodging. We know that the Master-in Lunacy is insistent that the family of a mental patient shall disgorge a portion of its financial resources in order to pay for his board and lodging. Why we should discriminate against the inmate of a mental hospital and in favour 'of an inmate of a prison is beyond my comprehension. I urge the Attorney-General, even now, to accept the amendment. and Minister for External Affairs) [8.38] -The Government cannot accept the amendment. In saying that, I am not desirous of closing the door against full vernment, to prejudice the further conconsideration of the matter whicli the sideration of this question. I express no honourable member has raised. The bill opinion upon it. I should have thought deals with specified anomalies which, it that the better way of dealing with it is considered, require immediate attenwould be by action designed to ensure tion. The time is not appropriate to deal the best possible management of menwith every anomaly in tlie invalid and tal hospitals, or the granting of a old-age pensions system. With regard to subsidy to them. However, that may not the specific matter which the honourable be the view finally accepted. To ask gentleman has raised, I handed to him, me, in the absence of the Treasurer ( Mr before the dinner adjournment, this Chifley), who is ill , to consent to an noteSection 45 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act That is the section which the honourable open to him, if he so wishes, to raise the gentleman wishes to repealprovides for the suspension of pension when n pensioner is admitted to a hospital for the it will receive the attention of the Goinsane, and no further payment is made until his discharge, when he may be paid not more than four weeks' pension in respect of the period during which he was an inmate. Representations have been made at various .times by State governments and other persons with a view to the payment of pensions in respect of pensioners admitted to mental hospitals, but these requests have been refused, the chief reason being that the maintenance and care of mentally afflicted persons in State institutions is the responsibility of the State Government. Another reason for declining to pay pensions to such inmates is No t to the prisoner. that most of these people would not be f it to handle money and the pension would, therefore, have to be paid to the authorities of the institution on their behalf, with the result that the. pensioners themselves would not necessarily derive any personal benefit from the payments, which would merely provide a certain amount of financial relief to the States in respect of these inmates. The Premier of New South Wales made representations in this regard in 1039, when the then Minister( Sir Frederick Stewart) approved of a recommendation that the request be not granted. It is estimated that there are approximately 2,400 invalid and old-age pensioners and expensioners in State mental hospitals. If pensions were paid to such persons at normal rates, as in the case of pensioners admitted to ordinary hospitals, the liability would be £1.08,000 per annum. If , however, a main tenance payment only at the rate of 17s. Cd. a week were made in respect of such persons, the cost would be £109,000 per annum. The Commonwealth Year-Book for 1941 indicates that there are approximately 27,000 persons in mental hospitals throughout Australia. Not all of these persons would be eligible for pensions, but it is safe to say that two-thirds of the number-18,000-woul d qualify. Tlie cost of paying f u l l pensions to these persons would be £1,250,000 per annum. I do not wish, on behalf of the Goadditional payment of £1,250,000 on this account is not right.

I cannot understand why additional benefits are to be given to the dependants of prisoners, and not to these other persons, who are more worthy of them in every way. If the extra cost be the consideration which weighs with the Government, why are additional benefits to be given to prisoners? in their case would not amount to £20,000 a year. wishes to be just and reasonable, why does it not consent to the pension being given to the inmates of benevolent homes, the number of whom is not very large? Why, above all, give it to the dependants of prisoners? I hope that the Government will rectify what appears to be a very grave injustice. Minister for Labour and National Service) [8.44] -The case has been grossly exaggerated, probably unconsciously, and has not been based on the facts. In order to draw comparisons, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) mentioned a number of persons ; he said that all sorts of concessions they ever did before. were given to drunkards and to every other class except the inmates of mental institutions. That is not a fact. A person who is an habitual drunkard does not receive the money; the payment is suspended until he enters an institution, when payment is made to the institution, aud he receives a portion of it. The question is not one of payment to a person who is insane, or who is in gaol. The whole system involves looking after dependants. If a man is declared insane, and enters a mental home, his wife, for the purposes of the Widows' Pensions Act, is immediately declared a widow. She receives the widow's pension and the first child of the marriage, who is unendowed, receives 5s. a week. The remaining children receive the child endowment. The wife is treated, in fact, as if she were a widow. If a man goes to a mental hospital, the whole or a part of his pension may be paid to hie wife and children. As I have said, the man who goes to gaol does not receive a pension, but his wife and children, if they are in necessitous circumstances, may receive the whole or a part of his pension. One honourable member referred to the possible hardship endured by an old couple on the landThat matter has been thoroughly gone into, and there is no obstacle in the way of the couple drawing a full pension. The alleged inconsistencies to which honourable members have referred have been grossly exaggerated. to persons in 'benevolent homes? denied to such persons. The last time we amended the act we removed a blot which the previous Government had left behind. Pensions are now paid to persons in benevolent homes. Thousands of persons who had entered such homes before the amendment of the act were, for a long time, denied the right to draw pensions, so that at the same table there were some drawing pensions and other? who were entirely dependent upon the charity of the institution. That has now been remedied, and they all draw a pension. A part of the pension is devoted to the maintenance of the inmate, and a part is paid to him as pocket money. Inmates now receive more pocket money than amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) proposes to go farther than does the bill. The situation which he proposes to remedy will probably be dealt with by legislation that will be brought down later. We are making progress, and, in the meantime, I think, the bill might be accepted as it is. It is not perfect, but ir goes a long way in the direction of giving justice to a section of the community not previously catered for. It seems clear that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) and the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) are at variance regarding the principle embodied in the bill. When the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was speaking",43,Evatt

Then the Minister for Labour and National Service said that the wives of men in mental hospitals were paid a widow's pension. That is true, but what happens in respect of dependants other than wives and children? They are not provided for atall. Moreover, when a woman becomes an inmate of a mental hospital, no pension is payable to her husband in respect of her. ro keep her husband. knows that, for the purpose of pensions legislation, the income of one spouse is regarded as the income of both. If the amendment of the honourable member for l arramatta be accepted, it will make proJ vision for persons not otherwise provided for. matter; it is the principle that is important. matta) [8.54] I remind honourable members that, according to this bill, inmates of mental hospitals will receive no pensions. It is true that, under the Widows' Pensions Act, the wife of a man in a mental hospital will be treated as if she were a widow, and will be able to draw a widow's pension. A male inmate, however, can receive no pension, and a female inmate, who was drawing a pension before entering the institution will immediately lose her pension, and will not be able to draw it again until she is released. Moreover, it would be a waste of time for any inmate of such an institution to apply for a pension. A pensioner who goes to gaol may have his pension paid to' a delegate on behalf of his wife, and, in addition, the wife and first child may also receive a pension. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) said that if a pensioner goes into a mental hospital, his wife receives a widow's pension. That is true, and I am glad it is so; but it is also true that if the pensioner goes I'll-bar or wives who are put in mental to gaol, instead of to a mental hospital, his wife and child not only retain their own pensions, but they can also receive the whole or a part of the husband's pension. Why there should be this differentiation in treatment I do not know. A physically afflicted person may go into an ordinary hospital without prejudicing his right to draw a pension, or the right of his dependants to draw allowances, but when a mentally afflicted person goes into a mental hospital his pension immediately ceases. That is the anomaly which my amendment seeks to correct. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) said that we should accept an assurance that the matter would be looked into. A few months ago I made the same plea as I am making now, aud it was suggested that if we deferred our representations something would be done. I now maintain that the time has arrived for such action. who has taken a great interest in old-age and invalid pensions, I know that much hardship is inflicted on the relatives of The amount involved does not pensioners, who, because they become inmates of mental hospitals, lose their pensions. However, the pensioner who enters an old men's home has his pension paid. The Master in Lunacy becomes the custodian of any assets the pensioner may have. If the relatives of that former pensioner cannot pay the cost of his upkeep, the Master in Lunacy is entitled to levy upon his assets, and on his death, when his widow is unable to meet the payments, her home can be sold up to pay thai liability. I consider that the Minister in charge of the bill should give due consideration to that aspect. I have often wondered why there is discrimination in favour of people in homes for the aged and patients in ordinary hospitals as against pensioners admitted to mental institutions. there is legislation discriminating in favour of people in prisons. The legislation was passed to-night. about that aspect.

No doubt the Government realizes that. But it may have overlooked the law of diminishing returns. If taxation is made so heavy, the time will come when returns from it will fall short of estimates. The Government must carefully watch that, and amend the law if it discovers that it has made a mistake. I hope that the Commissioner of Taxation will exercise his discretionary power by declaring that children's tickets shall not be subject to tax. If that be done, revenue will not be seriously affected. I hope that the bill does not contain a retrospective provision, although I notice a reference to retrospectivity, evidently relating to the refund of overpayments by persons subject to this tax. I urge the Government to exclude from the operation of this bill animal sanctuaries which can be included in the generic title of amusement parks. They should definitely be declared educational. Some of them, like Koala Park in New South Wales and the Colin McKenzie animal sanctuary at Healesville, Victoria, charge an admission fee to provide for their upkeep, but they should not be subiect to this bill. If they are, the Parliament will be unnecessarily taxing something that should be supported by the nation. Honourable members will be pleased to see that charitable, patriotic, and educational entertainments will be exempt. The status quo will be preserved in those cases.

Although that sanctuary is not controlled by the State Government or by some scientific or research society, the proprietor, Mr Burnett, is a scientist and possibly one of the greatest authorities in Australia on the life and habits of the koala. Whilst he is conducting Koala Park as a commercial proposition, it does not come within the category of some of the business activities about which we heard so much last week when we discussed the taxing of trusts and combines.

What I. have said is indicative of certain prac2-£ minutes is spent in some of the other tical difficulties that may arise in the administration of this measure. The effect of these provisions on enterproved conclusively that a lower price tainments of the Luna Park type also deserves consideration. what happens at such entertainments. Aman may take his nieces or his nephews or other friends to such an entertainment and spend quite a sum of money in treating them to rides on "" the big dipper "" or visits to side-shows. It seems to me that this measure has been drafted without proper regard to the advantages of the present system of taxing such expenditure. Some years ago an agreement was reached between the Luna Park organizations and the taxation authorities under which it was assumed that one patron in five paid for visits to more than normal attendances, partly because of one side-show, and tax was collected on that basis. The system has worked quite smoothly. If the Government desires to legalize that arrangement it can do so without imposing an additional tax. At present the management is collecting Id. in tax on each 6d. ticket; but under the provisions of this bill it will collect 2d. of national security regulations in saying on each 6d. ticket. That may have the effect of reducing patronage at these entertainments and consequently of reducing the revenue of the Government from taxation. Probably 95 per cent, of the shareholders of such companies are at present paying the maximum rate of tax of 183. 6d. in the £1. Any diminution of profits from these entertainments is not likely to affect those shareholders very greatly, but it may substantially reduce the tax revenue. A patron may decide, for example, that whilst he would spend 2s. 4d. on visits to four side-shows at 7d. each, he will visit only three sideshows if the price be 8d. each. It has been the experience of people associated with the management of these intertainment parks that an increase of charges of each side-show results in a reduction of turnover. The management of Sydney Luna Park decided, originally, to charge 9d. for each side-show and it found tliat patronage was not strong; subsequently it reduced the charge to 6d. and a remarkable improvement occurred at once in attendance and turnover. I am told that a ride on "" the big dipper "" Mr Halt. occupies only 40 seconds, and that only side-shows. At 9d. a time this is expensive entertainment. The management for the side-shows was definitely more We all know profitable. The more profitable these entertainments are for the management the more profitable, obviously, they are for the taxation authorities. I believe that the managements of these entertainment parks are quite sincere in their opinion that a higher tax on the admission tickets to side-shows will result in a definite reduction of revenue to the Government. The Treasurer may be prepared to take that risk, but he is proposing to take it at a most inopportune time. During the last year or two these entertainment parks have attracted abthe greater volume of spending power in the hands of the Australian people, and partly because of the presence in our capital cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, of large numbers of Australian and Allied service personnel. I do not believe that I shall commit a breach that the patronage of these entertainment parks by Allied servicemen is diminishing. That is certainly evident in Melbourne, and it is becoming increasingly noticeable in Sydney. Attendance at these parks is affected, also, by seasonal conditions. Normally, the season in Melbourne ends about the middle of May. It may, perhaps, end sooner this year owing to the early Easter. The Sydney season may last a fortnight longer. Towards the end of the season, attendances diminish partly because the novelty of the entertainment is not so great, and partly because seasonal conditions are not so conducive to outdoor pleasure. If the Government obliges the management of these entertainments to increase the charges at this period of the year, it will undoubtedly cause a reduction of support, and that will mean. a reduction of taxation receipts. It would be far better, I suggest, to defer any such action. Let the present season end under existing conditions, and if it is tnought desirable, apply the new charges when the new season opens. MT. CALWELL -The main purpose of this measure is to deal with night clubs; the entertainment parks are only a minor consideration. this measure is brought into force at once, a reduction of taxation revenue will occur, and that is something that the Treasurer wishes to avoid. Apart altogether from the points that I have been making, I urge that nothing be done that will impose additional tax on the tickets issued to children who attend Luna Parks and other similar entertainments. If a penny tax is placed on every 3d., it will undoubtedly affect the entertainment of children. from children. a tax should be imposed on the spendings of children at these entertainments, seeing that no tax is to be imposed on 6d. tickets for admission to picture shows. Honourable members know very well what happens with children. They may be given Is. or 2s. to spend at Luna Park and they desire to buy as many rides as possible on the merry-go-round and other side-shows. The total amount of revenue received annually from the sale of children's tickets at these establishments would be less than £1,000. The proposal to charge a tax of Id. on a ticket costing 3d. is difficult to understand. cause. I affirm, not in any party spirit, T ask the Government to consider the matter further. I also ask that serious consideration be given to my prediction that the imposition of this additional taxation may very well involve the Government in a reduction rather than an increase of revenue. Because of the movement of servicemen, attendances have declined within recent weeks. The Government would have a clearer picture of its revenue prospects from this class of entertainment were it to allow the present season to pass without a break in the continuity of the existing charges. In the light of its revenue requirements, it could then examine the load which this traffic might reasonably be asked to bear, and the tax could be imposed when the new season commenced later in the year. My view is shared by those who conduct entertainments of this type. Speaking from experience, they say quite definitely that an additional charge at this juncture would have the effect of reducing the revenue. [9.48] -Even though I do not expect to obtain redress, there is one point that I shall raise. Some time ago, I had occasion to appeal to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) in respect of the entertainments tax that was levied on a series of entertainments given by the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institute of South Australia. As my friend from Fawkner( Mr Holt) said a few moments ago, the revenue of the Commonwealth has never been more bloated than it is at present. That is an excellent description. The Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institute of South Australia, which has its counterpart in every other State, has only two methods by which it may live. One is by means of the work which the inmates do-that is not sufficient to maintain it-and the other is by appeals to the public for charity on behalf of those who suffer from onr j of the worse of all afflictions, namely, blindness, followed in close order by those suffering from deafness and dumbness. That the people go to entertainments given by this institution chiefly for the purpose of being entertained, cannot be argued. I admit that some of the entertainments are very good. But the principal motive is to support a very worthy that because of the revenue which is flowing to the Commonwealth from other sources to-day, activities of this description should be placed beyond the pale of tax impositions by the Commissioner of Taxation. That would be better than the present practice for the Commonwealth, and very much better for the inmates of these institutions. The pass has not been reached at which it is necessary to levy a tax in this direction. The Government would not have to look far before it would be able to devise means of either increasing taxation on certain amusements, or inventing a new entertainments tax. There must be in the Taxation Department somebody with the inventive genius of an Edison who could suggest means whereby the deficiency could be repaired. The amount is very small from the viewpoint of the Treasury,",49,Chifley

219,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"but point of tbe inmates of these institutions. course, a more charitable and christian view of these matters will penetrate the official skin of the Taxation Department. for Home Security) [9.52] -The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has been taken to task for his statement about the protection unreasonable to allow a refund in such of the revenue. Unfortunately, particularly as taxation has risen, that has become necessary in many directions, because of means that have been adopted to evade taxation. The Government is prepared to examine further the proposal to tax tickets for small amounts which are sold at children's entertainments, such as merrygo-rounds. Obviously, there are difficulties exemption. At Taronga Park, however, associated with the fixing of an age limit. At places such as Luna Park, however, a good deal of entertainment can be obtained by persons expending the small amount of 6d. or 9d. on different items, and in the aggregate as much as 15s. These persons are at a distinct advantage compared with the patron of a picture theatre, who is compelled to pay tax on the price of admission, and the Government considers that they can quite properly be brought within the scope of the entertainments tax. L-ntertainments are paying tax at the present time. I am not placing the proprietors of Luna Park in the category of those who ought ro be taxed, because already they are paying tax under an agreement. They have "" played the game "" well. But a few people who will not "" play the game"" impose hardship on those who do, because all have to be covered by legislation. The matter of dance halls can be discussed more advantageously in committee. A tax is not to be imposed on refreshments if the total average amount charged is 3s. or less. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation will examine the returns of entertainments which are run for profit. If these returns show that, on the average, the charge for refreshments raises the total to more than 3s., tax will considerable from tbe viewbe charged on the whole amount; otherwise, the tax will be on the entertainment I trust that, in due and not on the refreshments. Reference has been made to the retrospective effect of the provision in proposed new section 18A. The effect of this is to provide that refund of tax overpaid shall not be allowed to the proprietor of an entertainment who has passed the tax on to some other person. It would be cases. There is no apparent reason why the conditions relating to refunds should not be made retrospective to the date of the commencement of the act. As I stated by way of interjection, Koala Park is already subject to entertainments tax, and is not affected in any way by the present proposals. That park is conducted for profit, and the proprietor of it does not, therefore, come within the scope of any the entertainment provided is partly educative and is controlled by an institution which is not conducted for profit. This and similar entertainments will therefore be exempt from the entertainments tax. As regards entertainments in aid of the Blind, Deaf and. Dumb Institute of South Australia, mentioned by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), exemption is allowed under the existing law, if the expenses of an entertainment do not exceed 50 per cent, of the receipts. This applies to all entertainments for public benevolent purposes. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses l to 8 agreed to. Clause9 (Meals and refreshments with entertainments ). clause deals with the charge that is made for refreshment at a dance hall. In order that the Minister( Mr Lazzarini) may make a fuller explanation, I raise .again the point that I raised earlier, in connection with a dance hall at which a charge of 2s. 6d. is made for admission, and apparently an estimate has to be made of the average amount spent by patrons upon light refreshments. How is it proposed that this tax shall be calculated? Is it to be assumed that,",51,Chifley

Is the person in charge of the buffet to collect tax on each drink served because, on an average, the amount spent by each person amounts to more than 3a.? tax will be levied in respect of refreshments until a notice is served on the proprietor that his takings have averaged more than 3s. for each patron. ticular night? understand that the taxation authorities considered a minimum of 3s. for a luncheon and 5s. for a dinner. Whether those limits are to be applied at the discretion of the Commissioner, I do not know. Perhaps the Minister can give us some information on this point. for Home Security) [10.3] -As the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr .not possible in the class of case referred Scullin) has said, if the average return exceeds 3s., tax is payable on the whole of the proceeds of the entertainment. Where a patron of a dance pays one fixed amount which entitles him to both entertainment and refreshment, and the refreshment is subordinate to the entertainment, section 16 of the existing act gives clear authority for the collection of tax upon the total payment made by the patron, even though a substantial part of the payment might be attributable to refreshments. It was intended, also, that the tax should fall upon separate charges for refreshment at such entertainments, otherwise the tax would be inequitable in its incidence. A recent judicial decision, however, indicates that the original intention to tax such charges was not effectuated. Proposed new section 16 is designed to remedy this defect. It provides that where the Commissioner is of opinion that the provision of meals or other refreshment at an entertainment is subordinately related to the entertainment, the whole of the charges paid for entertainment and meals or refreshments shall he subject to tax. In cases where one inclusive payment covers the entertainment and the meal or refreshment, or where each patron is required to pay for a meal or other refreshment, the provision of the meal or other refreshment is deemed a pa»rt of the entertainment, and the whole amount paid, whether in one composite payment or in two or more separate payments, is subject to tax at the ordinary rates at present in force. In other cases, however, where there is a fixed price of admission and refreshments are obtainable for separate charges at the will of the patron, it is obviously impossible for the proprietor of the entertainment to keep a record of all the amounts paid by each patron, so as to determine the amount of tax payable by him. The tax is not imposed at a flat rate under the existing law, but increases as the charges increase. Therefore, under the present scheme of the tax, it is necessary to know how much is paid by each patron of an entertainment in order to ascertain the amount of tax payable. As this is to, it is proposed that the individual charges for refreshments shall be taxed separately at the special rates specified in the rates bill which has been introduced into Parliament in association with this bill. Where the refreshments are supplied at the entertainment by a person other than the proprietor of the entertainment, the supplier of the refreshments is deemed to be the proprietor of an entertainment and will be responsible for payment of tax on his charges. The liability for tax on the' charges for meals or other refreshments will depend upon the Commissioner serving notice on the projirietor of the entertainment that, in his opinion, the provision of the meal or other refreshment is subordinately related to the entertainment. This will occur in respect of refreshments served at dances, card parties and skating-rinks, but not in respect of refreshments served at. picture theatres, race meetings, football matches and carnivals, as the obtaining of refreshments at such entertainments i . e regarded as separate from, and not an integral part of, the entertainment. It is intended that the notices in question",52,Chifley

228,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa,"Ministe rshall be served by the Commissioner on t he proprietors prior to the holding of the entertainments. Paragraph b of sub-section 1 of proposed new section 16 relates to cases where the serving of a meal or other refreshment is not subordinate to the entertainment. In such cases the Commissioner is given power to apportion the total charge paid by the patron between the entertainment and the meal or other refreshment, so that tax shall be paid on the portion properly attributable to the entertainment. clause also contains the provision which provides for the payment of tax when, in the opinion of the Commissioner, more than Is. has been spent on a number of different side-shows. I again emphasize the point that, in the opinion of people who claim to be in a position to know, this may result in a reduction of revenue from adults. I presume that it is not intended to levy the tax on tickets bought by children except where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, more than Is. has been spent. Here, again, I see some difficulty in working out what number of children, on an average, will spend Is. or more; but presuming the number to be ascertained', how is the tax to be collected by tbe management? I understand that it is the intention of the Government that the tax shall be passed on by. the management; revenue would suffer because the profits of the proprietor would be reduced. Proposed section 16A (1.) b readsThis section may be applied, in accordance with the next succeeding sub-section, where iiny proprietor conducts(6) a group of amusements where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is customary for a substantial number of the .patrons of a group of amusements of that kind to pay, at any one visit to the place where the group of amusements is conducted, amounts totalling not less than one shilling for more admissions than one to one of the amusements or to more than one of the amusements. Obviously, some formula would have to tainments tax and, as we discussed the' be worked out regarding the proportion rates on the Entertainments Tax Assessof persons who would be deemed to spend ment Bill, I do not think that anything more than Is. In the case of children, more need be said. is it intended to collect a penny on every 3d. ticket sold? Every child will not spend Is., so what is to happen to the amount collected over and above that deemed by the taxation authorities to be payable in respect of a certain number of children? The management cannot sell one ticket at 3d. and another at 4d., and it will not know which child will spend more than Is. It will have to impose a fixed charge for children's tickets. understood that the purpose of the clause was to impose a tax of Id. on every 3d. spent, but the Minister gave an assurance across the table that an endeavour will be made to exempt tickets sold to children. The Commissioner has wide powers, and I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Minister that everything possible will be done to safeguard the position. for Home Seourity) [10.15] -The matter raised by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) will be examined. The person conducting the entertainment will be served with a notice that the entertainment is of the kind that is subject to the tax. His returns will be examined. If a substantial number of the people who attend the entertainment spend more than Is. a head, the tax will be levied on all tickets issued. That is the position as it stands, otherwise the but we will have another look at that. Glause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 17 agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment: report adopted.

Whilst the Minister for Trade and Customs has authorized the issue of permits to publishers to use specified quantities of papers in the publication of books, those permits do not themselves convey any priority rights in regard to acquisition of paper. Apart from imposing limitations upon the quantity of paper that may be used and an insistence upon its most economical use in this connection, the Department of Trade and Customs does not place further restrictions on publishers, and it would be competent for a publisher to produce any type of book within the limits of the individual quota held. So far as the Department of Trade and Customs is concerned, no special arrangements have been made to publish the Australian novels mentioned by the honourable member, and it will be necessary for the publishers, as in the case of other types of books, to procure paper through ordinary channels.
