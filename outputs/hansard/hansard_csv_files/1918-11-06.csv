Minister for Defence, upon noticeHas the Defence Department taken any steps to secure properly-equipped ambulance carriages for the use of cot cases amongst returned soldiers travelling from Wallangarra to ^Brisbane? able member's question is as follows:No properly-equipped ambulance carriages are available in the 1st M i l it a r y District (Queensland), but the M i l it a r y Commandant advises that first class saloon carriages w it h S latform ends are provided for the use of soliers who are cot cases. These carriages accommodate eight patients, and are fitted w it h special portable stretchers w i th mattress, pillows, hot-water urn sterilized, lavatories, enlarged window for passing stretchers and patients through. A red cross is painted on the outside of the carriage. The Railway Department do not anticipate any difficulties, but should the necessity arise a first class Pullman sleeper car to carry twenty cot cases w ill be made available. DUTY ON STORES FOR NAVA L ister for Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Is there differential treatment of the military and Navy by Trade and Customs Officers, i.e., are the military op embarkation allowed their stores duty free while the Navy are charged duty? 2. Why was duty demanded on stores required for HMAS. Brisbane during the latter end of 1917? honourable member's questions are:1. No. In each case the same concession is allowed as in regard to stores for ordinary merchant vessels, viz., dutiable goods ex warehouse or under drawback may be placed aboard for consumption outside Australian waters. No duty is charged upon goods imported or purchased in bond by the Department of the Navy for use aboard vessels of the Australian Navy. The only duty levied is upon spirits, wines, tobacco, cigars, and the like taken aboard for the private use of the officers whilst the vessels are in Australian waters. 2. Beference is evidently to an application by a Sydney trader for permission to ship by the Mawatta a considerable quantity of tobacco and cigarettes to the Brisbane, then at an island in the Pacific. OTiia application was at first refused, but on further representation by the Navy Department it was arranged, in January last, that where any vessel of the Royal Australian Navy was outsideAustralian waters dutiable goods might be transferred thereto ess bond or under drawback, provided only that on the return of the vessel to Australia the unused portion of such stores was placed under seal, and remained so u n t i l the vessel again departed for an oversea destination, or alternatively that duty was paid on any stores consumed locally. That practice still obtains.",28,Contract Meat Prices

""Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) NOTE -This was the first agreement w it h Cone and Company im connection w it h fitting out ships as transports. 4. Cone and Company were given first the fittin g out of /tonus and ChiUca, and later on other vessels were placed in their hands to be fitted out as transports. 5. As work progressed Messrs. Cone and Company were paid progress payments on account of expenditure incurred, pending rendering of final accounts. 6. In May, 1915, a report was received by the Department indicating that certain irregularities existed in regard to the work being carried out. Afte r investigation, the Minister (Senator Pearce) referred the matter to the Auditor-General for inquiry. The Auditor General's inquiries did not reveal any irregularities on the part of Cone and Company, but the Minister decided that the contract between tlie Department and Messrs. Cone and Company, viz., 10 per cent, commission on cost of labour and material, was not suffi-. cicntly definite, e.g., differences with contractors had arisen over the interpretation of the meaning of "" cost"" of material, <Ssc. It was also considered that more advantageous terms should be obtained for the Department, in view of the estimated prices at which Cone and Company could obtain timber. Accordingly Mr Jensen, Assistant Minister, arranged a now contract w it h Cone and ComThey are contractors, pany, which superseded the original arrangetimber merchants, and have had ment of 10 per cent, commission, and had Conretrospective effect from 1st February, 1915, be done economicthus covering all work done by Cone and Comquickly, and efficiently, and pany prior to date of new contract, viz., 4th August, 1915.

That hardwood timber be purchased at the prices in the published lists of the Associated Timber Merchants, less 10 per cent. 3. That all other timber be secured at most favorable prices, plus 5 per cent, on amounts paid. 4. That all other stores be obtained at cost price, plus 5 per cent., less any discount allowed by vendor. 5. That in respect of all sub-contracts, the actual cost be charged, plus 5 per cent, for supervision, subject to the Minister being satisfied that tiie' prices charged by the sub-contractor are fai r and reasonable, and that such work could not be carried out by the original contractors. 0. That the contractors should hand over to the Department the actual invoices showing details of purchases made in respect of work of fitting up ships."" 7. Though the new contract was satisfactory to the Department, the examination of accounts for final charges for fitting some of the transports revealed irregularities in connection w it h the claims of a sub-contraotor employed by Cone and Company for carrying out plumbing "" W. C. CONE & Co."" work, viz., Messrs. Peacock and Smith. As the result of the investigations the Ministeri n structed the Auditor-General to take such action under the War Precautions Aot as was",33,Gregory Asked The Following Question
108,Mr Poynton,"In .fulfilment of athought necessary. ported the result of his examination on 6th December, 1915,' and on 13th December, 1915, tlie Assistant Minister (Hon. J. A. Jensen) directed that the report be referred to the Crown Law Department for consideration as to action to be' taken against Peacock and Smith. On 11th January, 1916, the Attorney General (Hon. W. M . Hughes) minuted papers containing Crown Solicitor's opinion as follows :"" If there appears reasonable prospect of success, approve that proceedings be instituted in order to act as a deterrent to other contractors."" 8. Acting on advice of counsel, criminal proceedings were accordingly taken against Messrs. Peacock and Smith. These proceedings were unsuccessful, and Peacock was acquitted "" without a stain on his character."" !). Regarding the settlement of Cone and Company's accounts, during tlie course of the two investigations by the Auditor-iGeneral, and pending the proceedings against the sub-contractor, the Department did not attempt to finalize Cone and Company's claims, but merely paid progress payments in respect of the total debits rendered by the firm, holding a sufficient balance iti hand to safeguard the interests of the Department. 10. It was considered desirable that the account with Messrs. Cone and Company should be kept open as long as possible to enable the Department to see the result of the detailed investigations which were made consequent on the decision to proceed against Peacock and Smith criminally. The accounts rendered by Cone and Company from time to time, therefore, were not dealt with separately at any time, but progress payments only made, and all debits rendered by the firm treated as on account of the total claim. 11. On 19th February, 1916, the following minute (from which a quotation appears in the report of the Royal Commission) was signed by the Acting Director of Navy Accounts. This minute, which summarized the position of the accounts at the above date, was written solely in connection with an application by Cone and Company for a further progress payment of Â£15,000. Subject -Fitting up of transports by W. C. Cone and Company -Progress payments on account. 3rd Naval Member. Attached is a further application f r om Messrs. W. C. Cone and Company for progress payment of Â£15,000. 2. Final accounts totalling Â£27,688 have recently been rendered, and the position in regard to these claims is now as follows:Total final accounts rendered . . Â£168,504 Less credits allowed Payments made Balance due The Auditor-General re. 3. Considerable reductions w ill be necessary in the accounts rendered. These reductions might be estimated at, say, Â£15,000, leaving a balance of approximately Â£8,000. 4. It is not considered that a larger progress payment than Â£7,000 should be made in the circumstances. 5. If you concur, please certify attached account. The deductions of Â£15,000 alluded to in the above minute referred to the total estimated reductions from the accounts then rendered by Cone and Company, ancl it w ill be noted that the words "" progress payment"" are used. 12. The making of a further progress payment of Â£7,000 to Cone and Company was agreed to by the 3rd Naval Member (Admiral Clarkson), but the Assistant Minister (Hon. J. A. Jensen) would not approve payment, and minuted the papers as follows:"" In view of the very unsatisfactory disclosures of Peacock and Smith, for which Cone and Company were the sole persons responsible for supervision, I cannot consent to further paynients to Cone and Company unti l final adjustments are made."" 13. A t the close of the investigations which preceded the criminal .action, a settlement was made with Cone and Company on the advice of counsel, disregarding the amount due in respect of the sub-contractor's (Peacock and Smith) claim. 14. The position of the accounts was then as follows:Â£ s. d. Total debits rendered by Cone and Company .. . . 177,330 13 1 Less progress payments made 140,800 0 0 36,530 13 1 Â£ s. d. Less Peacock and Smith's account .. 29,877 19 11 Less progress payments . . 15,600 0 0 : 14,277 19 11 Balance of account .. 22,252 13 2 In final settlement of this sum, Cone and Company agreed to accept Â£11,750, being a saving to the Department of Â£10,502 13s. 2d. This was considered a satisfactory settlement for the Department. Peacock and Smith's (sub-contractors) account stood as follows:Â£ s. d. Total claim . . 29,877 19 11 Less paid by Cone and Company on account . . 15,600 0 0 2,810 Balance due . . . . 14,277 19 11 Â£165,694 16. After the termination of legal proceed.. 142,651 ings, settlement was effected in respect of Peacock and Smith's claim by a lump sum pay.. Â£23,043 ment of Â£10,250, being a reduction of Â£4,027 19s. l i d . A further payment of Â£1,034 was approved to Cone and Company, being commission on this sub-contractor's account, at 4 per cent., in lieu of 5 per cent, as per agreement. 17. Similarly to the settlement with Cone and Company, Peacock and Smith's account was dealt with as a whole, and no action was taken to settle any part of the claim u n t i l final negotiations were completed. The final adjustment of these claims was made on the recommendation of responsible departmental officers. 18. It wdll be seen that on the total claim of Â£177,330 a reduction of Â£13,490 was made. This is considered a very substantial reduction in the circumstances, and further reductions could only .have been effected by successf u l civil legal proceedings. Such proceedings would have been prolonged, and probably might have proved very expensive to the Department. In the opinion of counsel, the Department would take the most economical course by settling the claims for the lowest possible sum agreed between the parties. 19. The final result of the transactions under this contract is not considered unsatisfactory to the Department, as the cost of fitting out ships by Cone and Company compared very favourably with the cost of work carried out in Commonwealth dockyards, and more than favourably with the cost of ships fitted out at the State dockyard. 20. It should be explained that in the settlement of the claims of Messrs. W. C. Cone and Company the Department had the benefit of legal advice, the main part of which is as follows:"" I think it certain that of the amount of such discrepancies, & c , a considerable sum w ill , on further investigation, be found to the transactions of individual persons or -to be due to Cone, and the question is how best, in the interests of the Department, to deal with the matter. Three courses are open(a) Leave Cone to sue the Department, and then resist his claim, icounterclaiming, if thought advisable, for damages for negligence in not exercising proper supervision, and so for t h ; {-&) refer the matter to arbitration; (c) endeavour to settle the whole matter amicably, (a) and ( 6 ) . However profitable these' courses may be to me personally, I do not feel that I can recommend their adoption. In either case, I feel t h a t some amount would have to he paid by the Department, and the result would be very heavy costs, owing to the lengthy nature of the proceedings.

I should, therefore, recommend that an attempt be made to settle the whole claim. I need hardly say that I have .considered Mr Poynton. this matter very thoroughly and carefnlly, and I am certain that such a settlement -would be in the interests of the Navy Department, and would avoid a very long, troublesome, and costly litigation."" This advice was given before the prosecution of Messrs. Peacock and Smith, and after that prosecution failed, it was considered that it was sound advice to follow in connection with the settlement of Messrs. Peacock and Smith's claims. the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) asked the Minister for Trade and Gustoms the following questions:1. Whetheri t is a fact that consignments of rabbit skins have been sent to Japan, Canada, the United States, artd England during the past two years? 2.

If so, w ill the Minister supply a return showing particulars of such consignments? The honourable member was informed that the informaJtion would be obtained. I am now in a position to reply to the questions. The answers are as follow:1. Yes. 2. It is contrary to the fixed policy of the Department to disclose particulars in regard firms doing business with the Customs, either as importers or exporters. It may be stilted, however, that during the past two years shipments totalling 14,583,301 lbs. were made to the destinations mentioned by 74 different shippers, to 107 different consignees. 3. Yes.

On its being discovered, however, that the parcels post was being used as a means to evade the priority restrictions, steps were immediately taken to prevent exportation of rabbit or other furred skins per parcels post. 4.

The order regarding the wearing of the blue arm-bands by soldiers undergoing medical treatment was designed in the interests of the soldiers themselves, and it is not proposed to vary the existing instructions. This is emphasized by WAR PENSIONS. honourable member for Batman( Mr. Brennan) asked the following question :-I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he regards with complacency the fact that a mother of a soldier killed in action is, in one case of which I know, absolutely destitute because, since her son was born out of wedlock, she is not entitled to receive a pension. This woman is fifty-nine years of age-jus t too young to obtain an old-age pension, and too old to work. Will the Minister consider the advisableness of issuing an amended regulation to permit of mothers of soldiers killed in action, and who were born out of wedlock, receiving a pension like other mothers who have lost-their sons? In reply to inquiries which I then promised to make, the Department of the Treasury advises to the following effect:The .mother of a soldier born out of wedlock is entitled to a war pension (in the event of the death of the soldier) providing she was dependent either wholly or in part on the soldier during the twelve months prior to enlistment. Such pensions are continued indefinitely if the livelihood. If such a .mother was not dependent on the soldier prior to enlistment, no pension is payable.

Even under our Income TaxA c t we grant an exemption in (consideration of. children up to the age of sixteen, but this B ill , as it stands, proposes to penalize them from the age of twelve. The amount of revenue involved is very small, and I think the Treasurer might very well accept the amendment. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) must nob forget that the repeal of the bachelors' tax has been announced; and yet this B ill would impose a penalty on people who are doing their duty to the country by bringing children into the world.

In view of the circumstances of the past four years, I feel sure that this Parliament can confidently and f a i r l y ask the land-holder, who is the subject of our taxation, to bear an additional burden, and thus, out of his stored results represented by' his landed assets, assist the Treasuryi u the time of its greatest stress.

I am not permitted to go into that matter now, but honourable members who reflect on what has happened during the last two or three elections will call to mind very grave and unfair actions on the part of Ministers controlling the Chief Electoral Officer.

Some honourable members who have been so persistent in referring to minority representation first graced the House by means of minority votes.

Had he done so, no doubt we would have been in a far better position to understand the working of the proposed reform. It is lack of material from honourable members opposite which has led us to allow our imaginations to run riot as to the benefits that this alteration may confer. But it matters very little what honourable members on this side say, either about the limitation of the debate, or about the proposed new method of electing members. The time is to be fixed, and we are to be prevented from discussing the B ill adequately. The measure is to be railroaded through in order to get it out of the way in time for any by-election that may occur in the near future. The only hope that honourable members on this side have is that gentlemen in another place may exercise their brains in a better fashion, and give opportunity for the measure to be more thoroughly digested before it is rushed No ; and I do not through its final stages.

Australian elections had hitherto been regarded as representing, perhaps, the ideal system of conducting such business. We were not perfect, but, at any rate, we were far ahead of any country in electoral affairs. The Prime Minister at that time introduced into elections a new feature that destroyed our previous ronfldence and dependence upon fair dealing in electoral niatters. To-day the Government are copying his bad example, but are acting even worse, because, with all his faults, tbe Prime Minister had the courage to introduce a Bill to give the Government authority to do the things he proposed. To-day the Minister has deliberately brought forward an amendment to allow the Government to manage the elections according to their own sweet will. Surely after our experience in the past, we want no more of that sort of thing. The time has come for straight and clean sailing. The amendment introduced by the Minister is one that ought not to commend itself to right-thinking men in this chamber. throughout entirely free from party prejudices, and without amy wish to gain a party advantage. I have no hope that the Government will give any advantage to the Labour party in electoral matters, but the time will surely come when the Labour party will be in office, and then will belong to them whatever advantages the Bill confers upon the Government. this Bill gives an advantage to one party over another 1 any better illustration than the amendment now before the Chair, which gives the Government of the day power to do what they choose with the electoral machinery. member that only the provisions Telating to preferential voting will be operated irnmediately. clauses offhand. that this amendment will, give the Governmentgof the day power to bring into operation any portion of the electoral law which suits them.

I ask tlie Minister to relieve himself of the charge that will be laid forever at his door that he is proposing to use for a particular party purpose an Electoral Bill, although the electoral law is the real basis of the whole of our governmental institutions and the guarantee of their purity. No matter what party is in power, the electoral machinery should not be available for such a purpose; it should be above suspicion and the danger of manipulation. The Government would be 'acting more honestly if they put through the whole Bill as representing their ideal of electoral reform, or agreed to the elimination of the objectionable features. The only reason why the Bill is not to be operated as a whole at the Corangamite by-election is that the' Government have not time to make provision for postal voting. The Minister is placed in an unfortunate I cannot specify the position by his party, and if honourable members opposite wish to relieve themselves of the charge of partiality and of seeking a party advantage they should not press this amendment, but allow the Bill to go through in its entirety, and stand or fall by it.",50,Chairman I Called The Parties

That would have been a most cumbersome way of attaining our end, and I thought the better way would be to pick out that portion of the Bill which is relevant to the peculiar conditions of the moment, and which can be absolutely separated from the other portion without any inconvenience. I have sought for thc clauses that will be affected by the amendment I have proposed, but I cannot possibly specify them in a hurry with"" out some risk. I have, however, made a note of clauses 76, 125, 134, and 137. The balance of the Bill will be brought into force in one block, and cannot afterwards be withheld. Postal voting could not possibly be applied to the forthcoming by-election, because, after nomination day, it is necessary to have postal certificates all over Australia. certificates until the candidates are nominated, and in order to print them and have them distributed all over Australia in time for this election, it would be necessary to anticipate the nominations. 250,000 persons avail themselves of the absent voting provisions, but of these there are only about 15,000 who use this method of voting outside the State in which they are enrolled. Tn any case, absent voting cannot generally apply to a by-election, because there are no polling places outside the division in which the election is held. It would be absolutely useless to apply the postal voting or absent by-election. Why not postpone the elecvoting provisions of this Bill to the forthtion for a fortnight? I do not suppose coming by-election. The Government's proposal could not possibly affect the relative strength of the parties in this House. provisions' were not used at the recent Swan by-election. in force. But there is a provision in the Bill before the House which can be made to apply at the present time without embarrassing the electoral administration, and the Ministry thought it was sound policy to ask Parliament to sanction its immediate application. In asking for the sanction of Parliament, we are following a correct course. [272]2 is quite true that, if this amendment is passed, the sanction of Parliament will be given, and the Ministry have the necessary majority; but the method they have adopted is not in accordance with the.past actions of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Glynn). I would far rather hear him say that the exigencies of the moment have rendered it necessary. This course may have been adopted on previous occasions, but not to my knowledge; and it seems to me that it is the shadow of the Swan election which is causing the Government to apply to the forthcoming Corangamite election the portion of the electoral law which will suit them. I do not wish to stress the point, but I am perfectly candid in saying that the example set to-day will not be forgotten. The party which occupies No one can fill up postal the Government benches for the time being will always be justified in making full use of the Standing Orders, applying the closure or limiting debate. I welcome it if it means that certain legislaAbout tion will be carried into effect. More particularly would I welcome it if we had adopted the principles of the initiative, referendum, and recall, because then the people themselves could say, "" We will not have such legislation; we will have the Bill, and the whole B ill . "" If the Government had been more open about this matter, they would have been more honourable. They say that they cannot apply the postal vote to the Corangamite that the fixing of the date for a by-election is like the laws of the Medes and Persians-unalterable . . Speaking subject to correction, I should imagine that it is not compulsory to hold an election on a certain date after a member's death. If we could delay the Corangamite election, we could apply the whole of the provisions of the Bill, and so enable the Minister to escape from an unpleasant situation.

I would be prepared to expect such criticism if I were supporting the Government. I have suffered more than any honourable member or, perhaps, any two honourable members may have suffered, from the villainies that were perpetrated under the old postal-voting provisions; but yet I hope that the Corangamite election w ill be postponed, so that the whole of the measure whioh w ill be passed by this Parliament may be applied to it . [6.16] -As I understand the proposal, it will have the same effect as if the Government had introduced a separate B ill providing for the contingent vote only. I am unable to understand the amount of heat which the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Einlayson) has been able to p ut into the discussion of a proposition of that kind. Only a party spirit of the most violent k in d could rejoice at the Democracy being forced to accept a candidate elected by a minority of electors in opposition to candidates supported by a majority of electors. The man who professes to be a believer in democratic principles, and yet is prepared to support a system applying to any election which will enable a minority of electors to force their candidate upon an unwilling majority, has a very small claim to be a Democrat. The sooner that I have discussed the matawful system comes to an end the better it will be, no matter what party it may. affect. It is undemocratic. The proposal of the Government is in the in D i d the Minister terests, not of party, but of the electors, who have a right to be represented in Parliament by men approved of by the The Government do not majority.

This rot has given a very bad impression to their friends, and to their so-called leader across the seas, at the very time when those stay-at-home warriors are desirous of acclaiming themselves a successful Win-the-war Government and party. not understand the Government introducing these 'amendments. would think that the honour and safety of the Commonwealth-indeed , the safety of the Empire-depende d on their winning the Corangamite seat. On Friday last the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Chapman) threatened the Government with condign punishment, and made the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn) so angry and alarmed that he dare not go to his home at the weekend. Mr d-LYNxrI have not been home for us three weeks. and his colleagues, after the remarks of the honourable member I have mentioned, at once started to lay and hatch eggs, of which these amendments are the outcome. The Government is strong enough, and has subservient followers enough to do this dirty kind of business. they not go one step further, and disfranchise every man and woman with Labour sympathies and tendencies, and thus make things still more easy for the Government? to the effect that those whom the gods wished to destroy they first made mad; and honourable members opposite aTe going mad on electoral matters. All the powers of the Government-al l their trickery and machinations-wil l not save the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) next, time he faces his masters. The honourable member, who does not appear to like what I am saying, will remember the old yarn about the pitcher and the well. As a Labour man these things, for they are only rushing to their doom. If there is one thing more than another that an enraged Democracy will not have, particularly in Australiaand I know a little of the Democracy of this country, having grown up with it for the last thirty years-it is electoral methods of this sort. The Government and their supporters are to-day doing to the Labour party and Democracy what the squatocracy and the autocracy of Australia did to the manual workers and toilers in the earlier history of the Labour movement.

Things Why do that the Australian Democracy will not stand are Tammany practices in politics, and tinkering with the Electoral Act. The enraged Democracy will scarify honourable members for what they are doing There is an old saying to-day.

Honourable members opposite cavil about Labour candidates heing returned on a minority vote. In tlie first Pederal election some honourable members on the Government side, and one member of the Labour party were returned on a minority vote; but until this Bill was brought forward, I never heard of any complaint on that account. There must be something rotten in the state of Denmark when,after having endured the present system for eighteen years, the Government are induced to rush an amending B ill through in the few days before a by-election. What will happen if , notwithstanding all the anxiety of the Government to insure the return of a Nationalist candidate, the Labour candidate wins ? t i l the next elections. majority of electors elect the member? so in my electorate. A .blind man can see through What the Government are doing to-day. But a reaction will take place in the constituencies, and many honourable members who are reclining on the soft Ministerial benches to-day will be sitting in the galleries' watching their Labour successors doing what they ought to have done. It seems peculiar that , the Government should be so small-minded as to misuse the whole powers of Parliament and the electoral machinery in order to gain one seat, for no"" other reason than that a Labour man won the Swan seat with a minority vote. But even if the Labour candidate had not won the Swan seat, the Nationalist candidate, who had the endorsement of the Government, would have been defeated, and success Would have gone to another man, who would have been opposed to the Government. cannot say that. been operative, Mr Hedges would have been beaten on the second count. It is remarkable that the Government have made their first use of the guillotine on a B ill which most honourable members have referred to as a non-party measure. I do not think that any man should win an election on trickery; a constituency should have f a i r and proper representation, and if the Government think that preferential voting would insure that, I have no objection to giving it a t r i a l. member's arguments would be well founded if an injustice to any candidate were contemplated. this amendment has been brought forward by the Government. Apparently, even an electoral law that has placed fifty-three members on the Government side and twenty-two on the Opposition side is not good enough for honourable members opposite.

It is taken in the interests of party only, and I am sure they are ashamed of it. I am told that I must not attribute motives. There is no need to impute them. Honourable members tliink that, because they have the press on their side, they can do no wrong. In order to prevent honourable members on this side from having a fair opportunity to discuss the matter, they bring forward a proposal in this piecemeal way. Instead of giving the country a solid joint, they give it a pound of sausages, cutting off a piece at a time, and applying it piecemeal to the elections. istry which brought forward a regulation on the eve of the conscription referendum disfranchising Australian-born citizens would bring forward another regulation putting part of the Electoral Act into operation for one election, and then, if it did not suit them, they would not apply it at the next election. The law would prevent it. man does not know what his Government can do. By means of a regulation, they have already disfranchised certain citizens; and what they have done in the past they will be prepared to do in the future. I shall do my best, not only to prevent this Bill passing in the shape they desire, but also to prevent them from retaining the Corangamiteseat.

If the party numbers were very close, I could understand the urgency of the amendment; I could understand the Government doing a l o t of things with the electoral law; but since the Government have an enormous majority, and are so sure of the success of their candidate at the forthcoming election for Corangamite, why should they resort to this subterfuge ? W h y should they be ready to manipulate and juggle with the electoral machinery to suit their own necessities? If the Government would consider this matter apart from the party stand-point they would recognise that it is immoral to descend to the subterfuge now being resorted to by the Minister. with the amendments made in clause 2, under which such parts of the B ill as are found convenient may be made operative, he now proposes to make it possible to repeal only such parts of the existing electoral law as the Government may consider it convenient to repeal.

Under the B ill before us, the Government might at any .time issue a proclamation reducing or extending the hours of polling. I am reminded by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that prior to the taking of the last referendum a regulation was issued permitting certain questions to be asked of the electors; and such powers no Minister ought to have. If the Government have only the Corangamite election in view, why deface the B ill with such a clause as that before us. I do hot think that the House would agree to a permanent measure of the k in d ; and surely Parliament will not stoop to pass a measure which can only affect one by-election? I warn the Government that this proposal, if carried into effect, may prove a boomerang to them; and certainly the measure will not result in that purity of elections that we have been led to suppose. if these powers are given to the Minister, I hope they w ill not be exercised in the same way as have the powers under the War Precautions Act . My own opinion is that if the Minister had his way this clause would not find a place in the B ill , and it is only there as a result of influence brought to bear on him and the Government, in view of the approaching Corangamite election.

We are now fighting on the question of re-introducing postal voting. What does it amount to? Honourable members may not be aware how few electors would be affected in the Division of Corangamite. The latest return I have had from the Department shows that at the election on 5th May, 1917, there were 36,733 electors enrolled, and if there were only 77,000 postal voters out of 3,000,000 electors in May, 1917, that would be, roughly, about 4 per cent., so that in Corangamite the number would be about 1,500. I spoke, subject to correction, when, earlier in the afternoon, I said I understood that the date of an election following a vacancy was fixed by law. I find now that this is not so. There is no reason why this election should not be postponed seven or fourteen days; and allow the Electoral Department extra assistance in any temporary work that may be needed.

If we had what I have always contended for-the referendum, initiative, and recall-w e could recall the regulations under this Bill. It would give me some pleasure to take the platform throughout the length and breadth of Victoria, as well as further afield, to urge that this course be taken. members opposite will find that even their political friends will believe that the course now being taken has been dictated by the results of the by-election for Swan. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) must agree with me in this matter. It is quite palpable that this action is being taken to insure that Corangamite shall be safe for the Government. But the Government have large numbers behind them, so they can afford to be generous. They should see to it that no slur is cast at them over this matter. If I were on the other side of the House, I would speak in the same strain, and, if necessary, would vote against the Government. I recollect with some amusement what tbe honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) said while we were on the inquiry to which I have referred, and in which the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith) was associated with us. We had to work very hard to get justice at that time. I remember how strong the feeling was on both sides. If the honourable members to whom I have referred vote for this provision, they will be supporting a principle which will place in tbe hands of the Minister more power than any other Minister has yet enjoyed in regard to electoral matters.

I Honourable know that the present Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn)' has a splendid record, and that he would prefer the Bill to be so worded that if a Minister controlling a Department became so lost to a sense of duty as to order the public servant controlling the Electoral Department to do something which he thought he should not do, that servant should be able to say, "" There is the Act, sir, and I read it in another way."" Let us give the public servant that right. I ask honourable members on the Ministerial side to support me in requesting the Ministry to do the right thing. I do not care how quickly the Government pass this Bill, because if the opportunity ever comes to me to move in a particular matter I shall move quickly, it seems to me absurd bhat in times like the present we should have such long vacations and brief sittings. Our position is akin to that of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Let us get through the business and dispose of every motion standing in bhe names of private members. I suggest that the Ministry should withdraw the amendment. On the average, only 1,500 persons in a constituency with 36,000 electors vote by post, and to say that it is not possible to do what I have suggested is to reflect upon the capacity of the splendid band of officers who are controlled by the head of the Electoral Department.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) started by saying that this amendment would give general powers to the Minister to repeal old Statutes or reinstate them. It does not; it gives specific power to the Minister to repeal by proclamation Acts already on the statute book. Minister would dare to allow an Act to go unrepealed. Clause3 states that certain Acts are to be repealed from such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation, ' so that the Minister is given power only to repeal those Acts by proclamation, and when they have heen repealed this provision becomes a dead letter. If honourable members opposite will assist me to take, as far as practicable, all control ""out of the hands of the Minister in regard to the administration of the Act and the conduct of elections, I shall be pleased to have their support; but the clause under consideration is not the one upon which such an amendment sbould be considered. The proclamation under the Old-age PensionsA c t has been put for th as a justifipresent, during this part of the session, cation for the procedure proposed to be adopted in connection with this B ill . Honourable members know perfectly well that the proclamation under the Old-age PensionsA c t was provided for for the specific reason that it was impossible to bring the whole of the provisions into force at the time the A ct was passed, because there was not enough money in hand to pay the pensions. How can honourable members compare such a proclamation with one which is to be used merely for party purposes, to stave off the evil day for the Government, and to preven'; the people from getting accustomed to seeing the National candidate at the bot> torn of the poll? ber is begging the question by saying that the proclamation is for party purposes. If Opposithat the guillotine was employed this afternoon in order that those portions of the B ill which are likely to be most satisfactory to the Ministry may be forced through this Chamber by Friday afternoon, sent to the Senate, and passed through that Chamberi n the same hurried manner, so that they may be operated in the Corangamite by-election. I further believe that this action has been taken because of the awful beating which the Nationalist candidate received in the Swan by-election. That is the opinion of honourable members on this side and of the outside public, and, no matter how No t exactly; no Government supporters may t r y to hide their heads in the sand, the people w ill take that view with increasing conviction when they learn of what is being done in regard to the Corangamite selection. Fancy the whole parliamentary in stitution being employed to enable the Government to win one seat. It is not the probable loss of the Corangamite seat that worries the Government so much as the effect which another defeat would have on the minds of the people. In order to stave off the evil day, and to bolster up Nationalism, all sorts of devious and sinister methods are being used. The Government to-day instructed the Minister in charge of the Senate that that House should be adjourned, but with in structions that its members should assemble on Tuesday next. U p to the the Government have not thought fit to bring the Senate back to duty on the Tuesday, although on several occasions honourable senators have been sent home for a week. However, on the present occasion, knowing that the guillotine would give the Senate the Electoral B ill earlv next week, honourable senators are being brought back on the Tuesday to save the face of the Government, to stave off the evil day if possible, and to get their machinery to work that something may be done for the National party, whose foundations are crumbling away.

440,Mr Blakeley,"I sincerely believeGlynn), who is in charge of this B ill , is not a very happy man to-night. I say this on tlie strength of my personal acquaintance with him during the short time. I have been a member of this House, and on the reputation given him by my colleagues. than is the honourable member. but I have little doubt that he is happier than is the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald), who will be singing his political swan song very shortly. The fact remains that the Minister for Home and Territories ia called upon to do a work which I have no doubt is very distasteful to him. He is being used as a party tool. He has to do the d i r t y work of the National party in order to bring about a result at the Corangamite election which could not, under the existing law, be achieved. I have no fear at aU of the operation of the preferential system of voting. It will put more Labour members into this House than will the sudden-death system. The Labour party have nothing to fear from the preferential voting system. Many honourable members opposite owe their return to the suddendeath system, and with the adoption of a better electoral system I have no doubt at all that the Labour party will benefit considerably. If the Government had the courage to stand up against the signers of the round robin in the Senate, and in troduce proportional representation for the Senate as the logical corollary of the preferential system of voting for the House of Representatives, the Labour party would do very much better than they did at the elections in 1917. If the proportional voting system had been in operation at those elections they would have secured eight Senate seats, whereas under the existing system they did not secure any. When the numbers go up for Corangamite I am not at all sure that a Labour man will not be returned, provided that voters are not disfranchised. I am not too sure that honourable members opposite will not disfranchise a number of voters. I say quite candidly that a Government who could bring down a measure such as this, and hurry it through without permitting it to be properly discussed, are' quite capable of disfranchising voters. It would not be difficult to bring proof that this Government, did disfranchise thousands of native-born citizens of Australia for a political purpose. They did that at the last general elections. It requires courage even to be a rogue, and if the political party He is more happy opposite had had the courage to carry out the regulation providing for the asking I do not think so, of infamous auestions of electors as they went to the poll, a large number of young men in this community would have been disfranchised. I am not at all sure that some "" gerrymandering "" will not go on at the Corangamite election. A Government or a party capable of disfranchising electors are capable of anything. I know that in the State of Victoria the electorates have been ""gerrymandered"" by the same class of people as those who constitute the Federal Government. They stand on the same platform, are behind the same party and represent the same interests. WhilstI may be young politically, I know a good deal about our electoral systems and the way (ijn which they have been used throughout Australia. I know that the National Government are proficient in the art of gerrymandering, and are capable of using every evil practice during the Corangamite election in order to save their faces. This would not be because of their desire to retain Corangamite as a Government seat since they could afford to lose half-a-dozen votes or more in this House, and still have quite sufficient numbers to carry any proposals they considered important. But it is a question of the moral effect which the loss of the seat might have on tlie minds of the people. The citadel of Nationalism is crumbling, and no matter what sinister and evilpractices are adopted to prop it up it will fall. Provided that the electors axe given the opportunity to exercise the franchise, I have, personally, no fear of the result from the adoption of the preferential system. wish to say a word or two at this stage on a measure which honourable members opposite have pointed to as one, the effect of which the Government propose to test at the Corangamite election.

446,Mr Glynn (Angas,"Minister f o rthat we are introducing a system of preferential voting which may affect the old method of party government, the Commonwealth may not be divided into two stereotyped parties to the extent that has previously existed. Therefore, we have not included in this Bill the provision which finds a place in the Electoral (Wartime) Act. considered the matter ? any alteration. It mlay he effected afterwards. I think the better course is to -leave the matter for the present. or five seats in the Commonwealth to which the preferential principle will apply, and there may be only two candidates for each of the other seats. In the latter case, what will happen if one of the candidates dies after nomination day? Act which makes provision for such circumstances. to meet such a contingency. ing the preferential system of voting, and it is suggested that we should add to it something which has not hitherto been associated with it. That raises the question of whether nominations by a political party should be a part of.our electoral system. I know that what has been suggested obtains to some extent in America, but I do not know that it has proved a blessing, by any means. should be void if the candidate for a particular party dies after nomination day. the late Senator McGregor's case, I do not think that the contingency suggested has ever arisen in connection with a Senate election. providing that, in such circumstances, nomination day shall be postponed? worthwhile dealing with the matter, seeing that the occasion has not arisen to justify it? this House were equal. We do hot wish that condition of affairs to be repeated. able member, I can only say that no such provision as he indicates has been made in this Bill, because I do not believe in the principle of stereotyping parties. After perhaps eighteen months' or two years' experience of preferential voting, we shall be able to see exactly how it works. nomination applies to the Senate as well. I do not think that the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) will object to keeping in force a provision which will assist our soldiers who are abroad. It is possible that the principal Act may have to be amended in the light of the amendments we embody in this Bill. We may have to adopt some principle of preferential voting for our soldiers at the Front. But, as the Act will continue in force for the period of the war and for six months afterwards, I do not think it will be wise to amend it in the direction indicated, in view of the possibility of a great number of our soldiers, who have done so well for this country, remaining abroad for some considerable time. the question raised by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Sinclair) and the layson), I think this House was unanimous when we inserted the provision in question in our War-time Electoral Act. c When the measure reached this Chamber, that provision applied only to Senate elections. But I moved that it should be made to apply to elections for this Chamber. It is all very well for the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn) to say that when we have preferential voting party lines are likely to be removed. are likely to be removed; hut they are likely to be modified. they are.

I desire that the Chief Electoral Officer may be made independent of the Minister by being put into a position analogous to that of the Commissioner of Audit and the Commissioner of Taxation, so that should a Minister be so ill advised as to order something to be done contrary to the law, the Chief Electoral Officer may be in a position to say, "" As I am answerable to Parliament for giving effect to the law, I decline to do what you have directed to be done."" The Minister, of course, could appeal to Parliament, and if the officer were in the wrong, punishment would follow.

Electoral Officer( Mr Oldham) is a man with strong personality, and I would like to see the Minister who wonld suggest to him anything of an irregular character. But we might not always have a Chief Electoral Officer possessing such attributes. In a certain State which I know something about, a drastic alteration was to have been made in the electoral machinery which would have been detrimental to the electors. Fortunately, the then Attorney-General had control of the Electoral Department; and, when I called his attention to the position, the Minister said, "" This must not be done,"" and that was the end of it .

He has to check the finances of every Department, including those of the Prime Minister's Department, to which he is technically supposed to be subject, and therefore he has to be made practically independent, so that, on behalf of the Parliament, he may see that appropriations are carried out in accordance with the law.

What steps are being taken in Australia to keep it out? The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr information that I asked for is that for Greene) gave me an answer to-day with which I was not in the least satisfied. I have here a statement made to a committee of citizens in New Zealand on the subject. T regret that there is not a committee of citizens in Australia to take the matter up in the same way. The nature of the reply given on behalf of the Minister for Health for the Dominion makes one fear that a similar state of things may easily prevail in Australia unless public attention be drawn to it. The following is the statement made to the committee of New Zealand citizens on hehalf of the Minister:Criticism had been levelled at the Governonly figures supplied are those given to ment because it had not declared influenza a quarantinable disease, but to do this they would have had to declare it infectious, probably a dangerous infectious disease, meaning a serious disorganization in the Dominion. Moreover, if that had been done, shipping be the information in regard to zinc and tween New Zealand and Australia would be declared infected, and there would probably be a complete stoppage of shipment. medical authorities agreed that it was nothing more than pure influenza, and so far Australia had not declared New Zealand in fected. The reason given for this attitude is that the steps desired would create disorganization in the shipping trade; but we would willingly meet disorganization ten times greater than we can dream of to keep this disease from Australia. I am not at all satisfied with the statement of the Minister to-day, nor am I satisfied that proper precautions are being taken to combat the disease. was interested to hear that the return I had asked for as to Australian products had given rise to great expense and much energy on the part of those concernedin preparing it. I have since had an opportunity of perusing this immensely expensive document in a cursory way, and I extend my hearty congratulations to the ; Government on having supplied me with information for Passengers were not put in which I did not ask, and with no information at all for which I did ask. The information supplied covers a few pages of typewritten foolscap, and must in its preparation have taken at least an hour of some Government servant's time. The which I again ask the Minister, and that is information to show who is getting the benefiit of these prices. The only way that can be done is to show first what the producer of the raw material gets, what the man gets to whom the producer sells the raw material, what the man gets at the next stage, and so on, right up to the British Government. the Ministry! fied that the sacrifices the producer is making are for the benefit only of the British Government. In the return, the the Australian producer, which, of course, are known now. Minister( Mr Watt) refused to give me lead. to be obtainable from the producers. If we take the production of some of the metals smelted abroad, we ought to be able to show what the man who sells them to the smelter gets, and what the smelter gets from the British Government, or some person who sells it to the British Government. That is the information I desire, and I ask the Minister to see that the simple figures are supplied, for the benefit of the House and the country, at the earliest possible moment. [11.10] I am not sure that I apprehended the reply of the Minister for Recruiting ( Mr Orchard) to the request that copies of the literature issued at the present time shall be supplied to members of the House. I understood the honourable gentleman to say that if we applied we could have copies, but my object is to have this literature brought to the notice of honourable members who are not taking any interest in the matter, and who, when they see the expensive and wasteful",80,Adjournment Spanish Influenza^ Australia N Pro Ducts Return Recruitinglitera

I have had an opportunity of looking at it , and if the object is to bring the facts set out before the people, they are in the most inconvenient for m possible for sonally, I believe there are any number of reading, and the quality and weight of the paper used indicates , the wildest extravagance on the part of those in control. Ministers are preaching economy, and I think that every honourable member should have a copy of every important document issued to the public by this Department, so that we may know, when we are asked to waive our right to send Hansard and other literature to our constituents, how Ministers are practising the precepts that they teach. This morning I asked the Ministerf o r Recruiting ( Mr Orchard) two questions' concerning a pamphlet, or some printed illustrated matter, of which I had been able to secure a copy. I am given to understand that this pamphlet has been issued for circulation amongst the returning men. A perusal of it shows that it has been compiled mainly, in fact, exclusively, from the anti-Labour press of Australia, extracts from other papers not Australian, and from various cartoons. In the pamphlet there is the following, over the signature of the Ministerf o r Recruiting:The object of issuing this journal to returning soldiers is to provide them with light and interesting items to break the monotony of the last phase of their journey, and at the same time to give them, in lighter vein, an indication of public opinion in Australia towards the eligible -E .

A t this time, when there is so much talk under a pretence of placing before them about the shortage of paper, and the certain light and refreshing literature. need for economy, we have a pamphlet of Those responsible for this have a very this character, which, on the face of it , heavy responsibility to carry. appears to be circulated amongst the returning men for one . purpose only, namely, to create discord between them and that section of the community who do not see eye to eye w it h the present A d orable member thinks so. This is one ministration either in regard to the war quotation from the pamphlet to which I or the recruiting campaign.

A impartially to say that, from one end to are not paid by Germany, but ' Dark,' and I the other, it is anything but an appeal to the prejudice that the Minister, or whoever compiled the pamphlet, assumes that the men from the Front possess. Permen who, on coming back, w ill treat this pamphlet with the contempt it deserves. From my contact with a considerable number, I have found Ohat they are just as capable of understanding people who differ from them as are any other members of the community. If any ill-feeling, riots, or civil disturbances take place member is not a child. The action of the Minister responsible for the distribution of stuff of this character, calculated, as it is, to excite discord in the community, is very discreditable. men who would not fight with the soldiers fight against them ? member knows quite well that during the last conscription campaign the passions of men whom he claims to have so much at 1 heart were greatly excited at meetings, in the Sydney Domain and on the Yarrabank.
