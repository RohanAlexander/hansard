It must be appreciated, however, that it applies to a very limited group of easily assessible risks. It is not my function to answer questions on matters connected with insurance of other houses.

13,Mr Nelson,"I ask the Minister forout of eight elected members of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. The honourable member has suggested that this was done more or less as a protest against the Government's failure to agree to many of the Council's requests. Of course, the requests to which the honourable member referred were only some of the overall requests made. The main request was for greater powers for the Council in responsible and executive government, to be extended in the future to those of full executive and responsible government. The Government believes that the time is not ripe to take such a drastic step forward. I remind honourable members of some of the physical features of the Northern Territory. It is an area of more that 500,000 square miles-ver y much larger than the combined areas of New South Wales and Victoria. The population of the Territory is 47,000 including Aborigines. There are at present 15,000 names on the electoral roll. It has been suggested to the Council that local government activities be extended and that it might take over and why so little interest was taken by the government enterprises in the Territory as a preliminary step towards further powers in government control. As the latter part of the honourable member's question raises a matter of policy, I am not in a position to answer it in these circumstances. WOOL. to the Minister for Primary Industry. Has the honourable gentleman seen a report that the Australian Wool Board will give details of the proposed reserve price scheme for the marketing of wool in a series of broadcasts over commercial radio stations? Has the Board accepted financial responsibility for past broadcasts relating to the scheme? If so, did the Minister give approval to the Board under the provisions of section 24 (1.) (c) of the Wool Industry Act? Has the honourable gentleman given approval to the Board under that provision to undertake the proposed broadcasts? ment in the newspapers similar to that mentioned by the honourable member. The matter was referred to me by an honourable member, together with a legal opinion regarding the action taken on a previous occasion. I referred the matter to the F.4767/65 -R -[66 ] Attorney-General, who assured me that nothing had been done contrary to the provisions of the Act. The honourable member asked whether I had, in advance, approved of the Board's action. To date I have had no request to give approval for such action. addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is it a fact that interstate airlines operate their regular flights by scheduled services? Do special flights take priority over scheduled services when those services are cancelled without notice because of operational difficulties? If so, why? Is it reasonable for passengers, especially those in transit, at capital city airports who are booked on scheduled flights to be delayed hour after hour while numerous special flights leave for the same destination? Will the Minister have inquiries made of Trans-Australia Airlines to ascertain why so many people were stranded for up to six hours last Sunday in ideal flying conditions airline in the movement of stranded passengers in these circumstances?

I will make inquiries of the Minister for Civil Aviation, who is in another place, and as soon as I have the full story I will pass it on to the honourable member. the Attorney-General. I refer to the fact that the Third Commonwealth and Empire Law Conference, which has been arranged by the Law Council of Australia, is to commence in Sydney in the latter part of August of this year. This important conference will be attended by many distinguished overseas lawyers, including, I believe, the Law Ministers and Chief Justices of most, if not all, of the countries of the Commonwealth.

In my view, it will be the greatest event in Australia's legal history. Many hundreds of lawyers from all over the British Commonwealth will attend. The visitors wili include judges and Law Ministers. The Government has taken a very real interest in this matter. Indeed, some little time ago, the Prime Minister decided that the Government should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence in Australia of Law Ministers and Chief Justices on this rare occasion and, as Head of State, he has invited the heads of other Commonwealth Governments to make their Law Ministers and Chief Justices available to attend a conference in Canberra at the conclusion of the convention in Sydney. Acceptances are coming in to the Prime Minister's invitation and it has been decided to hold meetings in Canberra on 2nd and 3rd September this year. The meetings will be separate meetings between Law Ministers of the respective countries and Chief Justices of the respective countries. The rate at which the acceptances are coming in makes it clear that these meetings will be most successful, just as the organisation of the convention in Sydney indicates that it also will be a most successful legal event. Mr O'CONNOR -I s the Minister for the Interior aware of the statistics that are available proving the efficacy of the use of safety belts in reducing the injury and death rate arising from road accidents? Is it a fact that in some States it is obligatory for car owners to fit safety belts on all new cars? with members of the River Murray ComWill the Minister give consideration to making it compulsory for all Commonwealth cars and trucks to be fitted witb these safety belts? wealth cars do come under my control. They are Commonwealth cars in the Australian Capital Territory. Cars outside the Territory come under the control of the Minister for Supply. The honourable member's suggestion about putting safety belts in cars is one that we will consider. I know that many Commonwealth cars already have safety belts, but just how far this applies I shall find out and let the honourable member know. directed to the Minister for National Development. Js it a fact that if the Murray River falls to 20 per cent, of its normal flow it can, as desired, be built up to the normal flow with water from Lake Eucumbene? What authority is responsible for the control of the flow of the Murray River? Will the Minister make investigations with a view to ensuring that the river is kept at a level high enough to allow for the satisfactory pumping from the river for valuable large and small established irrigation projects? any formula when the Murray fails to 20 per cent, of its normal flow as the honourable member has mentioned. I know, of course, that the Snowy Mountains Council has made available to the River Murray Commission, which is the authority in charge of the level of the River Murray, a diversion of water from Lake Eucumbene and that this amount of water will increase as the scheme builds up. At the present moment, I think the River Murray Commission has the power to draw about 870,000 acre feet of water a year from the Snowy Mountains through Lake Eucumbene. I realise that the level of the Murray River presents a considerable problem in the area mentioned by the honourable member. The honourable member for Riverina also has approached me about the problem. I would have thought that at the present moment irrigation in that area was almost completed, but as the honourable member knows I will be visiting his area next month mission, and I will be delighted to discuss this matter further and see if we can arrive at any improvement in the present system.

26,Mr Daly,"Has the attention of thecompanies to £10 million in the last two years? In view of the grave concern of shareholders about these losses will the Minister give consideration to instituting some form of inquiry, either under Commonwealth law or in co-operation with the State Governments, to ascertain the reasons for these huge losses? Press report as the honourable gentleman. I do not know whether it is correct or not, but 1 assume that it is correct. The Commonwealth's responsibility in matters relating to companies is confined to the Territories. It does not have legislation or responsibility in regard to the States. In the past there have been companies which have shown big losses and the State Governments have been very quick to institute inquiries by inspectors appointed under the Companies Acts. In many cases the State Government which appoints an inspector in one State is able to arrange with other States that this inspector be the inspector for the purpose of inspecting in a second or third State. The results of these inspections have been supplied to all Attorneys-General, and all Attorneys-General have been able to read the reports and decide whether any action should be taken and, if so, what action should be taken. However, this is a matter which would not flow from the Commonwealth or from my initiative. ter for Labour and National Service a States like Queensland and Western Ausquestion. In statements made recently in his tralia in contrast with the Sydney to NewDepartment's bulletin and elsewhere the castle complex. participation of women in the work force has assumed increasing significance. Could the Minister at some future time make a statement on this new character of the work force, its long term and social effects on tion is directed to the Minister for Labour work force expansion, and compare this and National Service. Is he aware of thc capacity to absorb women enjoyed by differdecision of the Department of Immigration ent States? I am thinking particularly of a to allow Japanese workers to be brought to comparison in this regard between industry Western Australia by the overseas controlled in States like Queensland and Western Ausmining company, Mount Goldsworthy tralia and industry within the Newcastle to Mining Associates? What industrial code is Adelaide complex. that for some time the Government has instigated into this matter with a view to been attempting to encourage employers to this foreign company being required to recruit women when it was felt that they could fit into the employment pattern, particularly when it was thought that they could take the place of men who could be more effectively employed elsewhere. This applies also to some sections of the Postmaster-General's Department. In this matter we hope to have the closest co-operation of the trade union movement. It should be mentioned that in the latest statistics that are available over a period of one year the work force of women has increased by 6 per cent., compared with an increase in the number of male wage and salary earners of a little over 3 per cent. These figures indicate that employers are becoming increasingly conscious of the pool of labour that is becoming available and the part that women can play in the development of their own industry and in the development of the Commonwealth. The honourable gentleman will be glad to know also that I announced recently in the latest employment statistics that there had been a fall in the number of women registered for employment, although there had been an increase of about 950 in the number of male registrants. I think that the recommendation made by the honourable gentleman is a good one. We have carried out some surveys of female participation and we have noticed an increase in the employment of women in some industries, such as chemical, textile, electronic industries and others.

Nor am I aware of any move that has taken place to permit them to stay there in permanent employment once the mines are working. Nonetheless, I can assure the honourable gentleman that if it were felt that the requisite labour was not available, either the Minister consider whether the present to carry out the construction projects or to do specialized jobs in the production of iron ore, consideration would be given to temporary permits-and temporary permits only-for people to come in. Of course, we have not had to consider yet the particular job involved, but I can say that no-one would be permitted to come in until the Department had first carried out a survey of the possibilities of recruiting Australian labour. If that was not available then, of course, in the interests of the country we would give this consideration. As yet, no commitment has been made.

This Fund is derived from the interest on moneys in the Bankruptcy Estates Account. Ko equivalent provision Stamp duty is payable on cheques drawn or receipts given by a private trustee but not by oflicial receiver acting as trustee Generally speaking, the work of the Bankruptcy Law Review Committee was concerned with revision rather than with reform in the sense of proposing new and fundamental changes. With the exception of provisions relating to arrangements with creditors outside bankruptcy, to which I shall return later, the Committee left the basic structure of law established by the present Act undisturbed. Its proposals were chiefly concerned with remedying defects which have been found to exist in the present law, with simplifying procedures and with effecting some economies in the administration of the bankruptcy law. Nevertheless, these add up to a very great number of detailed, and in many cases important, changes in the existing law. The main emphases that will be gathered from the Bill are, first, the rehabilitation of debtors whose circumstances are due to misfortune; secondly, a strengthening of the provisions aimed at punishment of dishonest debtors, and, thirdly, the encouragement of private trustees to take up the administration of bankrupt estates. I turn now to a consideration of certain lating to arrangements between a debtor and of the provisions of the Bill that I think his creditors outside bankruptcy are to be merit special attention. Honourable members repealed and replaced by an entirely new will note from clause 44 that the amount code. The existing provisions are those in of indebtedness necessary to found a bankParts XI and XII of the present Act. Provision in Bill Bill Clause Upon the commencement of the Act the Bankruptcy Suitors' Fund will be closed olf and the moneys paid into Consolidated Revenue. In future the cost of prosecutions will be paid for by the Commonwealth, also cost of inquiries where the Attorney General so directs. A condition in any contract or agreement for 301 , 302 the sale of any property or any lease, hire purchase agreement or licence that it shall terminate or be modified upon the purchaser, lessee, hirer or licencee becoming bankrupt is void. A like provision applies in relation to any provision in a Bill of Sale, mortgage, lien or charge. Stamp duty not payable on cheques drawn or 311 receipts given by trustee ruptcy petition by a creditor has been increased from £50 to £250. The present minimum of £50 has stood for a long time. It was taken over by the existing Bankruptcy Act from English legislation dating back to 1869. It is wrong, as the Committee has observed, that a man should be made bankrupt when he owes only a relatively small sum and his assets are negligible. The raising of the indebtedness will lessen the opportunity to use the bankruptcy procedures as mere debt collecting machinery. Next, clause 149 of the Bill provides for the automatic discharge of bankrupts after the expiration of 5 years from the time when they became bankrupt, unless some objection is lodged to their discharge. Where an objection is made, the Bankruptcy Court will have discretion to grant or to refuse a discharge or to impose conditions upon a discharge. A bankrupt may himself apply to the Bankruptcy Court for a discharge, before the time for automatic discharge. The provisions of the existing law reHistorically, they are the result of the amalgamation of certain of the State bankruptcy laws in existence at the time the present Bankruptcy Act was enacted. The historical reasons for the form of the present law have been well described by the Committee in paragraphs 271 to 278 of its report. It is sufficient to note that the existin value of the creditors present at the ing Act provides alternative codes of procedure which may be followed where it is not desired by the creditors to have a debtor's affairs administered under the strict procedure of bankruptcy. The Committee took the view that it was unnecessary to have alternative codes of procedure. The new system is set out in PartX of the present Bill. This provides a scheme which is intended to be flexible enough to meet requirements for dealing with a debtor's affairs outside bankruptcy, but which will, at the same time, be subject to the general supervision of the Bankruptcy Courts. Under Part XI of the present Act, proceedings commence with the calling of a meeting of the debtor's creditors. All creditors are consulted, and have a voice in the decisions made. These decisions are binding on all creditors. The creditors may choose the particular form of administration of the debtor's offences appropriate to the case. By contrast, proceedings under Part XII of the present Act do not commence with a meeting of creditors. They are initiated by a debtor voluntarily executing a deed of arrangement in favour of a trustee, usually, but not necessarily, with the knowledge of his principal creditors. The deed is not binding on creditors who do not assenttoit. Part XII is concerned primarily with providing machinery for the registration of deeds, and giving validity to the deeds subject to compliance with prescribed formalities. Under the new Part X, the proceedings will in all cases commence with the calling of a meeting of the debtor's creditors and all creditors will be afforded an opportunity of taking part in decisions made at the meeting. The Bill ensures that appropriate publicity will be given to the calling of a meeting. It will be for the creditors to decide at the meeting whether the debtor's affairs are to be administered outside strict bankruptcy and, if so, the form the administration is to take. The choices available to the creditors under the new Part will be, first, a deed of assignment not unlike a deed under existing Part XI ; second, a deed of arrangement corresponding generally to a deed under existing Part XII; and, thirdly, a composition. The form the administration is to take will be determined by the creditors by special resolution; that is to say, by a majority in number and three-fourths meeting, either personally, by attorney or by proxy. A decision so taken will be binding forthwith and the individual assent of creditors will not be required as it is under the present Act. This will result in greater certainty and expedition. In the interests of maintaining proper control over prodeedings under the new Part, the Bill requires, whatever the form of administration decided upon, that a registered trustee shall be appointed to administer the debtor's affairs under the deed or composition. In addition, in order to avoid the losses that often occur in the assets of a debtor between the nominal commencement of proceedings under existing Part3 XI or XII and the time when a trustee is in full and effective control of the debtor's affairs, the property of the debtor is, under the new Part X, made subject to the control of a ' controlling trustee' immediately upon the debtor giving authority for a meeting to be called. This concept of a 'controlling trustee' is something entirely new in Australian bankruptcy law. I am sure that it will prove to be of considerable practical value. I pass on to refer to the change that has been made in the existing offence provision relating to the obtaining of credit by an undischarged bankrupt. At present, this offence is committed by an undischarged bankrupt who obtains credit to the amount of £20 or upwards. Having regard to the changed value of money, clause 269 of the Bill proposes that this amount be increased to £100. At the same time, because this offence is a prevalent one, the Committee recommended, and the Bill adopts the recommendation, that the penalty should be increased from the present maximum of imprisonment for one year to a maximum of imprisonment for three years. I have referred to changes designed to strengthen the provisions of the existing law aimed at the punishment of dishonest debtors. The Committee recommended a number of substantial changes in the offence provisions of the present Act, including changes to remove existing anomalies. At present, some offences do not apply in relation to arrangements outside bankruptcy. The Bill remedies this unsatisfactory position. In addition, it makes two important changes to the Committee's recommendations. In the first place, the penalty for all the Government has decided to adopt the offences which involve fraud or an intent to defraud has been increased to a maximum of imprisonment for three years. Secondly, provision has been made for a new offence. This is to be found in clause 265(8.) of the Bill. It provides for the punishment of persons who before bankruptcy incur substantial debts without any reasonable chance of making repayment. There is a comparable provision in the uniform companies law under which a penalty may be imposed upon an officer of a company who is party to contracting a debt in like circumstances. The next important feature of the Bill to which I draw attention is the reassessment it makes of the balance of interests between the Crown and private creditors. Clause8 of the Bill provides expressly that its provisions-that is, the provisions of the Bill-ar e binding on the Crown. Moreover, the Bill makes important changes to the position of the Commissioner of Taxation as against a private creditor. Only certain provisions of the existing law are binding on the Crown. The Committee considered that the privileged position of the Crown under the existing law is unfair, having regard particularly to the expanding activities of the Crown in the modern community. The Committee recommended that the Crown ought to be in the same position as other creditors of a debtor. The Government has accepted the Committee's view on this point. The changes made by the Bill with remake it clear that the Commissioner of gard to tax priority deserve special mention. Taxation is as nearly as possible in the same When the existing Bankruptcy Act was position as a private creditor. passed in 1924 priority was given to the Crown in respect of outstanding income tax but the priority was limited to tax the question of income tax instalments which had been assessed before the date of deducted by an employer from the wages bankruptcy and, moreover, was limited to or salary of his employee. Moneys which the amount of one year's assessment. In have been so deducted by an employer are 1942, when the uniform taxation scheme in the nature of trust moneys. Care was introduced, the Crown's position was has been taken, therefore, to ensure that considerably enhanced by giving priority to such moneys do not become available for the Crown in respect of all outstanding the benefit of creditors generally. This has income tax whether assessed before or after been done by preserving specifically the the date of sequestration. That priority has priority now accorded the Commissioner since been continued by section 221 (l.)(b) of Taxation by section 22 1P of the Income of tbe Income Tax and Social Services ConTax and Social Services Contribution tribution Assessment Act. The Committee recommended a return to the position which formerly obtained under the Bankruptcy Act. After much consideration and a weighing of all the competing interests involved, Committee's recommendation. The result is in clause 109 of the Bill. Clause 109, in addition, takes care of the position of creditors who have given an indemnity for costs of litigation in recovering assets of the bankrupt's estate. It has been judicially decided that, under the present legislation, the claims of these creditors are over-ridden by the priority given to the Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. Sub-clause (6.) of clause 109 enables the court to make an order giving indemnifying creditors an advantage over all other creditors, including the Commissioner of Taxation. It has also been held by the courts that the provision in the existing Act, which enables the trustees in bankruptcy to avoid paymenis and other dispositions of property having the effect of giving a preference to a creditor over other creditors does not apply to the Crown. One result of making all of the provisions of the Bill binding upon the Crown is to put the Crown in the same position as a private creditor under the provisions relating to avoidances of preferences. In order to make it clear that the Commissioner of Taxation is able to take advantage of circumstances which protect a payment that would otherwise be voidable as a preference, certain changes have been made to clause 122 of the Committee's Bill. The intention behind these changes is to Special consideration has been given to Assessment Act in circumstances where an employer, who has made deductions from the wages or salary of tiis employee, has failed to pay the deductions to the Commissioner of Taxation and has become bankrupt. In addition, the validity of payments made in respect of deductions to the Commissioner of Taxation by an employer who subsequently becomes bankrupt is specifically protected by clause 123 (4.) of the Bill. Similar provision has been made in respect of deductions of dividend-with holding-ta x under section 221YU of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. The Bill also makes some adjustments between the competing interests of private creditors. These are to be found in clause 109 of the Bill which sets out the priorities for applying the assets of a bankrupt's estate. I particularly invite the attention of the House to the following changes: The amount afforded priority for salary and wages has been increased from £50 to £300 in the case of any one employee. This priority includes, for the first time, amounts summarily. due in respect of long service leave or accrued annual leave. The amount afforded priority for employee's compensation is increased from £200 to £1,000. Having regard to the workers' compensation laws, it will probably be rare for this priority to be applied, but the Bill will provide employees with an appropriate safeguard. Some changes have been made to the existing law relating to the appointment of trustees and to the powers and duties of trustees. These changes are intended to encourage private trustees to accept appointments as trustees of bankrupt estates and. consequently, to relieve the present work load on the official receivers. The provisions relating to trustees are to be found in Part VIII of the Bill. Finally. I refer to clauses 273 and 274 of the Bill which relate to the prosecution of offences. I have here made some alterations to the procedures recommended by the Committee. The existing Act, as the Committee observed, appears in some instances to make the judge of the court both the prosecutor and the judge. This arises Under sections 216 and 217, under which prosecutions are instituted on the initiative of the court. I agree with the Committee th?t the present system should not be retained. I have decided, however, to introduce a rather less complex system than that which the Committee had recommended. It is one that accords more closely with the pattern of the prosecution procedures under other Commonwealth laws. The main features of clauses 273 and 274 as they appear in the Bill before the House are these: (a) Offences carrying a penalty of imprisonment may be prosecuted either summarily or on indictment; (b) summary proceedings may be brought either in a court of summary jurisdiction or in a court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction; (c) in each case, the penalty that may be imposed summarily is limited to imprisonment for one year, and there is a time limit on the bringing of summary proceedings; finally, in each case also, the court has authority to commit for trial. It will be seen, therefore, that imprisonment exceeding one year can be imposed only after trial on indictment before a criminal court and, in addition, that the means are available for bringing a case before a jury even where the proceedings have been commenced that no provision has been made in the Bill for incorporating the present Bankruptcy Courts as a division of the projected Federal superior court? Bankruptcy Court and, of course, State courts may be invested with the Federal jurisdiction in bankruptcy. The Bill retains the present position where there is a Commonwealth Bankruptcy Court. The matter of making the Bankruptcy Court part of a Federal judiciary will be considered in the context of the Federal judiciary as a whole. I have drawn the attention of honourable members to some of the changes made to the existing law by this comprehensive Bill, which is indeed one of the lengthiest pieces of legislation ever introduced in the Commonwealth Parliament. I have given no more than a general description of the painstaking work that has been carried out by the Bankruptcy Law Review Committee. I take this opportunity, therefore, of adding to what I have already said an expression of my appreciation of the valuable public service that the members of the Committee bave performed.",20,Bankruptcy Bill 1965

55,Mr Devine (East Sydney) [11.47],"Other pensioners can be seen walking around Sydney streets pushing barrows in which they collect discarded beer bottles, which they sell to supplement their pensions. Other pensioners may be seen carrying sugar bags over their shoulders in which they collect all manner of things. These happenings are an insult to Australia and to the Government, whioh should do something about them. If you go to Paddy's Market on a Friday you will see many pensioners buying second hand clothing because it is cheap. You will see other pensioners trying on spectacles. Spectacles are not included in social service benents and the pensioners go to Paddy's Market because glasses may be bought there for ls. or 2s. a pair. The pensioners try on the glasses and read something to ensure that the glasses are satisfactory. The New South Wales Department of Child Welfare and Social Welfare, we know, does supply glasses to pensioners, but a means test is applied. I have seen age pensioners in the market trying sets of false teeth, which are sold there. These people go to the market and can be seen standing there actually trying false teeth to see whether they fit. This situation obtains in Australia at present, and we should be ashamed of it, and so should the Government. I should also like to refer to the sickness £18 a week, they pay income tax at the rate benefit. One of my constituents is a migrant who has not been naturalised. She has a son aged 13 years. Because of an accident that she sustained at work, she is unable to work. She received compensation for a time, but this has run out. At present she is receiving sickness benefit of £4 17s. 6d. a week, out of which she is paying £4 a week rent. She is expected to live on the balance of 17s. 6d. Anyone who suggests that this woman is not living in a state of poverty should have his brains washed. The telephone directory in New South Wales lists 109 benevolent and welfare societies that are doing charitable work to try to assist these under-privileged and under-nourished people. We know of the great deeds that are being done by the Red Cross Society and the Matthew Talbot Hostel in Woolloomooloo. The hostel serves approximately 900 meals a day to destitute people or people in receipt of unemployment benefit. The superintendent of the hostel has said that most of these people are in receipt of the unemployment benefit. Because they are receiving only £4 2s. 6d. a week, it is impossible for them to live anywhere except in one of these hostels. They are given a bed for 2s. 6d. a night. If they do not have any money, they are not turned away; they are given a meal. As the honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope) said, we all know of the wonderful work that is being done by the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We also know of the wonderful work that is being done by some of the sisters who go around and look after aged people who are sick and are unable to care for themselves. Stewart) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. to take the opportunity this morning to refer to certain budgetary matters to which I hope the Government will give consideration before the next Budget is prepared. The first matter relates to the age allowance. The Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Act provides that a married couple having attained the ages of 65 and 60 years and not being in receipt of the age pension, shall pay no income tax on an income up to £18 a week. This is the total of the joint age pension and the permissible income for a pensioner couple. On incomes in excess of of 9s. in the £1 on the amount by which their gross income exceeds £18 a week. I mention the gross income, because no concessional deductions are allowed. No deductions are allowed for medical, hospital, dental, optical or pharmaceutical expenses. No deductions are allowed for any moneys they may pay for the education of children, for rates, for calls paid to mining companies, or even for money invested in the search for oil, which the Government is trying to encourage. No deduction is allowed for premiums paid to life insurance companies or even for contributions to a superannuation fund, if one of these people is still contributing to a fund. The effect of all this is that a man and his wife who have provided for superannuation of £25 a week or more receive no benefit whatever from the age allowance. I suggest that quite a number of people have contributed for superannuation of more than £25 a week. The purpose of the age allowance is to place these people at no taxation disadvantage as compared with",30,Grievance Debate
56,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr,,31,Grievance Debate
57,Mr Fox (Henty) [11.58],"I would likepensioner couples. The age allowance is never applied by the Commissioner of Taxation in cases where it will react to the disadvantage of the taxpayer. If the rate of 9s. in the £1 for the amount by which the income exceeds £18 a week results in a higher assessment than the taxpayer would normally receive, the age allowance is not applied. However, I think a very good case could be presented to show that persons who have provided for themselves by contributing to a superannuation fund and thus have saved the taxpayers from having to pay certain amounts of money to them, should be in a better taxation position than a pensioner couple. But the taxation law does not work in this way. In many instances, people have paid a greater amount of contribution to a superannuation fund in a year than they 'have been permitted to deduct from their gross income. At present, the concessional deduction for amounts paid to superannuation funds ancl life insurance companies is limited to £400. I realise that the Act provides that in will receive the greatest assistance when they some instances some of the money paid to need it most. superannuation funds or life insurance companies may be recovered after the taxpayer has reached the age of 65 years. tion expenses.

I also suggest that the Goto pay for his education to claim as a vernment should examine the possibility of deduction the amount he has spent on his permitting those to whom the age allowance education. I believe that parents ought to applies to claim concessional deductions. The second matter I want to raise is the expenses spent on children up to the age, matter of the concessional deductions thempossibly, of 30 years. This could be a startselves. I want to refer especially to the ing point. I have mentioned certain proinability of a taxpayer to carry concessional fessions in which it is impossible for a deductions forward from one year to person to complete his training by the age another. As I mentioned, concessional of 21, and at that stage the student is either deductions include such items as medical, wholly dependent on his parents or he has to hospital, dental and optical expenses. go to work part time to earn sufficient Amounts that have been spent by a taxpayer money to pay for his education. At present on these items can be deducted from his no one is allowed to claim a deduction for gross income before income tax is assessed. the educational expenses incurred. I suggest At present it is not possible to carry the conthat the Government examine the possibility, cessional deductions forward from one year to another. The oflicial reason given for this is that the deductions were designed to assist the taxpayer and if his income is such that he does not pay any income tax, if he has not assessable income and pays no income tax, he therefore requires no assistance. On the face of it, this seems very reasonable. But let me instance the case of a self-employed person who, through illness, loses quite a deal of time from his work and therefore incurs a loss of income. He also incurs a considerable amount of hospital and medical expenses as a result of his illness. At the time when his income is greatly reduced, he finds that he is unable to offset these expenses against his reduced income, if the income has been reduced to the point at which he pays no income tax. The Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Act provides that business losses may be carried forward for a period of years. I suggest that it would be very reasonable to permit concessional deductions to be treated in a like manner so that taxpayers I also want to refer to the matter of educabe able to claim a deduction for educational first of all, of permitting persons up to a certain ageI suggest it could be 30 although other ages could be consideredto claim as a taxation deduction the money spent on their own education. Secondly, I suggest that parents should be able to claim as a deduction moneys spent on educating their children up to the age of 30 years. to refer to a couple of matters in the time at my disposal. First, I make a plea to the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) and the Government to extend national television services to the west coast of Tasmania. We are very pleased with the response from the commercial station in Hobart and I must endorse the remarks of the warden of the Queenstown municipality and the local council in giving all credit to the commercial interests for extending television services to the west coast. However, we are not at all happy with the attitude of the national distance and the equipment available, surely broadcasting service which is very slow in taking any steps in regard to this matter. The residents of this area have waited for a long time. The area is very isolated and suffers from extremes of climate. This is substantiated by the fact that under the income' tax legislation the area is included in zone B. That indicates the conditions under which these people live. We are pleased that after waiting for so long roads aTe being constructed to Mount Reid and Mount Owen and soon the west coast of Tasmania will have the benefit of commercial television. Nevertheless we must have national television programmes as soon as possible. I have referred to the isolation of the area. It is most important that school children attending primary schools, preschool centres and also high schools should have the advantage of national television school broadcasts and school sessions which are transmitted by the national television service in Tasmania. I make a determined plea to the Postmaster-General and the Government to extend the national television service to this part of Tasmania. Whilst speaking on the subject of television, I ask the Government also to consider again the extension of television to King Island in mid-Bass Strait about halfway between Victoria and Tasmania. The island has a population of about 3,000 persons. It has been found impossible to get a signal to the island from Tasmania. Experiments have been carried out from a land mark near Stanley called the Nut but it has been found impossible to send a signal to the island. I should like the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to consider ways and means of experimenting with signals from the Otway Ranges in Victoria. Some years ago I submitted to the Government a plan given to us by the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation of New York which indicated that it would be possible, even with the equipment in existence at that time, to send a signal from the Otway Ranges to King Island and, by boosting it, enable it to reach Tasmania. At that time we were doubtful whether we could have a television service on the north west coast of Tasmania. If it would have been possible to transmit to King Island from Victoria then, having regard to the land contours, the it would be possible now, with improved equipment that must be available, to send signals from the Otway Ranges. In the remainder of the time available to me I wish to refer to the freight subsidy recently granted by this Government in respect of trade between King Island and Melbourne. I request that urgent consideration be given by the Government to making grants under section 96 of the Constitution to Tasmania so that a similar subsidy can be given to shippers who operate between King Island and Tasmania. The subsidy on freight between King Island and Melbourne was granted following numerous representations by members of Government and Opposition parties in both Houses, and following a deputation from the King Island Municipal Council and other interested organisations. I have a copy of the case that was put up by the King Island Council to the Government last year. It was an excellent case and set out the position very well indeed. No doubt it assisted materially in helping the Government make up its mind to grant the subsidy. The announcement earlier this year in respect of the shipping service between Melbourne and King Island provided for a payment of £2 10s. a ton on general cargo. However, the matter that we are very interested in is the reductions that were granted for livestock. In the case of",31,Grievance Debate
58,Mr Davies (Braddon) [12.6],"I wishhorses, bullocks, bulls, cows, steers and heifers the reduction is £3 15s. per head; for yearlings it is £2 15s.; for calves and vealers, £1 15s.; for rams, sheep and lambs, lis.; and for pigs 8s. per head. Without taking into account the Commonwealth subsidy of £2 10s. a ton, the general freight rate for cargo between King Island and Victoria is 133s. per ton. Subtracting the Commonwealth subsidy of £2 10s. a ton, the general rate for cargo between King Island and Victoria will now stand at 83s. a ton. As has been intimated to the Minister in correspondence we are all very delighted that the difficulties of getting stock to the island's traditional markets in Melbourne have at least been recognised, but this places the operation of the existing shipping service, labour and materials. With Government which is an intrastate service, between King Island and Tasmania at a distinct disadvantage. The shipping service from King Island to Melbourne has been operated by R. Houfe and Co., and due to rising costs their freight rate has risen steadily to the current granting by this Government of a very good rate of 133s. per ton. I have intimated that if we deduct 50s. a ton the freight is reduced to 83s. Due to good management, Kimberley King Island Trading Pty. Ltd. has been able to stabilise its freights at a reasonable level of 108s. per ton between King Island and Tasmania. Consequently, this company was successful in obtaining a contract from the King Island Dairy Co. for the freighting of butter from King Island to Tasmania. Previously this butter had been shipped to Melbourne but, because of the favorable rates available from Kimberley King Island Trading Pty. Ltd., the butter has been shipped in recent times from King Island to Devonport. This cargo amounts to 1,000 tons per year, of which approximately 850 tons are eventually shipped overseas I want to take this opportunity to register In addition, Kimberly King Island Tradvery considerable protest, and indeed ing Pty. Ltd. has boosted its earnings alarm, at the failure of the Government to because of the increased amount of wool take one defence measure which is essential carried, due again to the reasonable freight for the security of Australia.

I , the year 1963-64, 510 head of cattle went for one, do not think that there will be any to Tasmania. In addition, a large volume of crisis involving Australia's defence in the goods is imported to King Island from Tasnext few years; but this is a matter of chance mania. These include timber, cement, coke and coal, fruit, potatoes, fuels and oils, flour, superphosphate, farm machinery and vehicles. A very important aspect of this matter is that government departments on King Island, namely the Postmaster-General's Department and the Public Works Department, are wholly dependent on supplies and equipment from Tasmania. In the event of the withdrawl of the Tasmanian shipping services these supplies would have to be shipped to King Island via Victoria. The general conditions of contract, as laid down by the Public Works Department, demand that all government contracts must be of Tasmanian origin, utilising Tasmanian contracts already in progress and future contracts in the offing, Tasmanian tenderers will be eliminated by the lack of shipping facilities and the high cost of shipping from Tasmania via Victoria. I point out that this position has been brought about by the subsidy, but one which applies only to freight between King Island and Victoria. The general subsidy of £2 10s. Od. a ton given by the Government places the Tasmanian operators at a very distinct disadvantage with the operator between King Island and Victoria. I believe that I am speaking for honourable members of all parties when I say that we in Tasmania seek from the Government a grant to the Tasmanian Government under section 96 of the Constitution so that this anomaly can be rectified and so that the Kimberley King Tsland Trading Pty. Ltd. will be in a position to continue its services in the very efficient and able manner in which it has conducted tbem in the past.",33,Grievance Debate

We would lose a litde interest, that it has been in contact with oil comperhaps, but against that we would save panies to see whether the tanks could be the risks of devaluation. These matters can kept at a higher level. It is not possible, of be set one against the other. course, to keep them absolutely full; but they can be kept at a higher average level. is costless oil, and in view of the fact that This a good thing; it is a most immediate this could be the life blood of Australia if thing to do and the Government has done there should be any defence emergency or it The second thing is one which, again, is catastrophe-thi s is possible, although I have to do is to build up our oil storage capacity and stocks. The long term thing we We need, I should think, another 10 The stocking and filling of these tanks is is a real backing and is always available because if at any future date we should want to turn it back into money we would I put it that the actual oil that is stored think it is unlikely; but it is still likely enough to insure against-the advantages of having it are terrific. Although the only way to meet our defence requirements quickly is to build up our stocks, I do not for one moment discount the other necessity of increasing oil exploration in Australia to make ourselves self-sufficient as soon as we can. And over the medium term, by pipelines, by booster stations on existing pipelines and by provision for flush extraction from known fields, such as Moonie, we can give ourselves some protection. But we cannot do this quickly and we may be faced with a short term emergency. Any tankerage we install will not be wasted or lost because it can be incorporated into thj scheme of Australian oil production at some later date. I think that the Government is playing a very risky game by not doing this. The security of Australia is in peril. During this recess-no t when Parliament meets again-le t the Government do something about it. Speaker, honourable members of this Parliament will appreciate that in 1959 we passed a measure entitled "" A Bill for an Act to provide for the grant of Leases, Licences and Trading Rights in connection with Commonwealth Airports"". For us to do so was right and proper. I say that because it is well known that, surrounding aerodromes, there are substantial areas of land purchased by the Commonwealth, in some cases cheaply and in others at very -high cost. It is desirable that the Department of Civil Aviation, to wit the Commonwealth, should make available such portion of those lands, or such portions of airport premises, as are likely to return revenue to the Commonwealth itself. The terms and conditions under which land-and I speak particularly of landcan be made available are set out in the Act. The land can be leased. It can be leased for a period of three years without any difficulty insomuch as tenders need not be called. But public tenders must be called if a lease is to be granted for a period longer than three years. In my opinion this Parliament missed an opportunity to help municipalities adjoining airports to secure occupancy of such land at a nominal rent. It failed to insert in the legislation any proApart altogether from the disadvantage that vision to allow a municipality either adjacent to an airport, or far removed for that matter, to obtain a preferential right to some of that land for the installation of such amenities as recreational facilities for its citizens. It is generally recognised that people living adjacent to aerodromes are faced with some serious disadvantages because of noise. That has to be taken into consideration. In addition, the normal expansion of municipalities has been substantially retarded by the acquisition of these aerodromes. For instance, at Tullamarine an area of, 1 think, more than 2,000 acres was resumed by the Commonwealth. A few months ago, the progressive city of Keilora city noted for its interest in the provision of recreational facilities for its citizens-applie d to the Department of Civil Aviation for occupancy of an area of land near the Tullamarine airport for the purpose of establishing a golf links. The city authorities were promptly informed by the Director General of Civil Aviation that they could get a lease for three years without public years would be completely futile for a golf course. They were also informed that they could take their chance if and when public tenders were called for a longer lease of any portion of this land. Vvhen that situation arose they communicated with me and I sent a letter to the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), or perhaps to the Deputy absence of the Prime Minister. I suggested that the Act should be amended to ensure that a preference was granted to municipalities which sought land for the purpose of establishing recreational facilities for their people, particularly the young people. That letter was acknowledged over two months ago. I think that, at least, the Keilor Shire Council was entitled to notification of a decision about the matter, if any had been made, or, if it had not been made, then why it had not been made. The Council should have been notified much earlier than this. It does not matter so much about notifying me. There has been no word received yet. Surely it is not to be said that Cabinet could not make a speedy decision as to whether or not it was prepared to amend the Act along the lines I have indicated. such municipalities have incurred by the presence of these aerodromes, it is desirable",34,Grievance Debate

Why there has been no answer to my letter and why no decision as been made. I do not know. I have been patient and the authorities have been patient. Incidentally, the city of Keilor has a population of 40,000 people and is growing very rapidly. I hope I will be supported by honourable members in the attitude I take. WhatI grieve about is the long period of time that has elapsed without any decision apparently being made. This Parliament has now been in session for some months. Surely something could be done about this matter. Either the Government believes that the land should be made available or it does not. If it is against the proposal, it should say so out of common decency to the people concerned. The Government's dilatoriness in this matter is even less understandable in the light of an advertisement that I have clipped from the "" Australian "". It statesCommonwealth of Australia. Department of Civil Aviation. Tender Schedule C64/204. Long Term Lease of Land. Adelaide Airport. Several valuable large areas of land at Adelaide Airport are available for long term lease for use as business sites. An area suitable for the construction of a golf course can be made available. Adelaide Airport is situated only 31 miles from the centre of the City of Adelaide and the sites available are adjacent to transport and all other services. Tenders for the lease of this site or sites will supply and to ensure continuity of water close with the Secretary, Central Business Board, Department of Civil Aviation, 499 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 31si March, 1965. Interstate inquiries may be directed . . . And so on. Surely, after two months delay some decision should be made about the Keilor City Council's application. I urge that the authorities be given the courtesy of a decision and I urge, above all things, that the decision be a favorable one. Additional recreational facilities are badly needed in this country, particularly in the metropolitan areas where every day buildings are crowding in and shutting out the fresh air. More particularly is special consideration necessary where municipalities have been cramped, as is the case wilh the City of Keilor, the City of Broadmeadows and the municipality of Bulla, the boundaries of which all adjoin Tullamarine airport. I ask for more consideration, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, in the time at my disposal this morning I would like to enlarge on something that I referred to in this House last week, namely the importance of irrigation to Australia. I shall read from a paper recently presented to a symposium by a very eminent hydrological scientist. The paper commenced with the statementIt is rather surprising that, after 80 years' development in the application of diverted waters to land systems in Australia, it is still necessary to make a case to persuade Australians that further irrigation development is essential. It is equally surprising that it is necessary to outline our present indebtedness to existing irrigation. I do not want to go into too much detail, but I do want to refer to something which was said by the Minister for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn) this morning in answer to a question asked by me. It relates to a matter that is concerning quite a lot of people in my electorate and further down the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems. I refer to the possibility of damming more water in the upper reaches of those rivers. It is believedI hope to get some confirmation or otherwise of thisthat further damming of both river systems could be carried out. These dams would be in addition to the Blowering Dam and the Cumberland Dam on the Murrumbidgee. It is also suggested that further damming could be carried out on the Murray River above the Hume Weir to supplement the present supplies along both river systems during lengthy periods of drought. There is one other matter that I suggest should be given serious consideration. It relates to an investigation into the advisability and practicability of putting low level locks and weirs along the lower reaches of these rivers to ensure continuity of water supply for those people who have installed pumping systems. I refer in particular to the people in the Hay and Balranald districts in my electorate who now enjoy the benefit of insurance against drought conditions as a result of having installed pumping systems which have not cost the Government anything. Not only has it given them excellent insurance against drought at",36,Grievance Debate
62,Mr Armstrong (Riverina) [12.34].,"great cost to themselves, but it has also made a very great contribution to the national economy. I wish to refer, now, to the whole question of irrigation. Something like 40 per cent, of our total rural income is earned by the irrigation areas of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The most important point to emphasise about irrigation is that in a country of great uncertainty of rainfall, it ensures continuity of supply and provides an assured income for those who work small areas of land. It is to this aspect of intensive cultivation that I should like to refer briefly. Let me take vegetable growing first. To date it has been traditional for vegetable growing areas to be in fairly close proximity to our metropolitan areas. I suggest that we are rapidly coming to the time when the bulk of our basic vegetables will be drawn from our irrigation areas. It is interesting to note in passing-thi s is probably still going on-that a few weeks ago 1,500 tons of foodstuffs a day as well as 4,000 tons at the weekend was being sent to Sydney from the Griffith irrigation area. It probably comprised products from the whole of the Murrumbidgee irrigation area. This was enough to feed the metropolitan area of Sydney for two days. What has astounded me, and what has attracted the attention of people far more eminent than I am in the scientific world is the fact that certain people are openly fighting irrigation. Of course, other questions are involved, and I do not wish to refer to them. But I wonder whether, in our daily thinking, we realise how much benefit scientific research and scientific experimentation have been to us and how fortunate we are that this country has had such strong and trusted allies that we have been able to devote practically the whole of our scientific research to the benefit of our people and have not been required to devote it to other purposes. It is never a good thing to take extreme views on these matters, but the violent differences in academic opinion have produced thoughts to which I do not subscribe. I draw the attention of the House to the following article which appeared in a periodical of very good reputeIn Australia we have not only an appetite for national greatness; we have an urgent need to build something more than an artificial perimeter of defence about a rather empty barren land. In our ambition to develop a highly civilised nation we might sustain a serious blow by allowing to develop a theory, which, by ignoring all the historical experience of men in such geographical conditions as ours, could divert Australia from her road to greatness. This movement for the most part comes from a group of academics sheltered in metropolitan universities. Their case may be summarised briefly. ' Irrigation is uneconomic '. It is claimed lhat ' the annual dividend from irrigation agriculture does not justify the capital expenditure. Australia would do well to cease planning new, or extending old, irrigation settlements'. Make no mistake, the truth or otherwise of this is of supreme importance to our country. The advocates for irrigation have not pointed out that the yearly cash dividend from a university does not justify the capital expenditure. They know that the size of a yearly cash return is not the only way to judge the worth of a university. But do the academics realise there are other ways of assessing the dividends from irrigation? That there is an ' invisible return'? For example, have they forgotten that in arid countries the availability of university education might be influenced by the extent and success of irrigation? Is it possible that a nation's culture, indeed all her future greatness, may be profoundly influenced by her irrigation base? . . . That is the lesson of history. Mr Jeff Bate -Who said that? written by a Mr E. Hennessy. I shall give the document to the honourable member afterwards, but I assure him that I am not capable of originating it myself. It draws our attention to the importance of putting things in their proper perspective and to how vital irrigation is to us at a time when we get what is unfortunately the too oft repeated phenomenon of drought in this country. Last week in this HouseI referred to the amount by which we shall have to increase our primary production. I refer in particular now to our wool clip. We will require to increase our sheep numbers by about 50 million if we are to feed the increased population that we shall have in the next 20 years. This increase will be needed more for the supply of meat than for wool and will proportionally add to the strong wool in our clip. But all these things add up to the fact that more water is required, and I certainly hope that more can be done to assist the pumping systems to which I have referred in my area. I hope that the investigation which I have suggested will soon be made into the advisability and practicability of establishing dams and weirs at the places I have mentioned in order to",37,Grievance Debate
63,Mr Armstrong,"That article wasprovide a greater area of that country with an assured water supply. very much that I have only a couple of minutes within which to express my great disapproval of and my strong protest at the management of the business of this House by the present Government. There is no doubt that there is grave dissatisfaction both inside and outside the House at the way in which the affairs of this House are being conducted. We first met for this sessional period on 16th March. From then until Easter we virtually talked just for the sake of talking. Every procedure that could be adopted in order to keep business before the House was adopted. The Whips were continually asking members to come into the Chamber and make speeches on the particular topics that might have been before the House for discussion. At that stage, no real attempt was made by the Government to bring down any important items of legislation. Certainly, only very few important pieces of legislation came before us. Now, in the dying hours of the sessional period, the notice paper is full of important matters. There is a Bill to make certain amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act. There is a Bill relating to tbe re-establishment of national service trainees. There is a Bill relating to State grants minutes to 1 o'clock.

I had intended to propose another amendment, but, on reflection, I thought that it would probably have been out of order. SoI decided to propose the amendment that I have just moved. This, I think, will give the House an opportunity to decide whether it really wants science education and whether the Government, in this scientific and technological age, is doing a great deal for science education or whether it is just fooling the people by pretending to do something that it has no intention of doing.

When I spoke on the original measure a year ago, I saidIf rbe Government were really interested in assisting the States with science education in their of Australian education, but to the electoral secondary schools, does anybody believe for one minute that it would go about it in this way? . . . Would there not be an investigation of the relationship between the needs of science and the needs of the other parts of the educational system? Would not some evidence be produced to show that this, rather than some other, method was indeed the best way of meeting the needs of the States out of available resources? Those questions are just as valid today as they were when I posed them a year ago, Mr Speaker. They were not answered then. They have not been answered by the operation of the scheme in the past year. And they are not answered, and no answer is attempted, in the Prime Minister's second reading speech on this Bill. We are asked to accept the right honourable gentleman's assurance that the value of this form of aid has been demonstrated over the past year. We are given a table of the amounts granted, and the number and type of schools to which the grants have been made. But we are not told how this scheme fits into a general plan for science education in Australia. We are not told that, because, of course, there is no plan. We are not told how the scheme is helping to meet the real needs of the States in the fields of science and general education. We are given no information, because the Government has none to give. It does not know, because it has refused to conduct the sort of inquiry into education which all the State Premiers want, and have so often requested over the last five or six years. We are not told whether the schools in most need have received the most assistance. We believe that the schools that have benefited are not the schools for the poor but, rather, the schools for the better-off section of our society. Plainly, the Government cannot answer this most important question which I have posed, because the method of allocation does not provide that need shall be the first priority. The scheme works in the opposite direction. It is elementary that before public moneys are disbursed for any reason, some inquiry should be made into the need for spending, and the way in which the spending will be done. We all know why this elementary precaution was neglected in this case. We all know that this proposal originated with the back-room boys of the Liberal Party of Australia. If there was any consideration of need, it was with reference not to the real and pressing needs needs of the Liberal Party. By its nature, the proposal was slip-shod. It was given legislative form in a hotch-potch way last year. And the most surprising feature of this present Bill is that it will do nothing to improve, amend or give efficiency to the original proposal as it was invented in the heat and anxiety of the 1963 Senate election campaign. In his second reading speech, the Prime Minister himself confessed, by implication, that there was no preliminary investigation as to the real needs and requirements of the States. He saidThe States have not, for their own good internal reasons, been able to spend in this year all the money made available to them. There can be only one reason why this has happened: There was no prior consultation with the States as to their real needs, the Commonwealth's proposal was not in any way based on a study of the needs of the States, and no attempt was made to dovetail the administration of this scheme with the administrative processes of the Education Departments of the States. How else can we account for the fact that the States have not been able to spend all the money allocated to them under the original Act? Further, how can we explain the great apparent difference in the way the States have distributed the money which they have spent? What are the reasons behind these vast divergences in expenditure? For instance, New South Wales is providing facilities for 80 government schools. However, Victoria, with a smaller allocation -and there are 3,000,000 people in Victoria as against 4,000,000 in New South Wales-is providing facilities for 167 government schools or more than double the New South Wales figure. Again, the Queensland allocation for government schools is a little over half the allocation for government schools in Victoria. Yet Queensland is providing facilities for only 11 government schools-o r public schools, according to differing nomenclatures-and that represents just one-fifteenth of the number provided for in Victoria. The population of Queensland is half that of Victoria and Queensland occupies an area of 668,000 square miles and Victoria only 88,000 square miles. On the surface at least, these are great differences, if not anomalies. Why is the money provided by the Commonwealth being spent in such obviously different ways from State to State? Why does the nature of the Victorian Government's distribution of its grant differ so greatly from that of New South Wales and Queensland? This Bill is not designed to allocate money to non-government schools-cal l them denominational schools or independent schools if you will-it is designed to allocate money to government schools as well as to non-government schools. What special factors in the field of science applications received are being processed education operate in the States, and in particular in the StatesI have mentioned? Clearly, each of the II schools in Queensland is receiving much more than each of the 167 schools in Victoria. I pose the question: Why? Surely, the Commonwealth Parliament, which is asked to vote this money, has a right to have answers to these questions. Surely, the Commonwealth Government, which now claims to be making a contribution to science education, has a right and an obligation to give answers to these questions. But the Prime Minister has made no attempt to answer them. We can only conclude, therefore, that the Commonwealth Government has no real plan for science education, and has no detailed knowledge of how its so-called programme is operating, or how tbe money we are giving the States is being used for the benefit of the children of Australia and the advancement of science education in Australia. When we come to the question of grants to independent schools, lack of information and lack of preparation are equally apparent. The simple and disgraceful fact is that after a year of operation, the House is told no more about how the money given to the independent schools is being allocated, according to real need, than it was last year. The original Act divides Australian secondary schools into two categories, government and non-government, and it makes a further subdivision of this second category into Catholic and non-Catholic, or in the words of the Act ""others"". The latter description illustrates, if I may say so. how a really courageous' parliamentary draughtsman can dismiss the Diet of Worms, the Thirty-Nine Articles, the Council of Trent and the current Vatican Ecumenical Council with one sweeping stroke. According to this Government the people who are not Catholics are just"" others "". In his second reading speech on the original Bill the Prime Minister said that the division of schools would be "" adapted to the needs of the schools for science buildings and equipment as the scheme develops "". Well, the scheme has been developing-presumably-for a year now. But we have no more information now than we had then as to how the needs of the independent schools are being defined, and how they are being met. We know that by regional committees reporting to the Government. We do not know what principle of need these committees operate upon. And while there are two separate types of regional committees-thos e dealing with the Catholic schools and those dealing with the other independent schools-w e do not know how the needs of one type of school are co-related to the needs of the other type of school. For instance, there are, indeed, some struggling Catholic secondary schools. There are some very rich Anglican secondary schools. What principle is embodied in this Bill to ensure that the poor school gets justice vis-a-vis the rich school? There is none. Under the scheme embodied in this legislation, it is absolutely inevitable that anomalies and injustices will occur, and yet in a Bill designed to secure the operation of the scheme for a further three years, no proposals have been made to alleviate these injustices. Their very existence is not even recognised. It is true that the Government has appointed a Standards Committee, consisting of some very distinguished educationalists, but we are not told what standards tbe Standards Committee applies. The essential question is: Are its standards standards of need? If not, then this scheme is operating unjustly. Thus, this scheme is both unjust and unreal. It is unjust, because it does not apply the right standards. It is unreal, because while the Government pretends that it represents a worthwhile contribution to science education, it is not related to the real needs of either science education or education in general. Such needs will not be met, and they will not even be understood, until we have a national inquiry into education at all levels. It is not enough to provide a few million pounds for science buildings and equipment, allocated in this dubious fashion, and then claim that a really important step forward has been made in education. In 1963, the Science Committee of the New South Wales Teachers Federation prepared a report on the minimum requirements for the effective teaching of the fourtralian education can be easily stated. It year science course prescribed by the New South Wales Secondary Schools Board. These minimum requirements included the following: No class should consist of more than 24 pupils; there should be one full time adult assistant for every two laboratories; and a science research and distribution centre should be established and should be staffed by experienced science teachers. The Committee concluded that at least £23 million would be required in New South Wales alone to bring science teaching facilities up to standard. The scheme in the Bill before us which allocates, in a disjointed fashion, £15 million over three years for the whole Commonwealth-remembe r that £23 million was required to be spent in New South Wales alone-doe s nothing substantial to meet these needs. It is a miserable contribution to the educational needs of the people. Indeed, by its rejection of vital recommendations of the Martin Committee's report on teacher training, the Government has ensured that these real needs will not be met at all. The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Harold Wilson, a great world figure who belongs to the same school of political ideology as my colleagues and I do, recently pointed out that of all the scientists and mathematicians whom the world has produced since Pythagoras, Archimedes, and even Euclid, 97 per cent, are still living. This indicates, in graphic terms, the type of scientific and technological age in which we are living. It is our duty to meet the needs of the world in which we are living. We cannot meet the challenge that is before us unless we have science teachers. We could equip every school in Australia with wonderfully modern, gleaming laboratories, but unless we provide the teachers, all such efforts are futile. We will not make any great advances in education and we will not achieve that ""revolution in education""-the Prime Minister used those words -whic h found so unlikely an advocate as the Prime Minister himself at the last elections, until we begin to plan. There cannot be a plan for education unless and until we abandon the piecemeal process of election time bargaining and of treating education as a political football. The principle behind any plan for Ausmust be that every Australian child shall be provided, without discrimination, with the opportunity to obtain the highest degree of education which he or she is capable of receiving. That great goal will not be reached, it will not even be approached, if the Commonwealth continues to treat education in the piecemeal, planless fashion of the past; nor will it be attained by half-hearted, half-baked schemes such as the one now before the House. If we are to achieve the revolution in education which we must have if we are to survive in this modern world and which all right thinking people desire, we need the fullest possible information upon which to build. That, as the Labour Party has insisted again and again, and will continue to insist, is why it is imperative to have a national inquiry into all levels and all types of education. Without such an inquiry and the plan for education which would emerge from it, Australia will continue to fall behind the advanced nations of the world and existing injustices and gross inefficiencies will be perpetuated. In this House a couple of years ago I said that on education we were spending only as much per head of population as Turkey and Egypt were spending. In the next year we were spending about as much per head of population as Portugal and Spain were spending. We will not have a properly educated people until we are prepared to spend as much per head of population as is being spent in the United States and the Soviet Union. The people of those countries are spending much more than we are spending. The people of Great Britain are spending much more, too. This Bill is not part of a plan for a scientific revolution, or for fundamental changes in education in general, for the simple reason that there is no plan to which it can be related. Like the Government's scholarship scheme, it does not go near the heart of the real problem. The Governmonwealth trying to meet the needs of all ment likes to speak about equality of of them. opportunity, but in Australia equality of opportunity as far as education is concerned is a myth. The handicaps suffered dum. by the poorer half of our children are serious, permanent and cumulative. It is not enough to say that a few very brilliant need a referendum. 1 am not so sure children from poorer homes can, by dint that at this stage such a referendum of great sacrifices on the part of their would be carried. We would need to parents, achieve the university education educate the public to do the right thing by which the children from richer homes can their children and by Australia, in order take for granted. That is not genuine to have the referendum carried. In its own equality of opportunity. Equality of opporway, that would be a big educational tunity requires that the average student obligation which would be imposed upon from poorer homes will have the same the Commonwealth, whatever the political chances as the average student from richer persuasion of the government of the day homes. Further it requires that those who might be. suffer particular handicaps, by reason of their background, will receive special benefits to enable them to overcome those handicaps. The Labour Party's scholarships proposal what the Prime Minister likes to call "" divera proposal which would give benefit to sity"". There is no reason whatsoever why every parent and every child without disuniformity of standards should mean concrimination-is a step towards achieving formity. Our aim as a nation, therefore, some measure of equality of opportunity. I should make no special claim for that proposal quality and equality. beyond saying that it is a first step; but at least it is an honest attempt to tackle the problem in a realistic way. In one respect, the Bill does represent a real advance because the Government now adopts the proposition that the Commonwealth should accept greater responsibility in the field of education. Back in 1943 Having had the privilege of listening to the the present Prime Minister, before he Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) for became as conservative as he is today, about 25 minutes and hearing him wonder wrote an article in the Melbourne "" Herald"" whether or not a revolution is occurring in in which he advocated Commonwealth education, we have to compare him, in a control of education.

It says that it will not oppose the legislation if the The essential proposition put forward by Government's handling of this matter. Last year when we debated this matter members of the upper echelon of the Opposition -the y were more interested in this matter then than they are now-mad e the point that they were interested in all forms of education but that they wanted to help the scholar, not the school. Here is the essential differences between the attitudes of the Opposition and Government supporters: The Opposition does not want to treat the various phases of Australian education equally. The Opposition would deal differently with scholars in government and non-government schools. In other words, the Opposition looks at the non-government system of education not as a system but as a body containing disparate and separate individuals. a lot of individuals and it is also a system. The Opposition says that it will not recognise the system but will give money to individuals. Let us look at the philosophy behind that proposition. In the 19th century one of the great battles fought was over the recognition of trade unions. not there. more association with trade unions than the honourable member for Scullin realises. One of the great battles fought in the 19th century was over the right of unionists and working men to belong to union bodies. Honourable members will realise that with the repeal of the old anti-combination acts working men were no longer recognised as a lot of separate and disparate individuals. They had claims as an organisation. Following acceptance of their claims to be an organisation, on many occasions down through history t'hey have exerted a great and beneficial innuence in society. The way in which we recognise the nongovernment system of education is in the same stream of history. We recognise these people not merely as disparate and separate individuals but as having a claim to a respected system in our society. In this way we are carrying on in the same tradition as was initiated when working men in trade unions achieved their right to be recognised in their own voluntary systems of organisations. This is an important principle and I would like to hear some honourable mem: bers opposite argue against it if they dare. One of the other things that is rather intriguing about this matter is the changing views that seem to come from the Opposition from time to time. The Opposition's views are not ones of principle or ones which have been constant. They seem to vary in cycles of four, five or six years. I think we should look at some of the history of the Opposition in this respect. When we look at it over the last 10 or 12 years we find that it has changed its views three times. Of course, the consciences of honourable members opposite have changed. They may change all at once; that is their problem. But they have changed. In 1953 we know that the Labour Party decided to recognise all systems of education without discrimination against any. We know that during that time certain right wing elements in the Party fought over this matter. Now, faithfully, the Leader of the Opposition and his followers agree with that principle. He campaigned about it, and campaigned about it very fervently. Then certain events happened in 1955 and 1956. In my own State of Queensland, they happened in 1957. As a result of these changes, Opposition members in unison suddenly decided that what they had said in 1953 was incorrect. They now said: ""We will not recognise all systems of education equally. We will recognise only one kind of education and we will disadvantage any kind that does not come within our direct control"". And so they went on. changes once a fortnight. honourable member for Bendigo is not a very good student of history. Then we come to 1963. Let us look at the attitude of members of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labour Party in 1963. This is very interesting. The New South Wales Branch of this party still had a lot of good men. There were a couple in Queensland, but they seemed to have changed in thc other States. In 1963, this unswerving conscience of members of the New South Wales Branch changed once again. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) put it last year, this unswerving Christian conscience changed again. For a",43,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965

81,Mr Kevin Cairns,"Obviously thecouple of weeks, they decided that they would recognise all systems of education equally. Then, of course, there was a migration into New South Wales of certain very prominent people in the Australian Labour Party and the views of the New South Wales Branch changed once again. All this happened within a period of 11 or 12 years and I understand that yesterday an attempt was made by some people to alter the policy of the party again. In this field of education, the Government has had the innate courage to adopt certain policies. It has adopted them against the opposition of honourable members opposite and the people who stand behind them. The people of this country realise and appreciate the bigness of the policy that the Government has implemented and they will continue to appreciate it. I had a nice little speech ready to deliver this afternoon, but the Leader of the Opposition raised so many enticing propositions that I find it almost impossible to move away from them. The Leader of the Opposition also said, as an addendum to the first part of his speech, that he is really interested in the poorer children; that he is interested only in those children who do not have adequate resources. Let us look at what Labour education Ministers have done and let us see whether they are interested in the poorer children in the community. Tasmania? that now. The Minister of Education in Tasmania presumably has the same political philosophy as the Leader of the Opposition has. When the Commonwealth Government introduced its scholarship scheme and made this money available to children in their last two years at school, it realised that the Tasmanian Government already had a scheme of this type. The Tasmanian Government had a matriculation allowance scheme, which was subject to a means test and which was available to the children of parents with a lower income than the average. It was designed to help them. The Minister would go around Tasmania and say: ""We are the friends of the poor. We are helping these people."" When the Commonwealth Government introduced its scholarship scheme, some of these children received money that F.4767/65 -R -[67 ] we distributed under it. But what did this friend of the poor in Tasmania do? He immediately withdrew his assistance to the poor children excuse the pessimism that leads Opposition members to imagine that all State governments are Liberal, but one or two governments of their own political colour are still left. We can then ask the question: To what extent has the Tasmanian Ministe deprived these children of the money that we wanted to give to them? I made some quick calculations-it is amazing what can be done with a slide rule-and I arrived at the figure of £12,000 a year, give or take a little. That is the attitude of this Minister of Education. When Labour Governments have a responsibility, they stand four square with the attitude that Opposition members here have adopted and have always professed. I think it is worthwhile to mention some of the decisions of the Perth Conference of the Australian Labour Party. the honourable member that that matter is not before the Chair. ciple that is involved relates to a more efficient organisation of the resources in Australia that can be devoted to education. Opposition members from time to time say that we should provide more money for education. But it is not sufficient to come here and merely claim that we should give more money. It is also pertinent, one would think, to ask the question: How can we raise more money for education in Australia? Let us look at the scheme that we put into operation last year. Of the £5 million distributed then, some £3.66 million was distributed to Government Departments of Education, and this was spent on education as a result of our activities. About £1.33 million to be spent on education was distributed to nongovernment schools. Let us have a look at what we mean here. When we look at the science facilities that were built in Australia last year and are being built this year largely as a result of our distribution of £1.33 million, we find by any conservative estimate that this has attracted almost another £2 million for education.

87,Mr Kevin Cairns,"The other prinwords, as a result of our distribution of £1.33 million in this way, we have been responsible, although indirectly, for the expenditure of some £3.33 million on the teaching of science. This, I would suggest, is an efficient use of the resources available What would be the position of those parents for education in Australia, and it is the type in Australia who did not want socialism of use of our resources that will raise the standards of this country more quickly than any other will. It is not a direct charge on taxation; it is a charge on people who pay their 6d., ls. or other small amounts. Our entry into this field has caused this extra amount of money to be spent on education. When we look at the education efforts in the various States, I think we must take this view. We have to look not only at what is spent directly but also at what is spent indirectly. In my own State, I am happy to say, the people generally do more to help themselves in this field than the people in any other State do. Over 30 per cent, of the school children in the 14 years and over age group have been helped because thek parents wanted to help themselves. This is the way to raise money for expenditure on this field, and the Government has given a lead in this respect. I come now to the last proposition of the Leader of the Opposition. He would appoint a very powerful Minister for Education. Barton? mind the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns). could not do better. to education in his spare time. The honourable member, we presume, would be in the running to be appointed Minister for Education, as proposed not only by the Australian Labour Party Conference but by the Leader of the Opposition. There would be some interesting features about his distribution of the resources in education. His proposals have certainly intrigued me, and I think on previous occasions they have intrigued the members of this House. Writing during 1963 in a magazine called ""Descent"" he spoke about this matter and discussed the conditions under which he would distribute money for education. Let us have a look at what he said. He stated in this article that resources would not be distributed for education "" if what is taught is significantly inconsistent with socialism "". That would be the attitude of the honourable member for Yarra towards money to be distributed for education. We can ask this question: taught to their children? Is the money to be withdrawn from them? In a central ministry of education in which the honourable member for Yarra would have great say would that be the policy? Those people who have listened to the Leader of the Opposition and are aware of the types of persons who would be appointed as ministers of education should, I think, be very frightened at the prospect. to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) in which he branded the measures before us as unplanned, piecemeal and grossly inadequate. I remind the House at the outset that we are dealing with three Bills at the present time, namely the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill, the Universities (Financial Assistance) Bill and the States Grants (Technical Training) Bill. Up to this stage, of course, we have been preoccupied with the first of those Bills which deals with science laboratories. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) could be charged with having made a worthwhile contribution to educational thought. There were a couple of matters that he mentioned in a rather rambling discussion upon which I want to comment. First of all, he charged the Opposition, while supporting the measures, with insisting on impossible conditions. What are the impossible conditions that the Labour Party is suggesting? One impossible condition, so called, is a call for a national inquiry into primary, secondary and technical education in this country. Since when has that become so impossible to the Liberals? This is a call that has been made by every Minister for Education, Liberal or Labour, throughout the continent of Australia. The Australian Educational Council, which is comprised of Ministers for Education, as recently as a year ago, renewed its call for this national inquiry. The honourable member tried to insinuate that whilst this inquiry was being held the",46,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965

92,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [3.8],"I riseLabour Party would be prepared to do nothing in respect of primary and secondary education. He wants to have a look at the last two-to my recollection-electio n policy speeches of the Opposition and he will see one important item. This is that we are prepared to make £10 million available for primary and secondary education as an interim measure whilst a survey is being carried out. The honourable member chided -the Labour Party with changing its views on education. It would be a funny old world if we did not change our ideas. Maybe it is the conservatism in which thc honourable member is steeped which makes him look at this situation as something of an oddity. I would remind him that he did not change his own ideas, they were changed for him. One morning he woke up to find that his ideas were altogether different from anything he had ever espoused before, simply because the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) in a desperate effort to cling to office, when he had a one-seat majority in this House, decided that he was going to take the risk and bring in some measure to aid private schools. However, that is not the consideration in which I am involving myself. The measures we have before us should be dealt with on their merits, and that is the way I intend to deal with them. Under the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill the Government is proposing to renew for a further period of three years a £5 million grant to all schools providing science facilities in the Commonwealth of Australia. The grant applies to government and non-government schools. There is an amount of £5 million for the whole of Australia. Let us weigh that up, first of all, against the student poputhat in the last 10 years the proportion of lation in Australia. In 1964 government schools, primary and secondary, had 1,801,311 pupils-the best part of 2 million pupils. In non-government schools there were 565,163 pupils. In other words there were over half a million pupils in the private schools in this country. Twenty-four per cent, of the total students in Australia were, in fact, in non-government schools. The total school population in 1964I am talking about primary, secondary and special schools mainly for disabled youngsters-wa s 2,366,474; in other words, roughly 2 i million pupils in all the schools in the Commonwealth. The Government's gesture towards this problem is to provide £5 million for science facilities for the whole of Australia. In 1964 there were 7,977 State schools and 2,205 non-State schools. The school population we are directing aid to at the present moment is in the secondary schools. The number of pupils involved in 1963 was 673,761. The Government is congratulating itself on making £5 million available for the best part of three quarters of a million pupils in secondary schools. My State of New South Wales will receive, of that amount, £1.355,000 for government schools and £499,000 for independent schools£1.8 million altogether. I now wish to refer to the point made by the Leader of the Opposition that this whole provision is a piecemeal and fragmentary allocation. First of all, as I have tried to indicate, it is grossly inadequate even in terms of its specific purpose which is to help provide facilities in science laboratories in our secondary schools. Secondly, it is not only inadequate, but it is quite unrelated to the rest of the school programme. It is not based on any widespread survey of needs. It was just an ad hoc contribution and it is significant that this ad hoc contributiona figure of £5 million picked out of the air-is the same amount that is going to be paid in each of the next three years. Does it not occur, even to members of the Government, that if £5 million was sufficient last year, in another three years' time, possibly, the amount should be increased? We have been reminded in this House so many times of the intense growth in the numbers in secondary schools. We have been told youngsters completing their secondary school education has actually doubled. In other words many more youngsters are staying on at school. Even the Government's own policies are directed, in part, to inducing and helping children to stay on to complete their secondary schooling. The Government has, in fact, provided 10,000 secondary school scholarships to cover the last two years of a student's secondary schooling in an endeavour to induce and help youngsters to stay on at school. Does it not occur to honourable members opposite, having regard to the increasing population generally, the special increase in secondary school students and the longer period of attendance in secondary schools, that the need for more help is going to increase? The grant should not remain static as is provided for in this Bill. member think that some may have been built by then? would have been built, but has the honourable member ever taken the opportunity to look at the backlag in respect of even the kind of thing that we are talking about herescience laboratories and science equipment? The signincant thing to me and the most signincant omission is the fact that no provision is made for science teachers. No provision has been made for the training and retention of more science teachers for our schools. It has been said that only about 4 per cent, of our secondary teachers who are teaching science are graduates4 of every 100. 1 speak subject to correction on that, but I am pretty confident of my memory on that point. That situation will probably become much worse because of the factors that I shall now mention. First, private industry today is in the market in a big way for young scientists; secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the Commonwealth Government, with the co-operation of the States through matching grant provisions, is now subsidising in further measure our universities and is providing new subsidies to technological institutional grounds but tends to be founded on tions and tertiary colleges set up as a result of the report of the Martin Committee. These are additional institutions which are receiving Commonwealth help, and of course they will make their demands for science teachers. The most significant omission from the Government's action on the Martin Committee's report was that it rejected the strong and urgent plea of the Martin Committee for Commonwealth assistance for the education of teachers. Honourable members have before them at the moment another report which relates to Papua and New Guinea. That report teUs us that we will have to supply from our already scanty resources of secondary teachers in the States of Australia more than 1,000 teachers in the next five years for service in Papua and New Guinea. Do honourable members see the point that I am making? The provision in these Bills is very limited, and the fact that we do nothing about providing the necessary teachers to make use of the facilities that we propose to create will undermine the provision that we make. There is a further point upon which I do not intend to dwell. I refer to the specific allocation for science facilities. This can be a distorting factor in our educational programme. Children will get the impression that science is the be-all and end-all of our educational existence. Are there not likely to be needs in other segments of the secondary school curriculum, to say nothing of the primary schools? What about the teaching of languages? What about the teaching of new cultures that have grown up and that impinge on our very existence in this part of the world? I refer to the new Asian set-up, the new language requirements that we have, the new understanding that we need and the teaching of new Australians who are coming into our schools. Is not a lot more wanted in the way of language laboratories so that we can have more efficient ways of teaching the English language to all young students and youngsters who come here from overseas countries? Are not these all pressing needs? Of course, they could be, but we do not know about them and we make no research into the matter. The Government proposes to make just an ad hoc allocation which is not based on any inquiry based on educaCommonwealth budgetary and political considerations. As I have indicated already, the shortage of qualified science teachers in secondary schools, which is already an acute problem, is likely to be aggravated further in the years to come by the demands of the Commonwealth supported development of technical, technological and tertiary colleges, to say nothing of the ever increasing demands of universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Atomic Energy Commission and other Government instrumentalities. Few of these bodies are assisting in the training of teachers and in many cases they are not even training scientists. As a result we have this business of poaching on the secondary school arena for qualified science teachers.",47,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965
93,Mr Giles,Does not the honourable,49,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965
94,Mr Reynolds,"Of course, theyI have talked about the neglect of the teaching problem. I assume that all honourable members realise how important that must be. But there is also the fact that we -are providing laboratories and equipment. Are we, at the same time, looking at what is done in those laboratories and what is being taught in them? Many science teachers have confided to me that the science curriculum in many of our schools is woefully out of date. It bears little relation to the modern scientific field of knowledge. Is it not about time that we engaged in a bit of scientific research ourselves into the programmes that we teach in schools? Often we talk about the problem of wastage in terms of youngsters who leave school for one reason or another before they have completed their studies. But what about the wastage of the so-called learning that we impart in our schools which has not much relevance to modern day living? Too many school syllabuses and curricula are built on tradition. We teach what has always been taught. The schools are not enabled to be in close contact with the world in which we live, let alone be the leaders of thought. There is no time for the hard pressed teacher with all the students about him and with inadequate equipment to think too much of what he is teaching. He is given a syllabus Technical colleges, above all else, ought to and he has to teach according to that syllabus. He has to conform to examination requirements. Far too little research is done in educaof industry. The young apprentice who tion in Australia, but I would say that this research has never been so scanty as in the field of science teaching. Would it not have been a good idea to have enlarged greatly the Commonwealth Office of Education, something which the Labour Government intended to do if it had stayed in power? Research in education is a function which that Office could have carried out admirably. It could have set up science research facilities. It could have conducted research into all factors relating to education-no t only the content of education, but also teaching methods and new types of teaching aids which could be brought into our schools and school organisations. In that way we would really be doing something worthwhile and the results of our research would be available to State and non-State schools alike. The proposed grant of £5 million is peanuts compared with what we could have done and ought to have done but have not done. Reverting to the point about teachers, Professor W. N. Christiansen, when talking on the subject of scientific education in Australia only a couple of years ago, said. . . most of the new schools have some sort of faciUties for teaching science. However, the laboratories are quite inadequate and their equipment is poor. It is in the provision of teachers, however, that we have completely fallen down on the job. During the past few years more and more of our school children have been taught by people who are inadequately trained. It is no longer unusual to find a large secondary school with one or no science graduate on its staff. The measures now before the House also make provision for technical education, which includes the education of tradesmen and technicians. Again, I am afraid that the same remarks have to be made. A grant of £5 million has been given to technical colleges and schools, but that £5 million is for the whole of the State instrumentalities in that field throughout the whole of Australia. That amount must be judged to be grossly inadequate. One has only to visit some of our technical colleges and to look at some of the obsolete equipment they have to use to realise the truth of this statement. be the leaders in new techniques and new technologies in our community. They are the ones which should be refreshing and renewing the sinews of industry, but they find it difficult to keep up with the progress comes from some of the bigger industrial houses in the community to the technical college finds that he is obliged to practice and be trained on equipment which is up to 25 years out of date. This is no stretching of imagination; unfortunately, it is true. To the extent that perhaps this £5 million grant may help in some respects it is appreciated, but I want the Government to understand that it is not anything like the amount that is needed. Vastly greater sums are needed if technical education at this level is to be brought up to date. Anything that I have said about science teachers can equally apply to technical teachers. I had something to do with the training of technical teachers and with the art of teaching as a member of the Sydney Teachers College before I came to this place. I can say that even though the training of technical teachers has been improved and extended in recent years, it is still very inadequate indeed. It is not a preservice type of teacher training in my State generally; it is an inservice programme of training. In other words, a man or woman is brought in from outside the service, from the field of industry or commerce, and we say: "" You have been a good tradesman or supervisor, so you will be a good teacher. Get in front of the class."" Many teachers will agree that it is a fearful experience to face a group of 18 year olds, 19 year olds and 20 year olds and start to teach them, without having had any training in this task. We have to recognise that teaching is a He also mentioned that the total grant need profession; that it is something apart from not be spent by 1966. competence and knowledge in a particular subject to be taught.

Applications are to be received from individuals and research teams, so the Prime Minister said. He also indicated that these applications could come from outside the universities as well as from within them. I think we ought to be aware of what this their staff because the grant they anticipated will not be forthcoming. In this respect the . . . the funds so provided will do little more Increased research is needed within the univeron the more practical problems of education, about technical college allocations. Here again the Government is making money available for the material requirements of the university. It is not interested in following the matter up to see how effectively these grants are being used; how effectively the material resources are being used. The Martin Committee, in its very searching inquiry into many aspects of university education, is obviously not pleased or impressed with the efficacy of the use of these grants. As a matter of fact, at page 45 of its report it saidThe graduation rates of full-time students have level, It said that many of the vicenot shown appreciable improvement in the past six or seven years. That is an important point to note because at least six years ago, when I came to this Parliament, that was the thing that honourable members were discussing more than anything else-the failure rate at universities. Why were students failing in such great numbers? Why were they taking so much longer to complete degree courses than they ought to have taken or were expected to take? Here we are, some six or seven years later, and we have to make much the same complaint. We cannot even blame it on the fact that so many of them arc doing course part-time. The paragraph I have just read referred to full-time university students. We cannot overlook the fact that every now and again we have to make interim adjustments to the grants for the three or four year period. I am wholeheartedly in favour of the idea that we should let the universities and other educational institutions know some years in advance the amounts of money they can expect from the Government. They can plan their programmes much more effectively if they know this. But it seems to the Opposition that someone is making very poor judgments of the university needs when we have to keep putting through these interim measures. I do not expect the Universities Commission, or for that matter the vice-chancellors, to know exactly what the universities need, but I suspect that the investigation and assessment of needs are not made with the precision we ought to be able to expect. After all, we read daily in our newspapers that university students are sitting in corridors and on the floor of the library of the University of Melbourne. It is grossly overcrowded. We are still reading of the large numbers of students whose parents have kept them at school in order to matriculate, who have matriculated but who have been turned away from the universities by the imposition of quotas. There is something wrong when we are not able to predict requirements with more accuracy. Maybe the Martin Committee did have something particularly relevant to say on this subject when it spoke about the need for better administration at the university chancellors were grossly overtaxed in the demands made on them as far as administration was concerned. The report went on to say. . . there is the urgent need for more permanent senior administrative oflicers to ease the work of the vice-chancellor by assisting him in academic planning and policy making and concomitant financial implications. I can quite imagine that university administrators must have a very heavy task imposed on them with the greatly increased university populations that they have to deal with, the organising courses and all the rest of it. Therefore, it comes pretty hard for them to have to turn aside from that work and assess what their needs will be for the next three years. I hope that the Government and the universities will take notice of this recommendation of the Martin Committee and bring into our universities an increased measure of efficiency by the provision of more administrative staff. In finalising my remarks, I indicate my strong support for the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition. It is very obvious that we do need an overall survey of the needs of education in Australia. You cannot do this thing piecemeal. If you make ad hoc, or even planned, allocations in certain sections of education and neglect other sections, then it means that your provisions are going to be uneconomic. It means that the provisions you make are going to be undermined by what you have not done at the lower level. AH education from the primary school right through to the university has to have continuity. If there is a weak base at the primary school level or at the secondary school level, then obviously it is going to be reflected in the failure rate at the higher levels of education. Therefore, like the Leader of the Opposition, I plead with the Government to have another look at this question of a national survey of the various levels of education. I very particularly ask the Government to go back to the Martin Committee's report once again and have a look at its very worthwhile recommendations for Commonwealth support of teacher education. To me, that is one of the really fundamental omissions from the Government's programme. I ask the Government to have a look at that again, and I hope it will have second thoughts on it. wholeheartedly the remarks of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds). He has pointed out very effectively, I think, where the interest of the Government lies in education. First of all, it is dilatory; it steps going to speak, but the Opposition Whip into the field in a very slow manner. Secondly, it is perfunctory. It does not examine the position carefully at all. Thirdly, it is based upon the political expediency of attempting to capture the public with the idea that the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party are interested in education. Nothing could be further from the truth. Perhaps nothing exemplifies this better than the fact that I am speaking directly after my colleague the honourable member for Barton. Where are all the Liberal Party and Country Party spokesmen on this subject today? Why are they sleeping soundly wherever they are sleeping? Have they no conscience in the matter? Do they not understand that we are debating here today a matter of vital interest to the nation? We are not debating simply a question of aid to State and non-State schools. We are discussing three separate items-ai d to science laboratories in State and non-State schools, a certain amount of assistance to universities, and a certain amount of assistance to technical education. We of the Australian Labour Party, which I represent at the moment, are interested in and vitally concerned with education. It is, of course, symptomatic of Australia's development that those States which have had Labour Governments consistently in the past, have made the greatest advances in education. This is certainly the case in New South Wales. One has only to peruse the statistics relating to universities to discover that in New South Wales a bigger percentage of students reached the universities than in Victoria or any of the other States governed by other than Labour Governments. In Tasmania, the school leaving age has been 16 for many years. I wish there was some way in which one could indicate dramatically in ""Hansard"" that a Liberal Farty spokesman or a Country Party spokesman should be speaking at this hour at which I am speaking. Nothing indicates the dilatory and rather expedient way in which they are approaching the whole question of education better than does their silence now. The honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp), who is interjecting, will have his chance to answer me. He only had to put his name down a moment ago and he could have been speaking now in my stead. But, of course, he has been silent. I do not know whether he is has given me to understand that, again, the rest of the Government side are going to be silent on these matters. The honourable member may not wish to enter into the controversies associated with some of these points, but at least he ought to be able to make some contribution to the development of thinking on education in this Parliament. I entered this Parliament in 1955. skirting ail round the Bill; he is not talking about the Bill. Minister, and to his Party. I am pointing out the errors, the inconsistencies and the expediency of honourable members opposite. If the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Freeth) wishes to speak in this debate, I think there is plenty of space on the programme for him to do so. I entered this Parliament in 1955. I am glad the Minister has given me the opportunity to repeat that. Previous to that, there had been no major debate on education since about 1945 when the Commonwealth entered the field of education with the Commonwealth Education Act. During the following years, the Commonwealth became intensely concerned in many ways in education. First, it became interested through the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme, and, flowing from that was a rather consistent approach towards assistance to universities. So, in a way, the Bills we have before us stem from the actions that were taken some 20 years ago when an act was passed by",49,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965

97,Mr Bryant,"I am talking to thethis Parliament and was given wholehearted support by the present Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies). From then on, we on this side of the House have continually raised, during the debates on the Estimates, by raising questions of urgency and so on, the need for the Commonwealth to adopt a more proprietary attitude-if one may call it thatand certainly a more interested attitude and a more definitefinancialresponsibility in the field of education. The Bills before the Parliament today are a clear demonstration that our campaigning has produced some results. I believe it is fair to assert, as did the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), and my colleague from Barton, that this is again a very diffident step into the field of education. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, science education cannot be divorced from the need to advance and improve education at all levels and in all fields, and it will suffer unless an immediate inquiry into all aspects of education is instituted. Why are we assisting non-State education with capital grants? As the honourable member for Barton pointed out in reply to the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), who did not previously have any opinion on this matter, the decision was made by the Prime Minister as a political expedient at a time of election. When one examines the implications of it, one may say that it is one of the finest pieces of political cynicism with which the Government has endowed this country over the last few years. I shall examine in a moment the significance, so far asfinanceand the numbers involved are concerned, of the steps that are being taken. We believe that the Commonwealth itself must accept a national responsibility for education. We do not believe that this is necessarily a takeover bid. For my own part, I am interested in the devolution of power and the increasing responsibility at the lower levels in administration, education and through society generally. In the long term, in the nation's development, and in the short term of the nation's needs now, the only authority which can possibly step into the field and give education this leadership is the Commonwealth Government itself, with all the resources it has at its disposal. So, in debatclosely the school systems, both State and ing this legislation, we are discussing what, as the honourable member for Barton has pointed out, is relatively chicken feed. There are four questions before us. First there is the amendment which the Leader of the Opposition has moved and then there are the three Bills which are before the House. I have briefly mentioned the position taken up by the Leader of the Opposition. He has suggested that we must have a national inquiry. We must establish what the needs of education are. We must develop a theory, an approach and a practical attitude to the whole field of education, and we cannot do this until we know what the needs are. So we come to ths Bill for an act to grant financial assistance to the States for science laboratories and equipment in schools. In the definitions clause, the Bill states"" School"" means a school or similar institution, whether conducted by a State or not. Of course, the Government and its members have made a great play on this. They have introduced into the Australian education system an entirely new concept. It departs from the basic principles with which Australian public administration in education has been concerned since the Education Act of 1870, or thereabouts. In introducing this new concept, the Government made a fundamental decision as regards education. It decided to give assistance which is different in kind from the assistance ordinarily given to non-State schools in this country. There has grown up over the last 15 or 20 years, and even before then, substantial support for assistance to non-State systems of education by government action of various sorts. In some States the teachers have been trained in the teachers' colleges and have been permitted to go unbonded into non-State systems. In others there were grants for equipment, or special facilities for peopls to purchase equipment. In my own State, it has been the custom to co-operate in the narrower field in the classrooms for many years. I can recall teaching in schools in which tlie children from non-State schools nearby used the woodwork centre and thc domestic arts centre. This kind of co-operation which was developing should be encouraged. I believe that we have to integrate more non-State. We have to develop closer co-operation. We have to break down the schism between them. We have to prevent the development of two competing systems of education in this country. I believe that on both sides there will have to be considerable leaning towards co-operation in the attitudes adopted. The issue before the House now has nothing to do with an attitude of that kind. Under the terms of the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill, we are to make grants totalling £5 million in each of the next three financial years. We propose to grant £3,618,900 annually to government schools, £869,300 to Roman Catholic schools and £464,700 to those schools which are described, for want of a better term, by the designation ""Other"". I hope that they, in their time and place, will realise how lowly is their status. The independent schools are to receive annually a total of £1,334,000. Counting the grants to be made in respect of independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, this gives a total of £5 million a year. Why is this assistance being given? It is asserted that this scheme represents a step towards equality and amelioration of the lot of the parents of pupils who attend nonState schools. How real is this claim? What is the position, generally speaking, in Australia today? There are 8,000 government schools, in some places called State schools and in others called public schools, attended by 1,800,000 students. This includes preparatory schools up to senior schools educating to matriculation standard. There are 2,205 non-State schools, with 565,000 students. What has the Government done? It has established a system of endowment for science blocks. In a few minutes, I shall discuss the significance of science laboratories and equipment in schools in relation to education. Let us, for a moment, examine the statistics. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech on the States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill, informed us that 708 independent schools have been registered as applicants for grants, who send their children to such schools the of which 189 have received assistance. If one were to listen to the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), who, apparently, is to be the senior and only Government spokesman on this subject, one would think that these grants were being made to benefit the people in the community who are in the greatest need. I wonder who are those who have been receiving the benefit. At page 2683 of "" Hansard"" of 9th November 1964, in an answer to a question that had been asked by the honourable member for Barton, are listed the schools in respect of which assistance under this scheme had been authorised at 23rd October 1964. I doubt whether, if one were to go through the list school by school, one would find that the schools listed are really those in the greatest need. I know from my own personal observation, knowledge and understanding, that the independent or non-State schools in the greatest need received not one single penny. This whole so-called scheme is a hoax. It is the product of a first class piece of political cynicism. It is time those Australians who accepted the scheme as a step towards the amelioration of their personal lot looked at it closely and realised that they have been hoaxed. Let us examine this list of schools that appears in "" Hansard "". One is Abbotsleigh, at Wahroonga, in Sydney. In the last few days, there have been circulated photostat copies of an extract from a report in a Sydney newspaper about the opening at this school of a memorial chapel which cost £70,000 and which seats 500 people. This chapel was completed in January of this year. How did that school fare under this scheme? It is sufficiently well off to spend £70,000 on a memorial chapel, and it received a grant of £2,240 for the equipment of a science block. There seems to be a pretty fair evaluation of the importance of science there. What kind of people send their children to these schools that are receiving these grants? Research Bulletin No. 7, published by the Research Division of National Fund Raising Counsel of Australia Pty. Ltd., shows the fees charged by the independent secondary schools throughout Australia in 1963. Abbotsleigh charges £50 a term, or about £150 a year. Are those people in this community who are in the greatest need? Any suggestion that they are seems to me a doubtful proposition. Are those who can afford £150 a year or about £3 a week for the schooling of their children the people who are in the greatest need? Certainly not. honourable member quote the fees for all the the people in the greatest need. It is merely other schools? Korowa Church of England Girls' Grammar is the Government really doing, with a School, at Glen Iris, in Melbourne, educates great fanfare of trumpets?

The courage or information to be able to make Tintern Church of England Girls' Grammar a speech on the subject, say that the GoSchool, at Ringwood East, also received vernment's proposal stems from an act of £18,500 for a similar purpose. The Korowa great moral courage. It seems to me that school charges £50 a term for day pupils morality is going at a very cheap price when in the senior school. The Tintern school the non-State schools throughout Australia charges £50 17s. I see listed a number of are to receive annually a total of only Catholic schools which seem to charge no £1,334,000. fees and which have not received very substantial sums. For instance, the Mount St. Joseph's Girls' Secondary School, at while assistance to the non-State schools on Nundah, in Brisbane, received £1,050 for present figures? I assume that about one the equipment of a science block. Yet the quarter of the cost of education in Australia suffering citizens who are able to pay £150 is represented by the cost of maintaining the a year to send their children to the Korowa non-State schools. At the same standard, and Tintern Church of England Girls' this might be between £40 million and £50 Grammar Schools received the benefit of million a year. I am prepared to debate the grants of £18,500 to each of those schools. question whether the Government should These are matters of public record.

I look with envy at the accommodation being supplied for the fortunate few who are able to occupy residential accommodation in our Australian universities.

112,Mr Stewart (Lang) [4.7],"I intend loansyear and up to £200,000 next year for interest subsidies on money borrowed to provide new buildings or to extend existing buildings in independent schools. But I wonder whether the Premier has yet gone as far as to change his mind on direct per capita grants to independent schools and whether, as the Premier of New South Wales, he is prepared to accept aid under this States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill. One of the main points in the successful operation of this legislation is that the States should act as agents for the Commonwealth in order to channel the money for the independent schools to those schools. The previous Government of New South Wales participated in this scheme. It was prepared to act as agent for the Commonwealth Government. The Liberal Party, which in 1962 was violently opposed to any form of direct aid, is now part of the Government of New South Wales. In no part of the Prime Minister's second reading speech on this Bill is there any indication that the present Premier of New South Wales has been asked to give or has given an assurance that the New South Wales Government will continue to act as agent for the Commonwealth Government in transmitting to independent schools the aid provided under the Bill that I am discussing. I believe that it is up to the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr have been assisted by grants. It would be Freeth), who is at the table, to tell us whether the Government of New South Wales has given such an assurance. I suppose I am being a little naive in expecting that the Premier of New South Wales will stick to the opinion that he held in 1962 and will say: ""We do not wish to participate in this scheme because we are violent opponents of direct aid to independent schools "". It was easy enough for him to change his policy on interest subsidies; so I suppose he will find it just as easy to change his policy on whether his Government will act as agent for the Commonwealth Government in channelling this money to the independent schools. The assistance which was provided under the bil] that was introduced in 1964, and which is being extended for three years under this Bill, has proved most acceptable to the majority of independent schools. When the States Grants (Science Laboratories and Technical Training) Bill was introduced in May i964 there were 510 applications on hand. When the Prime Minister made his second reading speech on this Bill last Tuesday night 708 independent schools were registered as being interested in receiving assistance. In the preceding 12 months 189 independent schools have been granted assistance. That means that it will take 3 i to 4 years for the 708 applications on hand at present to be satisfied, assuming that no further applications for assistance under this Bill are made by independent schools. As the Minister for Shipping and Transport has interjected on a few occasions in the last half an hour and said that the Government has made a start in this field, I would like to know whether the Government intends to extend the aid that is provided under this Bill. It provides £5 million for each of the next three financial years. Despite what the Minister for Shipping and Transport says there is no indication that the Government intends to increase its aid for science laboratories in State and independent schools. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) named some of the schools that have been given assistance. The information which he gave was backdated to November last year. It is up to the Minister or some other Government spokesman to indicate to the House at this stage which schools interesting to learn also which States are not offering facilities to independent schools to purchase their science equipment through the channels used by government schools. In his second reading speech the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) saidThe scheme has been greatly assisted by the co-operation of State Governments, most of which have, amongst other helpful actions, agreed to provide equipment to independent schools through the same channels as those through which they provide equipment to Government schools, thus ensuring equipment being purchased at the lowest possible price. If the Government is vitally interested in the welfare of the independent schools and in the provision of science laboratories at those schools it is up to it to prevail on those States that are not co-operating in this direction. The policy of the Labour Party clearly would allow this course, because we have no objection to fringe benefits such as these being granted by the States and the Commonwealth or by the Commonwealth alone. I would also like the Minister to ascertain why some States are not prepared to give to independent schools the co-operation that other States are prepared to give. I would like to know why some States take this attitude and whether, if they are controlled by Liberal Governments, they believe in the same principles of aid to independent schools as the Liberal Country Party Commonwealth Government believes in. I said earlier that the Bill will provide £5 million in each of the next three yearsthe same amount as was provided in the last 12 months. There is no indication lhat the amount will be increased if more than 708 applications are received. The number of applications for grants has increased in 12 months from 510 to 708. I have no idea how much higher the number will go but it seems that most independent schools are now prepared to come into the scheme and that far more than 708 will require assistance. I would like to know also who set the figure of £5 million to be granted for the building and equipping of science laboratories in State and independent schools. No indication has been given to the House as to how this figure was reached or the conditions that were taken into account in arriving at it. Admittedly there is a formula for working out how much will go to government schools and how much will go to independent schools. These are some of the matters that could be disposed of by holding a national inquiry into all aspects of primary and secondary education. This is one reason why the Labour Party has moved an amendment to the second reading. We want the public of Australia to know something of the problems confronting the State schools in providing science laboratories, teacher training facilities, teaching aids and the various other things needed. In addition, a full inquiry would enable the independent schools to place before the public the problems that confront them. I do not think I am being extravagant in saying that I doubt very much whether anybody in Australia could give accurate figures with respect to the capital debt of the independent schools, their interest bill, the amount which Catholic schools are paying for lay teachers, their class load and how far behind State schoois they are in providing the necessary teaching aids. This problem of education is an important one. It is exercising the minds of administrators in every country. At a time like this it is not satisfactory to make piecemeal attempts to solve the education problem. I feel that the granting of aid to independent schools for science laboratories was a political manoeuvre in the first place but in my opinion the independent schools had a just claim to such aid. The aid that has been given to them and which I hope will continue to be given to them is well deserved. During this debate, as in last year's debate, strong arguments have been advanced that this aid is wrong. Arguments have been advanced that the dual system of education in Australia is uneconomical and divisive. These, too, are matters that could be dealt with in a national inquiry into education. If we are to solve the problem of education in Australia it is up to the Commonwealth, as the chief administrator, to initiate such an inquiry. With the co-operation of the States the Commonwealth should ascertain exactly what the independent schools lack. We must find out whether the dual system of education in Australia is a proper one and whether it should be continued. People in this House who say that the independent schools should be prevented from operating or not given assistance should ask themselves what would happen if only one-quarter of the independent schools in each State decided on the first day of the next school year to close their doors and send all their pupils to State schools. The happenings in Goulburn 12 or 18 months ago showed clearly that the State education system could not possibly carry the loads that would be placed upon it if such action were taken by independent schools. I do not suggest that the independent schools should do this, but I would like those people who are so violently opposed to any aid being given to independent schools to ask themselves what would happen if those schools were forced to close their doors. These are further matters that could be resolved by a national inquiry into education. In moving the amendment to the motion the Opposition has shown, as it did in moving its amendment to the legislation last year, more awareness of the problems in education than has the Government. I am not criticising for a moment the activities of the Government in the field of education generally. In the last five or ten years it has certainly endeavoured to take up the lag in university education and in other aspects of education, but it still is not doing sufficient. It still is not aware of the real problem confronting our schools, State and independent. Unless there is an inquiry into primary and secondary education along the lines of the inquiry by the Martin Committee, we cannot hope to solve this problem. I think most of the State Premiers would be prepared to cooperate fully in an inquiry of this kind. At the last Premiers' Conference all Premiers suggested that a national inquiry such as I have referred to should be held. Those are the thoughts I leave with the House on this occasion. The action of the Government in granting aid to independent schools for the building and equipping of science laboratories has proved very popular with the majority of people but it is not solving the education problem completely. In 1963, the Government picked this proposal out of the hat and used it as election bait. I hope that sufficient members on the Government side will accept their responsibility and will vote for the Opposition's amendment so that we will have an inquiry into all aspects of education. to refer to only one or two matters that arise from the three Bills that are now before us. I do not intend to take up the time of the House in discussing all the matters that could be dealt with. The Opposition finds itself at a great disadvantage in dealing with this legislation, just as it has in dealing with other legislation that the Government has introduced in the last few days. It should be clearly understood by the electors that these three very significant and important Bills dealing with education were introduced only during this week. But the Opposition is expected to give a considered reply and to express a considered opinion on the Bills. Members of the Opposition are being treated with contempt by the Government. It certainly has not extended to Opposition members the consideration that they are entitled to receive when important legislation such as this is being dealt with. I join with my colleagues in supporting the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). In it he has asked that a committee of inquiry be set up to consider broadly the needs of primary, secondary and technical education and, if necessary, to extend the inquiries that have been held into tertiary education. This is not a new approach by the Opposition. Government supporters who have been members of the Parliament in recent years, especially during the period mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), will recall that the Opposition has been suggesting since at least 1955 that a committee of this kind be established. I do not need to remind honourable members that this has been the subject of questions addressed to the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), who accepts responsibility for education in the Commonwealth sphere. It has certainly been raised as a matter of definite public importance at intervals in the period from 1955 to 1965. But during this period the Government has shown no interest in the needs of primary and secondary education. It is true that one of the three measures we now have before us provides some assistance for technical education. This again is a matter that has been constantly mentioned by Opposition members, who have frequently pointed out to the Government in recent years that there is a great need for further assistance for technical education. But apart from the interest that it is now showing in technical education which, of course, is far too late, the Government has constantly refused to accept responsibility for primary and secondary education in the various States. As I have already said, the Prime Minister has accepted what little responsibility for education he believes the Commonwealth should bear and I believe, in fairness to him, that it may be said that in recent years he has taken a very active interest in tertiary education. But surely he must understand that the success of education at the university level depends entirely upon the success of education at the primary and especially at the secondary levels throughout the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister and those who support him have consistently refused to accept the recommendations that have been submitted to him and to the Government not only by Opposition members but indeed by teachers and interested organisations throughout the Commonwealth over the last 10 years. These organisations have pressed the Government to appoint a committee to inquire into all aspects of education. However, we",59,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965
113,Mr Barnard (Bass) [4.25],"I wantfind ourselves again this afternoon asking the Government, even at this late stage with the three Bills now before us, to consider appointing a committee to investigate fully all aspects of education in the States. It is not sufficient for the Parliament to offer a sum of money for technical education or to assist in the establishment of science laboratories unless it has been told how the money can best be spent. All we have been told is that the Government is willing to extendfinancialassistance for a further three years, during which a sum of £5 million will be allocated to assist in the provision of science laboratories and equipment. Clearly the Government does not know how many teachers will be required in the future to teach in the science laboratories that it hopes will be established pendent schools in the various States. Taswithin the next three years. No report has been submitted to the Government on this question. As my colleague the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds) said earlier this afternoon, it is not sufficient merely to establish science laboratories; we must be certain that we have sufficient trained teachers available to teach in them. I believe that, if the Government were to investigate the position fully, it would find that in recent years very few teachers teachdependent, Tasmania will receive £165,500. ing science subjects have had the appropriate academic qualifications from a university. But the Government refuses to accept this situation. I do not believe that any honourable member would deny that the Government decided initially to make a grant to State Departments of Education for the provision of science equipment and laboratories as a matter of political expediency. One need merely refer, as I have already done, to the number of occasions on which honourable members on this side of the House have requested the Government through the Prime Minister, and those who represent him in the field of education in this House, to give some consideration to establishing a committee of inquiry, and to recognise the need that exists at all levels of education for Governtralian Universities.

There is a body of opinion in this country which believes that the independent schools have substantially benefited as a result of the Commonwealth legislation. I hope that as a result of the Commonwealth's intervention in this field there has been an improvement in the teaching of science subjects in independent schools. Most honourable members appreciate that in some independent schools there is certainly a need for improvement, not only in their teaching methods, but also in the facilities that are available to them. The Government has now decided, through the provisions of one of the three measures before us, that it will extend its assistance to both government and indemania cannot take a great deal of comfort from the amount that will be made available to either the government or independent schools in that State. According to the table which the Prime Minister was good enough to supply in his second reading speech, and which deals with the amounts to be made available in the various States for science buildings and equipment in secondary schools, both government and inOne could hardly claim that that magnificent sum will improve the situation to any great extent in Tasmania. I have touched upon one or two of the requests that the Opposition in this House has made to the Government in recent years. A request for an independent inquiry, which we believe is so important, has been sought, as I have already indicated, not only by honourable members on this side of the House, but also by interested organisations and people throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. The Government has accepted responsibility for two inquiries at the university level. It appointed, in the first instance, the Murray Committee on Ausable members acknowledge the great incentive that the Government received as a many of the principles and important recommendations contained in that report. I believe that had the members of the Martin Committee had the opportunity to consider this matter, as the Murray Committee did so many years ago, it would have decided, as did the Murray Committee, that not only did there exist a need for a re-examination of some of the problems affecting tertiary education, but that some consideration ought to be given to an investigation of the problems of primary, secondary and technical education as well. 1 have already said, Mr Speaker, that committee of inquiry were appointed. Such the Government is moving to provide a a committee would surely report back to the measure of assistance for technical educaGovernment that the facilities that exist in tion, but it still ignores its great responsibility every State of the Commonwealth, at the to improve thc standard of education at the educational levels to which I have referred, secondary level.

Buildings are being used which are inadequate for their purpose. It has been pointed out in this House on many occasions that Tasmania if this Government continued to departments of education are using buildings extend its principle of providing financial that were previously used for other purposes. assistance for technical schools? Obviously, Some departments have been obliged to use Tasmania would be in serious difficulties church halls and the buildings of other instibecause its technical schools are bound up tutions to accommodate the children who are in the comprehensive schools which teach attending State schools, particularly at the primary level. Where does the responsibility lie for the great influx of school children? As has been pointed out on other occasions, the influx has come about as a result of the Government's immigration policy. State Government departments have been faced with the responsibility of providing for a greatly increased school population at both the primary and secondary levels. Those are some of the matters that this Government ought to have considered, and we would hope that they would be considered if a We are now debating three measures they are known in other States. Tasmania What would be the situation confronting not only the trade subjects to which thc Prime Minister referred in his second reading speech but also academic subjects. I remind honourable members again that there is an obvious need for a committee to be appointed to consider the standards of education that apply throughout the various States of the Commonwealth. No real attempt has been made in recent years in this country to determine a standard of education that can be applied from one State to another. Standards differ in all States. The school leaving age is different in each State, and the States differ in their approach to the type of buildings that may be used. They certainly differ in their stanwe should be seeking. The Martin Comdards of education. It is conceivable, of courseI acknowledge this at once-that the standard or method of education adopted in one State may not necessarily suit another State, but this does not mean that there is not a great need for the type of inquiry to which I have already referred and to which my colleagues have referred during the debate this afternoon. The Leader of the Opposition in resuming the second reading debate stressed the need for a committee of inquiry. The Opposition has placed this point of view before the Parliament over a number of years. However, tbe Government has refused to acknowledge that a need exists for such an inquiry. We on this side of the chamber believe on this occasion, just as we have on previous occasions, that the point of view which has been expressed by the LeadeT of the Opposition and which calls for an urgent investigation into the needs of all aspects of education in this country should be considered. I want to turn briefly to a question that mittee has made, surely the Government has already been mentioned by other honorshould study the advice given by the Comable members on this side of the House mittee concerning the cost of improved during this debate.

I know, and I am sure that all honourable members will appreciate, that in recent years, because of the circumstances to which I have referred-the great influx in the school population as a result of the post-war years, immigration and other factors-ther e have been established in most States emergency teacher training facilities. Although these facilities have been able to overcome the immediate needs, they certainly do not provide in the long term the type of academic teachers that will be required if we are to achieve the educational standards that mittee considered this question very fully. It obviously felt that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to accept some responsibility in this field. In its report it emphasised that many of the teachers who are now teaching science subjects are not qualified to teach those subjects. Once again, this is inevitably the result of inadequate teacher training facilities in the various States. Why has the Government chosen to ignore one of the principal recommendations of the Martin Committee? Committee was able to indicate to the Government, as the Murray Committee did some years ago after its inquiry, that a certain amount would be available to achieve the standards that it recommended. If teacher training was under consideration by the Committee and if the subject was considered to be important, having regard to the other recommendations that the Com-",62,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965

I want to conclude by emphasising once again that the Government adopted a very important principle when it came into this field, but did so, in the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House, principally for political expediency. It is to be hoped that the Government will achieve success in its aim for which the money is to be spent, and that the expenditure will be applied in such a way that it will effect at least some improvement in the schools. The Government intends to proceed with its policy. The Opposition believes that whilst the Government has a responsibility for education in Australia which it should accept, it has a responsibility also to give effect to the recommendation which has been made so frequently by honourable members on this side of the chamber and which today has been incorporated in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to establish a competent committee of inquiry to consider all aspects of education in Australia. member's time has expired.

We are told that because we Speaker, I will not detain the House for have done something which the people very long but I wish to say, first of all, approved, and which the majority of people that the amendment moved by the Leader want, it is an election stunt. That is rather of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) is not different from what we heard from honoracceptable to the Government. Indeed, I able members opposite in previous years think that if the wording of it were studied when they were all clamouring for some closely by members of the Opposition I form of Commonwealth assistance for would be surprised if a large number of science teaching in schools.

The word used in the circulated amendment is "" substituted "", not "" instituted "". In other words, if this amendment were carried then the grants for science laboratories would not be made, but an inquiry into education would be substituted. I was not aware from reading the published newspaper reports that this was the spirit of the Labour Caucus on this matter. Presumably it is. I believe that honourable members do not fully understand that this is the import of the amendment moved by the Opposition; that if it is carried the aid for science laboratories will be deleted and a general inquiry, which could take several years to complete, substituted. Honourable members opposite should fully understand this. If the amendment does not mean that assistance for science buildings in schools is to be deleted, then it indicates that the Parliamentary Labour Party is in revolt against the policy laid down by its ruling body. This again is an interesting situation because clearly, if a Labour Government were in office, the policy laid down by the ruling body and still extant would apply until changed.

119,Mr Freeth (Forrest,"Minister for it. It seems to me to be a rather peculiarstunt. Of course, having said that, the Oppothat the Commonwealth Government has sition says: "" Why don't you do more?"" This is the kind of inconsistent argument which the Opposition adopts as a standard formula whenever there is any question of finance being given to somebody by the Government. First of all, the Opposition embarks on the argument that the proposal is wrong in principle and that the money should be given in a different way; then when it is apparent that some people will benefit from the grant, and will be grateful for it, we are told that it is not half enough and that more ought to be given. This is the argument that the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) seemed to stress. I think it is clear that tbere is a great division in basic political philosophy between the Liberal Party and the Labour Party on this matter. That was made very clear by the Leader of the Opposition. He made no secret of the fact that he believed it was wrong to assist independent schools at all. He believes it is wrong for the Commonwealth not to assume more responsibility not only infinancingeducation, but in controlling education policy. Indeed, in reply to an interjection he stated quite openly that the Commonwealth should be in control of all education throughout Australia. forced by the honourable member for Bass, who, not a few minutes ago, was on his feet stating with some pride that Tasmania had evolved a system of education which was different from that applying in other parts of Australia and which he thought was very good. But now he wants to change it. Where is his consistency? This is the basic division. Although the Leader of the Opposition tried to argue that he was not in favour of an education system which was not diversified and which did not lead to complete conformity, he said that all control should be centralised. I am not going to argue with him at this stage the fact that it is impossible to have an undiversified would be a recipient because every Governsystem of education which does not tend to complete conformity, with centralised control. I simply point out to him that the dangers in such a system are far greater than under the present system. As for me, I prefer not to take the risk. I believe been drawn into this field basically to assist tertiary education. It has had to conduct inquiries and to assist where it sees the need. It has had to do something towards meeting the acknowledged greatest needthe deficiencies in science education in secondary schools. But I do not believe there is any validity in the argument of the Leader of the Opposition that because the Government has come this far it should go further and take control of the lot. There were one or two other points made by the Leader of the Opposition which illustrate the basic division of philosophy between his party and the Government parties. He drew attention to the fact that there were discrepancies between the expenditures of State Governments from the Commonwealth grants. He pointed out that some hundreds of schools had been assisted in Victoria compared with only 11 in Queensland. Surely it is a matter for the State Governments to determine how they will use this money. In Queensland the State Government decided to make large expenditures on modern science buildings in particular schools. In Victoria, with different needs and requirements, the Government decided to equip a larger number of schools with furnishings and fittings. In a democratic community such as we have in Australia there should be some local control. We believe that this system will give far better results than if there were a standardised approach by a centralised government. Another approach was suggested by the honourable member for Wills who tried once again to raise the bogy of class distinction and divisive results through having independent schools. He implied lhat there should be some kind of means test applied to schools so that some would receive assistance and some would not. Surely the obvious answer to this is that if a means test were applied no Government school ment school, potentially at any rate, has all the resources of its State government behind it. Again, the honourable member was in conflict with the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) who said that in his view, although he had the same critical",66,States Grants Science Laboratories Bill 1965

121,Mr Freeth,"I am glad to be reinapproach to independent schools, there was a great need for improvements in facilities and teachers in independent schools. In other words, he was arguing that the independent schools were inferior to government schools because of lack of money. So the question of fees has no relation to the means of schools to provide these facilities, and the honourable member for Wills should know that. Of course, he prefers to rely on the old angle of class distinction. What this Government has done has been to make available to everyone, regardless of class or anything else, an equal opportunity to take advantage of this means of bringing their science buildings up to the required standard. The Leader of the Opposition contended thnt no attempt had been made to define those standards. Of course, an attempt has been made. There is a committee working in every State now. There is an interchange of ideas. There is a standards committee which is operating most efficiently and which is giving very welcome and appreciated assistance to the Commonwealth Government on this point. I believe that it is a great thing, when you are in political confusion, like the Opposition is on this particular issue, to start another hare running. As we have listened to this debate, honourable members opposite have been chasing all kinds of hares all over the countryside. They have argued about teacher training and they have argued about finding more money for other types of education, and so on. Of course, they do this. They are in immense political difficulty over this particular issue and they have therefore moved an amendment which opened wide the field for argument on this matter but did not at any time leave any one of them with the honesty to say to this House that if their amendment were carried there would be no aid for science buildings in all schools.

As I mentioned at the second reading stage, this Bill, the Customs Bill Classifications) Bill 1965 are related measures. It would no doubt meet the convenience of honourable members if the House were to have a general second reading debate covering this measure and the two related measures. At the conclusion of the debate, separate questions would, of course, be put on each of the Bills. I suggest that this course be followed. -There being no objection, that course will be followed. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [5.19] Mr a number of ways represents a record in this House.

The Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) in of last week, told us that the Customs Tariff Bill represents a major change in the nomenclature of the Australian customs tariff. At significant changes in the level of duties. In considering this measure, I think that, first attention to what the expression "" nomenclature"" means.

126,Mr Bury,"It is the largest ever.in Brussels on 15th December 1950. Article1 of that Convention states""Nomenclature"" means the headings and their relative numbers, the section and chapter notes, and the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Nomenclature, set out in tbe Annex to this Convention; . . . The handbook, at page 3 tell us a little more about the two conventions that underly this legislation-the Valuation Convention and the Nomenclature Convention. Referring to the Valuation Convention, the handbook slatesThe purpose of this Convention is to secure uniformity in defining value, with the object of facilitating international trade by simplifying customs tariff negotiations and the comparison of foreign trade statistics. Referring to the Nomenclature Convention, the handbook statesThe aims of the Nomenclature Convention are directed towards: (a) providing a systematic and logical classification of all goods (which enter into international trade); (b) classifying each product suitably and uniformly in the tariffs of all contracting parties; (c) providing a simple and precisely worded Nomenclature using terms and phrases comprehensible to experts and laymen alike; and (d) facilitating the comparison of national tariffs in the preparation of statistics for negotiations of international agreements. The Opposition welcomes the adoption of these Conventions by the Australian Government and supports these Bills. We recognise the need for simplification of negotiations and comparisons in international trade, particularly in respect to the terms and classifications used in relation to customs tariffs. These have become, and for a considerable time we in this House have been saying that the Australian system has become, unduly complex and complicated, it seems to me that the system now replacing the old one represents a useful simplification. It has taken a considerable time for us and the world to reach this stage. Soon after the First World War, concern was being shown in various parts of the world about the need to simplify the tariff and customs procedures prevailing in various countries. In 1931, in the League of Nations, there was reached a stage at which a convention known as the Geneva Nomenclature was adopted. But, in the atmosphere prevailing in the 1930's, with the development of trade autocracies in Europe, mainly that of Germany, and also in other parts of the world, these developments did not proceed very far. AH that was involved in the trade autocracies of those times is summed up in the handbook which has been provided to us. It states that the Geneva Nomenclature never became a practical proposition, however. In 1948, when the formation of the European Common Market was under consideration, we again saw movements towards a more uniform customs tariff for all the countries participating in the union. Those countries in Europe took the Geneva Nomenclature, which had been worked out in 1931, and produced a draft list of items derived from it. But in 1950, as a result of developments in Europe, the centre of gravity shifted to Brussels rather than Geneva. Brussels, of course, was the centre of the discussions about the formation of the European Common Market. In December 1950 the Convention on Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs was signed in Brussels. This is the basis for the present development. At that time two other conventions ware signed. The Council Convention came into operation in November 1952 and from that point further developments have taken place extending now to the adoption of this procedure by Australia. It is quite impossible in the 45 minutes available to us to convey to the House any idea of what the new classifications mean. The list of goods set out in the new nomenclature consist of 99 chapters, grouped into 21 sections. Each section refers to commodities that are clearly distinguishable from commodities in other sections and in which there is a logical relationship, the aim of classification being to define the items into which particular goods fall and to subdivide the items so that there is a classification for each article. There are 99 chapters and the 21 sections are subdivided so that it seems to me there are 207 items in each chapter. Clearly enough, I should think, this is to provide scope not only to fit in everything that we need to fit in today, but probably to provide for foreseeable developments in the future. At this stage there are one or two points of detail that I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister. In his speech the Minister said that honourable members could select any item in the Customs Tariff Bill and by turning to that item number in the concordance-whic h is a very useful document given to us with the other papers -h e could compare the new rates of tariff with the existing rates. The concordance gives us the new proposed tariff classification, the present classification, the most favoured nation rate and the preferential rate for each existing tariff, and by comparing that list with the list in the Bill we are able to ascertain the difference, if any, between the new rates and the old. At one point in the first paragraph of his speech the Minister saidThe new tariff, however, does not make any significant change in the level of duties. Later he saidThis Bill differs from other tariff bills in that it changes nomenclature, that is the numbering and naming of the items, without changing the levels of duties. 1 have made the comparison that the Minister's speech suggested we should make between the Bill and the concordance and I can find no significant difference. It seems to me that there is no significant change, but I wondered why the Minister chose to use the word "" significant"". Why was it necessary to use that word in one sentence and then, in another, state that the changes were being made without changing the levels of duties? I do not think the levels of duties the departmental officers to whom this have been changed, but I want to make sure may have been, if not a delight, a labour that they have not been changed and I of love-althoug h I cannot imagine such a want to make sure that I have not missed difficult exercise being regarded as a labour any change which could be regarded as of love. It must have been a task which significant. The other Bills that are associated with having brought it to a successful conclusion. this are included only for the purpose of I should like to raise one or two queries. giving effect to the changes consequent upon The first relates to clause 19 of the Customs the adoption of this new nomenclature, and Tariff BiH 1965. This clause requires some similarly, the Opposition supports those clarification. In dealing with it in his second changes. I do not intend to delay the House reading speech the Minister saidany longer. I welcome this enormous simplification of what has been a very complex in Clause and difficult subject in the past. I am conif it is desired to surcharge goods from countries fident that the changes will make tariffs in other than countries entitled to most favoured Australia and our international trading relanation treatment. tions easier to handle.

We should the Opposition as being consistent with the note that the old general rate column is need to protect our own efficient industries excluded in the new Bill and that the where necessary. Like the Government, we Customs Tariff Schedule will now have two recognise the importance of increasing intertariffs and not three. However, clause 19, national trade, particularly with the lesser developed countries. In passing, may I say that the statement made by the Minister for House yesterday on another matter is one of which I hope also to be able to express the approval of the Opposition in due course. We agree with the general principles involved. This is a contribution to the easing of international trading relations and is welcomed by the Opposition. We support the Bills. pose it will be refreshing for the House to hear me congratulate the Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) for bringing in legislation of this kind. I do so with an air of sincerity because I know that the Minister is not responsible to this department, although he is representing it-and representing it very well-in this House. But I also happen to know that 30 years ago when-and I know he will forgive me for saying this-h e was very young indeed, in a private capacity he was the secretary of a body which was working on the very problem of the introduction of the Brussels amendment lo the tariff nomeclature. SoI guess he will have dual satisfaction in introducing this measure and in having it accepted by both sides of the House in the manner it has been received.

129,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forcolumn 4. In the existing Customs Tariff 1933-1965 the third column specifies duties which are applied to countries not accorded most favoured nation treatment. On a number of items these duties are higher than most favoured nation rates and the surcharge varies from 2 i per cent, to as high as 45 per cent. Present legislation places no limitations on the surcharge that may be imposed on countries other than most favoured nations countries by amendments to the tariff. The new tariff will not carry forward the present surcharges and countries formerly affected will receive the benefits of most favoured nation tariff treatment from 1st July 1965. The purpose of clause 19 is to give the Minister a limited reserve power which could be invoked if difficult problems arose in the field of international trade. Other countries have similar provisions. Let me assure the House that this power will not be used to accord tariff protection. Tariff protection will continue to be accorded only after the matter has been considered and reported on by the Tariff Board and the Board's report has been accepted by the Government. I would also draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that any order that would be made by the Minister-thi s would be only as a result of a positive decision of the Government-ha s to be published in the "" Gazette"" and, in accordance with clause 28, has to be laid on the table of both Houses and is subject to disallowance in the same manner as regulations. Opportunity to debate any such order is therefore available to honourable members. The other matter which was raised by the honourable member for Wakefield, and which was also referred to by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), related to the imprecise reflection of existing tariff rates in the new schedule. As the honourable member for Wakefield pointed out, the new tariff schedule does not always accurately repeat the tariff rates of the existthe Parliamentary Draftsman, for whom ing tariff schedule. In my second reading speech I saidMayI remind honourable members that the main Schedule to the Bill has been translated from the existing Tariff Act in accordance with the Government's direction that any changes in the levels of duty should be minimal but that rationalisation should be made to produce a working his attention. All parties concerned with able document. It is inevitable that in a major recasting of tariff items there should be unders and overs. Where there is little trade significance I think one must accept rationalisation as justified. Where there are areas which cannot be differentiated by wording, I think there may have to be rationalisation; but where there is a clear cut commodity and there has been, by accident, a major variation in the rates of duty, I can tell honourable members that the Minister for Customs and Excise has given an assurance that adjustments will be made to bring the duty levels within the Government's stated intentions of how the translation should be made. To illustrate that this is the firm intention of the Minister for Customs and Excise, I point out that since this Bill went to press some three weeks ago discrepancies brought to the notice of his Department have been examined and changes will be made by ""Gazette"" notice to operate on and from 1st July 1965 in respect of some commodities. These changes will subsequently come before this House as Tariff Proposals next August and be debated in due course. Similarly, if primage duty has been imposed where it was not previously imposed and this involves a significant change in the amount of duty payable, exemption from primage duty can be made quite simply by "" Gazette"" notice under powers conferred by clause 27. I wish to thank the Opposition for its support of this measure, which I am sure has the general support of wise and rational people everywhere. The Bill is the product of many years work. I wish to acknowledge the compliments paid and to pay my compliments to officers of the Department of Customs and Excise and the Department of Trade and Industry who have worked extensively over a number of years to produce this result.

GOLD MINING INDUSTRY Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Harold Holt, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [8.2] -I move That thc Bill be now read a second time. The operation of the existing legislation under which Commonwealthfinancialassistance is provided to the gold mining industry expires on 30th June 1965. The purpose of the Bill before the House is to provide for continued assistance to the industry for a further period. The gold mining industry is one of considerable importance to this country. The annual value of gold produced in Australia and the Territories is currently about £15 million, practically the whole of which represents an addition to Australia's international reserves. Moreover, centres of population in outlying areas, parof fine gold are eligible for subsidy equal ticularly in Western Australia, are heavily dependent on gold mining for their continued existence. The gold mining industry in Australia has to contend with two major difficulties. The first, which is shared by gold producers in other countries, is that there has not been any increase in the official price of gold for subsidy of £2 8s. per ounce irrespective of very many years. The second is that of declining production of gold because of the gradual exhaustion of the better grades of known ore resources and the consequent gradual fall in the average grade of mined ore. The mines have done much to help themselves. Most mines, including the large Kalgoorlie mines, have been able to offset cost rises to a large extent by increasing efficiency of production. Cost savings have been brought about by increased mechanisation, the introduction of cheaper and more efficient mining aids, and other forms of managerial action. However, despite these cost savings the general trend is one of gradually increasing costs per ounce of gold produced. Indeed, if financial assistance for the industry were withdrawn, there is little doubt that a sharp contraction in gold mining activity would be inevitable on the basis of the present world price of gold. In this situation, the need for the continued provision of financial assistance to the industry ds self evident. The Government has given careful consideration to the form the financial assistance should take after the present legislation expires on 30th June next, and in this connection we have had the benefit of consultations with representatives of the industry. The Bill before the House em(Higginsbodies and gives effect to the conclusions we have reached. Before coming to the proposals in the Bill, I believe it will be helpful to honourable members if I brierly outline the main provisions of the present legislation. The existing legislation takes two forms: A subsidy scheme and a development allowance scheme. The two schemes are alternative means of assistance; a mine may claim either subsidy or development allowance, but not both. The subsidy scheme, which is embodied in the Gold Mining Industry Assistance Act 1954-1962, provides broadly that mines with a cost of production of more than £13 10s. per ounce to three-quarters of the amount by which their average cost of production in a subsidy year exceeds £13 10s. per ounce, subject to a maximum rate of subsidy of £3 5s. per ounce and a 10 per cent, profit limitation test. "" Small producers ""-generally , those with an output of not more than 500 ounces a year-ar e eligible for a flat rate their costs of production and profits. The development allowance scheme was introduced in 1962 and is embodied in the Gold Mines Development Assistance Act 1962. Its detailed provisions are complex, but the guiding principle is that development allowance is payable to the extent that a mine's expenditure on approved development in a year exceeds a defined base expenditure-generally , the average annual",74,Personal Explanation
134,Mr Harold Holt,"amount spent by the mine on development during the three years preceding 1962-63. For the purposes of the scheme, development means, broadly, exploration of the mining property and the preparation of ore bodies for mining operations. The scheme was designed primarily to meet the needs of some of the large Kalgoorlie mines which did not then qualify for subsidy and whose longer term prospects would be improved by the provision of assistance to enable them to increase the amount of work they were doing on development. There has been a substantial change in the industry's circumstances as compared to those which gave rise to the introduction of the development allowance scheme. With the steady rise in the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, most of the mines have reached the stage where their costs have risen above £13 10s. per ounce, which is the commencing point for eligibility for subsidy. Since the subsidy scheme is generally of more value than the development allowance scheme for mines in such a position provided they are not affected by the 10 per cent, profit limitation test, the mines concerned have tended to become claimants for subsidy rather than development allowance. Moreover, the development allowance scheme has in practice been of rather less benefit to the industry than was anticipated because of the physical limitations encountered by the mines concerned in stepping up the rate of their development work. In other respects, also, the development allowance scheme has been found to have some unsatisfactory features, particularly so far as its administration is concerned. The Government has therefore decided that the development allowance scheme should not be renewed after the present legislation expires on 30th June next, and that future assistance for the industry should be provided through continuation of the subsidy scheme in a liberalised form. The liberalisations have been devised having regard to discontinuance of the development allowance scheme as such, the effect being to absorb to some extent the development allowance scheme into the subsidy scheme. In addition, of course, the liberalisations have due regard to the deterioration in the industry's generalfinancialposition since the question of assistance was last reviewed some three years ago. The two main ways in which the Bill provides for liberalisation of the subsidy scheme are, first, abolition of the 10 per cent, profit limitation test that at present qualifies the subsidy entitlement of large producers and, secondly, an increase in the maximum rate of subsidy payable to large producers and in the fiat rate subsidy payable to small producers. As honourable members will be aware, inclusion of a profit limitation test is a usual feature of Commonwealth subsidy legislation, and derives from the thoroughly sound principle that the taxpayer should not be called upon to provide assistance which results in a more than reasonable level of profits for the recipients. In the case of the gold subsidy, however, there are other provisions embodied in the scheme which provide safeguards against the making of unreasonably high profits, namely, the gearing of the subsidy rate for large producers to a particular mine's costs of production, and the fixing for subsidy purposes of the selling price of the subsidised product. Having regard to those distinctive features of the gold subsidy scheme, and after considering representations made by the industry about the undesirable effects that retention of the test could have in particular sets of circumstances, the Government has decided to remove the profit limitation test from the subsidy scheme in its extended form. It is estimated that the immediate cost involved will be in the vicinity of £50,000 per annum but it is expected that the cost will rise significantly above that figure over the period of the renewed legislation. Commencing with the financial year 1965-66, the maximum rate of subsidy payable to large producers is being increased from £3 5s. per ounce to £4 per ounce. This is a substantial increase, but the Government has decided that it is warranted in view of increased per ounce costs of production since the rate was last reviewed and further cost increases that are in prospect. With regard to small producers who are eligible for a flat rate subsidy rather than a rate of subsidy determined by reference to their costs of production, the practice ever since the subsidy scheme was first introduced in 1954 has been for the flat rate subsidy to be three-quarters of the maximum rate for large producers. The Bill provides for continuation of this practice, so that the flat rate subsidy for small producers will become £3, rather than £2 8s., per ounce as from 1st July next. The existing subsidy scheme contains a special provision under which a producer with an annual output of more than 500 ounces can, if be wishes, elect to be treated as a small producer. If he does so elect, the rate of subsidy payable on the whole of his production is the flat rate subsidy for small producers reduced by one penny for each ounce by which his production exceeds 500 ounces. An appropriate adjustment is being made to this provision by reason of the increase in the flat rate subsidy payable to small producers. The amount of one penny to which I have referred will become one and one-fifth pence, or one cent when decimal currency is introduced. The effect of the adjustment can be illustrated by taking the case of a producer with an annual output of 740 ounces who elects to be treated as a small producer. At present, the rate of subsidy payable to such a producer is £1 8s. per ounce-that is £2 8s. less 240 penceor an annual total of £1,036. As from 1st July, it will be £1 16s. per ounce-that is £3 less 288 pence-o r an annual total of £1,332. The immediate cost of the foregoing increases in subsidy rates is estimated to be between £20,000 and £25,000 per annum. The cost will, however, rise substantially as and when additional large producers become eligible for subsidy at a rate in excess of the existing maximum rate of £3 5s. per ounce. In addition to the two main liberalisations 1 have outlined, the extended subsidy scheme provided for in the Bill contains some liberalisations which are of rather lesser consequence but which are nevertheless still of significance. Chief among these is a provision under which a large producer will be able to include in his costs for subsidy purposes one half of costs incurred in honoured position in the history of the approved exploratory diamond drilling elsedevelopment of this vast continent. The Gowhere than on his mining property. For this purpose, the yardstick for apmeet the industry's reasonable needs for the proval will be whether the diamond drilling, period of five years covered by the Bill and, if it resulted in the discovery of gold bearing in particular, will serve to stabilise for that minerals of payable grade, would contribute period the financial position of gold mines to the continued production of gold bearing on which centres of population in outlying minerals in, or in the vicinity of, an existing areas are so dependent. I commend the Bill gold mining area. At present, none of such to the House. costs can be included in the determination of subsidy entitlement. Bearing in mind that in the long run the future of existing gold journed. mining communities will be influenced by the success or otherwise of efforts to locate and open up new ore bodies, the Government has decided that inclusion of the provision I have outlined is desirable. The Bill also provides for the removal of two restrictive provisions in the present Act. In the subsidy scheme as it now stands, a large producer's entitlement to subsidy is subject to reduction if his expenditure on development exceeds a certain amount or if the grade of ore being mined falls below a certain level. In the present day circumstances of the industry, and having regard to the discontinuance of the development allowance scheme, we believe that these two restrictive provisions should not be renewed. Instead, we have concluded that a producer's entitlement to subsidy should be subject to reduction only if, and to the extent that, he fails to observe good mining practice. The Bill accordingly contains a provision to the latter effect. Finally, I wish to point out that the Bill provides that the renewed subsidy scheme will on this occasion operate for a period of five years. In accordance with the usual practice with respect to Commonwealth subsidy legislation generally, the gold subsidy legislation has in the past been enacted for maximum periods of three years at a time. The industry requested that the current extension be for a longer period so that the mines would be able to plan their expenditure and funds raising programmes on a more secure basis as to the duration of the extended scheme of assistance, and the Government has decided that in the industry's particular circumstances the request should be granted. The gold mining industry occupies an vernment believes that the revised measures of assistance provided for in the Bill should Debate (on motion by Mr Webb) adBILL 1965. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 18th May (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is to provide for the re-establishment in civil life of national servicemen. The Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill but there are several features of it that it intends to criticise. Before proceeding with the BillI want to raise an emphatic protest at the short time the Opposition has had to consider this important piece of legislation. The Bill was placed before the Parliament on Tuesday and the Opposition has been expected to analyse it during the short period that has been available since then. There are 37 pages in this document and 60 clauses, some of which are very involved. This is the way in which the Government runs the business of this country. It expects the Opposition to present its case on this Bill in the short period that has been allowed. The Department of Labour and National Service has been preparing this legislation for some months, yet the Opposition is given just a few short hours to consider it and present its reply. It is not good enough. At least a week should have been provided, and even that time would have been hardly sufficient to consider a bill of this description. This important legislation deals with the future of our young resumption or reinstatement after defence men who are called up for national service service. It places the onus on the employer training. The Bill provides for their reto re-employ a national serviceman who establishment in civil life. The Minister for was an employee for 30 days be.fore being Labour and National Service( Mr called up. But what happens when a McMahon) stated in his second reading business has closed down and the national speech that the Bill was directed to three serviceman has no job to which to return? purposesfirst, the protection of the interests of national that case. AH that he has is the seven days' servicemen in relation to their reinstatement in additional leave in which to seek employcivil employment; second, the protection of national servicemen ment of Labour and National Service would in relation to obligations they had entered into before becoming liable for national service; third, the facilitation of the re-establishment him. But what happens when no suitable of national servicemen in civil life on completion employment is available? All that he would of their period of continuous national service. The Minister stated also. . . that national servicemen who serve in special areas will qualify, under the same condiis insufficient, even in ordinary cases when F.4767/65 -R -[68 ] tions as those applying to regular soldiers, for repatriation and war service homes entitlement. That provision will apply to them, of course, if they serve in operational areas. He stated alsoIn addition, a series of benefits will be provided administratively. However, the Minister did not say what those beneiits are. Surely he could have given us an outline of the benefits lhat would be provided by the administration but which are not contained in the legislation. He continuedIn addition to any other Army leave due to them on discharge from their period of continuous service, national servicemen will be granted seven days' termination leave. . . . The Opposition has considered this statement and it does not believe that seven days' leave for these national servicemen upon discharge is sufficient. The national servicemen may not have any other leave due to them and, consequently, seven days' leave at the termination of their service would not, in its opinion, give them sufficient time to get back into civil employment. We suggest that the Minister give consideration to extending the period of the termination leave, possibly to 21 days. We ask him to consider that suggestion in addition to some other points that will be raised by the Opposition and to see whether he can meet our wishes. After all, these lads are conscripts and every consideration should be given to them when they complete their period of national service. Clause 12 of the BiH provides for There is no guarantee of employment in ment. I have no doubt that the Departdo all it could to secure employment for then get, so far as 1 can see from the provisions in the Bill, would be the unemployment benefit. Therefore, I suggest that seven days",75,Assistance Bill 1965

136,Mr Webb (Stirling) [8.18],"I amthe national serviceman has some other leave due to him. After all, he has a period of 30 days in accordance with the provisions of the Bill to enable him to get back into employment. But it is definitely not sufficient in the case that I have mentioned where the employer for whom he previously worked has become bankrupt or has gone out of business and a new job has to be found for the lad. After his seven days' leave has expired he may have to apply for the unemployment benefit until such time as the Department of Labour and National Service can find a suitable position for him. to. He would certainly be on the dole and that is not good enough for a lad who has been called up for a period of national service training. Sub-clause (2.) of clause 12, which deals with resumption or reinstatement after defence service, statesThe employer shall, upon the member so applying, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, permit the member to resume work, or reinstate the member in employment, in the occupation in which the member was employed immediately before the commencement of the period of Defence service and under conditions not less favourable to the member than those that would have been applicable to the member in that occupation if he had not been absent, including any increase of remuneration to which the member would have become entitled if he had not been absent. Penalty: One hundred pounds. Sub-clause (3.) statesIn any proceedings for an offence against the last preceding sub-section, it is a defence for the employer to prove(a) that he agreed to the member resuming work or being reinstated in employment, but the member failed, without reasonable excuse, to present himself at the time and place agreed upon; (b) that, by reason of a change of circumstances since the member was last emman, but as I understand the Bill he has no ployed (other than the employment of some other person to replace the member) it was not within the power of the employer, or was not reasonable or practicable, to permit the member to resume work or to reinstate the member in employment; or (c) that, by reason of a change of circumstances since the member was last em"" Hansard"" as having said in his second ployed (other than the employment of some other person to replace the memreading speechber) it was not reasonable or practicable to permit the member to resume work, or to reinstate the inember in employment, in accordance with the last preceding sub-section, but that the employer had offered to employ the member in an occupation, and under conditions, that were the most favorable that it was reasonable or practicable to offer him. only to a defence in proceedings brought against an employer. It is clear from a reading of that clause that the onus of proof is on the employer. Nevertheless, I ask the Minister, who no doubt will give me the information when he has the opportunity: Who protects the serviceman's rights? Who meets the cost of any action that is taken? Does the Department of Labour and National Service prosecute an employer in a case such as this? Perhaps the Department would launch the prosecution, but we want to know. There is nothing in the Bill to say that the Department will do so. the Bill to say that. ber's rights. point. We have to know these things and we want them to be shown on the record. There are a few other points that the Opposition considers to be very important. For instance, I understand that if a national serviceman is discharged at the end of his two years' service and, after having been discharged, he is recalled in the event of a national emergency, he has no rights additional to his reinstatement rights, unless he serves in an operational area. If he is taken into an operational area he would then have the same rights as a regular serviceother rights in the case that I have mentioned. I draw attention to the National Service Bill which was brought down in this House on 13th May. The Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) is reported at page 1540 of The second contingency is time of defence emergency. The Bill provides that a national",78,Defence Re Establishment

144,Mr Webb,"Then that clears up oneserviceman may be required to serve on full time duty in a time of defence emergency for longer than two years but not for a period in excess of his statutory obligation to render five years' total service. I should like to know what happens to a lad who is released from national service for a period after serving two years and who is then brought back in time of emergency. Provision should be made, if there is none already, to protect him in such circumstances. For example, he may be called up to relieve another national serviceman who has gone into an operational area. Does the lad who is called back into service continue to receive gratuity? Does he receive termination leave? Does he get vocational training, if that is necessary? Do the moratorium provisions apply to him on his second discharge? Does he come under thc provisions relating to re-establishment loans? I am sure the Minister will be able to give me answers to those questions. I hope he does so because they are points which the Opposition wants cleared up. They are not clear in the legislation. The National Service Act suggests that what I have stated is correct and that the serviceman does not come within the provisions if he is recalled for service after completing his first term. The Minister said in his second reading speechNational servicemen will be paid a gratuity of ployer, who had in the meantime engaged £40 on completing their two years' service, with a minimum payment of £20 for those discharged . . . before two years. Thc Opposition considers that the amount is very paltry. It represents a sum of £20 a year-les s than 10s. a week. Surely men who have served two years in national service training are entitled to more than that. It may be said by the Government that this is the same amount as applies in the Regular Army. That may be so, but I still say that it is not sufficient. A greater amount should be provided as a gratuity when a national serviceman is discharged after two years' service. Clause 13 deals with the rights of a national serviceman upon resuming his work. This clause guarantees that continuity of employment shall not be broken by a period of defence service. If the serviceman concerned remains in his former employment for a period equal to that which he spent in service then his period of absence from employment counts for long service leave, superannuation and pension purposes. That clause seems clear enough and the Opposition has no quarrel with it as far as I can see. Clause 14 of the Bill places the onus on the employer to re-employ the national serviceman for at least a period equal to Ihe period of national service. The clause states14 -(1. ) Where an employer has, in accordance with this Part, permitted a member to resume work or reinstated a member in employment after a period of absence on Defence service, the employer shall not, within a period after the member resumes work or is reinstated in employment equal to the period of absence, without reasonable cause, terminate the employment of the member or vary it by employing the member in an occupation, or under conditions, less favourable to the member than the occupation in which, or the conditions under which, the member was employed when he resumed work or was reinstated in employment. The clause goes on to state(2.) In any proceedings for an offence against the last preceding sub-section, the burden is upon the employer to prove that he had reasonable cause for terminating or varying the employment. Of course, the employer has to prove that he had reasonable cause for varying or terminating the employment. However, the Opposition considers that the clause is very weak. It would not be difficult for an emsomebody else for the job formerly held by the national serviceman and found him to be more suitable to his requirements, to find an excuse to get rid of the national serviceman whom he had to re-employ. I point that out to the Minister in order to draw his attention to the weakness that is apparent. Part III of the Bill contains the moratorium provisions. The Minister stated that these provisions follow very closely those in the Re-establishment and Employment Act. He mentioned that under this Part transactions must have been entered into before the age group of the national serviceman was required to register under the National Service Act. If deferred from call up the moratorium date is the date upon which the national serviceman receives his call up notice. The point is that commitments entered into by the national serviceman before the moratorium date will be protected; those entered into after that date will not be protected. The Bill gives protection for a period of 12 months after completion of service or, if the period of service is less than 12 months, protection is granted for a period equal to the length of service. There is provision also for the protection of the serviceman in respect of hire purchase agreements but there is a departure from the wartime moratorium legislation. The difference is this: If a serviceman has a hire purchase agreement involving an amount of less than £40-for example, £39 -and desires protection, he has to obtain the leave of the court in order to obtain that protection. In regard to an amount over £40, the protection is granted automatically. This is an important departure from previous legislation. It is true that the Bill enables a national serviceman to get relief by going to the court if he is in a position to prove that his case is worthy of relief. But he has to go to the trouble and expense of obtaining that relief, and that is a burden on him. It appears to tbe Opposition that it would have been advisable to grant protection even where the amount concerned under the hire purchase agreement was less than £40. I think, Mr not the place in which to give an exhaustive Speaker, that the Minister might have a further look at that matter also. I come now to Part IV of the Bill which deals with vocational training. In the opinion of the Opposition clause 44 is not specific enough. It leaves everything up in the air. I will read the clause because I want to show honourable members just how weak it is. It states44 -(1. ) The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, establish a scheme, to be known as the National Service Vocational Training Scheme, for the vocational training of such persons or classes of persons, being persons who have been discharged, otherwise than by a dishonourable discharge, from the Regular Army Supplement should receive the same opportunities as immediately after having rendered national service, those who returned from World War II and as the Minister determines. (2.) The Minister may, on behalf of the Combear that in mind when regulations are being monwealth, make arrangements with any State framed under the provisions of clause 44. for the use, for the purposes of this Part, of any services and facilities of the State in relation to I understand that the details are now being vocational training. (3.) Any such arrangement may provide for the at the moment, but perhaps my question will extension of any such services and facilities of be passed on to him, or somebody else may the State and for the use of those services and be able to answer it. I should like to know facilities as extended in pursuance of the arrangewhether we shall be given an opportunity ment. (4.) The Minister may, on behalf of the Comthat will be provided for these lads to be monwealth, provide, or arrange for the provision of, facilities in connection with any such scheme. (5.) Subject to such conditions as the Minister determines, the Commonwealth shall pay to persons undergoing training under this Part such allowances and expenses as the Minister determines. The House will note the repetition of the word "" may "". Even where the word "" shall"" is used, there is nothing definite about it. The clause simply says that the Minister shall pay such allowances and expenses "" as the Minister determines"". The clause continues(6.) The Commonwealth may . . . pay tuition and other like fees on behalf of persons undergoing training . . . (7.) The Commonwealth may, subject to such conditions as the Minister determines, provide or supply to persons undergoing training under this Part, or arrange for the provision or supply to such persons, of such books, equipment, appliances and tools of trade as are necessary in connection with the training. As I emphasised, the tenor of the clause is that the Minister may do this and may do that. Why does it not state that he shall do these things and that he shall make these provisions? I repeat that even where the word "" shall"" is used in one sub-section it is very indefinite. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that this Bill was list of the types of situations to be faced in such circumstances. He was talking about the methods to be used in getting these lads back into employment and vocational training. The Minister did not give any list Of the kind to which he referred. Surely the experiences of the Second World War and the Korean War would have enabled the Minister to lay down provisions for at least some of the types of situations that may have to be faced and that were encountered during the operation of the former legislation. We emphasise that at least these lads the Korean War. We ask the Minister to worked out. The Minister is not at the table to debate in this Parliament the conditions given the required training. The Minister i^id lhat Part IV o. ihe legislation permitted of arrangements being made with the States for the use of State services and facilities for vocational training. I wonder whether he knows whether these facilities are readily available for that purpose. For instance, I am advised that the South Australian Government cannot provide sufficient facilities for the training of apprentices now. That being so, how are we going to train our national servicemen with the facilities provided by the Government of South Australia? I do not know what the position is in the other States, but the Minister should be able to tell us what can be done in that regard. He should be able to tell us also whether the Commonwealth Government intends to provide the facilities necessary for the training of those national servicemen who may need training. We want this vocational training scheme to be at least as effective as was the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme after the last war. If that scheme can be improved upon, that should be done, but it was a very good scheme and we want this one to be at least as effective. I should have thought that, following on the experience of the operation of that scheme, plans for the new scheme would have been laid down already and put before the Parliament while this Bill was being debated so that we might know just what is involved. We suggest to the Minister that an organisation should be set up immediately to devise a scheme for the training of these lads and that the organisation should comprise representatives of employers, trade unions and the Government. I come now to PartV of the Bill. This which readsdeals with the rehabilitation of disabled national servicemen. It covers those disabled VIII. servicemen who will not come within the to, and in relation to disabled persons as defined provisions of the Repatriation Act-service by sub-section (3.) of this section in the same way men who have not served in operational as it applies to pensioners, claimants for pensions, areas. When the National Service Bill was beneficiaries and claimants for benefits as defined before the House, the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) had this to sayThe Bill also makes provision to allow a member to remain on full-time duty to complete medical Services Act 1947-64, in its operation as extended treatment which has begun prior to discharge. In by the last preceding sub-section, a reference in such circumstances he would thus be entitled to that Part to a pensioner, claimant for a pension, pay and allowances under the same provisions that beneficiary or claimant for a benefit shall be relate to members of the Regular Army and the read as a reference to a disabled person as defined Regular Army Supplement. As I understand the position, if a serviceman is disabled while on national service before he has completed his two years of service, he shall remain on his full rate of pay until he is fit for discharge. IfI am wrong, the Minister can tell me. But there is one point I should like to have cleared up. What happens if he has a recurrence of the disability after he is discharged? What happens if the disability shows up after he is discharged, or what happens if some disability which was caused during his period of national service training is not discovered until after he is discharged? We know what happens if he is sick or suffers injury while doing his two years national service training. We know that in those circumstances he continues on his full rate of pay until he is fit to be discharged. That is so if I am correct in my understanding of the position. But what happens if he has some injury, or becomes sick, gets fit before he is discharged, and then has a recurrence of the injury or illness after discharge? From our reading of the legislation, it would appear that such a person would have to make a claim under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act for an injury -h e may have lost a leg, perhaps-o r if he became sick. Again, if he must make a claim under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, what happens during the period while he is waiting for his claim to be decided? Compensation claims can *ake as long as 12 months or 18 months before being decided. I now draw the attention of honourable members to the provision which seems to cover such a situation. I shall be very disappointed if it does not because it is the only one that I can see in the Bill which could cover it. These provisions are contained in clause 47, sub-clause (1.) of Subject to this section, the operation of Part of the Social Services Act 1947-64 extends by that Part. Sub-clause (2.) readsFor the purposes of Part VIII. of the Social by the next succeeding sub-section. In a later provision, the Bill deals with servicemen who may have to enter a rehabilitation centre or who may have to be otherwise rehabilitated. I may be wrong, but it would seem to me that the best that a serviceman who either suffers a recurrence of an injury, or who suffers an injury which is not discovered until after he is discharged, can get while he is waitbecause, owing to the shortness of the time ing for workers' compensation is the benefits provided under the Social Services Act. examine the Bill only haphazardly. I suggest If such a person is a single man, he will receive £5 10s. a week, and if he is married tunity to look closely at these matters, bearhe will receive an extra £3 10s. for his dependent wife, making his total benefit £8 10s. a week. If that is the positionand it is as I read the Bill-then , in my opinion, it is pretty poor of the Government to treat a serviceman in that way. That provision of the legislation needs tidying up. Clause 48 relates to those persons who have entered into. The purpose of the Bill have to enter rehabilitation centres to be is to ensure that they are re-established in rehabilitated. They will receive the civilian life. This measure is patterned on equivalent of the invalid pensiot. while the provisions of the Re-establishment and attending the centre.

Apart from the points which I and some other provision should be made have mentioned and which need clarifying, for them.

In this sort of situation, it appears that, in the Opposition's eyes, the Government cannot be right whatever it does. I suggest that the Minister was absolutely right in bringing in this Bill as soon as it was ready to be presented to the Parliament. Nobody suggests that its presentation was delayed any longer than was necessary.

In two years from July of this year, 4,200 national service trainees will come back on to the labour market having served their prescribed time in the forces. Thereafter, trainees will be discharged at the rate of 6,900 a year, lt may fairly be said that not all those men will need the full range of the services provided for in this very comprehensive measure. Because of the incidence of national service and the relatively to cater for relatively few people. This point should be remembered when one comes to ber for Stirling.

154,Mr Hughes,"That is so. I went on to which the exercise of a broad discretion would be calculated best to achieve the object, namely, the rehabilitation, in a vocational sense, of any young men who have been taken out of the stream of industry or commerce by call-up for national service. The best illustration of the truth of the Government's thinking on that point is the wording of the corresponding provision in the 1945 Act-sectio n 50. If one looks at that section, one will find that there is only one material difference between its provisions and those of clause 44 of this Bill. The difference is that whereas under the 1945 Act the Minister was empowered to set up a central reconstruction training committee and regional training committees that power will not reside in the Minister under this Bill. I suggest that there is a sound reason for not putting into this Bill a provision requiring the setting up of the committees which functioned under the 1945 Act. The reason is that under the 1945 Act a scheme had to be devised and administered to deal with a vast number of people-vas t by comparison with the number of people who will be dealt with under this measure. It seems to me that it would tend towards top heaviness if we set up under this measure committees of the type that were set up under the 1945 legislaa gratuity of £40 on completion of two tion. I suggest that there will be no need for years' service or £20 for those discharged such committees. The committees were no doubt very necessary for tbe task in hand in the years after 1945, but the task then involved dealing with a great number of people with a great variety of individual problems. I do not overlook that administration of statement rights and, in the case of those the scheme enshrined in this Bill will involve without jobs to which they can return, looking after the needs of a great number would assist them in securing suitable of young men-althoug h relatively few by employment. This indicates that the full comparison with previous situations-eac h resources of the Commonwealth Employof whom will differ in his requirements and ment Service will be made specifically, in his situation in greater or lesser degree particularly and sympathetically available from the others. Human nature is infinitely to those young men when they complete varied and the virtue of the broad terms their national service training, whether of clause 44 is that the Minister-nobod y the term be two years or less. So, the would for a moment suggest that any criticism that the administrative benefits Minister charged with the administration of have not been sufficiently disclosed is with this scheme would act otherwise than with out substance. the highest level of responsibility-will , by having this discretion, be able to cater for Minister dealt with another matter-that of and look after individual situations and consultation with the relevant authorities, individual needs. I applaud the flexibility Commonwealth and State, and with the which is implicit in clause 44. I would not national employer organisations on the like to see anything done that would cut down that flexibility or detract from it. I want to attempt to answer, if 1 may, some other points raised by the honourable member for Stirling. After his opening remarks my honourable friend complained about the lack, as he put it, of sufficient disclosure of the administrative provisions that are to be applied by the Minister for Labour and National Service to give certain benefits additional to those provided by this Bill for national service trainees upon their discharge. I venture to say that that criticism was by no means justified, because if one looks at the Minister's second reading speech one will see that the honourable gentleman set out specifically the administrative benefits that were envisaged. The first was that in addition to any other Army leave due to them on discharge from their period of continuous service the national service trainees would be granted seven days' termination leave or, at the discretion of the Army, pay in lieu. I know that the honourable member for Stirling complained about the supposed inadequacy of seven days' leave, and I will return to that in a moment. The next administrative benefit dealt with by the Minister related to the payment of before two years had expired. The third administrative benefit that was specifically propounded by the Minister in his second reading speech was that his Department would assist national servicemen with any problems arising in regard to their reinIn the next paragraph of his speech the question of giving favourable consideration to the adjustment of age limits for appointments or advancement to positions where age limits exist. Those four specific matters show, in my view, a very comprehensive approacha very benign approach, as it should be-o n an administrative level by the Minister and his Department. My honourable friend, the member for Stirling, made a complaint about the supposed inadequacy of seven days' leave to these national service trainees when they complete their service. The point that the honourable member overlooks is that the seven days' leave is in addition to any other Army leave. ber did, it was in a very low key and I did not hear it. I should have thought that the honourable member would know-and anybody who has had familiarity with these things does know-that anyone on discharge from the Services is given discharge leave of readily identifiable length. The other point the honourable member for Stirling overlooked is that we are dealing with a Bill which provides, and properly provides, that the rights of these national servicemen to long service leave, and perhaps more importantly, annual leave, will be unimpaired by the suspension of their contracts of employment due to their being called up for service under the National Service Act. So the complaint of the supposed or alleged inadequacy of seven days' leave is not very valid when the matter of this leave is considered in its full context. I next want to deal with some suggestions that the honourable member for Stirling had to make about the rehabilitation provisions of this Bill, which are contained in Part V. I venture to suggest that he may have been under some degree of misunderstanding as to the full scope of Part V. PartV is tremendously valuable and wholly to be applauded because it goes beyond mere reinstatement and re-establishment as I will show. Let it be remembered that if a national serviceman suffers injury-and I use the word "" injury "" in the broadest sense to include all those matters that are injuries for the purposes of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act-whil e he is on service, he is protected after his discharge by the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. I know, indeed I have said so in this House, and the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) who is to follow me in this debate will remember this, that there are some features of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act that many of us would like to see improved. able member try to get them improved? a day. The question of improving the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act might fairly be said to be one for another day. I hope that day will not be too far away. issue. clear that it is relevant to this issue. The point I wish to make is that under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act a discharged national serviceman is entitled to a range of benefits which, broadly speaking1 leave out the details-ar e commensurate with the benefits provided by any State of the Commonwealth. The House will remember that last year the amounts of benefit were increased. So much for the national serviceman who suffers an incapacitating injury while on national service but not in a war zone, if I may use that loose term. I think the House will know what I mean by it. If the national serviceman is injured and incapacitated by reason of something that happens to him while he is in an area which can be classified as a war zone and in respect of which, therefore, the provisions of the Repatriation Act apply, he is protected just as well as a member of the Regular Army, who is a professional soldier, is protected. So no complaint can be made on that score. Here, again, I know that some honourable members take the view that the Repatriation Act needs to be improved. But, again, that is a matter for another day. The national serviceman is placed in precisely the same position, in respect of injuries received on",84,Defence Re Establishment

I suggest to the House that VIN of the Social Services Act a personthat is made clear enough by clause 8 of Joe Blow down the street, as the honourable the Bill which readsAn employer shall not hinder or prevent a person work or incapacitated to the extent of 85 employed by him from volunteering for service per cent, or more of full capacity. in, or serving in, a part of the Reserve Forces or of the Citizen Forces. In this Bill a clear distinction is drawn between hindering and preventing. Under clause 47 a national serviceman, after his discharge, is entitled to the benefit of Part VIII. of the Social Services ActI will come back to it in a moment-if , by reason of injury, disease or deformity, he is hindered in obtaining employment of a like kind to that in which he was engaged before his service. That is a very beneficial provision. It should be pointed out that a discharged national serviceman's being hindered by injury, disease or deformity will qualify him for benefits under Part VIII of the Social Services Act notwithstanding that the injury, disease or deformity was not the result of something that occurred on national service. Mr E. James Harrison -But Joe Blow injury, disease or deformity incurred on down the street gets those benefits. ferent from and additional to any benefit But it should not be overlooked because it that is provided under the Commonwealth shows that in this measure the Government Employees Compensation Act or the Repathas adopted-as it should adopta broad riation Act.

I will deal with the specific matter that he Mr E.

A discharged national serviceman may ask the Director of Social Services for benefits under Part VIII. of the Social Services Act-the y are benefits of a very wide character-althoug h he is not incapacitated for work at all.

164,Mr Hughes,"The point that I wantpeople in the community-that may be a wide statement, but I make it-hav e a claim on this country for just and generous treatment. 1 have not been able to deal with every matter that the honourable member for Stirling raised. I am sure that other speakers from the Government side of the House will deal with the other matters. I conclude my remarks by saying that the Government and the Minister for Labour and National Service deserve to be congratulated on a thoroughly worthwhile and unexceptionable measure. The great virtue of this measure is that it is founded upon a proper recognition of the fact that any provisions for the vocational training or rehabilitation of ex-servicemen must be flexible if they are to be really useful. Ex-servicemen have individual needs that differ from one ex-serviceman to another. Therefore, a stiff or inflexthe extent to which we will change existing ible approach to this matter would have been quite wrong. This Bill, in its underlying tection of Australian youth now to be conassumptions and in its underlying sub-structure, meets the position fully and well. [9.20] Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill is designed to extend to certain members of the forces the kind of protection that was afforded to ex-servicemen by the Chifley Government. In introducing the Bill the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr was suggested by the honourable member McMahon) referred to it as a charter. It is not unusual for a charter to cover every facet of a condition that may arise. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) fell into error when he chided the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) for saying that this House has had insufficient time to analyse properly the meaning of the legislation. Last night another measure affecting the general public was introduced. That measure is to lie on the table of the House and be subject to examination by the general public for some months before it is debated in the House. But here we are dealing with the very lives of men who will be conscripted to fight for this country and we are asked to analyse this charter in a matter of hours. I do not think that is right. This is not merely a charter. As from the fact that both are conscripted and are 1st July next young men will be conscripted eligible to serve anywhere in the world. for service anywhere in the world. This is The one injured in Malaysia would be the first time this has happened in our history. In 1917 when it appeared to the Government of the day that conscription for service anywhere in the world would be necessary the people were given an opportunity to express their views, and they rejected conscription. During the Second World War, which was total war, conscription was introduced only for a circumscribed area. But tonight we are dealing with a measure that enables the youth of this country to be conscripted for service anywhere in the world. It is not just a matter of whether this legislation covers these men in the way other ex-servicemen are covered by the 1945 legislation and the repatriation legislation. Honourable members should consider fully the implications of what we are doing and policy relating to the rehabilitation and proscripted in a new field. I agree wholeheartedly with the remarks of the honourable member for Stirling. This legislation does not affect only this House. It affects every businessman in the country from whose employ these youths are to be drawn. The legislation affects those people in more ways than one. We are discussing tonight a Bill that is much wider in its scope than for Parkes. The honourable member did not agree with me when I interjected during his speech to say that the Bill affords very little more protection to ex-servicemen than does legislation applying to a man who is injured while walking along a street. Suppose twin brothers are called up. One is sent to Malaysia and the other to Townsville. Suppose that on the same day each suffers a severe injury as a result of a motor accident and both are in line for discharge because of their accidents. I have dealt with many repatriation cases and all honourable members know the form of repatriation that covers such cases for the rest of their lives. Under this legislation we draw a distinction between the man injured in Malaysia and the man injured in Townsville, despite",87,Defence Re Establishment
165,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"covered completely hy repatriation whereas the one injured in Townsville would have to depend on the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. In my opinion once we conscript the youth of this country for a common purpose they are entitled to common treatment at the hands of the Government that conscripts them. Take the case of the twin who is covered incapacitated before he can obtain the by Commonwealth compensation. I do not invalid pension. But the honourable member think it is stretching matters to say that implied that PartV of the Bill now before many claims for Commonwealth compensaus will give the same protection, miserable tion arising out of the "" Voyager"" disaster though it is, to somebody who falls into are still unsettled. The conscripts have no this category and finds that he is hindered say as to where they will serve.

Suppose that the other would not be required to establish 85 per twin falls sick in Malaysia with the same cent, invalidity or an even higher percentage. complaint. They are twins so it is likely to happen. They both return and are ready for discharge. The one who comes back from Malaysia immediately is covered by repatriation, but what happens to the one who was only in Townsville? It is true that under other legislation he may remain it) honourable member says, "" Oh!"" Let me the Army until he is well but he will never inform him that we understand very clearly again enjoy the state of health that he enthe invalidity provisions contained in the joyed before he became ill. Honourable memSocial Services Act and we know that the bers will have noticed how carefully the decision rests on the ability of the applicant honourable member for ParkesI do not to prove that he is suffering from 85 per blame him-too k the term "" injury"" in cent, incapacity. His ability to do this is dealing with the Commonwealth Employees largely determined by the doctor who Compensation Act. He avoided referring to examines him. There is no rule that gives a the other things that may happen to serviceclear definition and no one can tell the men by way of illness as distinct from indifference between <?5 per cent, and 83 per jury, because he knows the difficulties that cent, incapacity. arise from them and he knows that the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act is a standing disgrace in this regard. Let me refer again to the case of the after his return from service at Townsville twins, one in Townsville and one in should receive only the invalid pension for Malaysia, who fall ill without ever hearing his wife and himself for the period of his a shot fired. The one who comes back from incapacity. This does not suit the OpposiMalaysia and is discharged suffers a recurtion. In my view, PartV is not nearly as rence of his complaint in 12 months time. wide as the honourable member for Parkes He is immediately eligible for all the says it is. Let us take the case of a man who repatriation benefits that flow from the fact comes back from Townsville suffering from that he suffered an illness in the course bronchial trouble.

The honourable member for Parkes has had careful legal training. Either he did not want to explain the real meaning of clause 47 (3.) or he has not given to this matter the careful attention that I expect from him. He referred at length to Part VIII of the Social Services Act and he reminded me that an incapacitated person must convince the authorities that he is 85 per cent, So we come now to this Bill. The honourable member for Parkes is welcome to his views if he is satisfied that a man who suffers a recurrence of bronchial trouble willing to accept bronchial complaints that",88,Defence Re Establishment
166,Mr Hughes,Oh!,89,Defence Re Establishment
167,Mr E. James Harrison,"Theare contracted while a man is on service. But a private citizen has great difficulty in having such a condition accepted for the purposes of social services. This is because bronchial troubles occur spasmodically. The benefits of the Social Services Act will apply to a serviceman who suffers from such a complaint if he is hindered in obtaining or maintaining himself in employment or in undertaking work on his own account. The honourable member for Parkes and other honourable members on the opposite side of the House may be satisfied with PartV as it is, but we are not. The men we are dealing with now are in a series of lucky dips. In the first lucky dip, service, he should not be given anything it is a matter of chance whether their marble is drawn or not. If their marble is drawn and they are called up, they are in another lucky dip which will determine whether they are sent to Malaya and are therefore protected for the rest of their lives or whether they are sent to Townsville and run the risk of having to bear the cost of their maladies themselves for the rest of their lives. If we were dealing with a system of voluntary service, there may be a case to support the proposition put by the honourable member for Parkes. But when we have conscription and take a man's freedom from him, we must accept the responsibility of protecting him and supporting him for the rest of his life if anything happens to him. The men we are dealing with here are liable to be called up at 20 years of age or at any time until they are 26 years of age, and in some instances even until they are 30 years of age. Let us consider the position of a man who is called up at 26 years of age. Let us assume that he is sent to Townsville and develops a bronchial weakness. If he is discharged and cannot maintain himself, he will be given the invalid pension, but his position will be no different from that of the civilian who lives in the same street as he does. I will not be convinced that this is not so. When the serviceman who is medically fessional men and engineers and this was unfit asks for a pension, he will be required its way of getting them. The Government to establish to some authority that he is deliberately chose 20 years as the age at suffering from 85 per cent, incapacity, and which men would be called up, so that they the civilian in the same street is required to could finish their apprenticeships and their establish the same degree of incapacity. I university courses. These are the men that say quite deliberately that if no more conthe Government will conscript. But it says sideration is given to these servicemen who to them that if they fall by the wayside are discharged through illness after serving in Australia than is now given by the repatriation authorities to ex-servicemen, then heaven help those in this scheme who fall by the wayside. An applicant for an invalid pension must establish that he has an 85 per cent, incapacity, but it is impossible for any doctor to measure precisely 85 per cent, incapacity. The same tight provision will be applied to these servicemen, and in my book that is not good enough. If anything happens to a young Australian who is conscripted while he is serving or if, after his discharge, he suffers from a disability that can be related to his less than the rate of pay he was receiving at the time of his conscription. The Government has taken him away from his civilian occupation. He has not been given a choice. He has been directed to join one of the Services. Once the Government gives a direction to any person, it should see that, if he suffers an illness or an injury, the minimum amount awarded to him is the rate of pay he was receiving before he was conscripted. The term of service of these men will be from two years to five years and in an emergency they may be required to serve continuously. As the honourable member for Stirling rightly put, we are not satisfied with the protection that is being given to these men. If the Government insists on these provisions and will not grant any additional benefits to those who are conscripted in a national emergency and serve for a period of years, this country will lose the confidence of those who are conscripted. In the present state of world affairs, we cannot afford to have this happen. Let me deal now with statements that were made about the fields of employment from which these men would be taken. In November last, the Minister told us that the Army wanted doctors, tradesmen, prothrough ill health they will receive only the invalid pension. The Minister said that this was a charter, and we will criticise it, as I am criticising it, on that basis because it is at the moment only a framework. The men who will be conscripted are worthy of much more consideration than this charter is giving them. I would not be so concerned with PartV if it were not that one of the legal men on the Government side of the House, the honourable member for Parkes, treats the provisions as though they were worthy provisions. In my view, the whole question of the rehabilitation of these men needs overhauling. I did agree with one line of argument, but not with the way it has been done. I agree that there should be flexibility in dealing with this kind of situation, because circumstances in which these men are rehabilitated could change rapidly. With develooments that are now occurring, the situation could completely change even in a period of two years. Recently when debating another matter Government introduced its legislation in I referred to the views of the Public Ser1945. vice Board on the changing conditions of employment in this new age of technology and automation. We know of the conditions numbers to deal with as the Chifley Governthat exist at the time these doctors, proment did, but in my book the future of fessional men and tradesmen are called up, 9,000 men is just as important as the future but we should also try to visualise the conof 90,000 men when it comes to an individitions that may exist in the years to come dual's claim for his rights. It is those indiviwhen we start to rehabilitate them again in which is only a framework and finally prove civilian life. It may be of help if we look whether it is capable of meeting the requireat the latest report of the Public Service ments of returned servicemen. I ask the Board in which reference is made to the Minister to have a good look at the clause changing conditions of employment even that has been applauded by the honourable in the Public Service. I quoteIn its consideration of the pay claims, the Board clause 10 of the Bill is that annual leave as has made such reviews of the classification strucwell as long service leave is to accumulate. tures as were necessary. It has been guided by the view that in many parts of the Third DivisionI think that the honourable member for of the Service, the classification structures had Parkes interprets the clause in the same way become undesirably complicated with too many as I do. I think that all employers ought to classes based on fine distinct'ons and with overbe aware of the real situation. lapping salary ranges and that, in these circumstances, they no longer fully met the working needs of Departments. The avoidance of fine distinctions (sometimes called broadbanding) enables the simplification of the classificat on structure, and hire purchase level ceases at the end a small number of classes each containing more of 12 months from the time that a servicepositions, and the avoidance of overlapping salary man is discharged. There may be something ranges. The policy of simplification and broadbanding does not, however, mean that the review to be said for that provision but I doubt of occupational categories will result in similar whether 12 months is long enough. Tf a classification structures. The classification strucyoung Australian between 20 and 26 is ture for each occupational category is being constructed in the light of the characteristics of the category in question and the working needs of the Service, after close consultation with the Departments concerned. That is an outline of one of the biggest employers in this country. The changing needs of work values and the need to change our approach causes me to think that the first mistake we made in conscription in Australia was to select the age of 20. At 20 years of age the great bulk of young people will be ready to move into some type of employment. The doctor will be endeavouring to put up his plate. I am mentioning categories named by the Minister; they are not my choice. The tradesman will be ready to take up his job. The professional man will be in a like position. At the end of two years-thi s is about the only real point on which I agree with the Minister-flexibilit y will be necessary properly to fit these men into their categories and this task will call for thinking equal to, if not deeper than, that which was necessary when the ChifleyI know that we will not have the same dual claims which will test this legislation member for Parkes( Mr Hughes). I ask him to examine whether what is meant in Thi protection given at the moratorium taken out of his normal occupation for two years can he be expected to settle down immediately to his job when he returns? I think we might be making a mistake. Let me put another proposition to the Minister. A young man who has been conscripted might marry after he has entered the forces and as a result of an accident in Australia he might be killed. As I read the measure, the only protection that his widow would have would be under the Workers' Compensation Act, and at the end of 12 months, if I read this Bill correctly, she loses all protection at the moratorium and hire purchase levels. We should provide for better protection in this kind of situation for those whom we are conscripting. If a serviceman is killed in, say, Malaya body's £ s. d.; we are dealing with human his widow would become a war widow and lives in this legislation and we should not would receive repatriation benefits. Howbe called upon to do so at such short ever, if the worse does happen to a servicenotice. man, I do not care whether he is killed in Townsville, Sydney of Malaya; in my book, if he is married, his wife is a war widow and is entitled to be treated as a was given the reason. war widow at the hands of this Government. Is it not sufficient to put his widow into the position where she has to be for information. Even at this stage the dependent upon the Workers' Compensation Minister himself cannot answer some of the Act. There is every possibility that her questions that have been asked. I ask the case would not be finalised within 12 Government, the Minister and his advisers months, anyhow. The case I have just cited why the Bill is being rushed through in the is only a shadow of what we might find way that it is. The honourable member for could happen.

In effect, as the Minister pointed out in his second reading speech, it is a re-establishment charter for national servicemen who are now in the course of being called up and I am confident that this Bill will meet It has been said by the two honourable members opposite who have spoken on this measure that there has been delay in bring-",92,Defence Re Establishment

It is worth noting in passing that the Government in office in 1944 when the legislation setting up the rehabilitation scheme was introduced was a Labour government which obviously had procrastinated during the period that it had been in office from 1942 to 1944. It is important to note also that a member of the Labour Government at that time was the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). He is aware of what would be required in a rehabilitation scheme. He and his supporters should have accepted their responsibilities and, perhaps, prodded the Government into action. But I have not heard any mention, either by question or in any other way, to suggest that the Government was slow in introducing the present measure, which is necessary to protect national servicemen. Therefore, I claim quite confidently that there is no point whatever to the arguments about the delay. As1 have indicated already, all those three purposes in mind. He said these concerned know of the entitlements which werewill be available for their protection on discharge after their tour of duty as national servicemen. It will be recalled that the civil Commonwealth Reconstruction Training servicemen in relation to obligations they had Scheme, which was introduced towards the entered into before becoming liable for national end of the last war and which was launched service; third, the facilitation of the re-establishin February 1944, was fully implemented ment of national servicemen in civil life on comto /ards the end of 1945.

This is an extremely important Labour and National Service which did a measure, and one which, in my view should particularly good job through its industrial be above party politics. It represents the distraining division in the field of vocational or charge of the nation's duty to those who trade training, or professional training other serve it in time of war or in time of national than at a university type course. It is proper emergency. The Bill is a document calling to comment at this stage that the Governfor intimate, human consideration of indiviment of the day did a very good job in dual problems. In my opinion no facet of introducing these training schemes. It would life calls for greater understanding and be proper to say also that the Bill now greater sympathy than the restoration of a before us has taken some of the points from young man to his normal way of life after those training schemes and that the schemes service in the interests of his country. will provide a valuable guide when we reach the stage when the re-establishment of national servicemen in civil life becomes necessary. The major work of training was performed by the Department of Labour and National Service. From the records I have been able to discern that the Department provided training for 78 per cent, of the total demand. The reconstruction training was of great benefit to ex-servicemen, as we all know. In fact, it was of great benefit to industry and to the national welfare. The success of the scheme, in my opinion, was due to the ready co-operation of State educational authorities, employer organisations and the trade unions. Australia has learnt much from the experience of this form of rehabilitation-experienc e which will be used with profit in the re-establishment charter for the future of national servicemen which is provided by this Bill. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this Bill provides a "" re-establishment charter for national servicemen "". He said that the Government had First, the protection of the interests of national servicemen in relation ot their reinstatement in employment; second, the protection of national It is of great significance that this Bill Implementation of the intentions of the Government as set out in this Bill will call for sympathetic, intelligent and very tolerant treatment. I believe that the experience gained since World War II in the field of repatriation and other areas of soldier welfare will be of inestimatable value in rehabiliwill be much trouble in fitting these men tating and re-establishing national servicemen. As a result of experience gained in the years since World War II the officers of the Repatriation Department, the War Service Homes Division and the Department of Labour and National Service have become expert in dealing with the tasks imposed on them. They are efficient, and above all they are very sympathetic in their treatment of an infinite variety of individual cases. Thereyoung national servicemen, and who will fore, as far as they are concerned, it will not be a matter of experimenting in order to obtain beneficial results. They already know what they are required to do in the execution of their office in the various departments. Mr Deputy Speaker, we are living in a technological age, particularly as it applies to the operation of modern equipment in our three Services-the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. It is obvious, therefore, that national servicemen who serve in any of these arms will have the opportunity to improve their technical knowledge and competency if they are so minded. They will then be able to seek a better type of employment, perhaps, than they had when first called up. I would imagine that a national serviceman who has been given this opportunity of acquiring technical knowledge and competency will find that his services in civil life are in very great demand. So, I believe that many young men will find the experience they gain in the Services will be of great value to them in after life. I trust-and I just raise this point of warning-that the trade unions will not obstruct these lads when they try to get back into civil employment upon discharge. I trust that they will not face any difficulty in obtaining employment of their choice or be barred from joining the particular union associated with that employment. In other words I hope there will be no closed shop against young men who are seeking to return to civil employment, and that they will be shown the utmost goodwill and co-operation by the trade unions. Such goodwill and cooperation are very essential if the scheme envisaged in this Bill is to be successful. What part will the employers play? Will they accept their responsibilities or will they seek to avoid them? Will they look for loopholes in the Act to escape re-employment of national servicemen upon discharge? In time of labour shortage I do not think there back into jobs but if there is an over abundance of labour, will the employers honour their obligations or will they discriminate in their choice of labour? I feel that as was the case after the last war there will be some employers who will seek to avoid their obligations, who will be ruthless and selfish, who will act with no regard for human consideration or for the sacrifice made by not give them a fair deal. The people of Australia must demand that this Government stand solidly against any employer who seeks to avoid his obligations to national servicemen, no matter how strong or powerful the employer may be. I wonder whether employers will subsidise the wages of national servicemen? I know that there is nothing in the Bill which makes provision for this. As Army pay and fringe benefits are now so good it is conceivable that many servicemen will receive more than they did in civil life. But there will be numerous instances where young men of 20 who are capable, efficient and responsible in their civil jobs will find themselves at some disadvantage with only their Army pay to rely on. Will employers make up the difference in pay rates as was done in so many cases during the last war? I hope that they will do so even though there is no compulsion on them. Clause8 of the Bill which statesAn employer shall not hinder or prevent a person employed by him from volunteering for service in, or serving in, a part of the Reserve Forces or of the Citizen Forces. Penalty: One hundred pounds. There are many ways in which an employer can influence an employee against volunteering for service. He can exert influence that is tantamount to intimidation. A lad can be placed in the position of fearing to prejudice his future. I only hope that any lad so hindered will, as required by the Act, come forward with courage and lay his complaint against his employer so that appropriate action may be taken. During the last war I knew of many instances in which unpatriotic employers acted in this way, and I hope that in the somewhat critical circumstances in which we are now placed there will be no employers endeavouring to avoid their responsibilities. I note that the BiU makes no mention of preference. Preference, of course, has been a feature of past legislation and awards. In the past, difficulties have been experienced in connection with interpretation in certain circumstances and situations. Can it be for these reasons that no provision relating to preference is included? I do not know. Or is it that an optimistic view is being taken, the view that the safeguards of preference are not necessary as, under this Government, keen competition for jobs will continue well into the years ahead? I should say that there will be plenty of jobs for lads on their discharge from national service. Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason why a preference clause has not been included. One of the inevitable problems that I of national servicemen in this country, it foresee is the position of the lad of 20 has not had ample opportunity to draft years of age, who may be a junior clerk suitable legislation and present it in time to and who is called up. He may be a good ensure that honourable members on this side soldier, a born leader of men, a lad who of the House had every opportunity of possesses all the qualifications necessary to considering it. make a good officer, and he may get a commission. After five years of service, he for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) has will have matured very considerably as an already explained, this Bill contains 37 officer bearing responsibility. He will have pages and 60 clauses. Each of those clauses known a life of command and a life of contains a complexity of detail and obviresponsibility.

In view of the points I have made, and because of the understanding I have that this Bill is going to be of considerable benefit and use in the re-establishment of our national servicemen, I commend it and hope it has a speedy passage. the criticism that has been levelled at the Minister for Labour and National Service Government in general tonight for having thrust this type of legislation upon honourable members on this side of the House at such short notice is well deserved. Nothing that the Minister can say in defending himself against this criticism will convince honourable members on this side of the House that, since the Government made its decision in 1964 to legislate for the call up As my colleague the honourable member Tuesday of this week, and the Opposition is obliged to resume the second reading",93,Defence Re Establishment

This meant that we had to remain here and endeavour to understand the complexities of the legislation that we now have before us when possibly we should have been giving consideration to other matters, ln fairness to the Minister, it must be said that he did at least make available an officer of his Department to help us in our consideration of some of these matters. We acknowledge that but, in my opinion, that does not excuse the Government's action in bringing down legislation of this kind at such short notice. The honourable member for Stirling( Mr national servicemen under this scheme. Webb) who led for the Opposition in this debate, has already pointed out that this legislation can mean a great deal to the many national servicemen whom the Government will be calling up to serve this country in the years that lie ahead. Since the proposals before the House will have an effect upon their future after their discharge, the Opposition feels that the matters contained in the Bill ought to be given the fullest possible consideration by this Parliament. Certainly, under the circumstances in which it has been presented to us, we have not had the opportunity to which we are entitled of fully considering the Bill. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Cockle), who has just resumed his seat, has denied the accuracy of the Opposition's contention that gross discourtesy has been shown to honourable members on this side of the House. Government members seem to have adopted the attitude that everything contained in this legislation is quite satisfactory, that no anomalies are likely to arise and that the interests of the national servicemen are fully protected by the Bill. The Opposition does not share this view. We believe that the legislation contains many provisions that ought to be considered further by the Minister. The honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Blaxland have referred to them already, and the Opposition will expect that the questions that we have raised will be National Service, who now sits at the table. I certainly do not share the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Warringah who says that the type of national service to which he has referred will provide the type of experience that is likely to be of benefit to these young national servicemen when they are discharged from their service. Unless there is a great improvement in the attitude of the Army authorities towards these national servicemen compared with the attitude they adopted when national servicemen were called up at a certain age for three months under the Government's previous legislation, I suggest that the national servicemen called up under the present proposal will not benefit in any way at all. Honourable members on this side certainly hope that there will be some type of special treatment accorded These young citizens of Australia are to be called up to serve for two years. Despite what has been said by honourable members on the Government side of the chamber, obviously these young men will be at a great disadvantage when they return to civilian life. The Minister for Labour and National Service may plead that it is not possible, in legislation of this kind, to provide for every contingency. I could quote a number of anomalies and injustices which will affect national servicemen and for which this Bill makes no kind of provision. I point out to the Minister at this stage that I know of one young citizen in Tasmania who conducts his own business and employs a number of workers. He has received a call-up notice and, if he is required to serve for two years, he will have no option but to close down his business, This will mean that his employees will no longer be in employment. What protection will this Bill afford in a case such as this? It is true that, under the terms of the measure, in certain circumstances, a re-establishment loan may be made. But, obviously, this young citizen, if he is called up to serve for two years, will be at a great disadvantage, because he will undoubtedly lose his business. So",96,Defence Re Establishment

Honourable members on this side of the House do not believe that this situation should apply. There ought to be general sympathy for the point of view raised by the honourable member for Blaxland that this Government might consider extending to national servicemen some of the benents that it has extended to other ex-servicemen and, indeed, to those who serve in the permanent forces. It is problematical whether this Government can place itself in the position whereby it can force young citizens of Australia to serve for a period of two years in the armed forces and yet have loose legislation, such as this which we are now debating, to protect them in the case of disability or injury. Why did the Minister or his departmental officers choose the Department of Social Services to cater for the requirement of a national serviceman who has been discharged from service with a disability? Would it not have been possible for the Repatriation Department to have accepted this responsibility? Surely the Minister could have examined this question more carefully. One factor that is rather important, and area public servants are granted extended which has not been covered in this debate, is leave of three months. However, the that if the Department of Social Services Government says that after two years' serpays a pension to a national serviceman who vice, some of which may well be in the has been discharged with a disability, that Territories I have mentioned, national serDepartment becomes responsible for the revicemen are not entitled to more than seven habilitation of that national serviceman, but days' leave.

A national the completion of their service. The Bill serviceman discharged with a disability provides for a maximum payment of £40 should not have to rely upon this Departafter two years' service and a minimum ment for his rehabilitation. I believe that payment of £20 for 12 months' or lesser this demonstrates clearly the weakness of service. Some Government members have this legislation. I turn now to the question of the rethat it is the same as that applying to memestablishment and re-employment of a nabers of the permanent forces. I point out to tional serviceman after discharge. It has the Minister that most, if not all, members already been stated that the Government can do no more than provide a period of seven days' leave to the national serviceman on the completion of his training. That is the period in which he has to rehabilitate himself before returning to civilian employment. Some Government supporters have suggested that it is not merely a question of seven days' leave because there will be accumulated leave as well. The Minister must surely realise that there will not be accumulated leave in all cases. Probably in only a small percentage of cases will there be accumulated leave. The national serviceman will be called upon to report for employment seven days after his discharge. We do not believe that this is a generous approach to the question. I point to the situation that applies in Papua and New Guinea and in our other external Territories. It must be clearly understood that in some instances national servicemen may be called upon to serve in New Guinea. In these circumstances surely the national servicemen would be entitled to the same leave as is granted to public servants who work in Papua and New Guinea. It is well known, of course, that after a period of 21 months' service in this My colleagues who have preceded me in indicated that they regard this as a generous contribution by the Government and claim of the permanent forces on discharge receive payments from the Defence Forces Retirement Benents Fund by way of pension, but the Government says that after a period of two years' service it is prepared to pay a gratuity of £40 to national servicemen. The Opposition has not suggested the amount the Government should pay, but we regard £40 as an insignificant sum which the Government could increase. In his second reading speech the Minister referred to the question of re-establishment loans. This has not been mentioned by preceding speakers, but I think it is an extremely important topic on which the Minister might supply further information. It is obvious that when a national serviceman is discharged after his two-year period, if he requires a loan to re-establish himself in business he is entitled to apply for one, but the extent of the loan is not known. No doubt this will be determined by the Minister's Department but perhaps the Minister can tell us who will make the decisions on these loans. also inform the House the rate of interest payable on these loans. They will not be interest free loans because the Government does not believe in extending to national servicemen interest free loans. What is the rate of interest that will be applied to these ing for employment through the Department loans? This is extremely important to the national serviceman. I commenced my speech by referring to a citizen of this country who, apparently, is to be called up to serve for a period of two years and who is almost certain to lose his business as a result of this Government's conscription legislation. Obviously, that citizen will need a loan if he is to be able to rehabilitate himself in his business following his discharge. I believe that the Minister should tell the House, first, who will be responsible for deciding the amount of the loan that will be made available; secondly, what will be the period after discharge within which a national serviceman must apply for a loan; and thirdly, what rate of interest will be payable on the loan. 1 have covered some matters to wbich other honourable members from this side of the House, who have spoken rn this debate, have referred. This legislation leaves a great deal to be desired. It certainly does not apply the rehabilitation principles of the 1945 legislation. If a national serviceman is to be rehabilitated following his discharge and if he needs specialised training, he will immediately be thrown on the resources of the States. This Government is not prepared to accept any responsibility at that stage. The honourable member for Stirling pointed out in the course of his speech that in at least one State-South Australiafacilities for the training of national servicemen after discharge are not available. It is quite obvious that the Commonwealth Government is not prepared to establish the types of facilities which were available after the Second World War and which were established by the Labour Government of the day. I refer, of course, to the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. Such facilities will not be available for discharged national servicemen, who will be thrown back on the resources of the States. It appears to me that the great weakness of this legislation is that in every respect it is the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Social Services which must accept the responsibility. It must be clearly understood that these discharged national servicemen will not receive any special treatment at all. When they apply for positions they will merely apply together with other citizens who are applyof Labour and National Service. The great weakness of this legislation is that it does not provide any special consideration in terms of rehabilitation, employment and coverage in respect of sickness and other disabilities that national servicemen may experience. Too much responsibility is being placed on the Department of Labour and National Service. We members of the Opposition do not believe that the responsibility should rest on that Department. -Order!

The first is that on 25th March last the Minister for Labour and National made a statement in this House setting out the substance of the Bill that is now before us. I understand that, very properly, he made officers of his Department available to members of the Opposition for discussions on the details of the Bill. I am told that the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison), for example, availed himself of those facilities, and that they were offered to the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb). I do not know whether he availed himself of them. That is one reason why I believe that in this instance the Opposition's criticism is captious. The second reason is the nature of thc of 10-woul d want it in the form of a Bill itself. Most of the provisions of the Bill home.

It is well and good that these assist in the housing of discharged national people should know before they are taken servicemen, as I said, at the time of disinto the forces what their general rights of charge if they are married and, if they are re-establishment will be; but the details, not married at the time of their discharge, including the legal details-ther e may be on the date when they are married. talk about the legal effects-ca n be worked out and adjusted in the two years and more that remain to us before the relevant parts Government grant of £250, which is given of the Bill become operative. For those two to everybody who saves £750, to, say, £350 reasons I believe that in this instance the for discharged national servicemen as a Opposition has been a little captious and mark of the nation's special obligation and unreasonable in some of the criticisms that gratitude to these men who have served it has made. In regard to the Bill itself, there is only out the administrative details. I also believe one matter to which I want to direct attenthat it would be good if the general printion and one suggestion that I want to put ciple that I have outlined were adopted and before the Minister. I believe that there is made part of Government policy here and one omission from his Bill. That omission now. can be remedied. There will be plenty of time in which to remedy it. I believe that insufficient emphasis is placed on the rehousing or housing of the discharged national servicemen. I know that the discharged national servicemen who have had overseas service will be entitled to war service homes. But would it not be good if, in parallel with the War Service Homes Divimoved forthwith. sion, we had another organisation which would make housing benefits-perhap s not a third time. on full war service homes terms, but on generous terms-availabl e to all national servicemen who have served their time? I suggest that national servicemen who have served their two years in the forces should become entitled to a loan representing, say, 90 per cent, of the value of the home, with a reasonable maximum of £3,000 or £4,000, at a low rate of interest, say 5 per cent., on discharge if they are married and, if they are not married, on the date when they are married. If we did that we would be doing something which was very much in line with thinking all over the world. We would be giving people who have served their country a stake in their country. Some national servicemen might want their entitlement in the form of a farm or a business; but most of them-probabl y 9 out It might be a good idea to increase the it. That is all I want to say.

188,Bill (On Motion By Mr Mcmahon) Read,"BILL 1965. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 13th May (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill aims to preclude further monopolisation in ownership and programming of Australian commercial television stations. It aims to carry out the work which the 1960 legislation was designed to achieve. The Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) has confessed that the 1960 legislation did not succeed in its object. He has not been too specific in giving the timetable of the Government's failure under the 1960 legislation. In the intervening five years monopolisation of ownership of television in this country has proceeded apace, as has monopolisation of programming. The first matter-monopolisatio n of ownership-cam e to a head when the Ansett interests were denied the licence for the third television station in Brisbane and then bought up the shares in the company which secured the licence. The Minister made some statements on the procedure by which his decision had been thwarted and after a decent interval of time he admitted thut there was nothing he could do about it. This was more than a year ago. Now that the Ansett interests are securely entrenched in breach of the existing law, the Minister has brought in a Bill which will prevent, he hopes-w e all hope-furthe r breaches of the law intended five years ago. breach of the existing law. some time to find out over a year ago.

If you knew that he was not in breach of the law and was entitled to the licence, why were you withholding the licence? You had been frustrated. You were baffled. You have not explained to the House why you have taken a year to see that your decisions and policy are not frustrated on subsequent occasions. You have not explained why you are doing nothing to vindicate the Government's policy as announced five years ago and to restore the position when the licence comes up for renewal. of five years ago. that there was no breach of the law when you said you were withholding his licence. Were you trifling with him as well as with the House? holding his licence. licence-the licence which you had promised to the company, the shares which the Ansett interests had bought up. It is true, of course, as you know-as you should have known then and as had been revealed some time before-that there was no breach of the law if the voting rights did not exceed 15 per cent, in more than two stations, even if the shareholding did exceed 15 per cent, in two stations. I hope-w e all hope-that the amendments you have now brought in will carry out the Government's policy. We hope that you are spared the humiliation on future occasions exercise your judgment. many of my learned friends I could find loopholes in this legislation, but as long as I hold office in the Parliament I would not think it proper for me to make that endeavour.

I only regret that Government would have devised some the public interest is not being restored in accordance with the Government's policy of five years ago. The Minister has not said why he has taken so long to bring in these amendments. PerhapsI may refer to the shareholdings in television stations of the major newspaper companies. I will go off Mr Ansett for a moment, although I may make some subsequent reference to him. I shall cite some figures from the report for the last financial year of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The ""Sydney Morning Herald"" holds 1,186,630 of the l i million shares in ATN Sydney, half the shares in QTQ Brisbane and large parcels in CTC Canberra and NBN Newcastle. The Sydney"" Daily Telegraph "" holds one third of the shares in TCN Sydney, one-fifth of those in GTV Melbourne and large parcels in WIN Illawarra, NBN Newcastle, BTQ Brisbane and NWS Adelaide. The Melbourne "" Herald"" holds 637,505 of the 750,005 shares in HSV Melbourne and large parcels in GTV Melbourne, BCV Bendigo, BTQ Brisbane, ADS Adelaide and TVT Hobart. supporters of the Government? tion the Adelaide"" News"" holds one quarter of the shares in TCN Sydney, one half of those in NWS Adelaide, and large parcels in WIN Illawarra, NBN Newcastle, GTV Melbourne, and BTQ Brisbane. The affiliates of the Melbourne "" Herald"", the Brisbane"" Courier-Mail"" and the Adelaide"" Advertiser "", hold one third and one half of the shares in BTQ Brisbane and ADS Adelaide. The"" West Australian "" holds 45 per cent, of the shares in TVW Perth. The Melbourne ""Age"" and the Hobart"" Mercury"" hold one-sixth of the shares in GTV Melbourne and TVT Hobart respectively. By comparing the latest report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board with its report of four years before one sees how monopolisation of ownership has gone ahead since the 1960 Act in breach of the policy enunciated by the Government at the time of the Act and intended by the Government to be ensured by that Act. In all these circumstances, one would have thought that the method to vindicate its policy and to assert its policy at least at the time the present licences expired or came up for renewal. The Government has not done so. Can the Minister give us at least the reason for ths failure of his policy and for his failure to defend it or assert it? The other question, the monopolisation of programmes, was intended to be tackled by the Minister's predecessor and the then Attorney-General, who is now the Chief Justice, also under the 1960 Act. The High Court ruled that the procedures they devised were not authorised by the Act. This decision was given in August 1963. Again, the Government has taken a very long time to devise methods for preventing the further monopolisation of programmes. amended. not say it had been. revealed. I said the terms of the licence which the Minister's predecessor issued with the advice of the then Attorney-General were declared by the High Court not to be authorised by that section. Since August 1963, when the High Court gave that decision, the Government has taken no steps to prevent the further monopolisation of commercial television programmes. The Minister has now repealed one section and proposed others which he believes will cover the position. Again, we hope that he is saved from further humiliation, that the Government's policy at least will be carried out from now on, and we regret that no steps have been taken to reassert the Government's policy in respect of those who have defied it up to now, at least from the time the present contracts expire. In its report last year, the Board made a summary of the consequences of the High Court's decision. It concluded in this wayThe Minister, on 21st November 1963, informed licensees that the notice given by him of his intention to impose further conditions of licences was withdrawn.

This, Mr Speaker, is an admirable euphemistic explanation. The House will remember that the Sydney metropolitan commercial television station had monopolised the programmes which the new commercial stations in Newcastle and Wollongong wished to purchase. The Minister had taken what he thought was the correct action under the 1960 Act to ensure that the Newcastle and Wollongong stations gained access on proper terms to those programmes. As the Board said, however, the constitutions of the companies at Newcastle and Wollongong were changed and the programming difficulties were overcome. They were overcome by the offending station in Sydney taking over the Newcastle and Wollongong stations. was the final, the ultimate, solution; the monopolisation of programmes was overcome by the monopolisation of ownership. One would have thought that the Board would have said as much, but reading between the lines and looking at other parts of the Board's report one sees that the cure for defying the Minister's policy in one respect was achieved by defying it in another respect. Once again I assure the Minister that he has the sympathy of honourable members on both sides of the House for the treatment to which the licensees have subjected him and their good wishes for better treatment in the future. I agreed in answer to some interjections to say something about the Ansett interests. Industries Ltd. makes a donation to political At least the Ansett television interests have funds, it is not out of pocket because the the virtue of being free from newspaper Government still sees that it makes 10 per control of television. My friend, the honorcent, profit on its overall activities. If the able member for Henty( Mr Fox) two weeks Ansett television companies make a loss, ago referred to some remarks I had made Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. still makes about the Ansett interests in general. He a 10 per cent, clear profit. had told me that he intended to speak on this subject, but I could not be here when he spoke. I assured him that I was aware ask that the Deputy Leader of the Opposiof the circumstances that he mentionedthat is, that the Ansett organisation has Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. was guarannever failed in any of its undertakings to teed a return of 10 per cent, on its investthe Government and that the Government ments in return for donations to political has not had to honour any of the guarantees funds. which it has given for the Ansett organisation. I do not dispute that. NothingI have in the point of order. strued as disputing it. WhatI did say was that the Government has ensured that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. will always find and be able to declare a 10 per cent, dividend on all the undertakings of its subsidiaries after accounting for depreciation, fixed interest payments and all other obligations. The Government ensures that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. will always be able to pay a 10 per cent, dividend after tax and reasonable allocation to reserves. still wrong. for Civil Aviation has stated this more than once in the Senate. He knows that the survival of the two airline policy depends on the profitability of Ansett Transport Industries. There is no mystery about it. He is quite frank and quite blatant about it. but my statement of it is correct. The Government ensures this 10 per cent, clear profit for every activity of any subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. by seeing that the principal subsidiary, AnsettA.N.A., has enough routes and high enough charges to provide this profit on all the activities of the group. The television activities of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. are being run at a loss. Nevertheless, all these losses are borne by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., which is guaranteed a 10 per cent, clear profit on all its activities.

218,Mr Speaker,"There is no substancedonations were made in return for a guaranteed 10 per cent, profit. I have said, Sir, that no matter how many donations Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. makes to political funds-and , of course, the latest instance was a nightly donation to the Liberal Party in New South Wales-the Government still ensures that the holding company, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., makes a 10 per cent, net profit after paying donations, after meeting television losses and all other expenses.

Accordingly, we should be able to make television films in Australia which could be sold in the rest of the English-speaking world, and which could be sold in other countries where English is a second language. The Minister, and his advisers too, apparently-bu t at least the Minister-adop t a very dilatory and very dubious attitude towards Australia film production. Film production these days is mainly for television purposes. Why do we not produce some films for our own television stations, particularly when we can sell them overseas? One Government Department-the Department of the Interior-ha s produced splendid documentary films. Ministers. to electoral matters, I agree with the honourable member. The films which governments have produced in Australia are of first rate quality and are accepted as such elsewhere. I have no doubt that private enterprise in Australia could produce films too. The Commonwealth could see, since it issues licences to television stations, that television stations sat down this evening I reached the firm used Australian films. It might be that it is difficult for a country of Australia's size to retain all its artists who can find employment in other parts of the English-speaking world. Nevertheless, there are a large number of fields in which we could produce films in Australia, and an English-speaking film produced in Australia should be welcome anywhere where English is understood. I regret that the Minister has made no reference in his speech to Australian film production-to the production of television programmes by Australians for Australians and for the English-speaking world. I have referred to the principal features of this Bill. We support the general objective of countering monopolisation and restrictive practices in ownership and in programming of Australian television. We believe, however, that the Minister has taken no steps to undo the damage which has occurred in the last five years and to restore the policy which his predecessor tion sat down he did so approving of the announced on behalf of the Government policy of his party, which is complete and five years ago. We believe that the House utter nationalisation. This may not disturb is entitled to an explanation and that honourable members are entitled to elicit this information. We believe that there should be now a joint parliamentary committee appointed to inquire into these matters as a whole, as the Senate Select Committee inquired into some features of them last year. Accordingly, I move That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:-""Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House considers that a joint select committee should be appointed to inquire into and report on(a) the operation and administration of the Broadcasting and Television Act, including issue of licences, shareholdings, networks, monopoly control and programming, and (b) other matters associated with this important medium of mass communication in Australia.

The honourable gentleman made the charge that no matter what happened to that organisation it would pay a 10 per cent, dividend. What authority did the honourable gentleman produce for that statement? Dr. Gibbs -Muck raking. friend, the honourable member for Bowman describes it as a muck raking performance.

What authority has the honourable gentleman for his attack upon Ansett Transport Industries this evening? Absolutely none at all. Apparently he works upon the premise that if he throws enough mud a little of it will stick. But the honourable gentleman sees one virtue in Ansett Transport Industries. He says it is free from newspaper control. AgainI come back to his leader-""My leader"". I can see the honourable member when I close my eyes. The scene appears before me as almost a fairy tale performance. "" My leader"", he says. What does his leader think about newspaper industries and about mediums of communication? I put it to the House and I put it to my honourable friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that his leader has an endemic hatred of all mediums of communication which do not support him. IfI may presume to weary honourable members, I want to refer to one or two illustrations of the thorough-going detestation of the Leader of the Opposition for newspapers, for people connected with them, and indeed for all people who have any association with organisations that hold a point of view that differs from his own. Let me quote some of the rapturous language of this leader"" My leader"". The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is sitting at the table there scribbling like aI must mind where I am and not say what comes to my mind. This is what his leader had to sayNaturally, as a member of the Australian Labour Party, I support nationalisation. It is a plank of our platform. It is part of my political making that statement? He had absolutely bible. I speak somewhat sadly on the question, because 1 cannot persuade the Government lo nationalise anything. If1 could only screw Ministers up to the point, I should nationalise, not only the wireless broadcasting system, but also banks and insurance companies. I should do a lot of things which, unfortunately, the Government will not do. These are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. They appear in "" Hansard"" of 2nd June 1942, and I hope the representative of the Melbourne ""Herald"" will take some heed of them. This is what the honourable gentleman thinks about people and institutions who put forward a different point of view from that of the Australian Labour Party. I refer to ""Hansard"" of 7th October 1942. He saidIn view of the irresponsible nature of the charges,That is, charges made by Sir Keith Murdochand the effect that they will have on public morale, will the Minister put a censor in each office of the Murdoch press, or will he issue an order prohibiting Sir Keith Murdoch from writing articles calculated to lower public morale, or, better still, will he have him interned? And here is another statementThe proudest day of my life will be that on which I see the Editor of the Melbourne "" Herald"" in the dock charged under that section of the Crimes Act which provides for seven years' goal without the option. Who said that? I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is sitting over there looking as comfortable as a pumpkin, that it was said by his leader. I am sure that the words I have read will be no surprise to the people outside this Parliament, but I think they are entitled to know exactly where the Australian Labour Party stands in the matter of television and in regard to the control of all mediums of communication in this country. But I want to return, if I may, to the attack made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition upon Ansett Transport Industries. The honourable gentleman said that Ansett has been securely entrenched and has been in breach of existing law. That was the language used by him. My friend, the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) who is sitting at the table, will confirm that that is a fair interpretation of what the honourable gentleman said.

If it appears that Ansett Transport Industries has acted outside the lawand I deny that for a start-the n plainly it is open to the Government to launch appropriate action against that company. But there is not one skerrick of evidence to support that point of view. Yet the honourable gentleman has made the charge that Ansett Transport Industries has been in breach of the existing law, and I suppose if a little of this mud rubs off elsewhere, the honourable gentleman will be satisfied. May I , Sir, with great respect, invite the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition to consider a point of view put forward by Lord Sumner. No doubt the honourable gentleman is not particularly interested in political authorities but perhaps he can recapture sufficient of his legal training to respect legal authorities. This is what Lord Sumner had to say in Levene against the Inland Revenue Commissioner, reported in 1928 Appeal CasesIt is trite law that His Majesty's subjects are free if they can to make their own arrangements so that their cases fall outside the scope of the taxing acts. They incur no legal penalties and, strictly speaking, no moral censure if, having considered the lines drawn by the legislature for the imposition of taxes, they make it their business were members of the Australian Labour to walk outside them. Has the honourable gentleman any complaint to offer against that statement? If any person or any group of companies in this country has gone outside the law, then it is not up to this Parliament to turn round and seek to impose any censure upon them. This Parliament is responsible for the law and if, when the last amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act were before us, there were any deficiencies apparent, then it was open to those who sit on the Government side and those who sit on the Opposition side to refer to them. But what was the attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tonight? He sought refuge-and I think it is a thorough-going euphemism so to style it -by saying: "" Oh, well, it is not up to an office bearer in the Parliament to refer to any deficiencies "". I invite the honourable gentleman to reconsider his position. I invite him to acknowledge the fact that his duty as a member of this Parliament is supreme. If he recognizes any flaw in legislation, if his sense of perception is such as to indicate to him that some company or some group of companies, by resorting to a particular form of behaviour is escaping from what may be predicted as policy, it is open to him to indicate what should be done. But what happened when the legislation was last before us? There was not a peep from the honourable gentleman. I venture to say that it is open to all companies to use such resources as may be open to them to seek to protect themselves. It is also open to this Parliament to seek to protect the policy as proclaimed by the Government. This is precisely what is happening this evening. With no sense of impertinence or affectation, I would like to congratulate the Postmaster-General most warmly on his ingenuity, enterprise and skill in putting before the House amendments that will protect the essential and declared policy of the Government. But what does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do? He moves a miserable contemptible little amendment inviting the Parliament to set up a select committee. I return, Sir, to where I began my speech. What virtue would there be in having a select committee established on which there Party who hold this stated policy of nationalisation? It would be a complete and thorough-going waste of time. This Bill is plainly a measure which is best considered in Committee. It is a measure which I most respectfully describe as being very complicated and very complex. It is a measure which is open to points of view but, nevertheless, I hold that those points of view can be best considered in Committee. I have been stimulated this evening by a number of things. First of all, I have been stimulated by the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in leading for his Party, has sought by one way and another to disguise from the Parliament and from the Australian people the fact that his Party is still pledged to the complete nationalisation of television in this country. SecondlyI have been stimulated by the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made what I repeat was a thoroughly scandalous and scurrilous attack upon Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. I recapitulate that the Australian Labour Party hates success, and the reason why it hates success is that it is a party of failure. Finally, may I , by no way of weary recapitulation, again congratulate the Postmaster-General on the tremendous amount of time that he has put into this measure? This is a measure which, although it is complicated and may appear, prima facie, difficult to understand, nevertheless represents a very well intentioned effort on the part of the Postmaster-General, and on the part of the Government, to secure the essential interests of free enterprise in Australia, to see that those interests are well balanced against those of the Government, which rest under the general aegis of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and at the same time to see that those interests of free enterprise are not put into the perilous position of being completely controlled by a few people in this country. thing that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) has done for me in particular this evening has been to clear up why it is that so many members of the Australian Labour Party have such a warm spot in their hearts for him. He said that the Labour Party hates success. I am certain that this is the reason why he feels so close to Jim. I was amazed at the pleasure that was expressed by members of the Labour Party when the honourable member was successful in passing his lawyer's examination. We know he must be a good lawyer because it took him twice as long to get his degree as it takes the average person. Now, before I get on to the speech which 1 have prepared, and which I hope has far more relevance to the Bill before the House than the speech to which we have just listened, let me, once and for all, verify the statement that was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) about Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. Senator Paltridge attempted to justify the Australian National Airlines Bill in 1961 by sayingAnsett Transport Industries Ltd. must have a target of the order of 10 per cent, after tax, and a Postmaster-General, Sir Charles Davidson, reasonable allocation to reserves. ment introduced that measure. tridge said. F.4767/65 -R -[69 ] interpretation. -Order! The honourable member for Lang has the call. I would suggest that the House come to order and that interjections cease on both sides. I might remind the House that although we are discussing the Broadcasting and Television Bill, this debate is neither being broadcast nor televised. like to voice a strong protest against the Government's bringing down this legislation at this late stage of the session and then expecting the Opposition to discuss it within a very short time after its introduction. The second reading of this Bill was moved on 13 th May-onl y seven days ago. The honourable member for Moreton-and here I agree with him-sai d it was a most complex piece of legislation. The Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) said in his speech that it was a complex piece of legislation. Yet the Opposition and the backbench members on the Government side have been given only seven days in which to investigate the proposals outlined in the Bill. The Bill that we are discussing has been under consideration by the Postmaster General, by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and by members of the Postmaster-General's staff since early in 1963, yet the Opposition has been given only seven days in which to consider the proposals that are now brought before us. In order to prove my point, let me refer to the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for 1962-63 which, in paragraphs 111 to 120, contains specific statements to the effect that the Postmaster General and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board are perturbed by the actions of television companies in endeavouring to take over shareholdings in other companies.

On page 33 of closely related are the second reading that report, appears this statementOn 29lh June, 1964, John Fairfax Ltd. inGeneral and remarks made by his preformed the Minister that the company had decessor in officefiveyears ago. As reported purchased the Australian investments of Associated at page 1705 of ""Hansard"" of 12th May Television Ltd.

It goes onThis matter was being considered by the Minister3 of Part IV that is now in the Act. Division3 at the time of preparation of this Keport. Paragraph 100, on the same page, mentions provides that a person shall not be in a position paragraph 111 of the Board's annual report to control directly or indirectly more than two for 1962-63 and saysThese matters were still under consideration by capital of a company holding a licence shall be the Government at the time of preparation of this Held by residents of this country and that no Report. So the legislation that we are discussing of that capital. These provisions were enacted to tonight has been under consideration by express the Minister and his officers since early fall into the hands of too few, and that the 1963. The amendments contained in the benefit derived from the exercise of licences Bill have been found to be necessary bewhich cause some of the smart operators conmunity. trolling television stations have looked for snide ways of getting round the legislation that was introduced by Sir Charles Davidson, the Postmaster-General, in 1960. Those people might have been legally correct in what they did, but they were certainly morally wrong. The present Postmaster General virtually said as much in his second reading speech, and Sir Charles Davidson also virtually said as much in the second reading speech which he made in 1960. The legislation we are discussing tonight is designed to do exactly the same things as the 1960 legislation was designed to do. In this Bill, the Minister has made no real attempt to impose stringent penalties on these people who operate television station licences and endeavour to get round legislation enacted by this Parliament. This is another instance of people of this kind endeavouring to obtain control of very powerful instruments by snide operations. People of this sort caused the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), not many months ago, to introduce in this House legislation extensively altering the income tax laws. Some of the owners of our television stations, and people like them, are always endeavouring to find ways and means of getting round acts of this Parliament in order that they may put more money into their own pockets. 1 want to show the House just how speech made by the present PostmasterI now come to a group of clauses in the Bill which substitute a new Division3 for the Division in the Act at present contains two very significant sections. The first is section 91 which television licences. The second is seciion 92 which provides that 80 per cent, of the share non-resident shall hold more than IS per cent, this Government's policy that this very important channel of communication should not lay in the grant of the Government should be spread widely through the Australian comHe went on to sayThe Government does not deviate from the policy which it asked this Parliament to express in sections 91 and 92 of the existing Act and accordingly I have retained them in substance in the new Division 3. But the Government is desirous that there should be no frustration of that policy by sheltering behind a legal concept whilst in truth and in commercial reality the policy is being defeated. Sir Charles Davidson addedI do not pause here to speak in detail of the manner by which the clauses ensure that this provision cannot be evaded by the interpolation of a company or a series of companies between the person seeking to control the television licence and the company which has it. In the later part of his speech, he spoke of the monopolisation of television programmes in these termsMr Speaker, there may, of course, at times be a dearth of available television film, and I do not propose to enter what is perhaps a controversial field of discussion as to whether that is or is not a prevailing condition at the moment, but the Government has decided that it will take its stand against any endeavour to monopolise television film-to corner it, to use an old and well understood phrase-and to use it, not as an item of commerce but as an unwarranted source of power. There are further references in this speech to the efforts made by the Government at that time to curb the activities of some of the holders of tele%'ision licences in the monopolisation of programmes. I turn now to the present Bill. The Postmaster-General opened his second reading speech by sayingThe primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1964 to make more effective the provisions relating to the ownership and control of television stations. Because of the extent of the amendments required it has been considered desirable to remake the whole of Division3 of Part IV of the ActThose words are almost exactly the same as the words used five years ago by Sir Charles Davidsonand the opportunity has been taken, at the same time, to propose a number of incidental amendments. Certain alterations are also proposed in respect of the way in which, in the future, problems in respect of what is termed the monopolisation of programmes will be dealt with. Again, the words are almost exactly the same as the words used five years ago by Sir Charles Davidson. The Minister went onHonorable members may recall that on 17th wiiich were in a position to control only one December 1964 I made a statement announcing the Government's intention to bring down legislation station, and IS by persons or organisations which to deal with the position of the ownership and were in a position to control, or were substancontrol of television stations. I pointed out in tially interested in, two stations. The remaining that statement that the Government's policy with 59 stations were controlled by persons or organisarespect to the control of commercial television tions which were in a position to control directly stations has been and still is, broadly, that no or indirectly, or had substantial interests in, three person, and this includes a company, should be in or more stations, but in no case did it appear to a position to control, either directly or indirectly, the Board from the information in its possession more than two licences and that, as far as practhat there had been any infringement of section 90 ticable, licences for country television stations of the Act during the year to which this report should be held or controlled by local interests. relates. The present provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act relating to this matter, which were enacted in 1960, were framed with the intention I hope that the Board's information about of giving effect to this policy but, notwithstanding television stations is much more accurate the comprehensive provisions of the 1960 legislathan its information about radio stations. tion, situations have developed which, though they From this report it is obvious that the Board are not in breach of the law, are in conflict with the Government's stated policy. So the Postmaster-General endeavouring to cover the tracks that were left so exposed by his predecessor, Sir Charles Davidson. But nowhere in his second reading speech did the Minister mention one television company, one director or one person who may have been concerned in the alleged infringements of the 1960 legislation. Why does not the Minister lay down before us in this House chapter and verse of his case and tell us who are these people who are endeavouring to infringe the law and who are causing this Parliament again to go through all the trouble of drafting and discussing this kind of measure in order to curb the activities of a few people in the community who continually endeavour to get round the laws of the land? The Minister, in this Bill, has made no attempt to deal with any of the infringements-o r perhaps likely infringements-of the 1960 Act. The Bill, indeed, provides that those who are infringing its provisions will not have to sell up any of their interests. The Government is well aware that it has been tricked by these snide operators. Therefore, why does it not force them to sell the interests that are said to infringe the law? I suppose that the answer to this question is reasonably obvious when we look at the people who control our newspapers, television stations and radio broadcasting stations. I have obtained relevant information relating to radio stations from the report of fhe Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the financial year 1963-64. At page 10, it statesAccording to the information supplied by the licensees to the Board during the year, 35 of the 110 commercial broadcasting stations in service were being operated by persons or organisations was not certain whether the information it was getting was reliable. I hope that in is again the case of television stations, particularly under the provisions of this Bill, the Broadcasting Control Board will be able to say it is certain from the information it receives that the Act is not being infringed. We find that included in the newspaper companies associated with broadcasting stations are John Fairfax and Sons Ltd., Australian Consolidated Press Ltd., David Syme and Co. Ltd., News Ltd., Advertiser Newspapers Ltd., West Australian Newspapers Ltd., Armidale Newspaper Co. Ltd., and Country Life Newspaper Co. Ltd. If we turn to page 33 of this same report we find set out in paragraph 101 the principal newspaper interests in commercial television stations. John Fairfax Ltd. is interested in ATN Sydney, CTC Canberra, NBN Newcastle and QTQ Brisbane; Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. is interested in TCN Sydney, WIN Illawarra area, NBN Newcastle, GTV Melbourne, BTQ Brisbane and NWS Adelaide; the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd. is interested in HSV Melbourne, GTV Melbourne, BCV Bendigo, BTQ Brisbane, ADS Adelaide and TVT Hobart; David Syme and Co. Ltd. is interested in GTV Melbourne; Queensland Press Ltd. is interested in BTQ Brisbane; News Ltd. Adelaide is interested in TCN Sydney, WIN Illawarra area, NBN Newcastle, GTV Melbourne, BTQ Brisbane and NWS Adelaide; Advertiser Newspapers Ltd. is interested in ATS Adelaide; West Australian Newspapers Ltd. is interested in TVW Perth; and Davies Bros. Ltd. is interested in TVT Hobart. The report also lists country and provincial newspapers that are substantial shareholders in television stations. If we examine this mass media in its widest ramifications we find that the same people to a large extent control our daily newspapers, our broadcasting stations and our television channels. From time to time in this House we hear talk about censorship and the need for the Government to lift censorship restrictions. Many organisations claim that there should be no censorship in Australia, but with our mass media we have a more dangerous censorship developing. Here people who are beholden to nobody can refuse to publish any item of news, can refuse to publicise anything that might happen, can refuse to allow people to appear on their television programmes, and if they so decide can virtually control the government of this country. This is a dangerous type of censorship. It is the type of censorship against which we should be safeguarding ourselves. nationalisation. nationalisation at all, although I do not see anything wrong with nationalisation. The alternative is that the legislation we are now discussing should be more strongly worded than it is so that no company or no individual should be allowed to have shares in more than one television company. We should curtail interests in this direction. The honourable member is reasonably new to this House and I do not know whether he was listening to the early part of my speech, but I pointed out that twice in five years-in 1960 and again in 1965-the Postmaster General and his predecessor have re-written Division3 Part IV of the Broadcasting and Television Act in an attempt to curtail the activities of these people, who, for some reason or other, seem to be regarded as little gods because they happen to control our newspapers. They are as vicious and as dangerous as any other person in the Commonwealth. Because they happen to be newspaper proprietors does not mean that they are not capable of envy, jealousy, bitterness or hatred, and to allow them to gain control of so much of our mass media js someihing which could be dangerous to us in future. There would be nothing wrong with the Government itself controlling our television licences. The licences cost these companies nothing and the companies return very little to the Commonwealth in fees, yet they make enormous pronts. Why should not the licences be held by the Commonwealth and rented out to these people perhaps on the basis of a proportion of their profits or on an annual rental? Why should the control of this powerful medium of television be allowed to get into the hands of private individuals? For the information of the HouseI point out that Mr Osborne, who was a member of the Royal Commission on Television, recommended that all transmitters should be under Commonwealth control. Most honourable members would know who Mr Osborne is, and that was his attitude in 1954. He said that in his opinion all transmitting stations should be under public ownership. In suggesting that there should be national control of television stations we are not committing the sin that the honourable member for Moreton might have honourable members believe. We are not committing the sin that the honourable member for clined to make out, because in the United Kingdom this situation applies. There is no such thing as a commercial television broadcasting licence in the United Kingdom. All licences are owned and controlled by the government. These are matters that we should be examining at this stage. Surely the Government has realized by now-in",110,Broadcasting And Television

246,Robertson ( Mr Bridges,"Maxwell) is inits attempts in 1960 and in 1965 to curb the activities of these people who are endeavouring to gain more and more control of our television stations-that it has to be much more deliberate in its attempts and it has to make absolutely certain that the restrictions on the ownership and control of television are much harsher than they are today. These are some of the reasons why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment asking for a joint select committee to go into the various operations of television stations. I appreciate that we have as Postmaster-General perhaps the greatest lover of private enterprise activities it is easy to criticise television programmes; in this Parliament. I know that some of the things I say displease him, but I think that his experience since he has been Postmaster General of the attitudes that he has had to adopt on many occasions should convince him that unless he gets rougher and tougher than he has been in the past the television owners are going to try to get around the provisions of this Bill the same as they got around the provisions of the 1960 legislation. ter is right, but the Minister's predecessor had exactly the same air of confidence when I spoke on the 1960 legislation at practically the same time of night. I conclude my remarks by once again complaining that legislation of this importance should be given to us so shortly before we have to discuss it. I feel that the Government and particularly the Leader of the House( Mr the owner of a network, such as the AusHarold Holt) deserve to be censured for not having legislation such as this brought before us in time to give us an opportunity to fully discuss it. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Friday, 21st May 1965. I rise to support the Bill. One of the principle against monopoly, which it has principles underlying our legislation on television is that there will be no monopoly of the means of transmission. That principle slation was passed? It is true that when that was evident in the first television bill-the legislation was introduced its provisions Broadcasting and Television Bill-whic h was appeared to be stringent and confidence brought in by this Government in 1956, and was expressed that they would cover the it is evident in the amending Bill that is position. For example, that legislation made before the House tonight. There are various it an offence to hold or to be in a position reasons why this principle is accepted by the Government and, I believe, by the majority of the people of Australia. In the first place, the concentration of this very important power of mass communication in the hands of one body or in the hands of a few bodies would give it or them a great influence over our thoughts and our minds. For example, if there were only one source of news in this medium a situation could easily arise in which only one side or one set of facts would be presented to us. Another reason is that the presence of competition in this field tends to keep up the standard of entertainment. Of course, but I think honourable members will agree that it is fair to say that in Australia we have a lively and efficient television industry and that at least in the capital cities we have a reasonable choice of programmes of good standard. The commercial stations have their problems; but, with encouragement from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, they have, in fact, displayed a considerable sense of responsibility. There are pressures which operate in favour of concentration of control in the hands of television stations. These pressures are very substantial. Some of them may be open to criticism. One of the facts of economic life in this industry is that network operation is more economical and is a sounder proposition commercially than independent operation. The cost of purchasing first rate programmes is such that tralian Broadcasting Commission, has a distinct advantage over the independent operator. That is one reasona perfectly innocent reason-wh y there is this strong tendency for the owners of television stations to seek to acquire an interest in as many stations as possible. To redress and check that tendency is the constant concern of the adopted in the public interest. What has happened since the 1960 legi-",113,Broadcasting And Television

Government, Having In Mind The Over","ridingto control more than one commercial television licence in a Territory or within 30 miles of a General Post Office in a capital city, or more than two licences in Australia. The effectiveness of that provision necessarily depended on how "" control"" was defined. In the 1960 legislation, section 92B it a prescribed interest to hold what it calls provided that a person who was in a position to exercise control of more than 15 per cent, of the voting power of a company holding a licence was deemed to be in a position to control that company. On the face of it, that looked to be a stringent provision. But a practice grew up under which companies provided in their articles of association that a shareholding would not carry more than 15 per cent, of the votes. In such a case a shareholder might excluded. These are overdrafts due to a have a very large-eve n a dominantshareholding in size and yet not have more than 15 per cent, of the voting strength. That was not in breach of the existing Act. It has been found that a large shareholding -eve n with these limited voting rights and, indeed, even with a large debt-ha s given to the holder of it control in fact which has a loan interest if, instead of lending the been contrary to the policy adopted by the Government. I come to the remedy that is now suggested. This Bill sets out to deal with three types of control-shareholde r control, creditor control and director control. Dealing with shareholder control and creditor, I point out that under the amendments contained in this Bill it still will be an offence to hold or to be in a position to control more than one licence in a Territory or within 30 miles of a General Post Office in a capital city, or more than two licences in Australia. But greater stringency ascertain whether a company is in a posihas been introduced in the provisions relating to control. Under this Bill a person necessary to go not to proposed new section will have what is called a "" prescribed interest"" which, for the purposes of this part of the discussion, we can regard as control if he is in a position to exercise control of more than 5 per cent, of the votes of a company holding a licence. The percentage is 5 instead of 15. People might say: "" The companies can alter their articles classed as control for this purpose. So, a again to reduce voting power to 5 per cent. This amendment will not worry them"". But proposed new section 91 (2.) also makes it a prescribed interest to have shareholding licence. Interests exceeding 5 per cent, of the total amount paid on all shares in the company. So it no longer will be possible to have a large or dominant holding in paid-up capital with a small vote. That covers shareholder control, direct or indirect. This proposed new section goes further. It also deals with creditor control. It makes interests in the company exceeding 5 per cent, of the total amount of all interests. Proposed new section 91 (1.) makes it clear that "" interest"" includes shareholding interest or loan interest. Loan interest may arise by various methods which are referred to in the definition. There is no need to go into them in this second reading debate. Loan interest covers debentures unsecured notes, and, in fact, all types of loans. But there are two types of loans which are bank and moneys owing in consideration of the supply of equipment. I think honourable members will agree that those are proper exclusions, although the second one seems to carry the consequence that if a company wants to borrow to buy equipment the lender will avoid being regarded as having company the money to buy the equipment, he buys the equipment and re-sells it to the company. However, the figures for equipment are not the majorfiguresin this industry. The major figures relate to the purchase of programmes. In addition, this Bill deals with director control. Proposed new section 92c provides, in effect, that a person shall not be a director of two or more companies which between them are in a position to exercise control of more than two licences. I am summarising the provision. In order to tion to exercise control in this sense, it is 91, which deals with prescribed interest and the 5 per cent, of the voting strength, but to proposed new sections 92A and 92B. Broadly, the effect is that voting rights exceeding 15 per cent, in the company holding the licence, or a holding of more than 15 per cent, of the paid-up capital, will be director of such a company having such a holding will be a director of a company in a position to control a company holding a The Bill, as originally drawn and brought before the House, made it an offence to continue after the prescribed date directorships which, although legaUy unobjectionable under the existing law, would not be permitted to be set up after this Bill is passed. Incidentally, the prescribed date is 17th December 1964, the date on which the Postmaster-General( Mr Hulme) made a public announcement of his intention to introduce these amendments. Since the bill was introduced the Postmaster-General has circulated a proposed amendment to the provision dealing with directorships. PerhapsJ could refer to that in dealing with the subject of retrospective operation of this tion. Before the prescribed date-17t h and other provisions of the Bill. A further provision to be noted is the prohibition against non-residents holding more than a certain proportion of shares. That section of the previous Act which required conditions to be inserted in the licence governing the proportion of shares which may be held by non-residents is repeated in the Bill. amending Bill will permit those holdings The next important provision deals with changes in ownership from time to time. Proposed new section 92F applies to transactions which will result in a person's obtaining a prescribed interest in a company holding a licence or, if that person already has a prescribed interest, to transactions which will result in his increasing his interest. Those two types of transactions are subject to the Minister's approval. If the Minister's approval is not sought, the Minister may direct that a person shall cease to have the new interest. Sub-section (4.) of proposed new section 92F provides that the Minister shall not refuse to grant approval or give a notice, unless there has been a report by the Board and unless considering the report and any recommendation the Minister considers there is a contravention of section 92 or that it is necesposal to allow those stations to continue sary to maintain the particular ownership or control in the public interest. Perhaps one may sum up by saying that a person who has interests lawfully acquired under the existing law, which would contravene the Bill, will be allowed to continue them, but will not be allowed to increase them. If he has interests under the existing law which would not breach the Bill, he will not be allowed to enter into a transaction which will increase his holdings so as to breach the present law. If he reduces his holdings, and those holdings at a prescribed date were in excess of what would be permitted once this Bill is passed, he has to keep them reduced; he is not allowed to return his holdings to what they were at the prescribed date. Although the Minister is given power to approve, he is not permitted under this legislation to approve a transaction which would create a breach of the Act. These are fairly tight restrictions. They will be more effective than the previous provisions in carrying out the Government's policy. There is one matter that I should menDecember 1964-whe n the Postmaster General announced his intention to amend the law, various television stations had acquired interests which were not in breach of the existing law but which would be in breach of the present provisions if similar action were taken at the present time. This to be continued. Although the Bill as it originally came before us would have required directorships to be discontinued under the amendment which the Postmaster General has indicated he will accept in the House it will now be possible to continue existing directorships which were not in breach at the prescribed date. I submit that this is a wise provision because to disturb these past transactions which were valid at the time they were entered into would be to give the legislation retrospective operation. Normally in a civilised community this is undesirable unless absolutely necessary in the public interest. In this particular case if one required a reconstitution of these interests there would be depreciation in the value of a lot of small holdings in these companies. I commend the prothe position which had in fact legally come into existence at 17th December last. What does the Opposition say to this Bill. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said that in the five years since 1960 monopolisation of ownership and programmes had proceeded apace and that a year ago Ansett acquired an interest in a Queensland television station which was in breach of the law. He said also that the Postmaster-General has been tardy in bringing down amendments. If we examine these allegations we find that they are without foundation. There have been changes in the ownership of television stations which have been in accordance with the existing law. The particular instance which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to, namely the acquisition by Ansett of an interest in a Queensland television station, was not in breach of the then existing law and would not be in breach of this law. As honourable members are aware, it is possible to have an interest in two television film available on terms which appear to the stations in different capital cities. This is all that would result from the acquisition by Ansett of the interest in the Queensland station. Both laws would permit this to be done. It is beside the point to refer to that transaction and to say that the Postmaster General should have acted. The foundation of the argument is not sound. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said also that under section 108 of the Act particular conditions were imposed in licences and that on application to the High Court of Australia those conditions were found to be outside the provisions of the section. This argument also is quite beside the point in relation to this Bill. There is no proposal to amend section 108. There is no need to amend it as a result of the High Court's decision. All that flowed from that decision was that if one wanted to give effect to the section one had better draw the licence in a different form. As it happened there was no need to issue further instruments under that section. An amendment has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition by which the Opposition, while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, seeks the appointregulations. It is true, of course, that regument of a joint select committee to inquire into and report on various general matters. If this amendment was designed to delay the Bill taking effect it would be contrary to what I understand to be the view of the Opposition and of honourable members on this side of the House. If the amendment simply means that we pass the Bill and then have an inquiry by a select committee, it does not amount to anything. We have already had a report of a select committee. We have the constant supervision of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The appointment now of another select committee would advance the matter no further. I therefore oppose the Opposition's amendment. BeforeI conclude my remarks I wish to carefully to the last two honourable members refer to one other matter. Section 105A of on the Government side who spoke in this the previous legislation dealt with the monopolising of television programmes. The section provided that the Board might, upon application of a television station, by order addressed to a person who has the right to make television film available and who has not complied with a request of the licensee, direct that person to make that Board to be just and reasonable in all the circumstances. Before making an order under section 105A the Board was obliged to hold an inquiry. It was not to make an order if it was satisfied that the person had reasonable grounds of objection for refusing to make film available. It was further stated that it would be a reasonable ground of objection if the person refusing showed that his failure was not in any way related to an intention or attempt to obtain control of the management or the selection of programmes of the other station. This section is to be repealed by the Bill and a new section 134 will be inserted. This new section gives the Minister a wide power to make regulations dealing with this subject matter. It may be said that the old section 105A was not used to any extent. It is not entirely clear whether this was because it was considered to be ineffectual. It may be said it would rarely be possible to prove that a refusal to supply film was in any way related to an attempt to gain control. While I am in agreement with the necessity for having an effective provision regarding the supply of television programmes, I question whether this should be left entirely to lations will have to be laid before both Houses, if they are made, and they may be disallowed. But this is a matter of considerable importance and I would ask the Minister to consider whether at least the principles should not be contained in the Bill. Subject to this comment, I support the Bill. Motion (by Mr Daly) negativedThat the debate be adjourned. thought honourable members opposite, who look so weary and distressed, might have cared to listen to me at a later hour this day when they would be more receptive to the views I will place before them. I listened",114,Broadcasting And Television
250,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [12.31 A.m.],"Idebate and to say the very least they were a very dreary pair. 1 gained the impression that they are very weary, perhaps as weary as their colleagues appear to be. 1 followed the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowen) closely, but 1 can only say, as charitably as possible, that his speech did not sound too good. However, it will probably read well. For his sake, ) sincerely trust that it will. His speech was a defence of the huge newspaper and vested interests which, under this Government, have taken over the television stations. The Bill gives us an opportunity at this late hour to refer to matters relating to television stations. The people will not know what our views are, because the Government always arranges for a debate on legislation such as this to be held at a time when people cannot listen to our speeches. I have here the ""Hansard"" for 18th May 1960. At8 o'clock at night, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) moved an amendment to the Bill. The 1960 legislation has proved to be a failure and the Government is now trying to bolster it a bit with some completely new provisions. The debate in 1960 finished at 4 a.m., after we had debated it for eight hours without a break. The debate started on Wednesday and finished in the early hours of the following day. Now the Government is asking us to debate this Bill in similar circumstances, although it has had the legislation for months. Why is the Government so ashamed of the legislation relating to television stations, speech of the Postmaster-General. It is the granting of licences and the control of stations? Why must it bring in bills relating to television stations when the proceedings of Parliament are not being broadcast and rush them through in the dead of night, no matter how tired honourable members may be. I think the Postmaster-General( Mr marised what he said were the terms of this Hulme) has something to answer for here. The legislation that he has brought down is of the most complex type. Honourable members opposite have admitted that this is so. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) said that it was a complex Bill. The Postmaster-General said in his second reading speech that it was a complex Bill. As I sat here tonight waiting for an opportunity to speak, the Postmaster-General produced half a dozen amendments to the Bill. Although we have not had a chance to look at them, the Minister expects us to put them through at this hour of the morning. had the Bill for a week. for six months, but he now tells us that we have had it for a week. Although he has had it for six months, he has not made up his mind about it and now brings in half a dozen complicated amendments. Dr. J. F. Cairns -Al l the honourable members opposite have had it. ment is hiding a lot of the things that are happening in the television industry and in the granting of licences. The Minister might well answer to us for insisting that the debate proceed on this Bill at this late hour. The records of the Senate show that Bills relating to television have been brought in after long delays by the Government and have been rushed through the Senate without any consideration being given to the need to debate them. These matters are worth bringing to the attention of the public. They show the sinister influences that are at work. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said tonight, some people are gaining control of the television industry in this country with the approval of the Government. This is why the Government chooses to have these matters debated at a time when the public will not be listening. I have looked at the second reading almost a complete apology by the Government for the failure of its 1960 legislation to stop trafficking in shares and to restrict monopoly control of television stations. The legislation that it said would prevent exploitation has failed. The Minister sumBiH in this wayIn essence, however, the major effect of the Bill may be fairly succinctly stated. It provides that no person shall, in the future, acquire interests of a voting, shareholding or financial character which would result in such interests being in excess of 5 per centum in more than two licences. That is the Minister's summary of this very complex piece of legislation. However, a lot is hidden in that little statement. For instance, on 17th December 1964 he promised to introduce legislation. Let us congratulate him. He brought it down on a Wednesday, we have debated it in the",117,Broadcasting And Television

They are, in general, fairly complex and can better be dealt with in the CommiUee stage. Will the Minister tell us why a fairly comof one share, one vote.

254,Mr Daly,"The Opposition will settlea certain man who has a big interest now in a Brisbane station that he should never have obtained. Here again we see the protection of this Government given to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd -eve n in television legislation. I think that if honourable members checked the legislation thoroughly they would find that the real reason why it is to apply from only 17th December last year is that the Government would catch its friend Ansett if it were to go back beyond that date. The Fairfaxes, the Packers, the Murdochs and others can thank Ansett for saving them from paying the full penalty for their crimes of trafficking in television licences and shares. It is probably because of Ansett that the Government will not go back beyond that time. The Opposition will give honourable members on the other side of the Parliament an opportunity to line up and vote for the Opposition proposal in the Committee stages of the Bill. I do not want to deal any further with the second reading speech of the Minister other than to say that it is a collection of apologies for a complex Bill and for the failure of the Government's friends to live up to their obligations and do the right thing in paying for the favours that have been given to them. The very issue of television licences needs a complete and full inquiry. The amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr costs, but even before the hearing started Whitlam) is clear for all to see. Tonight, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr chance of obtaining a licence. Killen) who made one of his worse effortsand I am giving him plenty of leeway because there are not many of them that are very good-woul d not have been able to make a speech if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had not spoken. The honourable member for Moreton spent all of his time complaining about how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had torn tbe Minister to ribbons for the Government's treatment of its favoured sons in this section of industry. had only six Queen's Counsel and five junior As has already been stated, the amendment moved by the Opposition provides for a full inquiry into the shareholding, networks, monopoly control and programming of television stations. In his second reading speech the Minister said that he did not know what a network was. One of these days when he has a couple of minutes to spare he should come around to my room and I will bring him right up to date. In an effort to protect his friends he said that the Government could not define what a network was. I think he could get the definition out of Webster's Dictionary let alone from the Packers, Fairfaxes and others. If the Minister does not know what a network is let him have a good look through some of these reports that were cited by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) tonight. Any Minister who says that he cannot legislate because he does not know what a network is, is defending, on behalf of the Government, people whom he knows are its friends and whom he does not want to bring into the light of day. The granting of television licences must be one of the greatest rackets in the country. As the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) said a royal commission is required for the simple reason that television licences are a public benefit for members such as the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowen) and others. When the television inquiries were on in Melbourne you could not get into Mascot airport for the number of Queen's Counsel and junior counsel going to and fro in order to take their part in the long inquiries that may have been decided even before these gentlemen went to Melbourne. There were instances where companies have written to me and said that they paid thousands of pounds in they felt that they did not have much Let us have a look at a small inquiry. There is one in the report in connection with applications for television licences in the Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth areas. On page 65 the dates of the inquiries are shown and the names given of counsel for the applicants and interveners. The inquiry in Brisbane was held from 21st May to 24th June. That was just a short period so they counsel. I suppose that the QC.'s would be paid a couple of hundred pounds a day and that, in addition, the junior counsel would receive about 50 per cent, of that amount. The hearing went on for a month. Honourable members can work out what the costs for Queen's Counsel alone would be. In the Adelaide area the hearing lasted from 16th July to 13th August. They were two QC.'s and five juniors. In Perth the inquiry went from the 3rd September to 19th September. They did not let their heads go there; they rspori o; the Australian Broadcasting just had two QC.'s and two junior counsel. Control Board of 30th June 1964 shows The cost of these counsel alone makes it that at that date there were 110 television difficult for a company even to make applistations in Australia. The stations say how cation for a licence. There ought to be a completely new combined profits of television and radio approach to the issuing of television licences. stations have risen from £81,689 to I am not exaggerating when I say that the £2,455,041.

That is is not much more than an instrument of another good reason why honourable Government propaganda. It is significant members on this side of the House desire that it is loaded against the Labour Party in that there should be a full and complete every way, from the granting of licences inquiry into all the ramifications of what down to the types of political programmes is taking place in the television industry. that are presented. Quite apart from the general inquiry that the Opposition is asking for it is nearly time that a royal comthese matters now. The honourable member mission was appointed on the issuing of for Lang tonight cited the networks that television licences. Such a royal commission now exist in Australia. The Minister should could go into all the ramifications and the read some of the reports issued by the actions of those who are involved. There are a few other matters to which network is. I want to direct the attention of the Parliament. The Packers, the Fairfaxes and others would not put on a live show able member. unless they were forced to do so by a section of the Act. They import films that are seven, eight and 20 years old and bit from me also. Of course, the Minister frequently go back to the days of Hopalong is luckier than most honourable members Cassidy.

256,Mr Daly,"The Minister will learn aWhen honourable members consider the times allotted by the television stations to the Labour Party for political telecasts and also times allotted to the Liberal, Country and Democratic Labour Parties, they will realise how the allocation of time was loaded against the Australian Labour Party. I refer first to the allocation of time by the television stations operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which at this stage appear to be subject to ministerial direction, judging by the programme "" Four Corners"" and a few other things. On page 24 of the report there appears a table showing the times allocated to various parties and candidates. Throughout Australia on metropolitan stations the Labour Party received 45 per cent, of the time allocated; the rest of it went to the other parties in this proportion: Country Party, 16.9 per cent.; Liberal Party, 30.6 per cent.; Democratic Labour Party, .9 per cent.; and others, 6.4 per cent. In other words, 55 per cent, of the time allocated went to anti-Labour propaganda and only 45 per cent, of the time was allocated to the Australian Labour Party. On the country stations, 58 per cent, of the time was allocated against the Labour Party, which received 42 per cent. If honourable members look through thesefiguresthey will find that in the metropolitan and country stations combined, Labour was allocated 42 per cent, of the time whereas the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labour Partyall Government parties-receive d 58 per cent, of the time. Honourable members will see the bias in those allocations. In addition to that, the Labour Party was not allocated times at reasonable hours of the day. The Labour Party candidates were expected to take late viewing times. Yet the same stations probably gave free time to the enemies of the Labour Party in return for favours given in respect of television licences. I regret that I have not time to go on all night on this subject because I may be able to wake the Government up on the matter. Let us consider the distribution of time by private stations for televised political matter. tration is not sound, is loaded against one We find that in the metropolitan area the Labour Party received only 42 per cent, in all States whilst the other parties received 58 per cent. Yet on the private stations we were required to pay for that time. The country commercial stations gave Labour only 35 per cent, of the time and the balance was allocated to Labour's opponents who sit opposite-nodoub t as a gesture of thanks for the television licences. For the metropolitan and country stations combined, the Australian Labour Party received 38 per cent, of the time allocated and the others received 62 per cent, between them. What benefits the Government is getting from the lavours given out in television licences. No wonder the Minister wants to debate this Bill in the dead of night. No wonder honourable members are angry when these revelations are made about how the Government is exploiting television in its own political interests. Mr Speaker, even you must be amazed at what is happening in the television world. You must be amazed to see what is done in the name of what honourable members opposite call democracy. I mention these matters merely in order that the public will be aware of what is taking place in Australia and will realize the need for an inquiry along the lines suggested by the honourable member for Werriwa. What objection have honourable members opposite to an inquiry into the monopoly control in Australia of television? Does any honourable member opposite deny that, as stated in the motion moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a joint committee should be appointed to investigate the operation and administration of the Broadcasting and Television Act? Who in this country does not want an inquiry into the granting of television licences? And what about the shareholding interests that are involved and the trafficking in shares? Why is it that honourable members opposite do not want an investigation of the networks that have been established by the various newspaper proprietors, and why is it that they do not want an investigation into the monopoly control of television, programming and the matters associated with those questions? When an individual has a guilty conscience, he does not want an inquiry. Nor does a Government want an inquiry when it knows that the adminisparty and is loaded in respect of its own supporters. That is why we debate this matter at this time of night and that is why the Government refuses to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. I wonder whether the Minister would be prepared to make this provision retrospective if he did not know that the Fairfaxes, Packers, Murdochs and the people in Melbourne and Brisbane were involved in some of the transactions prior to 17th December. I wonder if the Minister will tell us, apart from making weak excuses, why he cannot make the provision retrospective, why he will not take action against companies which exploited the Government's policy prior to 17th December 1964. Is he ashamed to do so? gentleman what he is frightened of. He is is true also that overseas talent on telefrightened of the revelations that would vision is preferred to our own people.

263,Mr Robinson (Cowper) [1.0 A.m.].,"bore little relationship to the real purpose of this legislation. I am certainly not going to weary honourable members at this hour in order to enlighten hira. If he is so far behind in gaining a clear knowledge of the actions of the Government on this occasion it is a pity the honourable member would not go to sleep and stay that way. He has made scurrilous attacks not only upon the Government but upon people in all sorts of responsible positions. He referred to the legal fraternity in a most unseemly fashion. Not so very long ago he referred to television as a medium which the Labour Party would include in its policy of nationalisation along with radio. Of course, in this way he disposes very easily of this matter of what it has cost for hearings to determine applications for licences and so on. Certainly this would be much cheaper under Labour because there would be only one television system in this country. If honourable members look around the world they will realise just what has been done in the field of television by this Government and will appreciate that there is something of worth in the Bill with which we are dealing tonight. If we compare what has happened in the United Kingdom as a typical example, with what has been achieved in Australia, we will realise what the Government has done. The Labour Party should be ashamed of itself for the criticism which the Opposition has levelled here tonight. The charge has been made by the honourable member for Grayndler that a disproportionate amount of time was given to the Government candidates during election campaign both by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and by the commercial stations. But if honourable members study the figures quoted by the honourable member for Grayndler they will find that the charge is ludicrous for the simple reason that he referred to a number of political parties as against one political party. Of course, supporters of the Country Party could quite well make a comment about a particular election in the State of Tasmania. I do not propose to do that tonight. However, I do want to say to the honourable member for Grayndler that his allegations are baseless; that he was not able to produce one iota of real evidence to substantiate the claims which he made. This measure is designed to do these things which this composite governmentthe Liberal-Country Party Governmentbelieves should be done in the interests of television in Australia. On behalf of the Country PartyI want to say that we stand four square behind the legislation we are dealing with in this dying hour of this sitting. We stand behind it for very simple reasons. We believe that there should not be a monopoly in the control of television. The actions of the Minister and his predecessor in looking to these particular requirements as a policy principle have been exemplary, I think, and the charges made tonight cirtainly cannot be substantiated. There have been a lot of airy-fairy references made tonight to a certain gentleman called Mr Ansett. This is a typical example of the ludicrous approach of the Labour Party because Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. is a great public company. It is a company which has done a great deal to develop not only the airways of this country but, in more recent times, television. How absolutely ridiculous it is to level the sort of criticism we have heard tonight without any substantiation whatsoever. If the honourable member for Grayndler and his Deputy Leader were to heed something that happened not so long ago in the State of New South Wales in regard to air services, they might think a little more of the opinion of the people, expressed through the ballot box, rather than utter the unjustified criticism which we continue to hear. Of course, there are many facets of television which must come under scrutiny when legislation of this kind is under consideration. There is no need for me to reiterate what has been said so ably by honourable members on the Government side of the House. I want to conclude by saying quite definitely and conclusively that the Country Party supports the measure. There is not one atom of evidence to suggest that any other course of action could have been taken to reach the objective which this legislation is able to encompass at this point of time in the progressive development of television in Australia. It is legislation which will stand the test in the immediate future. I am sure that the Minister will make no apology if he has to come into this House with further amendments to this legislation. He has said that he hopes that this Bill will do the job. He said there had been a great deal of criticism because earlier legislation was not able to effectively meet this problem. How ludicrous it is when the Opposition says that the Government has failed. The Government has shown that it is prepared to stand on principles, and to meet the situation as it developed. It is for those reasons that Parliament is dealing with the legislation now. I believe it is sound legislation and worthy of recognition by this Parliament. I wholeheartedly support the Bill.

265,"Sinclair, I . M . Mr Nelson (Northern Territory)","structure of the Legislative Council somewhat, but it still made sure at that particular time that it retained vital control over the Council and its functions. The difference made by the amendments was not so very great. By them, a new class of member was introduced to the Council. These were called non-official members and they were appointed from outside the circles of the Commonwealth Government. It was resolved at the meeting of members of the Legislative Council and representatives of the Government, to which I have referred, that the functions and affairs of the Council would be reviewed every five years and that reforms would be instituted as the need for them became apparent. It was in consequence of that decision that, in 1963, the Legislative Council appointed a select committee consisting of elected members and one non-official member. This committee submitted a report recommending certain things to the Government for its consideration. At that time, the Council had the support in its objectives of all the members, both elected and non-official of the Legislative Council. On that occasion, the Crown Law Officer, a nominated member and a leading member of the Legislative Council, saidMy position 1 make quite plain and clear. I have sympathy with the proposal, but I think that inaction and unfulfilled promises, and its time must be taken to prepare a proper case and 1 think in my personal opinion that time should be taken by the select committee. Time was taken, and the Crown Law Officer was supported in the debate by other nominated members. As a result of that report, the Select Committee was invited again to Canberra to discuss the Legislative Council's affairs with the Government. After a lapse of some 18 months or 2 years, the present Minister for Territories ( Mr Barnes) sent his reply to the Council's request. A whole series of requests had been made, but all that the Government had to offer the members of the Council was an undertaking that they would be permitted to elect their own President. This added nothing at all to the powers or functions of the Council, because, by virtue of the Government's majority control of that body, the President would automatically be a Government nominee. Is it any wonder that, after waiting for 18 months on this occasion and for years on other occasions, a number of members of the Council walked out again in disgust at the treatment that had been meted out to the Council? This is not the first occasion on which members have walked out. It is a fact that every request for enlargement of the Council's powers or functions has virtually been completely ignored by the Government. Members of the Council are forced to walk out or to take similar action in order to direct attention to their plight and to demonstrate the seriousness with which they regard the slight inflicted on them. On this occasion, eight elected members and one non-official member have walked out. I know that in the past it has been the Government's wont to say that this sort of action is taken only by irresponsible members. But that cannot be said this time, because the non-official member who has walked out, and who, of course, was a Government appointee, is highly respected in the community. He was a grazier in the Northern Territory and had reared a family there, and he is highly respected by all. Evidently, the Government considered him to be a very responsible member of the community. Indeed, if I were looking for a person to appoint to a body like the Legislative Council, I would agree that he would be the right person for appointment. On this occasion, he has become so disgusted with the Government's lack of support for the Council, as to be impelled to walk out with the elected members. The Government, of course, has not taken kindly to this action. This non-official member of the Council was told by the Assistant Administrator that, as a result of refraining from participating in the affairs of the Council, the only course of action left open to him was to hand in his resignation. This is typical of the sort of thing that we expect from a government like this, which is drugged with the power that it has been given. All this has occurred despite what was said in 1959 by the present Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), who was then Minister for Territories, in answer to a question by Dr. Evatt when the position of non-official members was mentioned in the debate on a bill. This passage appears in "" Hansard"" Dr. Evatt -D o they hold office? Dr. Evatt-Can they be removed7",125,Bills Returned From The Senate
266,Mr Hasluck,"Yes, for three years.They can also resign. . . . Nevertheless it has not entered the mind of the Government, nor do I think it would be in the mind of any government, to exercise the sanction of removal visited within the precincts of this building against them. YetI venture to state that the non-official member at present involved will soon find himself without a position in the Legislative Council. It will be interesting to see whether the Government lives up to its undertaking, given on 1st April, that the eight elected members who have walked out will be allowed to act freely and without pressure. I do not think that the Government's actions wili live up to that undertaking. The fact remains that we want some sort of meeting between the Minister for Territories and members of the Legislative Council. We want to find some satisfactory basis for the continuance of the Council. We want a basis of democracy in the Northern Territory-somethin g that we have never had before. We want to do away with this system of government control at all levels. We believe it is time the people of the Territory had a majority voice in the affairs of their Legislative Council. The members of that body are responsible persons from all sections of the community. This Government's attitude towards the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory represents a strange contrast to its attilike to communicate with a legal adviser tude towards the House of Assembly for tbe Territory of Papua and New Guinea International pressures and the weight of criticism voiced in the United Nations, especially by representatives of Asian countries, have forced the Government to do something about the indigenous people in New Guinea. Nothing similar has happened in the Northern Territory. We who live there feel that our demands for reform of the Legislative Council have been completely neglected. I ask the Minister to get together with members of the Council and hammer out some sort of basis for democratic government in the Northern Territory so that the people of the Territory can get on with the job of developing the north, satisfied to share in the shaping of their own destiny. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [1.27 a.m.] Mr Speaker, I regret that I have to address the House at such a late hour of the night. The matter that I wish to raise, however, is, I believe, one of considerable urgency. Furthermore, the choice of the hour is not that of the Opposition or myself, but clearly of the Government. This evening, I was by a man who was on crutches. He appeared to have a very seriously injured right leg and he showed all the signs of having been very roughly dealt with. His name is Neil Handley. He told me that he lives at 74 Schlich Street, Yarralumla. He informed me that last evening, at about 7.30, he was at home in the presence of his wife, who, he told me, is eight months pregnant, and his seven children, ranging from 2 to 13 years. He said that he was sitting in the lounge waiting to see a television programme when there was a ring at the door and two men came in, stating that they were plain clothes officers. They told him that they had a warrant to search his house for a tape recorder that was to be an exhibit in evidence in a matter relating to ""the Postmaster-General's Act"". This man told me that he saw the warrant and asked the men into the lounge. He then produced a small Japanese transistor tape recorder and played on the tape a few words of a particular conversation, telling the officers that the balance had been erased. At that stage, he told them that he would and said that he wanted a little time to do this. He informed me that the senior officer concerned then said that he had power to ley told me that the senior officer then began to twist his arm and that his wife intervened and explained that Dr. Horniblow, a local doctor, had diagnosed high blood pressure and advised that her husband should take things easily. This, he told me, was ignored. He said the officer took hold of his wife by the wrists while the other officer, after some argument, proceeded to telephone somebody whom he claimed to be his senior officer. After a conversation on the telephone with the senior officer, the man who had made the call proceeded to try to take the tape recorder by force. My informant told me: ""After he had done so and the other officer took it out, he held me round the neck with his arm and kicked my right leg from under me, when I came crashing to the floor. My wife and children were hysterical. Then he left me lying on the floor. I could not stand up. I crawled",126,Bills Returned From The Senate

He said any radiation would be restricted to the immediate area of the antenna, and there were built-in safeguards for the staff. "" The beam would have to be pointed straight at you to be hazardous"", Mr Pugh said. The question would only arise when Tidbinbilla sent a command signal to a space vehicle, and it would then be very brief.

The satisfactory award for sheet metalworkers did not improve the attitude of electrical trade employees to their employment. At any rate, in respect of this industrial dispute, a newspaper article of 24th February 1965 was headed "" Power cut threat called ' saboDr. 3. F.

Finally, I should like to know whether any charges are to be made against Mr Handley or any other person in connection with this matter. General) [1.36 a.m.] -The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has raised this issue in a most extraordinary way. First he put to the House a pathetic story of a man who had suffered all sorts of injuries. He then went on to give an eye witness account of the evidence. He added: "" Furthermore, this man told me of a woman who had told him who had told someone else "". This brings the matter into some sort of perspective. The honourable gentleman then suggested-jus t to have two bob each way-that there must be an issue of security. By way of interjection my colleague, the Minister for Supply( Mr Yarra has put before the House tonight. Fairhall) said: "" There is no security issue ."" So, to have three bob each way, the honourable member then said: "" It must be an industrial matter."" The point is this: He raises an issue and then he retreats from ita constant retreat. He asked some questions. I made a note of them and I think they should be answered. He asked: Is this an industrial matter or is it a security matter? It is neither. What is involved here is a suspicion of a breach of Comonwealth criminal law. Two men did go last night to a house in Canberra. Those two men were members of the Comonwealth Police Force. They went to that house in pursuance of their duties as police officers investigating what they suspected to be a serious breach of Commonwealth law. They went there for the purpose of carrying out their investigations. At the time they went there they carried with them a search warrant. Having gone to the house and having commenced their investigations they then sought a piece of evidence which they wished to take away with them to use in their investigations. It was not offered to them freely. They then sought and obtained instructions from the Commissioner of Police to execute their duty; they produced the search warrant and they took away the piece of evidence. The piece of evidence is now being appreciated for the purposes of laying charges of a criminal nature. Dr. 3. F. Cairns -Did they use any force? missioner of the Commonwealth Police Force for a report from the police officers on whether they used force. The report that I have is that they did not use force, except for one of the officers physically restraining the particular person while the other Officer picked up the piece of evidence. The piece of evidence was a tape recording. I do not want to say anything further in relation to the nature of the evidence until the investigations are completed. Depending on the result of the investigations, a charge or more than one charge may or may not be laid against one or more persons. The report that I have from the Commonwealth Police is completely contrary to what the honourable member for Dr. J. F. Cairns -In respect of what? The Attorney-General has admitted everything up to date. How is it contrary? trary Dr. F. J. Cairns -In what respect? honourable gentleman says that unreasonable force was used or that any force was used. No force was used. There was a physical restraining of one person. The honourable member then says: "" It must be security and that is wrong."" Then he says: "" It must be industrial and that is wrong."" The honourable gentleman finds it constantly in his mind that there must be suspicion about somebody or something. Anything that is for the preservation of the established law and order of this country is anathema to the honourable member for Yarra. Motion (by Mr Fairhall) agreed toThat the question be now put.

The range of repatriation benefits available under act of grace arrangements to Solvation Army Red Shield personnel, among others, in respect of 1939-45 and Korean service is for all practical purposes the same as that available under the Repatriation Act in respect of those operations. It includes, for example, war ancl service pension, medical treatment for eligible persons and the normal range of other benefits and allowances. The benefits available to dependants of act of grace beneficiaries are also similar to those available to dependants of members of the Forces under the Repatriation Aot. No provision was made under the act of grace schemes in respect of service in the 1914-18 war. 3. As such personnel do not come under the Repatriation Act the statutory rights of appeal under that Act do not apply to them but the Commission has always reviewed decisions administratively where grounds existed. Appeals arrangements for persons such as the Salvation Army Red Shield personnel are however currently under consideration. 4. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, that Red Shield representatives do not have this entitlement. Native Members of the Forces: Repatriation Benefits. (Question No. 918.) Mr Cross asked the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice1. In view of the recent amendments to the Native Members of the Forces Regulations, is the Minister now in a position to state that Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders are entitled to exactly the same pensions, privileges and benefits under the Repatriation Act as other Australians? 2. If there are any continuing differences, will the Minister explain them? tion has supplied the following information1. Since the end of World War Two the rates of benefit for Torres Strait Islanders which now equal those for other Australian ex-servicemen, of benefits available to them extended. The Government decided on the last such extension at the end of last year, and regulations are at present being prepared to give effect to this decision. The result is that Torres Strait Islanders are generally in line as to repatriation benefits with other Australian ex-servicemen. An appropriate appeal system is also to be provided for them. 2. In accordance with policy adopted in relation to other post war repatriation legislation, a provision in relation to pulmonary tuberculosis similar has supplied the following to that under section 37 (3) of the Repatriation Act, will not be available.

Does an agreement exist between New Zealand and Australia to allow each other's nationals to pass between the two countries without travel or health documents? 2. If so, does this mean that there are generally no restrictions on the period of stay of (a) Australians in New Zealand and (b) New Zealanders in Australia? 3. ls it the practice of New Zealand authorities to prohibit the entry of, or limit the period of stay of, any categories of Australian citizens? 4. Is it the practice of Australian immigration authorities to prohibit the entry of, or limit the period of stay of, New Zealand citizens? 5. If any prohibitions or limitations are applied by either country, what are the details of such restrictions? member's questions are as follows1. There is an agreement between New Zealand and Australia (effected by an exchange of letters in 1920) which provides that for natural-born British subjects of either country, travel between the two countries should be free and that passports be not required. Health examination in such cases is confined to the visual inspection of the traveller at port as followsof arrival. 2. Yes, to the extent that the reciprocal travel arrangements currently in force, which are based on the 1920 agreement, apply (with the exception mentioned hereunder) only to the natural-born or naturalised citizens of European descent of either country and their indigenous natives (viz. Australian aborigines or Maoris), travelling either as intending immigrants or as visitors. The exception is that New Zealand requires the naturalised Australian citizen to produce evidence of his citizenship to the carrier company and at port of arrival. 3. 4 and 5. Both countries require the naturalborn or naturalised citizens of the other country who is of other than European descent (apart from aborigines and Maoris) and who is an applicant for entry a; an immigrant to be in possession of a passport and prior authority for such entry by way of endorsement (in practice New Zealand waives the passport requirement and the authority for entry is inscribed on a special form). The entry of such persons is not prohibited nor is their period of stay limited, subject to their being eligible for entry and their first complying with the normal requirements for admission. Where a visit only is intended, Australia requires the natural-born or naturalised New Zealand citizen of non-European descent to have a passport and prior authority to enter by way of endorsement or a "" letter of authority "" issued by an Australian office following production by the intending visitor of evidence of citizenship. New Zealand, whilst requiring neither a passport nor prior authority to enter, requires the intending visitor who is a natural-born or naturalised Australian citizen of non-European descent to produce evidence of his citizenship to the carrier company before embarkation and to tbe boarding authorities on arrival, together with a return ticket with a firm booking for a date within six months of arrival.

How many (a) new homes were erected and (b) existing dwellings were purchased from advances made by the Division during the same years? 3.

Has he considered amending the section? able member's questions are as follows1, 2 and 3. State legislation makes provision for municipal and water rates to become a charge on the land in respect of which they are assessed. The charge so created commences on whatever date is fixed by the relevant State statute and, as a rule, this is either the first day of the rating year or the date on which the rate is levied. Section 26 of the War Service Homes Act 19181962, provides that no advance shall be made on any property which is encumbered by any previous mortgage or charge, other than a mortgage or charge under the Act, unless the advance is applied for the purpose of discharging the previous mortgage or charge. In view of this legal position it has always been necessary for the War Service Homes Division not to make any advance available (whether it is an initial or an additional advance) whilst a prior charge or encumbrance in favour of a third party remains on the property. All branches of the Division were reminded of the legal position and the necessity to observe the requirements of the legislation on 2nd April 1962. 4. Section 26 is an original provision in the War Service Homes Act and has been retained without alteration. Its purpose is to ensure that the Division's charge will have priority over all other mortgages or charges on the property and that the Division's advance will not be defeated by a sale under a previous charge. For these reasons an amendment of the section is not contemplated.",131,Answers To Questions Upon Notice

War Service Homes. (Question No. 1058.) MrL . R. Johnson asked the Ministerf o r Housing, upon notice1. Has the War Service Homes Division recently changed its policy in such a way that advances are no longer made to finance the purchase of one-bedroom fiats and home units? 2. If so, why? able member's questions is as follows There has been no change in the VVar Service Homes Division's policy relating to the granting of loans for the purchase of one-bedroom flats and home units. Every application for a war service homes loan is cons-'dered on its merits having regard to the provisions of the Act which require that the home in respect of which the application is made, will provide a satisfactory security and that (having regard to the locality in which it is erected) the risk is a reasonable one for the Director of War Service Homes to undertake. The Division, in common with most other major lending institutions, does not provide finance for the purchase of a one bedroom dwelling-house whether the home is a detached house, a flat or a strata title home unit, unless it is satisfied that the property provides adequate security and that, in the event of default under thc security document, the property would realise sufficient on resale to discharge the liability to the Division.

289,Mr Fairbairn,"The Minister for Civilyears. The Avis bid on a sole rights basis was accepted as it was the highest tender received and offered car rental services at the greatest number of airports for the convenience of the travelling public. The contract with Avis does not prevent Kays or any other car rental operator from attending airports to pick up clients who have made pre-arranged bookings with that car rental operator. Airline buses, taxis and hire cars can also continue to pick up and discharge clients at airports. 2. The contract was granted to Avis following normal public tender procedures by the Department of Civil Aviation. 3. Ansett-A.N.A. has no financial or other interest in Avis.

293,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honor4. In what buildings in Canberra was oflice space occupied by Commonwealth public servants as at 1st April 1965? 5. In respect of each department in Canberra, what was the average area of office space per person (.ignoring filing, storage and service areas) occupied as at 1st April 1965 by (a) administrative and professional staff accommodated in individual offices, (b) administrative, professional and clerical staff accommodated in general offices and (c) other staff using general working areas? honourable follows1 and 2. Criteria for allocation of office space for Oovernment departments have been adopted by the Public Service Board after discussion with the Treasury, Department of the Interior and other departments concerned. These criteria, which are used as a guide for requisitioning and allocating available office space, have regard to such factors as the administrative status of officers and the nature of the duties to be performed by them. Departments' stated requirements of space are examined by the Public Service Board in all cases before available space, whether in Commonwealth buildings or leased accommodation, is allocated by the Department of the Interior. In addition to space for occupation by officers, appropriate areas are, of course, allowed for unstaffed areas, such as public reception areas, amenities, conference rooms, storage space, &c. it will be appreciated that, as a result, the criteria applied as between departments are by no means standard. Individual departments adopt similar criteria as a guide when partitioning space allocated to them. 3. At the present time, because of considerable expansion within departments and the limited availability of office accommodation in Commonwealth-owned or leased premises, it has become necessary for some departments to contain expansion in their existing premises. However, this position is expected to ease to some extent with the completion of several large Commonwealth buildings now under construction. 4. See attached schedule. 5. This information is not readily available. It could only be obtained by a detailed assessment of all office space occupied by Commonwealth departments in Canberra, involving physical measurement of rooms after classification by departments of their staffs into the categories mentioned in the question. The tremendous amount of detailed work by all departments to obtain the information requested is not considered to be warranted.
