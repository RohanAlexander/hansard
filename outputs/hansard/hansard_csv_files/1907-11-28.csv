Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had moved by way of amendmentThat the words "" Machinery for scouring and washing wool"" be left out. [11.28] -The way has been, cleared for our dealing with this item in an equitable manner since the declaration made last night by the Treasurer that he intended to take out the special exemption of items relating to the hat industry and the woollen industry generally. We ought to make no distinction between one trade and another regarding things which are in the nature of tools and preliminary requirements. All ought to be placed, as far as possible, on the same footing, and I take it that much bf the cause of complaint on the part of the honourable member for Maranoa has now been removed If I remember rightly he built uphis complaint principally on the ground that certain 'industries ' we're mechanics being specially treated, arid he urged that such treatment should also be extended to wool-washing machinery. Machinery and Machinery for use in woollen mills was free -before. is beyond comprehension. Why cannotthe pay its fair quota to industries which are making tools and machinery in the ordinary way ? There are some industries for which we cannot do very much, even though we do our best in the direction of protection. We Gannot assist the currier and tanner very much with duties, since he manufactures largely fpr export. Why, therefore, should we tax his tools of trade, when we exempt the tools of trade required in an industry peculiarly susceptible to the benefits of protection, whatever they may be? I hope the Treasurer will agree to treat all inare concerned. I am sure I can appeal to the sense of . fairness of the honourable member for Maranoa not to press his views unduly if other trades are being bending rolls in sizes to bend up lo treated exactly as the one in which he is interested. I have a suggestion to make in connection with this series of items. I think that there ought to be a uniform duty imposed on tools of trade, and, personally I should not be prepared to make it more than 15 per cent. ply a revenue duty. slightly protective. I take it that it is a fundamental principle even with protecCOOK (Parramatta) tionists that tools of trade should as far as possible be free. No better evidence of that could be found than in the very fulf list of exemptions, provided for already. A duty of 15 per' cent, on these lines would be slightly protective, and I think sufficiently protective having regard to the class of articles in question.' WhatI suggest is that we should make all these things subject to a'uniform duty of 15 per cent., and that having done so we should strike out item 169, which appears to me to confer a very dangerous power on the Customs authorities. Under that item provision is made for the free admission of Tools of trade for the use of artisans and and tools in general use as prescribed! by departmental by-laws.

We should have to get a resolution passed through both Houses of Parliament. see how that could be. The Government control the business, they could bring down a resolution at any time they pleased, and it should not take twelve months or even twelve days to pass it through Parliament, unless the Ministry desired that it should take longer. Tariff debates teaches me otherwise. what the honourable gentleman is referring to, but since he has made that statement. I wish to reply to an insulting interjection made just now by the Government Whip,to the effect that if the House is to rise, at Christmas the leader of the Opposition should be consulted and asked to say whether he would allow it. That is good, considering that the whole of yesterday's sitting was taken up entirely by speeches from honourable members on the Government side. the corner opposite had a good deal to say-. think the Government might try to keep their own side in order, that we may get through with the consideration of the Tariff in decent time. The talk from the other side has been interminable during f the whole of this week, and that is why we have not made better progress. circumstances, it is idle for the Government Whip to suggest that honourable members on this side are obstructing business. I am making a suggestion which, if agreed to by the Treasurer, would save a day's debate on this very debatable item. suggest that he should agree-to a uniform duty on all tools of trade and machines which in their nature are tools of. trade. The honourable gentleman has already agreed to take out of the schedule at the end of the Tariff, specially favoured industries. In accordance with the suggestion I have made, I am prepared now to move that the General Tariff duty of 25 per cent, be left out with a view to inserting 15 per cent, with the understanding that that duty should be applied to all similar articles. The honourable member will not be able to get what he wants in that way. surer state his objection to the proposal, and so save the time of the Committee? refreshing to hear the honourable member for Parramatta advocating protection, or objecting to put anything on the free list. I think the honourable member is 'under some misconception, and is assuming that this wool-scouring machinery is associated only with the woollen industry. It is only in the out-back districts that very much wool-scouring is done at the present time. Owing to the fact that German and other continental buyers come into our markets and buy wool on the spot, very much less wool-scouring is done on the coast than used to be the case. It is in my electorate, and in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa, in districts 500 miles from the coast, that wool-scouring is chiefly carried on at the present time, in-order to lessen the weight of the wool that must be .taken to ports. wool-scouring done in those districts as there used to be. done at Coonamble, where there is a very large wool-scouring establishment, and also at Bourke. The wool-scouring clone out back has increased, whilst it has decreased on the coast. Honourable members should remember that wool-scouring is not done by the big wool kings, but is an industry which in many cases is in the hands of working men, and In the is a large employer of bush labour. A good deal of the machinery used for wool-scouring may have beeni made locally, but some of the best is covered by patent rights, 'and could not be made here. There is a somewhat limited demand for'it, and, I therefore, its free admission would not interfere very much with the engineering trade. On the other band, a high duty on it would put a considerable tax on an important industry that is already fairly heavilv taxed through the great cost of taking the machinery long distances inland, especially in Queensland and New South Wales. The machines are practically the tools of trade of' an industry",19,Tariff

The patentee is Mr Hall, of my electorate. He has had the patent for the last thirty-eight years. I believe the patent has now run out. Messrs. Hall Company have made 150 of the machines here. Previous to their competition the price of the imported machine was £750. To-day the price is £,500a reduction of £250 through the establishment of the local industry. I stand here as a protectionist and as an advocate for the farmer, so that he may get his machinery cheap. I want the primary producers to share in the benefits of a protectionist Tariff. That result can be achieved by imposing a duty on imported machinery of this character. If the duty is removed the importer, who sits in Collins-street, will send home for more machinery, and the price will be put up.

Those letters are sufficient evidence that good machines can be made here. 1 have also shown that the local competition . has reduced the price by £250. There is Bros. and no reason why the-article should be put 011 the free list. I saw the machine working this morning, and have with me samples of the wool, scoured and unscoured, which honourable members can see. If such excellent work can be done by locally-made machines I cannot understand why the Treasurer wants to put the article on the free list. Out of the £500 cost of the ma-? chine £350 goes in labour. I am certain that when the Treasurer knows that the machine is being made here, and is doing good work, and that the pastoralists are satisfied with it, he will not persist in his proposal. [11.48] -The machine referred to by the honourable member for Batman is, in all probability, a very good one, and cleans the wool well, but wool can be cleaned excellently with a' stick. The cleaning will not give it quality. The fact that Mr McCaughey's wool brings more in the London market than dees any one else's only Your machines shows that his stations are more suitable for sheep-raising than are other stations. He grows on his runs some of the uesr wool in the world. That does not prove anything for the machine -There is, however, something to be said for the imported machines, which are the best articles for doing, the work of the fellmonger. The Any person going in for a scouring fellmongering industry was once a very large one in Australia, but owing to rhie exportation of sheepskins it has fallen off, and, consequently, fewer machines are in S.

It is merely a question of whether wool can be more cheap] v scoured here than in England, taking into consideration the loss of weight in the carThe following is anriage of wool. I shall support the Treasurer's proposal to place the article upon the free list. The arguments urged in favour of that course last night are as; strong to-day as they were then.

Most of the wool-scouring is done inland in Queensland, and when the machinery has been landed at Rockhampton, Brisbane, or Townsville, enormous railway freight has to be paid for its :onveyance. Further, wool scouring provides employment for a great number of men after the -shearing season has closed. If we impose -an increased duty upon this class of machinery, there are many establishments in the western districts of Queensland which will be compelled either to use obsolete machinery or to cease operations. Some years ago, I heard a member of the party to which I belong advocate in this Chamber the imposition of an export duty upon greasy wool. that the operation of such a duty would force all greasy wool into our woollen -mills. was the idea .underlying the suggestion. I know for ""a fact that the German buyers prefer t'o purchase greasy wool. During the past ten years a larger quantity of wool has been scoured -in the Commonwealth than was previously scoured here. As a matter of fact, the quantity of :wool -scoured is increasing every year. I should like patent wool scouring machines to be placed on the free list. I fail to see why the wool industry should be penalized any more than is any other industry, seeing that it has to compete in the markets of the world. posed to the exemption from duty of machine tools.

But it does not come within that category. Having fought for the engineering establishments, I must, in common fairness, consider the do not know of any particular firm in New South Wales which produces these machines, but that is no reason why a uniform rate should not be imposed upon them. The honourable member for Maranoa has opposed the Government proposal upon the ground that it will levy a tax upon the masses. But when we consider that these machines cost £500, surely it is patent that such an argument is devoid of substance. member must recollect that there are machines and machines. At a later stage I might just as reasonably put forward a plea to exempt from duty expensive engineering machines, costing £2,000 or £3,000 each, in the interests of a company like that of Mort's Dock. But I shall refuse to do so. The honourable member for Parramatta has adopted the common-sense view of this matter. He supports the imposition of a uniform rate. Uniform treatment should be meted out to all these industries, and I fail to see why one branch of an industry should be protected whilst another is not. If any honourable member proposes a duty of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, upon these machine tools, I shall be found supporting him. I stated last night that I am in favour of uniform treatment being extended to all classes of machine tools, and I trust that the Committee will endorse that view. surer would say that he will accept that suggestion debate upon this item would cease.

In reply to the observations of the honourable member for MaranoaI wish to say that I have not abated one jot of my opposition to revenue duties. But the proposal of the honourable member is to make absolutely free articles which are being manufactured in Australia very extensively . and satisfactorily. exempt from duty wool washing and wool scouring machinery. The honourable member desires to exempt one particular machine, but he must recollect that hard cases make bad laws. It would be unwise on our part to exempt only one particular machine. The proposal to exempt wool scouring ma chinefy if carried would mean placing upon the free list machines which are being manufactured in Australia. As a protectionist I cannot subscribe to that principle. I want to see' uniform treatment meted out to manufacturers so far as their tools of trade are concerned. I am willing to admit that a duty of 15 per cent, all round would not be much in the nature of a protective duty. But it is better than having a machine admitted free. be a good deal of protection on some of them. amount of protection on some; but the protection on others would not amount to much. of protection to the local, manufacturers than put a large number of machines on the free list. ber vote for preference? duty is only 15 per cent., I shall not vote for preference. The only alternative to a uniform all-round duty on machine tools is to admit all machine tools free, and the Government, to be logical, should propose one course or the other. We have decided that a duty shall be charged on machines used by tanners, to which I did not object, although there are a number of tanneries in my district. But now the Government ask us to admit free of duty wool-scourers, some of which are manufactured here. I trust that the Committee will agree to an all round duty of 15 per cent, upon all kinds qf machine tools, and to bring that about we should vote against the omission of woolscouring machines from the dutiable list. night I drew attention to the fact that many objections have been made to the classification of machine tools. My attention has been drawn to the very arbitrary classification adopted by the Department, under which tools which are regarded by the trade as all coming within the same category have been treated, some as dutiable, and some as free. Under item 167 the Department has power to issue by-laws declaring that certain machine tools should be free. I have here an enumeration of machine tools,, all of the same class, and some of them actually used in the same machines, in regard to which the Department differentiates, making some dutiable and allowing others to come in free. I endorse the sensible suggestion of the honourable member for South Svdney that there should be an all-round low duty, and I suggest that there should be a. common definition of machine tools. We should not proceed by enumeration. We might define machine tools as tools which are worked by power instead of by hand. big exemption, list. Tariff Commission. Mr Pearson made the same suggestion, and a large importing firm has pointed out to me that a designation which would cover all machine tools should be adopted. whether we should not get a more favorable result by imposing a small all-round duty than by differentiating. lowest rates proposed. I understand that many machine tools which are very effective and economical-sorti e of them very delicate-ar e not manufactured in the Commonwealth. These tools, especially such as are driven by pneumatic power, are largely used by the smaller engineering establishments, in which it is' found too expensive to use steam motive power. Some of these tools are covered by patents, so that they could not be made here, and any duty imposed on them will amount to a specific tax on production. I hope that the Minister will consider the advisabilitv of imposing a low all-round duty. if these tools are not to be admitted free, and of determining upon some principle of differentiation. wish to defend myself from the charge of",23,Winton Wool Scouring Co

I thoroughly endorse that suggestion. The honourable member treated my interjection, assenting to an export duty on wool, as inconsistent, and he went on to say that a great deal of the wool exported from Australia is now locally scoured. The honourable member for Parramatta interjected that the desire was to get the greasy wool manufactured in Australia. I desire, though, under present conditions, there is not much hope of getting a great deal of it manufactured here. But there is no reason why the bulk of it should not be scoured here, and if we put a-high duty on the machinery used in the various processes of scouring, those 'who manufacture such machinery will establish works here, because this is the largest wool producing-country in the world.

Again,1 must congratulate the pioneers and workers out-back in having discovered a new friend in the honourable member for Batman. by him that under a 1 2 per cent, duty 1 a reduction in the price of machinery to one man in the back country has been made to the amount of £ 2 5 0 . the farmer ancl working man out-back would like to know is what further reduction a 25 per cent, duty would bring about, and at what particular stage the magic in which the honourable member believes would give them free 'machines all round. .That is a line of reasoning which the honourable member must carry to its logical conclusion to see that it is not the Tariff altogether which determines the reduction in the price of machinery. There are other conditions which apply, and those conditions have operated to such an extent with. all kinds of machines-the manufacture of which cost a certain sum fifteen or twenty years ago-that there has been an all-round reduction, irrespective of the Tariff which has been imposed by this House. That will operate in the future as it has done in the past. Where new labour-saving appliances have been applied to the production of machines, and the cost of labour and material has been reduced, the result has been a reduction in the prices, quite irrespective of the Tariff. A duty affects the price of an article by increasing the cost to the consumer. Otherwise, it is of no benefit to the manufacturer. It is claimed that it is more profitable to export wool in a greasy state to the seat of manufacture, and have it scoured there, than to have it submitted to a scouring process here and then re-submitted to another process. ment has been put forward. Apparently a number of honourable members ha.ve noi fully realized the changes which have been brought about. Take the far-back country, such as the Maranoa electorate, where the product has to be carried for hundreds of miles by bullock or horse teams to the nearest railway station. There is a large quantiry of wool which is inferior' in that it is short. It is so loaded with dirt that, unless it is cleansed on the spot, it is a lost product. Sir treated on the spot. . back country, I have seen sheds where large quantities of .that kind of wool have been thrownout in heaps until such time as mechanical contrivances are brought It has been claimed along and enable it to be properly treated. That is done with the assistance of woolscouring machines, and men are profitably employed in the process. The honourable What member for Maranoa has pleaded with the Minister to assist that form of industry by allowing the machines to be imported as cheaply as possible. I remind the Committee that the men who are engaged in this industry have to compete with Germany, France, and other producing centres, and that their wages and returns are determined by that open competition. They cannot derive any benefit from a protectionist policy. If honourable members levied a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, it would not benefit those persons by one iota. The product has to be sold in outside centres. There is another point which I think ought to' appeal to the Committee very strongly. When framing the old Tariff, it was decided that wool-scouring machines should be placed on a 12 J per cent, list, but the very same Committee decided that the coddled manufacturing interests of Australia, particularly of ""Victoria, should have certain lines of machinery put on the free list, despite the fact that they could be made here. That principle ' has been endorsed by this Committee. So that at the present time the big woollen mills of Melbourne and elsewhere can freely import wool-scouring machines for use in their factories. If a squatter or settler requires a machine to assist him to prepare his wool clip for the market, to turn an unmarketable commodity into a marketable one, the protectionists clap a duty of 1.2 per cent, on 1 his machine, and now it is proposed to raise the duty to 25 per cent, in the general Tariff, and 20 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. Where is the justice in that kind of Tariff reform? If the Committee has any sense of justice at all it will assist the Minister to put wool-scouring machines on the free list in the interests of not only the Victorian wool manufacturers, but also the men struggling in the way-back districts of the Commonwealth to develop its resources.

To save a long discussion, it is just as well that an arrangement should be made. The honourable member for Maranoa has very generously relieved me from the promise which I made to him, because I should have felt bound, even if my proposal had been defeated, to fight it for him if he had insisted. As he has relieved me, and as it is the general feeling that an average duty of 15 per cent, should be placed upon these goods, I shall ask leave to withdraw my amendment.

There will not be much loss of surer will not object to my reading what the manufacturer has so say before he decides It is not a very important matter whether or not he should agree to my proposal. A manufacturer of cardboard boxesand other .goods writes, that item 166, "" Machinery for the manufacture of paper and for felting "" has probably been suggested by the Strawboard Trust for two reasons, viz 1.

So as to frighten any possible competitor from starting a paper m ill . They have their machinery for papermaking -already, and, therefore, would have no duty to pay; whereas if , say, a new Arm started to make brown paper they would have to pay from £2,000 to £3,000 duty on their machinery. In this connection it is interesting to note that I suppose, the Strawboard Trust is thinking of importing another lining machine; possible competitors. I do hope that you will put these lines on the free list.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think so; and unless further complications are to be created, the proposal must be amended. There seems to be a desire to have a uniform duty of 15 per cent., though, personally, I think that desire is, perhaps, a mistake. A great number of these items were free in the old Tariff, while others bore a duty of 12\ per cent. TheA division of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., while the The honourable B division recommended, in certain cases, 10 per cent., and, in other cases, 15 per cent. Evidently there is a feeling that, as I say, there ought to be a uniform duty of 15 per cent.; and in order to save time, that might as well be accepted. Sof a r as the machines mentioned by the honourable meniber for Batman are concerned, those interested in the manufacture have no ground of complaint, except that the duty that will be imposed 'is not so high as that proposed by the Government.

Sydney) [2.55] I desire to draw the Treasurer's attention to WhatI think is an error in connection with the proposed duty on pneumatic hammers It was not intended, under the old' Tariff nor, do I think, in this, that hand pneumatic hammers should be made dutiable. These patent hand hammers are not made in Australia, and, under the by-laws, ought to be free as machine tools for metal working, caulking, chipping, and riveting. As the item appears now, however, these hand pneumatic hammers are made dutiable under the allembracing words ""pneumatic hammers,"" Steam hammers, where the steam operates within the tool, are allowed in free, while other steam hammers are dutiable.

Mr James, a manufacturer of tools, formerly employed a great number of men and did some very important work, but, under the operation of the present duties, his business has almost disappeared.

249,Mr Mahon,"I have been speaking ofvarious Departments will have to pay more for the material they buy, while the Commonwealth will be able to retain only one-fourth of the revenue produced by the duties. matter to which I wish to .call attention is this: Parliament is voting various rates of duty for the encouragement of our different industries. Those rates must be regarded as the maximum protection which we think should be given to those industries. But the practice of the Departments has been to give local tenderers a preference of from 15 to 25 per cent, over foreign competitors, in addition to the duty. That, in mv opinion, is illegitimate and improper. Item 171 covers, I take it , practically all the manufactures of metal not elsewhere specifically dealt with in the Tariff. Yesterday, however, after a great deal of discussion, the Committee decided that the rates of duty which should apply to the various kinds of machinery dealt with under items 163, ancl 164 should be 25 and 20 per cent., and, therefore, I intend to move to reduce the rates now proposed from 30 and 25 to 25 and 20 per cent.

I shall support the amendment of 'tlie honourable member for North Sydney. {3.48] -We have heard a great deal about uniformity, and there is something to be .said from that point of view. are tools of trade, which, I think, might -fairly be put on the free list. It will be -admitted that the material of the saws -which are made locally is imported in sheath form. They are then-made circular or otherwise, fitted-up, and have teeth put into them. That is all that constitutes the industry ---Those -people who use saws in ihe three States where there is a large lumber trade are well able to pay the duty, if they choose to imiport superior articles, and from that point bf view there is no reason why saws should not be put on the same footing as other tools. But still I shall support a proposal to make them free, as saws are in general use. saw-millers want the very best material for their purpose, and to secure the best saws they must import. We were sent here to rectify anomalies in the Tariff. Saws were formerly upon the free list. Even protectionists admitted that they should be free. We leave no anomaly by allowing them to remain on the' free list. The local sawmaking industry is one that can stand alone. It requires no protection. As pointed out by the honourable member for Riverina, saws have been made in Melbourne in the open market. What better evidence do honourable members require that there is no need to impose a duty ? I move That after the words ""25 per cent."" the -words "" and on and after 29th November, 1907 -id, val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United prevent differentiation between different Kingdom), free,"" be inserted. The honourable member for Fremantle has pointed out that since this Tariff was introduced those concerned in the saw-making t industry have increased their price by 50 per cent. that. Sir JOHN FORREST -That is a state of affairs that should not .be tolerated. that ought to be substantiated. I believe. -The honourable member for Echuca has in his possession an invoice from a Melbourne firm, and the explanation of the increase of price is that it is owing to the Tariff. An increase of 50 per cent, on invoice cost has been made in the price of the same saw of the same gauge. I saw the invoice myself at lunch time. member produce it? will produce it to-morrow. [3-5S]--if there is a case of protection run mad, it is this. There are employed in the sawmills of Australia about 11,000 men. It . is preposterous that we should compel them to -be dependent upon one source of supply. Apart altogether from the quality of the saws, there should be some choice left to the people who use them. Otherwise, we might as well destroy a man's freedom at once. Why Our compel him to buy his saws, good or bad as the case may be, frpm one particular State in the whole of Australia? There is no reason in it -Sydney, too. few of, them. If honourable members choose to impose a steadying duty, all right, but to shut out importations altogether, and compel the whole milling industry of Australia to be dependent upon a small local source of supply seems to me to be protection run mad. Mr W, H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3:56] I think we should endeavour to have something like-uniformity in this Tariff, and to classes of people engaged in different occupations. We have just dealt with a large class of things.under the heading of machinery and machine tools which are used by people engaged in various occupations. I understood that by the general assent of all parties we agreed to a compromise to make these goods pay a uniform duty of 15 per cent. 1 do not see why these particular goods-saws-shoul d be free any more than any other goods. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, it was asked for.

311,Mr Hedges,"No one asks, for that.point out to those who are anxious to have a high duty on saws, that there are only two manufacturers of saws in the Commonwealth, both of whom established their industries without any duty whatever. One is Blakeley, in Victoria, who established his business thirty years ago without a duty, and the other is Chapman, of Sydney. Saws are essentially tools of trade, which should have been included under the same heading as other tools. If honourable members look at the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, they will find that Blakeley asked for a duty of 35 per cent, on circular saws, band saws, and other saws for five years only, whilst Chapman, of Sydney, asked for a duty ot 25 per cent. On circular saws only. Both makers admitted that their industry had been"" established without any duty, and acknowledged that they were doing a splendid business. They said that they were able, to compete with American makers of saws, and Chapman, of Sydney, stated that he was cutting the Americans entirely out of the market. So that they are doing very well indeed under present circumstances. They are not only able to hold their own, but are absolutely driving their foreign competitors out of the local .market. One of them also admitted that he was exporting profitably to New Zealand, and that for the last twenty years, in spite of the New Zealand duty, he charged 70 per cent, higher prices in New Zealand than his principal American competitor, and still held his own. Mr Chapman said that he charged £ 1 8 ios. for a 5 f t . circular band saw. invoiced in America at £ 1 2 8s., so that the local manufacturers secure immensely higher prices for their saws than are obtained for the imported articles. . He added, however, that he allowed a discount of 10 per cent, to merchants. Mr Blakeley admitted that he got a reasonable price, and that if the duty were increased-and this bears out the statement that prices have been increased since the imposition of the new Tariff-the . consumer would have to pay more. The evidence of the only two makers in the Commonwealth shows that there is not the slightest need for any duty.

There is a large number of printers in the Commonwealth, and, keeping in view the comparatively small value of the importations, it will be seen that the duty would not add one iota to the cost of printing-it would be merely a. few pounds divided amongst the printers.

'Moreover, it is very hard to define any special face, so that local manufacturers are practically at liberty to make any face of type that they like. It has been said that only a few boys and girls are employed in making type locally; but, as a matter of fact, some seventy hands are employed in the Sydney type foundry. Twelve handlings are necessary to produce the finished article; but, without wearying the Committee with a description of all the processes of manufacture, I wish to emphasize what I have already stated, that, while at the present time the kinds of type available for jobbing fonts are somewhat limited, there is nothing to prevent all the varieties of type that the world knows of being made, supposing that the industry gets the protection for which it now asks. I know Mr Wimble personally, and have had business dealings with him. The country would be quite safe in accepting his pledge not to increase prices; but, in any case, Parliament can. protect the consumers under a measure for regulating this and other industries. best wages, and there is a good feeling towards it on the part of the employees, which is very pleasant to see. sent time, notwithstanding the use of linotypes, the expenditure on type amounts to between £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 -and £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year. The honourable member for Coolgardie said that some of the type which is imported is again exported. type exported is, as the honourable member for Parramatta has stated, the Wimble type, which is sent to New Zealand, where it finds a better market than in Australia, because the operations of the business concerns there are not so hidebound' as those of the Australian firms. If we cannot get patriotism spontaneously, we must, since it is so necessary for the development of Australian industries, compel people to be patriotic by making it impossible, or at least unprofitable, for them to buy other than Australian manufactures, when these can be produced at prices not exceeding those of importations, and are of as good quality. In view of the large expenditure upon type in Australia, probably with an increase in the duty, another firm will start, and that will provide competition. The honourable member for Calare objects to the duty on type because type is used by the small man, and he would exempt linotypes because they are used by the large man. The existThe fact that different faces ence of patent rights prevents the Australian manufacture of linotypes; but there is nothing to prevent the manufacture, within the Commonwealth, of ordinary and jobbing type of all kinds, and it is only reasonable to provide for its manufacture here. The present makers are ready to be bound by any reasonable restrictions that Parliament may choose to place upon them. Once we have a factory hedged about by the necessary conditions, we have, as it were, a policeman to watch the operations of any similar factory, and prevent evasions of the law. I hope that the Committee will take advantage of this opportunity to encourage an industry which will be a boon and not a bane to our printers. do not profess to know much about the printing business; but I have received a circular from an influential body of printers vvho I think would not be guilty of printing an absolute untruth. I quite recognise the principle enunciated by the last speaker. We are here, I think, to do what we can to give a good protectionist policy to the country. But whether that is to be prohibition or not I do not know. It appears to The firm pays the me that we are departing very steadily from what I call a good protective policy. While at first I was quite prepared to f o l Even at the prelow the protectionist recommendations of the Tariff Commission, I am considerably shocked at the manner and the mode in which they were arrived at. Hitherto type has been allowed to come in free, and the duty recommended by the T a r if f ' CommisThat is not so. The sion, and proposed by the Government, is 25 per cent. The circular which I hold in my hand puts the position in this wayAgain the occasion has arisen for united action by the masters printers of Yictoria in protection of their interests. Of course, there are two sides to every question. The side of the workman has been presented with great force, but the side of the other man, who, in my opinion, is concerned as much as the worker, has not yet been presented.

I am informed that the best type passes through thirteen hands before it is finished. There is more labour employed in producing the best quality of type than is generally supposed. The idea of the honourable member for Parramatta seems to me to be quite out of the question. What he suggests is -that the local firm shall go on without a duty until they are able to supply the whole market. If the firm should ever attain to that position, they will not require a duty. That is not the idea of protectionists at all. Why should that firm be singled out for differential treatment simply because it is not able to supply local requirements? The only other question to consider is, how much duty shall be imposed? Some practical printers have indicated that there is a sufficient margin to enable them to supply, without increasing the price, the demand which the local firm cannot supply. How far that statement is correct, those engaged in the business know best. I believe that there is a considerable margin. The local firm have, I understand, agreed not to raise the price, and the importers will act as a check upon them. There is an advantage in having .type made locally. If it is up-to-date, if it is equal in artistic appearance to the best type in the world, printers are always able to secure a supply whenever they run short. I happen to know that in some cases printers have been unable tq procure from the importer an additional supply of a particular font of type, and it has had to be ordered from England or America. often. it happens very often, but it' is an advantage to a printer when he runs short of a particular font to be able to readily get an additional supply from a local maker. This firm' undertake -special feature of that. clined to think that a duty of 20 per cent., as suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, will be sufficient. Wimble and Company have been able -tb ' build up a trade without any duty at all. I think that the Committee might very well agree to an all round duty of 20 per cent. Necessarily printers will have to import type to some extent. The local makers cannot completely overtake the Australian demand.' had better hear what the small printers have to say about a 20 per cent. duty. small printers are not very frequent purchasers of type. They struggle along for a long while with their old type. Any one who looks at some country newspapers will see that the type from which they are printed has not a very good face. Of course, the printers want to get their type as cheaply as they can, but the duty would not increase the price materially. There is a sufficient margin of profit to enable the importer to cut his price down. In any case, country printers are not constantly buying type. I wish to be quite fair all round. If we are going to have a protective policy, why single out type for an exception? I have tried to get consideration .for other industries, and have failed.

The honourable member for Macquarie has mentioned that English manufacturers of type pirate American designs -to say. whether or not that is so. I am willing to take the honourable member's word. But I point out that the same kind of thing takes place in the case of the local manufacturer. I do not make that statement on my own authority, because I do not know. I base if upon the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. With reference to pirating, it was' stated there that the local maker ""pirates"" the new types designed elsewhere by making electrotype castings of each letter-question s 94132 and 94162. evidence goes on to show that one of the -automatic type-making machines produces ,£100 worth of type in a day, and that consequently little labour is employed, and the . labour cost is insignificant-questio n 94174.

The argument of those honourable members, who pin their faith in heavy taxation as a means of promoting prosperity and who believe that we need to protect Australian labour against the lower wages paid in other Again, he stated that countries, is, "" How are you to prevent the local manufacturer from fairly competing unless you give him the advantage of a duty?"" I have pointed out that the American and British workmen have greater reason to complain in this instance of the He went on to say lower wages paid in the Australian industry, and that therefore there is not a tittle of excuse for removing this item from the free list. In the absence of any stronger argument than I have yet heard, I shall vote for retaining type on the free list.

457,Mr Thomas Brown,"The honorwhile there are 14,000 employees who are interested in the goods being placed on the free list. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) .[6.0] The honourable member for Calare has made a point which I think is a good one, and deserving of attention. which are really the maker's of type for the large newspapers, are admitted free. In other words, the large newspapers which have linotypes practically use no other type at all. This duty will, unquestionably, for many years hit the proprietors of small country newspapers. It is all very well for the honourable member for Darling to say that it will not be felt by newspaper men; if he had to buy a few faces of type for a newspaper; or sufficient founts for a job printing office, he would quickly .discover that it is a very considerable item. Country newspaper and job printing offices' have to stock a large quantity of type, having regard to the work that they turn out; they have to keep in stock type which sometimes is not used more than .once or twice in a year. Variety is necessary to secure custom. I have no desire to say one word against the Australian type foundry, but I would point out that it does not produce the variety of founts to be found in the catalogues of the large American and English type founders. The cost of type, even when it was on the free list, was quite dear enough for the man.who had to buy it , and this duty will f a l l heavily upon men who can ill afford to bear it . I recognise that there is no hope of restoring the item to the free list, but I would urge honourable members not to agree to a duty of more than 20 per cent, on foreign imports, or of more than 15 per cent, on imports from Great Britain. ply to the statements made with reference to the Australian type foundry, I desire to say that it employs five skilled men, who receive from £ 6 to £ 3 15s. per week, and that three more skilled artisans are being brought out by the Dorset in order that the foundry may cope with the increased trade which has resulted from the imposition of the duty. Since the introduction of the new Tariff, the trade has not been called upon to pay an extortionate price for type; the country printer has not been, and is not going to be, asked to pay any portion of this duty. If he were, I should be one of the first to agitate for -its repeal. I know the men engaged in this industry, and therefore have no hesitation in making this statement. In view of the fact that there are seventy-two hands engaged in the industry, and that following the arrival of the three special artisans to whom I have referred someThe machines, thing like 250 persons will be employed, I think we should be prepared to assist it . are employed? number of girls are employed. The type is cast in slugs, which are easily separated, and the girls have simply to part the "" stamps"" and pass them on for trimming purposes. The process is a very simple one, and since many girls have to work for their living, it is better that they should be employed in this than in many other ways. I have it on -undoubted authority that the Australian type foundry is casting over 100 varieties of jobbing type, comprising some 300 characters; and fifty series of type, comprising 500 different sizes or bodies, are now cast by it . In short, I may say that the variety is sufficiently wide to meet the necessities of every country printing office. I have been identified with country newspaper offices for many years, and have no hesitation in saying that they need never go beyond Wimble's factory for what they want. Special type may be required by large job printing offices, and even those varieties will be obtainable from the local foundry when the industry is sufficiently established. I have listened with attention to the debate, and have learnt that there is only one large firm in Australia engaged in the casting of type. That firm is well known throughout Australia, and, under free trade, its business has attained considerable proportions. We have only to look at the catalogue which the members of that firm sent to us the other day, to satisfy ourselves that the industrv is in a flourishing condition. No one desires that tbey should not have some assistance, although tliey seem to have done very well without it. Last year, I understand, our imports of type were valued at less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0, showing a. falling off as compared with the imports ofi previous years. I ami not going to suggest that the reason for this reduction is solely that the local industry is successfully competing with the importers, but it would not be unfair to use such an argument. It would certainly -be unjustifiable to grant",53,Rebate For Home Consumption

As the honourable member for Swan has I knew them said, Wimble .and Company are a very old firm. Mr Wimble bought out a man named Thitchener in Melbourne, but, being unable to carry on the business, he went to Sydney, and after a hard struggle, endeavoured in vain to induce the Master Printers' Association to buy him out. If he has succeeded to a certain extent in establishing this industry, it has been by I have not heard one argument in dint of great exertion, by reason of his splendid mental capacity and as the result of the assistance of others in monetary and other directions. I have read all the circulars that have been sent to me in regard to. this matter, and I think the fairest suga master printer is that we should impose this duty in respect of all the classes of tvpe which Mr Wimble manufactures, and allow other classes to come in at a reduced rate.

There is no difference between weeks ago,-he put the articles on the free 1 list. Now, perforce, they must be subjected to fixed duties of 5s. 6d. and 5s. per cwt. How do those rates work, out ad valorem? I have no idea as to what the incidence of this new taxation is. I do not know the value of the screws for wood, and, unless the fixed rate can be taken out for us ad valorem, how are we to know what duty we are voting? The"" 5s. 6d. per cwt."" is so much Dutch to us. If , as the honourable member for Boothby says, music-stool screws are related to mining machinery, I should like to know why they have not been placed in the same category as to the rates of' duty? chinery bears a duty of 20 per cent.j and yet the Treasurer proposes to make screws bear an impost of 25 per cent. per cwt. means a little over 5 per cent. much to cavil at in a duty like that, and, therefore, the change becomes the more mysterious. -better classification. classification as it is, and reduce the rates of duty; we do not quarrel with the classification, but with the duties. Somehow or always mean an increase in duties. AndI submit that this is a most surreptitious way of endeavouring to get higher duties passed. It is most unfair that we should not be given notice of the Treasurer's intentions; and I do not see why these amendments should not have been circulated this morning, so that honourable members might have an opportunity to compare the amendments with the items in the Tariff. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the figures "" 25,"" paragraph A, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figure "" 5 "" think'that the re-arrangement proposed by the Treasurer is an improvement. The duty on some of those screws certainly 6ught not to be s per cent, and free. For instance, I have in my hand a brake screw, and this and nearlyall the screws mentioned by the Treasurer are square-threaded screws made on lathes. ' There is no reason in the world why these screws should be admitted free, because most of them are parts of the machines and engines which are to be admitted on duties of 25 per cent, and 20 a music-stool screw, a table screw, or a brake screw* and the other screws mentioned, so far .as the mechanism is concerned ; and all of them ought to be made here, as most of them are. Their manufacture gives considerable employment; and I do not think that, in any case, many of the larger screws would be brought in finished. It is certainly ridiculous to put them in the same category as, for instance, carpenters' screws, which are not made here. Engineers' set screws are not square threaded, and really take the form of a bolt without a nut. ' These are made here; but if they were free of duty, they would Mining maprobably be imported ready-made. Almost all machines contain engineers' set screws, which are generally made from steel. In my opinion, duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., as in the case of machinery, would be fair. No one will pretend to say",58,William Lyne I T Is A Re Distri

These drills have acquired popularity in all the States, where they are largely used in assisting mining operations. drills? driven by compressed air or by steam power, but they cannot be driven by electrical power.

Western Australia altogether. The life of a rock drill is, roughly speaking, five years. So that the utmost advantage which the local makers could expect to get would be to the extent of a couple of hundred rock drills per annum in Queensland. New South Wales, and Victoria. The number used 'in Australia is about 2,400. In my opinion, the arguments for giving the same treatment to rock drills as they had under the previous Tariff is unanswerable. I do think that if we are going to endeavour to encourage the improvement and manufacture of these machines in Australia, the best course for us to pursue would be to give consideration to the industry on the lines proposed in regard to the manufacture of iron and its associated products, instead of by imposing a duty which will be injurious to the mining industry. stead of taking our information from the advertisements of firms and being guided 6y testimonials supplied by them, I think that honourable members would be well advised in giving consideration to the evidence adduced before the Tariff Commission. I turn to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, of which the honourable member for Bendigo was chairman. On page 16 of the report on Mining Machinery, there ate references to rock drills. I quote this passageThe principal rock drill Tecognised on the Kalgoorlie mines is that of the Inger?oll-Sergeant Co., of New York. This drill has been worked alongside of and against the TaylorHorsfield (Bendigo) and other outside makes of drills, and it has been found that the Ingersoll-Sergeant drill bored better and quicker than any other. The mining manager of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation mine was not able to say which of the drills was responsible for the .greatest consumption of air. It was proposed to make proper comparative tests of the various drills, including Australian, in order to show the exact consumption of air for the boring done per minute, or per hour, as the may be. Whichever was found to be the best would be installed -(Q . 413S2-5; 41486.) Further on the report says: I should say so; and The principal items of machinery imported from America, and used at Kalgoorlie, are rock drills, rock breakers, belt conveyers. These imported articles were preferred to Australian made, because they were considered to be the best -(Q . 41404.) That statement, which the honourable member for Bendigo fathered as Chairman of tlie Commission, was very different from the one which he made here as member for Bendigo. tract from .page 31 of the report. 17 saysA quantity of engines and machinery has been discarded and scrapped on the gold-fields, and its place taken by high-grade machines of English and American manufacture -(Q . 40877; 40982-5.) tion of the Commission, and the report was signed by the honourable member for Bendigo. dicted ; and besides, it does not say that any' rock drills were scrapped. saysMany types of rock drills are in use in Australia. A Victorian engineer (Taylor -Horsfield, of Bendigo), and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta), had designed rock drills, which had considerable improvements on those imported. It was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of getting Australian designed and made drills into general use. The better such drills were' the greater the probability of their being copied by American makers and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described; when they found a better drill than their own their agent secured samples, sent them to America to be copied; they were then sent to Australia and sold at any .price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out -(Q . 46487; 46643 ) Percussion rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent, would enable the local. men to capture the market, and would gTeatly increase employment -(Q . 48031.) Then at page 36 we have the statementThe Shaw rock drill lately patented in America was being introduced into Australia, and the Austral Otis Co. had arranged foT its local manufacture.

Asi t has been opened up, I suppose the discussion on this item will be concluded; but I . think the Committee should favourably consider the proposal of the honourable member for Newcastle to omit boring machinery from this item. I appeal to the Committee to let the mining industry have a few of the implements required to carry it on admitted at a reasonable rate of duty. I appeal to honourable members also to be guided by the views of men who have to handle these drills, which are likelv to be more reliable than the opinions expressed in advertisements published by firms who have drills for sale. listened with attention to the previous speakers on this item. We have in connection with this item again to consider the questions of monopoly and protection. Before Victorian manufacturers of these drills entered into competition for the trade, the price of drills was £ 8 0 apiece. I wish the Committee to bear that in mind. Since we have had local competition for 'these machinles, the price has come down, and I am given to understand that they can now be purchased for about £ 3 0 each. Darling spoke of the annual cost of repairs, as amounting in the case of the imported to 12s. 6d., as against -£4 ios. for the locally-manufactured machine. In answer to that, let me inform honourable members that the deepest shaft in Australia was sunk 252 feet with a locallymade drill, at a cost for repairs of only is. per foot.^ The honourable member also informed the Committee that straps were used in connection with the locally-made drill.

I wish to say that Victorian manufacturers should be credited with bringing this machine up-to-date. When these drills were first imported it took three men to cart them around. The pistons of the imported drills were so brittle that if one broke it could not be repaired, and had to be replaced at a cost of £ j ios. Australian manufacturers have succeeded in manufacturing a piston that can be repaired. In the next place, the chuck attached to the piston of the imported drills was of so brittle a character that in working pieces of metalbecame detached and workmen were injured in this way. The Australian manufacturers' have; improved the machine in that direction also. But what do wefind to-day ? We find the company which has been referred to adopting the Australian chuck, and putting it on to their machines. Company. Australian manufacturers have made improvements upon the machine, and brought the price down from _£8o to £ 3 0 , under the operation of a protective duty of 25 per cent., which was in force in Victoria prior to Federation.

It was the operation of that Tariff that brought down the price of the drill, and now we are being asked to place this machine on the free list that the importers may secure a monopoly, and put up the price again. These drills are being made in many parts of Victoria, and I believe also in South Australia.

The honourable member for Flinders the other night said that he was prepared to vote for the proposals of the Government on a certain item, because they were framed in relation to the Excise duties. I trust that honourable members who are in favour of protection, or who take the view held by the honourable member for Flinders, will vote on this item to keep out the imported article, and to give employment to men who are now out of work. There has not been a single reason advanced why rock drills should be struck out, and I trust the Committee will vote for the highest protection it is possible to get. [9.48] -The honourable member for Batman made a very fine speech in favour of the Australian-made rock drill, and satisfied me that its manufacturers are doing a roaring business. He states that 500 or 600 drills are in use in Victoria, attach a good deal of weight to what was' said by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. Although he quoted from a trade circular, it is not fair to say that what he quoted was not correct. The drills to which the' honourable member for Bendigo referred are to be found in some of the principal mines in Western Australia. I was upon the fields some months ago, and saw the Bayley's Reward claim.. There was no reason to suppose from its appearance that the best of everything had not been put into it. It was closed down because they could not get gold, and not because the drill did not do its work. It is no part of my business here to run down a colonial production. I believe that the Australian drill is a good one, but, so far as I can gather from the evidence quoted by the honourable member for Darling, the imported drill will do the work quicker and better. Still that does not mean that the local drill will not do its work. The honourable member for Bendigo quoted an extract which showed that there had been some competition between the two drills, and that the colonial article was a first class one. Still, the imported drill is so much Although it is proved that it is not quite better that the makers can afford to keep its price above that of the colonial article. The honourable member for Batman stated that its owners will only allow people to buy the imported machines if a guarantee is given that they will not use the colonial article. But only a man who is sure of his ground will make such a stipulation. If his machine were inferior, he would be told, "" I do not want your machine, andi would not have it on those terms."" lower price to get the monopoly. honourable member pointed out that the imported machine costs £ 7 more than doesthe local drill. That is not a very large difference, especially to rich mines. Apparently the differencebetween the two machines is small, or the difference in price would be greater. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has stated over and over again that, as a protectionist, he would not agree to placing on the free list any article which can be produced here of good quality. But where is the honourable member on this item? Let him.vote with the protectionists. All through the Tariff, a large amount of protection has been giver* for articles of excellent manufacture that will do their work. If that is to'be the policy the protectionist ought to stand by the colonial article. While I am in favour of free competition in manufactures, and would open our ports to allow the best articles to come in, so as to keep the local maker up to the highest pitch of efficiency, I would not say that the imported article should be taken in preference to the colonial. All things being equal, I should give the choice to the colonial article. I bave come to the conclusion that in this case the colonial rock drill is not quite so good as is the imported machine, and, if that is so, we should allow the latter to. come in. But the local manufacturers have nothing to fear, because everybody in Victoria uses their machine. The honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out that at immense depths it is better thar* any other. My desire is to have the local article made as good as is the American) or English production. That' will never be brought about unless the imported machine is allowed free entry to our marketsThe local machine also has the advantage of the local prejudice in its favour; otherwise, it would not be so largely used. EO good, its makers can thrive in spite of the competition of the imported article. A. low duty would therefore satisfy all requirements. the suggestion of the honourable member for.

But, on the other hand, to put a high duty upon the Ingersoll Sargent and the Rand drills ; would be doing an injustice tp the mining community. None of these mines are in any sense philanthropic bodies, nor do I imagine that the question enters very much into the consideration of the directors or mining managers as to whether a drill is made in Bendigo or America, but the managers-man y of whom, like Mr Richard Hamilton and others who Iiave been mentioned, are at the very top of their profession-hav e unquestionably a strong desire to secure a machine which will do the work effectively and -cheaply, and in such a way as will allow the miner to show the most satisfactory results. I do not wish to prejudice, by any remark of mine, the drill which is made in Australia, but the bulk of testimony from the managers of large mines throughout the mining industry has good reason for shall not be put upon an article which has proved itself to be so serviceable. That is due to the fact that the makers of three great drills haye joined together, and, as Edison does in America, have their agents all over the world to ascertain what improvements or changes are being made, and secure them. Consequently there is no possibility of an Australian manufacturer ever being in such a completely satisfactory position as to have at his command all the latest ideas --and practical improvements in the way the great combinations have. I shall, there-fore, favour a lower duty than the one proposed by the Government. Some assistance and help should unquestionably be given to the manufacturers, not only in Victoria, but in all the other States. But I do not approve of a duty which would prevent drills of a higher class being introduced for use in the mines here. This drill is being used in some of tbe mines in BrokenH ill and Tasmania, and has found its way to the West; and it would be unjust to our local manufacturers to say that their manufacture does not deserve consideration, seeing that it has been adopted by most capable and able managers. I shall support the suggestion to have this appliance put into a separate line, but I shall ask the Committee to impose a higher duty than that proposed by the honourable member. I think a fair compromise would be to have a duty of 20 per cent, in both columns. some mines. of that argument; no mine worth working will be shut down by the imposition of such a duty as I suggest. There is no question that these rock drills ought to be made in Australia. are not good enough. local manufacturers some assistance. They have struggled under the old Tariff, and I have previously protested that we were doing them an injustice. I hope the Government will accept the compromise I have, suggested, and in the case of rock drills impose a higher duty than that attaching to the other machinery and appliances in the item. the Commonwealth will show that intend to support the proposal of the honourable member for Newcastle. Australianurging that a prohibitive duty made rock drills are sold in the local market at a. cheaper rate than are the imported drills, and, that being so, I do not see why any more protection is required. The Australian consumption of rock drills is about 5 per cent, of the world's consumption, and, if the idea of imposing a duty is to compel the foreign manufacturer to establish works here, I do not think it will have the desired effect. To make it worthwhile for a foreign maker to put down the necessary expensive plant in Australia, there would have to be an output of 2,500 drills annually, whereas the Australian consumption is about 400 or 500. These facts appeal to me as a business man, and, in mv opinion, the duties will be excessive if they exceed 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. The Hollmann drill is composed of very fine material, which is not available in Australia ; and which, in case of the manufacture being carried on here, would have to be imported, thus adding to the cost qf production. Nearly every part of this drill is protected by patent rights; and therefore I do not see how any good can arise from an increased duty, unless the makers are",71,Pairs

The great desideratum in mining is cheapness in working; and, notwithstanding what so great an authority as the honourable member for Kooyong has said, there are many propositions in Australia which would employ thousands of men if , by means of scientific improvement, they could gain a little advantage in this connection. In Western Australia there aremany old mining propositions which, with a little cheaper working ensured, would become good going concerns. down, or a proposition is prevented from maturing, more men will be thrown out of employment than could find work were the whole of the market for this' appliance confined to Australian manufactures. member think that a small duty like that proposed would cause any mine to shut down ? not affect thoroughly established mines, but there are many other ventures which' are only waiting for improved and cheaper means of working in order to employ thousands, who would be consumers of the products of those engaged in other industries.

When I submitted the amendment I was under the impression that rock-boring machines were not manufactured here to any material extent.

But there are many smaller propositions which would be severely handicapped if we imposed a duty of 30 per cent, upon rock-drills. I have never attempted to decry our local manufactures, and I do not say that the drills made in the Commonwealth are not excellent for some purposes. price of the imported article is about £ 4 4 , so that a duty of 30 per cent, would be equivalent to about £ 1 4 That is the increased amount which the users of these machines will be called upon to pay under the Government proposal. manufactured drill is being sold to-day for less than is the imported article. It is the acme of absurdity for honourable members to declare that men will purchase the imported in preference to the Australian article as the result of mere prejudice. ported machine is about £ 2 7 . MrM c WILLIAMS formed by a reliable authority that it is .£44. But, assuming that it is £ 2 7 , an ad valorem rate of .30 per cent, would very nearly enhance its cost by one-third. The honourable member for Batman has argued at considerable length that the local drill is superior to the imported article. If that be so, surely there is no justification for the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent. better one, why is it not exported? MrM c WILLIAMS to say a word against the Australian machine. For certain work, it is an exceedingly good one. propose that the price of the article should be increased by 30 per cent. honourable member for Batman apparently entertains the idea that the supply of rock drills is practically' in the hands of an American trust. As a matter df fact, 50 per cent, of the drills imported into the Commonwealth are of British origin. maintains large and expensive agencies here. already secured half of the trade, and they ask for no preference as against the trust. The honourable member for Batman mentioned the fact that a shaft had been sunk at Bendigo by means of drills of Australian manufacture at a cost for repairs of only is. per foot. I may inform him that at the Princess Royal Mine, Norseman, a shaft was sunk several hundred feet at a cost for repairs' of only 7d. per foot. These figures, however, convey nothing, because so much depends upon the character of the ground. I hope that the Committee will vote in favour of the lower duly. Roughly speaking, the am sorry that honourable members should have spoken disparagingly of the locally manufactured drill. I have had considerable experience of these drilling machines in connection with the Long Tunnel Company, at Walhalla. There we sank a The locally shaft 2,800 feet in twenty months. The men employed, who were first-class shaft sinkers, sunk as much as 160 feet per month, which, I think, constitutes a world's record. They started by using Taylor-Horsfield drills. They were allowed to use whatever machines they chose. After they had been working some time, acting on the advice of our mining I have been inengineer, we substituted American drills. But the men speedily reverted to the Australian machines.

Australia is a very big country, and cannot be governed wholly in accordance with the views of the people of Melbourne or of Bendigo. Men whose employers consider them worth salaries of £3,000 or £4,000 a year to manage mines should be tiie most capable judges of what is the best machinery to use in those mines. we have heard about American trusts has no weight with me, because some of the best drills that come to this country are British.. The honourable member for Batman proved more than he intended to prove. Statistics show that Australia requires 500 new rock drills annually, so that if Victoria had the whole business of manufacturing drills, the work would not give employment to 500 persons as stated by the honourable member for Batman; that, would be only one drill per man per annum. The honourable member for Darling bears me out in fhe contention that it is necessary that the big mining companies, such as the Great Cobar Company, should have up-to-date machinery, and should be allowed to say what machinery is best for their purposes. A drill which might suit one kind of rock might not suit another. We have listened to a great many so called experts to-night; but I claim to have some knowledge of this subject, because I have driven underground, through haid rock-blueston e and granite-for a length of half a mile at a time, and I know that a drill which will do good work in one shaft or tunnel may not do good work in another. knows anything about rock drilling will support that statement. Indeed, men who have been accustomed to deal with one particular kind of rock, if taken to another place where the rock is different, and given the drill to which they are used, will often, prove practically useless, and their drills, The honourable member for Bendigo says that the drills which he mentioned have been used at the Queensland Menziesmine, at Bayley's mine, and at one or two others, all of which are now closed. drills referred to? orable members must draw their own conclusions. No doubt the drills have beeni used in mines which are still at work, and The States are now federated; are doing well; but the fact that they have does not show them to be any better than other drills. Had they proved so good as to be able to keep the mines going, there would have been something to say for them.

But they forget that nowadays Western AusThe talk tralia produces more gold per annum than all the other States put together. that position. with "" has-beens.""

If Victoria, considering the small amount of gold she produces, were allowed to dictate to Western Australia in this matter, it would be a case of the tail wagging the dog. The tail should wait until the dog wags it, and Western Australia is -certainly the dog so far as mining goes. I do not ask that rock drills be treated differently from other tools of trade, or that they be admitted free to the detriment of local manufacturers.

But under this Tariff, in almost every instance, the Government have proposed duties of 25 and 30 per cent., and it has only been after a very heavy struggle that we have been able to secure some reduction in the rates. It has been truly said by honourable members that the mining industry is a great one In my electorate it has kept two or three townships going. Surelyi t is only fair to assume that the increased duties are likely to do considerable injury. The honourable member for Bendigo did not tell everything in connection with locally-made rock drill. I am informed that about three years ago a trial took place between the imported Hollmann machine .and the locally-made machine, that the whole of the mining managers of Bendigo gave the palm to the former; and that it is being used by the bulk of the mines in Bendiso. disloyal to their own State? that. I am dealing with a proposal of the Treasurer which, if carried, will_ involve a huge additional expenditure in connection with the mining industry. The other night the honourable member for Kooyong stated that the increased duties on mining machinery meant an immediate additional cost of nearly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to the mines throughout the Commonwealth. I also have been informed on reliable authority that the increased duties wiil cause a very considerable increase in the expenditure' on those mines. For instance,_ a duty of 30 per cent, on 500 rock 'drills would realize about £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . What is the use of building up an industry and then crushing it out of existence? I know that in this very city the interests in connection with mining companies are so great that they have almost created a slight financial paralysis. If we keep on increasing the duties on item after item, what will be the result? It is all very well for some honourable members to say that the Government are proposing an increase of only as compared with the duty under the old Tariff. Buti f we impose an increased duty on every one of nearly 600 items, we shall impose upon the people a burden which they cannot afford, to bear. I recognise that we must have increased duties. But suppose, for the Sake of argument, that the ^duty on a mining requirement was 1 2 per cent, under the old Tariff. 1 Surely an increase to 20 per cent, is fair, and an increase to 30 per cent, unfair. When a locally-made piece of machinery can be sold at 25 per cent, less than the cost of the imported article, honourable members should hesitate before they impose an excessive duty. I recognise that it is no use trying to get the duty down to what I consider would be a fair rate. As the industry for which the duty is proposed is a going concern, there is no need for it to be propped up and buttressed. Surely a going concern the does not require more than a reasonable duty. In this instance the old story of protection cheapening the article is not a factor in determining the issue.

[11.48] I do not desire to address the Committee at any length upon this question. the evening, but the debate turned upon one matter, in which I was not specially interested. In the proposal which is now under consideration, however, the whole of our mining interests are involved. honourable members will turn to the Budget statement, and to the papers connected with it which were laid upon the table of the House by the Treasurer, they will find that from 1902 to 1906 inclusive, the mining industry exported wealth to the amount of £104,225,000. export of machinery, implements, and manufactures of metals was valued at only £ 4 6 9 , 0 0 0 . must be remembered that the product of the mining industry has to find its market in the outside world. withstanding this, there are large numbers of persons engaged in the industry who are not working rich mineral fields, but fields upon which the margin between profit and loss is a very narrow one. Yet it is now proposed to increase the taxation upon mining machinery from 12J per cent, to 25 per cent, uncler the general Tariff and to 20 per cent, under the. Tariff for the United Kingdom. remind honourable members thai this industry employs about 112,006 labourers, as compared with seme 16,000 who are employed in the whole of the machine and metal manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. I desire to call the attention of honourable members to the different treatment which is accorded to the mining industry by other protectionist countries. I find that<in item 222 of the New Zealand Tariff it is specified that steam engines and parts thereof, including the boiler or boilers there for, imported speciallv for mining or gold saving purposes and processes or for dairying purposes, are dutiable at 5 per cent. Again, in item 439 I find that machinery for gold-saving purposes and processes has been placed upon the free list. That is the treatment which the industry receives in a country which believes in a protective policy, but which'does not believe in penalThe izing its large primary industries. A similar remark is applicable to the Dominion of Canada. member think that it is wise at this hour of the night to speak at such length, especially as the general question has already from speaking earlier in the debate in the I had intended to do so earlier in hope that a reasonable duty would be agreed to. But instead of securing a duty of 20 per cent -whic h I was prepared to accept-the Committee have imposed a duty of 25 per cent, upon mining machinery If under the general Tariff. Consequently I have no alternative but to fight for the insertion of a reasonable rate in the preference column. In Canada all the important machinery used for mining purposes is upon a list of special exemptions. The case of the Wilberforce Gold Dredging Company has already been cited. There As against that, the is also the case of the Cobar Company, which recently ordered machinery to cost about £ 7 1 , 0 0 0, of which about £ 4 7 , 0 0 0 In this connection it worth was to come from England and about £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 worth from America. Under the old Tariff the duty-12 per cent. 1 Not-woul d have been about £ 8 , 8 0 0 , but if 25 per cent., and the preferential duty of 20 per cent., is charged it-will be increased by ,£17,000, and will come to £ 2 5 , 9 8 7 . About£ 9 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 worth of machinery included in the order was previously on the free list, but is now dutiable at 25 per cent. That is an instance of the way in which one of our great primary industries, which has been, a source of enorI would further mous wealth to the country, is being burdened, so that it will become more difficult for those connected with it to obtain decent wages. I move That the amendment be amended by inserting the figures "" 15 "" in the blank created by leaving out the figures "" 25-"" [11.57] -The honourable member for Calare has referred to the Great Cobar mine; but those connected with that mine, as is well known, will purchase nothing in Australia. many working men going. many thousands of pounds profit.

The company, when it started, imported even its columns and girders, showing that it is capable of resorting to any device to avoid purchasing in Australia. It has already been determined in connection with similar items that the rates of duty shall be 25 and 20 per cent., and if the free-traders try to force a reduction to 15 per cent, in connection with importations from the United Kingdom, I hope that the protectionists will insist on an all-round duty of 25 per.cent. -What was said in connection with the proposal to tax rock drills applies with a hundredfold more force to the proposal to tax ore-reducing appliances. lutely necessary to encourage the use of the test and latest ore-dressing and ore-reducing appliances, as they do in other countries, in order that our very low-grade ores may be worked to advantage. The Simmer and Jack Mine, by far the largest gold-producing mine in the world, which uses 600 head of stamps, is working on a 6-dwt. reef. using the latest and most up-to-date appliances. Here in Australia we have many hundreds of low-grade propositions, and we can work them profitably only by using the most up-to--date appliances. The mining industry, instead of employing a few handfuls of men, as some of the manufacturing industries do, gives work to tens of thousands. who put their money into mines a fair chance to profit by their investments. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has had a great deal to say about the mining companies importing their requirements, but we are very glad to get money from abroad to work our mines. Apparently the honourable member would consider a man who put money into Australian mines as an enemy to the country, but what we need is the investment of more capital in mining. members should wish to put a duty of 4s. in the £ 1 on the machinery that we most need in Australia to develop the mining industry. I shall vote for the lower duty. The.honourable member for Melbourne Ports has spoken of the Great Cobar mine as an English company which never buys anything in Australia. That mine, however, was for manv years an Australian property, and was developed by Australians. It is only about a year since the English company purchased it, so it is not correct to say that everything at the mine has been imported. Of course, much of the machinery is such as could not be made in Australia, because it is covered by patents. I do not hold a brief for the company, but I feel bound to correct a misstatement. is appalling to hear some of the statements made in this Committee. The Great Cobar mine invited tenders in Australia, England, and America for its requirements. opposed the reduction of the duty to 15 per cent., but the proposed rate having been struck out, I accept the defeat as regards the higher duty, and am now prepared to It is absovote for a duty of 20 per cent. Although mining is a very important industry in my district, I do not propose to speak at length on this subject, because I always tear in mind the value of our time, and the need in the country's interest for getting through the Tariff as quickly as possible. Therefore I make my remarks as short as But it can do so only by I can. Question-That the blank created in the amendment be filled by the figures "" J 5 "" The Committee divided.

This item is, I think, on all-fours with item 166, as to which we accepted tliis morning in regard to several industries the duties I now propose. In my opinion, all these items ought to be treated on the same basis. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea' surer) [12.12 a.m.] -The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is mistaken, because tliis item is not identical with item 166.

Sampson, S. proposed a duty of 25 per cent., and I suggest that the difference should be compromised with a duty of 20 per cent. to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The protectionist section of the Committee were generous enough to say that special machinery should goon the 15 per cent, list, but now honourable members opposite -som e of whom came here claiming to be protectionists-wan t us to put all lines on that list. The sooner we put an end to that sort of thing the better, I think. Rather than vote for a duty of 15 per cent., I shall vote for these articles to be free. . Either we ought to give protection, or we ought not to penalize the users of any machinery. A duty of 15 per cent, is not a protective, but a revenue duty. Some of us who voted for a duty of 15 per cent, did so by way of concession in regard to special machinery. But we are now dealing with machinery that can easily be made within the Commonwealth I now admit that those of us who believe in protection made a mistake in the previous case in voting for 15 per cent., because it is evident that advantage is being taken of our generosity. I trust that the higher rate of duty will be agreed to. Personally, I should vote for duties of 35 and 30 per cent, if I had an opportunity.

The Tariff Commission arrived at certain conclusions in respect of this industry, one or two of which I propose to read. It is greatly to be regretted that a question of such magnitudea question dealing with the advanced guard of scientific engineering, and exercising such a momentous influence upon our industrial system, has ro l»e dealt with at this early hour of the morning, and in such a thin Committee. Among our conclusions we found thatelectrical generators, motors, and fans, and other machinery and appliances have been made in Victoria and Queensland under 25 per cent, protective Tariffs, which were in operation at some period prior to Federation.

We thereon the machinery which I have named. The Government in its first proposals in regard to electrical machinery adopted our recommendation except as to rates, confining the higher duties to generators, motors up to the capacity of 500 horsepower, fans, and starting and regulating rheostats. But in the proposals now before the Committee they apply the duties to all electrical motive power and machinery, irrespective of horse-power. Motors of a capacity of over 500 horsepower, and other big electrical machinery, are not likely to be made in Australia for many years to come; and any duty imposed upon them will be merely revenue producing and oppressive to the industries that .have to use this machinery. But duties on small motors and generators may give a stimulus to local manufacturers. I am desirous of doing all I can to encourage the manufacture of electrical machinery in Australia; but I do not wish to go beyond what is fair and reasonable. Senator McGregor, ex-Senator Higgs, Mr Francis Clarke, and myself talked this matter over and came to the conclusion that the highest COOK -There is no duty that should be imposed on the machinery I have mentioned was 25 per cent., and that bigger machinery should be dutiable at 12J per cent.

I think we shall adopt a very fair standard in accepting the suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo. Our requirements in the way of electrical machinery are so limited that in all probability a dynamo of 500 horsepower will prove to be the maximum required. An increase of duty from 1 2 per1 cent, to 20 per cent, is as much protection as an industry that has reached the stage of development of the one we are considering can expect.from any Parliament. Recognising the impossibility of making a successful appeal to the Committee at this time.in the morning, when we ought to be in bed, I feel disposed to accept the suggestion of the Minister.

In the honourable gentleman's absence, and knowing the sharp tactics witb which we have had to deal in connection with Tariff matters, I am compelled to put before the Committee my arguments in support of the proposal made by the honourable member for Bendigo. which the Government have already agreed to. If that honourable member will let the Chairman put the question, we are prepared to allow it to go at once. ister of Trade and Customs that the responsible Minister in charge of the Tariff is not here, and has not definitely told the Committee what reductions he is willing to agree to respecting several of the articles included -rates. If they bought articles at such vastly in the item, and that honourable members on-this side representing New,South Wales have been upbraided for not having put their views on this subject before the Committee. I have promised to remove all cause of complaint on that score, and I intend, to do so. I find, on referring to the Customs returns for 1906, that from the United Kingdom we imported this class of material to \he value of £117,852, equal to 55.57 per cent, of the total imports. Our imports from Germany amounted in value to £21,181 equal to 10.32 per cent. From Sweden, ,£12,966; from the United States, £52,426, equal to 24.72 per cent.; and from all other countries, .£6,845 worth of these materials. The total value of these importations amounted to £212,570. Turning to the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission in connection with these matters, we find that it clearly proves that no duty we could impose would enable the majority of these articles to be manufactured locally, unless the manufacture were preceded by a, very large increase in consumption, and also that the few articles that could be made here could only be produced at an excessive cost. At page 2240 of the Tariff members of the Opposition. I know that Commission report, it will be found that the honourable member for West Sydney has Mr Crocker, of the Kalgoorlie Electric been very active in the matter. Power and Lighting. Company, gave this evidencePractically none of tbe machinery and appliances used for pioducing and dealing with electricity are made in Australia. That is the sworn evidence of an expert in this particular business. Mr Crocker said in his"" evidence that Weymouth and Company, of Melbourne, did a little manufacturing, but added, "" We endeavoured to use one of their motors, but we did not find it working satisfactorily. Moreover, the price was £ 6 7 9s. 3d., while the invoice price of . similar imported articles was£17 ios. iod."" Evidently, therefore, there was a desire to give a preference to the local article, but the deal was found discrepancy between the two prices. The figures are so important that I should like to have a quorum present before proceeding. [Quorum formed.] So great a difference in price must have weight with municipal councils and similar bodies, who are responsible for the lighting of cites and' answerable to the"" ratepayers for the proper and economical expenditure of the increased prices they would have to increase the rates. If they find that they cannot get appliances manufactured locally in a satisfactory manner or at a reasonable price they must, to conserve the interests of the ratepayers, go to the cheapest market. Mr Crocker stated in his evidence that at such a price as he quoted it was impossible to use electrical machinery, for mining pur-, poses. This is, therefore, a matter of the gravest concern to those engaged in mining enterprises. Now that the Treasurer is present, I shall be glad to hear what he proposes. to make an explanation witli regard to the honourable member for West Sydney, who spoke to me a few days ago regarding this item, as he was very anxious that the duties proposed by the Government should be reduced. Earlier in the sitting, when the honourable member for Cook rose, I rose at the same time, intending to speak on behalf of the honourable member for West Sydney.
