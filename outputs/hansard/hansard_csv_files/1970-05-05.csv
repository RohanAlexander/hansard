11,Mr Gortoni Gather That The Leader,"the Treasurer. Is it a fact that a meeting of certain representative builders of all States met in Canberra at the end of last week, that they had collated figures indicating a serious downturn in building commencements over recent months, and that they communicated these matters to the permanent head of the Department of Housing who promised to convey them to his Minister and to the honourable gentleman? I now ask the honourable gentleman whether he his received these representations, whether he agrees with the builders' thesis and whether, if so, he has any corrective measures in mind. which took place last week, following which representations were made to the Government. 1 have since made an arrangement, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Housing, to see representatives of the Master Builders Federation and a number of other authorities concerned with building, on Friday morning. I do not agree by any means with some of the representations made both publicly and to the Government. They vary by degree and nature. Some of them almost amount to mass pressing of panic buttons and certainly do not do the industry any good. Believing that I might be asked a question on this subject. I brought into the chamber with me a statement made by Mr Hobart, Chairman of Stramit Boards Ltd, which was published in the 'Australian Financial Review' of-16th April and with which I heartily agree. He said inter alia: . . . on-site construction in the building industry is racing along at frenetic speed . . . . The immediate penalties of the present boom, where nobody seems to get much advantage, is decreasing labour, productivity, extravagant competition for labour, and lower quality, all of which add up to steeper price rises and delayed finishing times. If thc controls are applied judiciously and released wilh sufficient anticipation, a return to a healthy level of increase without long term disruption could be expected. Under these conditions, such short term adjustments are welcomed as well as necessary. That is a statement with which I completely concur. It is the Government's desire to see an outcome of this kind. The building industry has not been dealt with singly but as part of the who'.e e.onorny altho.igh it is an indusiry which is particularly affected. This is the kind of result for which the Government is aiming and which sensible people in the building and housing industry would applaud. to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Is it correct that the Government has approved of the entry into Australia of 2 new Bulgarian-built ships to be operated by the Australian Territory Liner Services in the Gulf of Carpentaria? If so, what will be the function of these ships and where are they to be registered? Has any Australian shipyard had orders cancelled or indefinitely deferred as a direct result of the decision to allow into Australia these 2 foreign built vessels? Liner Services has made application to the Government to bring into Australia 2 vessels which I understand have been built in Bulgaria. The same requirement is being placed on this company as on any other company wishing to bring vessels into Australia. This is that they should, prior to the date of import, undertake to build vessels within Australia and actually place orders for construction. At this stage the vessels have not been given their ultimate licences to come into Australia. I understand that 1 vessel is already here under temporary permit and that another vessel is shortly to arrive. I think that most members of this House are aware of the very real increase in cargo volume in northern Australia as a result of the development of mineral leases at Gove, Groote Eylandt and Weipa. There has obviously been a need for more tonnage to be available than was previously needed to serve the cattle stations about the northern Australian coastline. One other Australian operator has been in that field. That company has subsequently been taken over by an overseas company. It also has some vessels plying in the trade. My Department and I have had discussions with representatives of that company and with Australian Territory Liner Services to ensure that there will be both the maximum possible utilisation of Australian built vessels and the maximum possible employment of Australian seamen in vessels operating on that part of the coast. I am sure that when the vessels are duly licensed and that when the new",16,Railways Port Pirie To Adelaide

I think that I should wait until I make that statement before answering any questions. addressed to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. As many residents in the electorate of Mallee are intensely interested in the port of Portland, Victoria, and desire that it should be used for the export of their products and the import of goods they continually require, I ask: Did the Minister for Shipping and Transport at the invitation of the honourable member for Wannon recently make an inspection of the port of Portland? If so, did he note its decentralised location, its ability to berth practically any ship afloat and the vast, highly productive area it could serve? Will he do all in his power to foster the use of this port by coastal and international shipping? honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Wannon have been very eager to have me look at the port of Portland at the earliest possible opportunity. I have done so and I must confess I was impressed both with the facilities available and with the remarkable amount of tonnage handled in that port over the last 12 months. I understand that the tonnage is in fact a record for this port and covers both bulk cargo vessels and general cargo vessels. My visit, of course, was generally related to the difficulties associated with the centralisation of cargoes for the container movement of wool and other outgoing cargoes from the port of Portland. lt has been the objective of the Government to ensure that through commercial negotiation the shipping companies operating within the container consortia will apply a standard freight rate-applicable not only to the sea leg but also to the land leg. It is my understanding that as a result of negotiations about a fortnight ago an offer has now been made by the shipping companies, ft will embrace a comprehensive freight rate applicable to the out port of Portland, other out ports in Tasmania,-and to Albany in Western Australia. I believe that it is essential in a port such as Portland that there be an adequate service available for the many wool growers in that area and also in South Australia who are increasingly finding in Portland an excellent selling centre. T think it must be said that a great deal of credit must go to those who were initially responsible for the establishment of Portland as a wool selling centre for their enthusiasm at a time when there were obviously very real difficulties in iheir way. 1 am sure that this latest step towards the establishment of a general container freight rate will assist that wool selling centre to establish itself to an even greater extent in the future.

I am sorry to say that both the 2 Press statements that I saw were incorrect. First of all , the Aus1 tralian Atomic Energy Commission did not give any instructions in relation to a paper that was to be presented to this symposium, as has been mentioned by the honourable member. But it is a fact that a member of the Commission, Mr Davy, had been asked whether he would present a paper and he was proceeding to do so. This was delayed to some degree in view of the survey on the environment which is proceeding at the present time. The manuscript for this paper was read the day before the symposium was to commence. The basis of the manuscript was made public but it was indicated to the chairman of the symposium that the paper would not be available for presentation at that time. That was accepted and understood. The paper, when it is finally edited and completed, will be presented later this year. I would like to make clear the second its rights to refuse to accept the grants! point that was referred to and which was brought out in the Press reports, that is, that this particular paper was to refer to the establishment of the nuclear power station at Jervis Bay.

As Commonwealth assistance to the independent schools is channelled through State instrumentalities, will the Minister assure the House that any action by a State Labor government to prevent Commonwealth assistance from reaching these schools will not be tolerated? Mr N. H. BOWEN-The honourable member will know the aid that is given to independent schools is by way of grants under section 96 of the Constitution and these grants are given by the Commonwealth to State governments upon condition that they apply them towards the schools in the way mentioned. At present the various State governments are accepting the grants on these conditions but if the Victorian people elected a government which had the policy reported as being that of the State executive of the Australian Labor Party against State aid it would be within to the Postmaster-General.

Affairs aware of a broadcast made last night over certain commercial broadcasting stations by a Mr Frank Chamberlain in which he inferred that the United States action in respect of Cambodia was no different from the Soviet Union's actions in regard to Czechoslovakia last year? For the sake of clarity to the public will the Minister advise, firstly: Was not Cambodia occupied by North Vietnam and Vietcong units which were advancing on the national capital before any United States intervention? Secondly, if Mr Chamberlain is correct will the Minister advise what foreign question that I am asked is obviously that country was occupying or threatening Czechoslovakia before the Soviet intervention? nor had 1 been informed of the statement alleged to have been made by Mr ought properly to be taken up by Ministers. Chamberlain. But if it is true then neither hisfacts nor his analogies are correct. In the first place, Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Soviet and other Warsaw Pact countries. It was a violation of Czechoslovakian independence, and the subsequent effects were that the liberal regime-the Dubcek Smrkovsky regime-wa s in fact replaced, Dubcek was sent out of tbe country, all liberal reform ceased and Neohighly unlikely that that kind of shareStalinism was once again resumed in that country. On the contrary in the case of Cambodia there had been a violation of the Cambodian territory by the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. The United States-South Vietnamese action is designed with 1 purpose and that is to protect the lives of free allied forces, because unless those sanctuaries in Cambodia are cleaned out they will in fact be used by the Cambodians as a sanctuary and consequently places where they can go and remain free from attack. So, Sir, the analogy is totally wrong. The invasion in both of these cases is by Communist forces and they are the ones, Sir, who are guilty of aggression. May I correct one word? I said Cambodians. I should have said North Vietnamese-Vietcong the last 5 years. from the fact that it is invasion. Prime Minister. To what extent are stocks and shares being offered to Government Ministers? Secondly, why does the Prime Minister think that these advantages are being offered? Thirdly, does he think that Ministers can maintain a position of independence if they own an equity in any private concern which does business with government? I do not know.

I w'll make some inquiries about of Cambodia. That is clear. But North Vietnam never abided by the provisions of those Agreements and in fact, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, a little more than 5 years ago the North Vietnamese Vietcong attacked and violated tbe territorial integrity of Cambodia. As for the last part of the honourable gentleman's question relating to Sihanoukville and the supply routes to III and IV Corps areas of South Vietnam, the fact is that well over 85% of the total supplies reaching III and IV Corps areas go through Sihanoukville. This is a privilege that could not be given under any kind of international law or international understanding. Tliis is another indication of the fact that the invading forces in South Vietnam-the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong-were being supplied through this channel.

MrN . H. BOWEN-The advice of rhe Australian Universities Commission is sought in connection with the establishment of new universities.

Efforts are being made not only in those 2 countries but elsewhere to achieve this objecexplicitly formulated by a leading member tive. So far there has been no success. In the Government's view reconvening of the Commission would be wise. I think it can be taken for granted that it is 1 of the 3 objectives for which we will press at the Djakarta conference. These objectives are, firstly, to establish the fact that we do not believe in interference in the affairs of other nations; secondly, that we believe in the right of each country to determine its own future; and thirdly, that we hope to achieve the reconvening of the International Control Commission or, if that is not possible, something equivalent to it. the Prime Minister.

WiU he consider the urgent need for relief of the lower and middle income earners who progressively had been inflated into the middle and upper income tax scales? obvious that the Government has considered the need for relief in the lower and middle income tax scales since that consideration led to its announcement about what it would be seeking to do over its term of office, that is, to ameliorate the burden on the very people about whom the honourable member has spoken.

In the substance of his question the honourable gentleman asks about the application of the Brezhnev doctrine. I have not heard the speech made by the honourable member for Lalor but I have been made aware of the contents of that speech. He in effect said that he agreed with the statement made by Senator Fulbright that the North Vietnamese had the right to secure friendly governments in neighbouring countries. He went on to explain that he meant by 'neighbouring countries' Laos and Cambodia. Prompted by somebody in the background he then included Thailand in the description of the countries that he felt could be occupied by the North Vietnamese without violating international rights in any way. This to me is a pecular doctrine. It claims that because you happen to be a North Vietnamese and therefore from a Communist country you have the right to violate the territorial integrity of other countries. This is something that no-one on this side of the House believes and we will see from the Opposition whether all honourable members on the other side of the House agree with the honourable member for Lalor.

That would bring total Commonwealth drought relief assistance to Queensland since 1965-66 to over $32m. Honourable members will also know that the Premier of Queensland recently proposed certain modifications of existing relief measures. Following Cabinet consideration of the Premier's proposals, I have now informed the Premier that the Commonwealth is prepared to reimburse the State for carry-on and re-stocking loans made to graziers to enable Queensland to extend the existing limits on those loans. The Commonwealth has always adopted a flexible attitude to the limits of drought loans. Our main concern has been that normal commercial sources of finance should first be exhausted and that in making a loan the State authorities should satisfy themselves lhat the applicant has a reasonable chance of recovery. It will be for the State to determine the new limits, and the rate of monthly payments of loans, in the light of the circumstances of individual graziers. I have also informed the Premier that the Commonwealth is agreeable to his proposal for graziers who have received drought relief carry-on or re-stocking loans under the 1969 drought relief arrangements to have their loans, including any unpaid sums under the earlier 1965 arrangements, consolidated as at 30th June 1970. I understand that the State's objective is to give further relief to graziers by extending the period during which interest will be capitalised and no redemption payments will be required. The Commonwealth has also agreed that however, that this is rather a belated rebates on the transport of stock for redecision after the very many forceful restocking purposes, which at present apply quests that have been made since the end of only to breeding stock, should be extended last year. A point which I should like to to cover all stock transported for re-stockmake to the Prime Minister is that whoever ing up to a property's normal capacitywhether this involves stock purchased or loose way because it is most ambiguous in stock returning from agistment-provide d the sense that it is difficult to understand that the stock are held for a minimum from it just who is a grazier and who is a period on the grazier's property before farmer. being eligible for rebate. In addition, because of the widespread effects of the drought on Queensland pastoral areas and the fact Grain Growers Association of Queensland. that New South Wales could be a major It is signed by Mr Price, a man who is well source of stock for re-stocking when the respected in grain growing circles. It asks drought is over, the Commonwealth has indicated its willingness to reimburse the Queensland Government for expenditure on freight rebates on stock purchases in New South Wales for re-stocking and on returning from agistment in that State. The existing measures provide for additional carry-on loans to assist droughtaffected graziers with the payment of crown rentals and local authority rates in 196970. We have now agreed to further assistance in this regard in the form of grants to the State to enable it to meet half the cost of rates payable in 1970 by graziers who have experienced drought for more than 2 years in the 2 droughts of 1965-67 and 1969-70 and who are demonstrably in need of such assistance. Even before allowing for the additional cost in 1969-70 of the agreed extensions to drought relief measures to which I have referred, the Commonwealth contribution towards drought relief measures in Queensland this year would be easily the largest amount ever provided to any State for drought relief in a single year. The Government believes that the additional measures which I have now announced will make a further substantial contribution to the relief of those farmers and graziers in Queensland who continue to be affected by drought. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson)-by leaveThe substance of the statement by . the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) is, of course, welcomed by the Queensland Government but more so by the graziers and farmers in the drought stricken areas of western and south western Queensland. One must say, wrote his statement has written it in a very I have received a telegram from the for assistance by way of further drought relief for Queensland grain growers. It reads as follows: Association alarmed State Premier's statement no reasonable chance of recovery. <Nobody can further drought relief to Queensland grain growers contrary Department of Primary Industry report crop prospects grim certain areas. Continuous drought still exists much south eastern, western and northern grain belt. Appreciate your immediate sympathetic consideration. I want to ask the Prime Minister whether this relief will cover wheat farmers also because it is not clear from this statement. The only time he mentioned farmers was in the last sentence. Will this cover wheat farmers, or is it confined to only sheep and cattle people in, say, the south-west corner or other drought areas of Queensland? There are farming areas in western Queensland that are just as seriously hit by the drought as some of the grazing areas in the far west of Queensland. I refer particularly to some of the wheat farms. Therefore it is important to know whether this decision will also cover wheat farmers. It has not been made clear in the statement. This information cannot be gathered from the statement. I assume that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr how this interest is to be capitalised and McEwen) or someone else to follow will make it quite clear. There are plenty of people other than those on sheep and cattle properties who are seriously affected by drought in various parts of Queensland. I said before-and I repeat it because the Prime Minister might not have heard methere is ambiguity in this statement in relation to some points. No details have been given. 1 refer, for example, to the statement that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to reimburse the State for carry on and re-stocking loans. What terms and conditions are to apply here? If the State is lending money to graziers and farmers under certain conditions, does this mean that the Commonwealth is also lending to Queensland, or is it making an interest free loan or making a grant? Mr GortonA Commonwealth loan for drought relief is always interest free. grants, too. That is only one point. I am pointed out during the debate on estate mentioning the points that are raised with duties that people from the cities are coming members of Parliament representing areas into the country to invest money and to affected by drought. We have raised this buy properties. They are causing the value point in the Parliament because we want of properties to increase. This is reflected to know what the statement means. I defy in the local valuations for shires. Wool anybody to explain the statement that in making a loan the State authorities sbould satisfy themselves that the applicant has a forecast how long adrought will last in some of these areas. It has been going on with intensity for 3 or 4 years in some areas. No-one can make a decision on whether a person will recover or not.' I hope this is not taken as literally as it is expressed here because it is essential that some of these graziers and farmers get assistance immediately without being subject to too stringent an examination to seewhether they will recover or not. Some of them are past recovery. If some of these carry on iosrns had been made available more liberally last year, for example, a lot of them would not have been past the point pf no recovery at the present time. I find it hard to understand why the Prime Minister should say that he understands the State's objective. The Commonwealth Government should know what the State's objective is. ,Never mind about understanding it. That leaves an element of doubt. It is essential that it. be made clear how redemption payments are to be made. It is quite possible that the Commonwealth does not understand because it has been difficult for graziers and others interested in this problem to understand what the State Government means in this respect. I would like to commend the Government on liberalising the re-stocking provisions with respect to stores, because it is quite clear that some graziers in the fattening areas of the south-west channel country, where store cattle are the main source pf livelihood, because of the integration of breeding properties, are not going to restock with breeding cattle. When the channels flood they will stock quickly with store cattle to make maximum utilisation of existing herbages such as parakeila and others. These are points that I believe should be clarified. Something should have been done about rates years ago. In practically every area of Queensland they have been progressively",23,Cambodia
44,Dr Patterson,"There are some increasing, despite the drought. It wasprices, for example, have been going down or have remained static and property values are decreasing at an alarming rate in drought areas of western Queensland. It is essential that some other revaluation proQueensland Graingrowers Drought Comcess be used and during the drought period there should be a complete alleviation from rates which have reached almost saturation point on some small properties. I also ask the Prime Minister to say when he will allow a debate on the amendments to the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act to take place. This is of concern to the graziers. This amendment will allow surplus wheat to be sold for stock feed at reduced prices. It is a fact that this can happen now because complementary legislation has been passed in most States. Nevertheless, it is time that this amending Bill was debated in the Parliament because it is essential to extend the supply of fodder and surplus grains to drought stricken areas. The Opposition believes that the amount of $1.45 is far too high for surplus grain that cannot be sold. This is another problem. They are the main points 1 would like to make. Wheat farmers are in the grip of the drought just as much as graziers are. In addition, the proposal should be retrospective. With regard to the transport of stock, it is important to know whether the scheme will apply to those farmers and graziers who have already restocked with store cattle, not breeding stock. It would be quite wrong for the Government suddenly to introduce legislation or a regulation or whatever is needed covering restocking in the future when in the last 6 months a lot of restocking has been taking place with other than breeding stock. Surely these people should be covered by the retrospective operation of the scheme. Those are the points that I would like to make.' On the whole, as I said before, the measures that are taken by the Governthis scheme is effective only for drought stricken producers, but it is rather belated. -First of all, I would like to say that this announcement by the Prime Minister( Mr down here and received a herring from the Gorton) is particularly timely. Only today the Premier of Queensland, his Minister for Lands and Mr Peter Bell, President of the United Graziers Association, leave on a trip to visit the drought afflicted areas of the outback. It is further most timely because only last night the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett), the right honourable member for Fisher( Mr Adermann), Senator Lawrie, Senator Maunsell and myself met for a top level conference with the President of the mittee, Mr Don Eather, and the Secretary, Mr Don McKechnie, to discuss their problems and to bring them into the orbit of consideration for drought relief. I would submit that this was a constructive move. As a result of that conference further submissions will be made to the Federal Government. Let me in retrospect outline the work that has been done in Government circles in relation to this drought situation. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) quite recently visited the grain growers and small farmers at Mundubbera in the Burnett Valley in the latter part of last year. He addressed them and heard them state their problems. That evening he flew across to Emerald and again met a large gathering of farmers, wheat growers and grain growers generally, and heard their problems. This has been taken into consideration. In reply to the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) let me stress this point: Over the last few years we have been out in the field looking into the problems of these areas constantly. I have been accompanied by no less distinguished persons than the right honourable member for Fisher, the honourable member for Maranoa, Senator Maunsell and Senator Lawrie. We have been constantly working through these areas, collecting information and putting it before the Government. Let me get down to the facts. We get a little tired of hearing these grand speeches from the Opposition presenting nebulous solutions to these problems while we are the actual storm troopers casting the blows to secure ment for the people who are affected. It all began in the latter part of last year when the most distinguished men in the industry, whom I will name shortly, came Treasurer ( Mr Bury). These men included the President of the UGA-thi s is on the grazing side, I will admit-Councillo r Behan, whose names are bywords and traditional in Queensland and who have proven their worth, Johnny Henssler, the current President of fhe Central and Northern Graziers Association, and Fred",25,Cambodia
45,Mr Katter (Kennedy),"by leaveTritton, who is the best known identity in northern Australia for his contribution to primary industry, to the grazing industry and, I might mention, to the grain growing industry. They then went into conference with the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr ments. This is all part of the general situaMcEwen) and the Minister for Primary Industry. This led to a further conference with the Premier of Queensland. This is the action that has been taken. These are not theories or grand speeches. These men were not seeking headlines because of attacks on the Government all the time. This was solid hard work going on behind the scene. The conference was held in Brisbane in November. Subsequently there was another top level conference in Southport. No less a person than the Deputy Prime Minister flew to Queensland for that conference. All these identities were there. Out of all this activity has come the announcement which was made today. Admittedly we would all have liked these submissions to have been made earlier. We would have liked the announcement to have been made earlier. Of course, we would like to see the wheels of government turn far more quickly, but at least we have got somewhere today. I would now like to deal with the grain growers. About3 weeks ago while Senator Lawrie and I were in Emerald we were approached by the field officer of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr drought committee, and their Secretary, Mr George Crawford. He said: ' I think it is time that you people who have been working io secure additional drought relief for the grazing industry Leave was given to debate this statement, not the drought. make a statement in relation tn the drought relief announced by the Prime Minister and that is what the honourable member is doing. The honourable member for Dawson also covered a good deal of ground which was not contained in the statement. I believe it is relevant to the statement made. debate on it. ber for Dawson also covered a fairly wide range of subjects which were not included in the statement but which did have something to do with drought relief. pose in all of this. There are two Senate candidates hopping through my territory like kangaroos with ants in their pants, and they are going about making wild statetion. Let me return to the situation in Emerald. We were approached by the field officer of the Queensland Graingrowers Association. He felt that the same level of discussion and consideration should take place in regard to the problems of grain growers. Their position is deteriorating. The grain growers frankly admitted last night that they have not reached the crisis stage that the grazing industry has. Nevertheless, their situation is deteriorating to the point where it could well fall to this level. Let me point out now while I have this opportunity that many of the grain growers in my State, and particularly in my electorate, have had -3 successive crop failures. They are reaching the point where they are in real trouble. We immediately said: 'Let's get together', f then convened a meeting of the Country Party drought committee and every member to a man was present last night. This was on May Day when we workers should normally be relaxing. We met in Brisbane. We had a top level discussion, and the grain growers sent their two top executive members-thei r senior State Vice President, Mr Don Eather, who is also President of their Don McKechnie. 1 think the grain growers are pretty well satisfied with what has taken place. They appreciate that while political propaganda is belching forth from the other side of the House we are actually there fighting their cause. We have been briefed by them and the guide lines and submissions which we will support come from them. SoI feel absolutely confident that the grain growers, the reasonable thinking men who are not intent on making political propaganda out of almost everything that occurs, will agree that their affairs are being handled to their very best advantage. wish to say a few words in reference to the important matter under discussion. Every honourable member agrees that in time of drought relief, measures are necessary. As the honourable: member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) and the honourable",26,Cambodia

I am concerned about the attitude of members of the Australian Country Party and in particular of the honourable member for Kennedy in reference lo measures of this kind. Their attack seems to be centred not so much on the matter under consideration; rather do they take the opportunity to launch an attack on the Opposition, particularly the honourable member for Dawson who consistently pressed for measures of this nature able member for Kennedy and others who long before members of the Country Party woke up. The honourable member for Kennedy gave us a resume and repeated 3 or 4 times the names of every member of the Country Party who had belatedly and at the point of the gun, as it were, met representatives of rural interests on the important measure that we are debating today. The honourable member for Kennedy has a peculiar arrangement. He consistently attacks the Government outside the House for not bringing in measures of this kind to assist rural industry in times of drought and distress. He continually attacks the Governword of the country people. They have ment for its failure to face up to its responsibilities. Then he gives copies of his farmers who are marching from Perth to speech to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Press in his electorate and gives everybody the impression, quite falsely, that he. is a great militant and a great sponsor for rural and drought relief and things of that nature. But not once in this Parliament has the honourable member for Kennedy proposed a motion in support of the measures that he says are necessary and about which he speaks so much outside the Parliament. The honourable member should give expression to his sympathies and, if there is substance in his views and if he is sincere in them, he should move a resolution against this incompetent Government for its failure to assist the primary producers at this time of great stress. The honourable member would be surprised to find how many members on this side of the Parliament would join him for once in giving expression to measures which would bring support to the primary producers. I welcome this measure today. The may criticise it as much as they like outside Country Party has nothing to be proud of the Parliament. Anything may happen to in giving support to measures of this kind the primary producing interests outside, as only at the very last moment and in the long as in this Parliament the Country most essential of circumstances. Honourable this. Nine hundred members of the Country Party at a conference in Warrnambool a few days agoI suppose 900 would be the whole party in Victoria-sai d that the front line troops in the Parliament were not carrying out their responsibilities to the primary producers of this country. They likened these men to front line troops. I think they are more like McHale's Navy. The Country Party, particularly the honourrepresent huge drought stricken areas, have let the primary producers down. They have not faced up to their responsibilities. One cannot blame them in a way. When all is said and done half the Government is not interested in the primary producers. Very few primary producers are represented by the Liberal Party in the Parliament. It is nice to see the Country Party, which does not take the initiative, compliment a Liberal Prime Minister upon doing something for the primary producers that its Ministers and others have not done. As I said, honourable members do not have to take my word for this. Let them take the awakened to the fact.

Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) mental principle of making it more expenadjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 April (vide page latest estimate is nearly 69% greater than 1050), on motion by Dr Forbes: That the Bill be now read a second time. That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'Whilst not opposing the Bill because it represents some improvement this House is of opinion that a National Health Insurance Commission financed from graduated contributions would pay for medical and hospital services for all more equitably and economically'. If nothing else has been established by the manner in which the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) has handled his portfolio so far at least 2 points become irrebuttably identified. First, he has a poor and unreliable grasp of it and secondly his credibility with the medical profession rates deplorably badly. Can the nation have faith and trust in a man who, until his Party's traumatic experiences at the last election, (Wentworth-Treasurer ) asserted frequently, loudly and overbearingly the unqualified virtues of the Government's so called voluntary health insurance scheme? Indeed, can there be confrank admission of the considerable and .. 191,237,000 grave failings of the scheme and contra. . 20,000,000 earlier claims. In the past he was quick to defend pripromise of his Party-refor m of the health insurance scheme-base d on the fundasive for those able to remain within its framework as contributors, and then after the election blandly admitting his costing of the alterations was. a mere $16.5m understated? To put it another way, the his original quote. This is a rather masterly, albeit scarcely commendable, confidence trick on the paying Australian public. The Minister's statement in March and his second reading speech on this Bill are public admissions of the Government's humiliation on health insurance policy. Clearly, its radically altered tack on this issue of policy is convincing evidence that it interprets the 1969 election results as a stunning vote of censure against it by the Australian public. In June 1968 the Minister airily stated as a virtue of his Government's scheme: the danger is not so much that people may be excluded from the best treatment or care for financial reasons, but that thcy' may suffer neg'cct through failure to use agencies which are available.

It was scarcely an ago: Injustice arises when equals are treated said in the House earlier does not tell us unequally and also when unequals are treated how he intends to ensure that the benefits of equally. Again, there has been a no more ungeneral practitioners. His statement refers seemly display of public ineptitude than the to adherence to the common fee as a factor running brawl the Minister has provoked vital to the success of the new health benewith the medical practitioners.

He states in the particular section the Minister is the man who has forever in which we are interested that because of been implying that he had the doctors tied the assurance of the profession that it will up, but he is the man who has been quite adhere to the common fee he will not severely rebuffed by the doctors.

Finally the Minister said: what the practice will in fact be. I now want to quote from the publication, This is scarcely an answer to any of the The Australian GP', which is the organ of points I raised with the Minister, that the the General Practitioners Society in AusGeneral Practitioners Association is clearly tralia. The April 1970 issue of this publicaunder the apprehension that the common tion at page 6 makes an interesting statement. This quote is in relation to Sir William Refshauge.

After all, what he the common fee will, be provided by The Government will constantly review cooperation by the profession. fee will not be enforced and that doctors will be free to operate quite flexibly within the arrangements of the medical insurance scheme. If this is in tact true the promises of the Government and its dogmatic assurances to the general public, as distinct from undertakings by the Minister for Health to the general practitioners, mean completely different things. Remember that about 1,000 members of the General. Practitioners Association have claimed that they will not operate on the common fee basis. If the Association is correct many people resorting to general practitioners will obtain limited benefits from the medical insurance scheme and the grave problems which these amendments to the legislation were supposed to overcome will persist. It seems that the Minister works according to an amazingly high factor for obfuscation. The Bill does not deal with the Minister's promise, made somewhat earlier in the session, that a health insurance commission would be set up. Nor does it include any proposal for the deduction from wages by employers of employees' contributions on a voluntary basis. The proposed amendments to the Act fail dismally here and one is justified in asking why these matters have received no attention in the Bill notwithstanding that in March this year the Minister claimed quite definitely that they would be the key points in the legislation. Let me move on. to the legislation itself -to the issues implicit in the amendment: How will costs. be kept down h health insurance in Australia? This is the key to the problems that have bedevilled the scheme to date. So far the Government has failed to hold costs within a reasonable area. By the very nature of health services costs will increase at a faster rate than comparable costs for other services in the community. To a large extent this is unavoidable because of the complex and extremely expensive nature of researchof improved treatment in health servicesbut this is no justification for allowing comproposals fail to provide any relief for long pletely unfettered increases to occur. It is rather a stimulus for a responsible body, such as a government, to take steps to try to restrain those cost increases which must be borne by the general public, essentially by the hapless contributor to the scheme and by the unfortunate Australian taxpayer. From all the evidence one can gain by international comparisons, voluntary health insurance schemes are inherently inflationary and the inflation occurs at a much faster rate than is the case where universal schemes operate. The experience is that universal schemes hold down the rate of increase much more successfully than do voluntary health insurance schemes. I will give some examples, comparing 1967 with 1948. As a percentage of the gross national product the cost of health services in the United Kingdom in 1948 was 3.54%. In 1967 the cost had increased to 4.18%. In the United States in the same period the cost increased from 3.3% of the gross national product to 5.26% of the gross national product. In terms of gross national product this was an increase of 59% compared with an increase in the United Kingdom of only 18%. What must be remembered in all this is that Great Brita'n not only has been more successful than the United States in holding down the rate of increase in the cost of health services but also gives a comprehensive cover to all members of the community. In the United States 24 million people have no insurance at all. About 61 million people have no insurance for in-hospital medical expenses. About 102 million people have no insurance for doctors' surgery visits. So one can readily comprehend the comparative advantages favouring a universal system of health insurance. Because of the many similarities in the American approach and the Australian approach it is instructive to note that the American system is collapsing. Its failure, like that of the Australian scheme, is due to the fact that many people find it so costly to be a member of the scheme. Not only the poor people must worry in this regard but many others as well. The proposals now before us will do only a moderate amount to modify this cause for concern, particularly if the assertions of the General Practitioners Association are correct. Certainly on their face value the current term non-medical hospitalisation. This surely is a serious deficiency. Let me compare the American scheme with ours because it will be seen that the American scheme, which is based on voluntary health insurance, is collapsing. It will also be seen, on the evidence that one can easily obtain, that this is freely admitted by responsible authorities in the United States. After1 have done this I will move on to a comparison of the Labor Party's proposals for universal health insurance and the Canadian scheme, thus upholding my argument that universal health insurance is more successful in containing cost increases than is a so-called voluntary health insurance scheme based on a multiplication of competing insurance organisations, each involving unnecessary cost which is a dead loss to the contributor and to the scheme, ln America the former Secretary of Housing, Education and Welfare and now head of the Urban Coalition, John W. Gardner, has bluntly stated that the present system of medical care delivery is outworn, expensive and outrageously inefficient. In an article headed 'The $60 Billion Crisis over Medical Care' the reputable United States magazine 'Business Week' in January this year stated: The clamour for some kind of national health plan is already drowning out the shouts agai'nst Socialism and it has been heard on Capitol Hill. Perhaps as early as 1971 Congress will start formulating a national health care programme. The reason for this is that the American Governmenta businessmen's government generally advised by successful businessmen, unlike the government of Australia, which is staffed by failed businessmen-ha s recognised that voluntary insurance is bedevilled by chronic problems of sky rocketing medical costs and a failure to deliver the goods to the paying public. In America the national health bill per capita has increased by $293-mor e than twice the level of a decade ago-and is still climbing at a breathtaking rate. I suggest to honourable members that ance or even of hospital insurance we are there is a clear similarity to the position only skirmishing around the periphery of a in Australia. Since 1966 the cost of health very big problem which involves an in the United States has been ris'ng at an approach towards community health services average of 7% per annum, which is well based on an integrated arrangement of those above the rate of increase in other conservices focused on regionalised public sumer prices. The more one analyses the hospitals. situation in the United States the more one observes this similarity-the collapse of the American scheme and the imminent collapse the United States where the Committee for of the Australian scheme. All that the National Health Insurance has recommended Government is propos'ng in this legislation universal cover in health insurance and a only temporarily defers the date of crucial regionalisation of services based on a fund decision when it must confront the problem to which contributions would come from the of what is to be the alternative scheme for employer, the employee and the Federal the Australian public. In his publication 'Economic Policy in Australia', Mr B. McFarlane points out in a table that in 1959-60 the per head cost of health was $58 and in 1965-66 it had increased to $90-a n increase of 55% in 7 years. Over the same period Commonwealtb hospital benefits have been held static at $2 a day. This represents quite an unreasonable approach by the Government. The interpretation of this, of course, is that an increasing burden is cast on the shoulders of the State governments. From memory, deficits of the various public hospital authorities in Australia amount to $l55m, according to the latest information received in reply to a question appearing in the debate reports. Much of that sum has to be taken up by the State governments. In 1966 over $6m was written off as bad debt by the public hospitals in Australia. In the meantime the Government holds $2 a day the rigid level of hospital bed benefit struck in 1963, in spite of a. confrontation by spiralling prices. In the past 18 years the cost of running public hospitals and nursing' homes in Australia has increased more than 8-fold while the number of patients has merely doubled. This evidence can be looked at in 2 ways. Firstly, one gains an appreciation of how significandy rapid is the rate of increase in the cost of maintaining health services. At the same time one also gains an appreciation of how reluctant the Federal Government is to react responsibly in the face of this sort of challenge. It is patently obvious to anyone that the States are incapable of meeting all the demands made on their limited resources. Certainly this is true in the field of health services. Accordingly, when we speak, as we do. of medical insurPerhapsI ought to revert to the case of Government. The significance of this, firstly, is that it is very similar to what the Australian Labor Party is proposing; secondly, it has been suggested in the United States, the country of free enterprise. It is amazing then that we find the conservative Government of Australia appalled at any suggestion that we ought to introduce universal health insurance to the community. As Dr Salkind, former Secretary of the British General Practitioners Association, has stated: 'We must have national health. Private health is just too expensive.' This is the experience today in the United States, and he was commenting on that situation when he made that statement. It is the experience in Australia today. In 1967, the year referred to in the latest figures I could obtain, we spent 5.5% of the gross national product on health services and the United Kingdom spent 4.18%. Yet the United Kingdom provided considerably more than is available under the Australian scheme. The latest national opinion polls show that in Great Britain 78% of the public is well satisfied with the national health system. In contrast, in Australia the polls in January this year showed that only 38% of the Australian public was satisfied with the scheme as it currently operates. In interpreting statements made from more expensive to the public. The real time to time in this House by the Minister cost must be measured in terms of an for Health in reply to questions, it would extra $29.5m in Commonwealth benefits seem that either the Australian system is and an extra S24m in contributions from twice as deficient as the British system or the members of the scheme. To that total that it is only half as satisfactory as the Briof $58m we must add the subsidy of $llm tish system. In any event his assertions have for low income earners, which is $3m higher been that the scheme in Great Britain is than the Government originally proposed. gravely deficient and is causing wide spread We find that the extra amount involved is dissatisfaction. You know, if 78% of the S65m. That is the magnitude of increased public is satisfied, then that is not too bad. cost which must be borne by the unforThat is about twice as much satisfaction as tunate contributor and taxpayer in Australia the current Australian scheme is able to to resuscitate temporarily a flagging medical provide. But in any case, on the basis of the Minister's claims and the gallup poll findings, it is quite apparent that if the Minister is consistent he will admit that the Australian scheme is twice as bad as the British scheme. Senate election is safely out of the way, will I want to make it quite clear at this point tain steps somehow to resuscitate hospital that the British scheme is not related to the insurance in Australia. But where does this Australian Labor Party's scheme, contrary all end? How much longer will it continue? to the windmil'l which the Minister for Will it be a matter of substantially increased Health likes to joust out from time to time. costs for the community every 2 or 3 years? The Labor Party's scheme is based on a Confused explanations have come from the H % levy on taxable income. The British Minister as to how the scheme will operate. scheme is based on a system of poll tax; I hark back to the cla m of the General regardless of income level, one pays a fixed amount. Again, the Labor Party's scheme is based on a concept of fee for service from general practitioners in private practice; the British scheme is based on a per capita remuneration. Again, the Labor Party's scheme in no way interferes with the rights of the private practitioner or of the patient. These are things which will continue in the way they have continued up to the present time. Our scheme merely is concerned with ths funding of health insurance in Australia to make sure that adequate money is available in this important area. As Dr Salkind indicated: Private insurance is too expensive. Clearly it is a case of public responsibility to ensure that adequate health cover is available for the public. It seems that not only the Minister for Health is intent on misrepresenting the proposals of the Australian Labor Party. I noticed that he has been joined by Sir Clarence Rieger. It seems that Sir Clarence Rieger is playing a rather droll Cervantes to the rather dull Don Quixote of the Minister for Health. Let us look at the cost of the scheme so far. This is the crux of the whole issue before the nation. The Government's proposal aims at making the health service and health insurance scheme. But that is only the first episode of the serial. The next episode, no doubt after the come when the Government proposes cer; Practitioners Association that it had an assurance from the Director-General of Health in Australia speaking on behalf of the Government. It clearly conflicts with undertakings given by both the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister to the Australian public. If the association is correct, this takes us back to square one in this unhappy game of trying to keep the health insurance system operating. The Minister for Health groans. I wish he had given a similar groan when he sent to me the letter I referred to earlier. It would have been a simple matter for him to have said in his letter: 'These allegations are completely untrue and we intend to take steps which will ensure that the common fee is upheld by all general! practitioners or else certain things will be done'. I do not know what the certain things would be, but so far the Minister has tried to be evasive on this issue. I refer to the proposed increased costs. absence of consideration of what the scheme This is a surprising proposition from the means to patients. We are concerned with Government in the face of the recommenboth patients and doctors. Our scheme, dations in the Nimmo report. The Nimmo means better remuneration with both report said clearly: Health insurance contributions are already as high justified on the experience of Canada from as most people are prepared to pay.

Again the Gomedicare commissioner, Doctor Samuel vernment has not faced up to the challenge Wolfe, pointed out that there was only a of the Nimmo Committee to introduce very slight increase in the demand for docregionalisation in the operation of the tors' services as a result of the introduction scheme. The Committee reported: In our view only one open fund should be perclaims of the Minister for Health and bis mitted to establish facilities for the enrolment of unthinking supporters on . the Government members and collection of contributions in any side who like to echo the thoughtless words one region. The reasons for this are obvious. It avoids scheme. Our proposals would not involve a unnecessary complications, duplication, rapid increase in demand for doctors' seroverlapping of services, competitiveness and vices. The experience of Canada establishes so on-the elements that are the very this point. The limited increase in demand essence of the scheme operated by the Government. What the Nimmo Committee was trying to get at was that if we regionalise the activities of the open funds to some extent we can eliminate some of the unnecessary cost factor and contain costs which are the bugbear of health services in tbe community. 1 said our scheme was based on a l i % levy on taxable income. For something like 80% of taxpayers in Australia this will mean cheaper contributions than they are currently paying. For the majority of contributors it will mean a net payment considerably less than the Government scheme will provide even allowing' for the benefits of its regressive tax deduction system. I would like to revert to the case of medical practitioners because the approach of the Government has been exclusively directed to what the scheme means to doctors and has been remarkable forits almost total patients and doctors. This is quite clearly which we have derived a fair bit of our MacLeans Journal of 18th September of tbe scheme. This again is a reply to the the Minister uses as criticism of our there seems clearly to have. been , a justified increase arising from people having a need fulfilled which in the past they have been unable to satisfy because they could not afford health protection. Looking at the extravagant costliness of the Australian scheme from some aspects we find that the reserves in the medical funds for 1967-68 were $44m. They exceed 3 months' contributions by some $27m or nearly 5 months' contributions. The reserves in the hospital funds stood at $76m, nearly 10 months' contributions.. Using 1967 figures, the reserves in. the hospital funds equallea 8.31 million bed days on average costing based on thefiguresprovided in the evidence of the Department before the Senate Select Committee inquiring into this subject. In 1966 we had 6.3 approved hospital beds, private and public, per thousand of population, a total of 75,600 beds available in Australia. Yet the amount of money salted away in reserves would provide 110 bed claims for each bed available in Australia. Clearly the magnitude of reserves was not justified and one is left spellbound at the calm way in which the Government allows this sort of practice to continue. In the 10 years up to 1967 the administrative costs in medical funds were reduced by the not large amount of 1% and equalled 15.1% of contributions. Similarly the administrative costs in hospital funds were reduced by roughly 1% and now stand somewhere near 11% of contribution income. We should contrast this with the experience in the United States of America which has a similar voluntary health system. The authorities there say the scheme is collapsing because they cannot make it efficient enough. They have been able to achieve a retention ratio which is more than just administrative costs. It includes the amount of money diverted to reserves as well. In America the retention ratio in the Blue Cross Funds is 4% for hospital funds and 9.6% for medical funds. On American standards in 1967-68 the retention rate for hospital funds in Australia should have stood at $4.8m; in fact it was $21m. On the same standards for the same year the retention rate for medical funds should have been $ 11.3m; in fact it was $18m. These are tremendous increases over the levels which the United States of America was able to achieve with obvious greater efficiency in administration and operation of the scheme than we are able to achieve. In spite of this the Americans feel that the scheme ought to be scrapped because the successful businessmen advising their Government feel this is no economic way in which to operate the scheme. In fact, by failing to achieve this efficiency we paid S23m more than we should have. That is a lot of public money, a lot of dead money which is lost as a benefit to contributors to the scheme and a lot of dead money which has to be provided by taxpayers in Australia. Let me contrast the Australian scheme with the Canadian scheme. The Minister for Health, as is his wont because he works to a high misrepresentation factor on a lot of these issues when it suits him, said in the House of Representatives on 9th September when relating the Canadian scheme to the Australian Labor Party proposals: The Canadian medicare scheme has only just been accepted by the last of the Provinces, yet costs are getting so much out of hand that the Federal Government of Canada has announced that it will be abandoning the scheme in 5 years time. Almost immediately after the introduction of the scheme the Federal Government of Canada proposes to hand responsibility back to the Provinces because it sees this as the only way of containing costs under this system. This is demonstrably an untruth and either the Minister delivered this in the House wilfully or out of ignorance. In either case he is not flattered by his performance. I suspect, as is his wont when cornered, he has never hesitated to make his last ditch stand of prevarication. Because of what the Minister for Health said here, I wrote to the Canadian Minister for Health, Mr Munro, and he replied with some sense of passionate feeling as follows: It is completely unwarranted for anyone to allege that the federal government has been 'forced to relinquish administration of the scheme to the provinces because the scheme became unwieldy and expensive' when operated by the federal government. Because of the constitutional position, to which I have referred, the federal government has not been operating a medical care insurance plan as such or selling medical care insurance to individual Canadians. The same remarks apply to hospital insurance. The federal government could not 'relinquish administration' of something which is a provincial prerogative. Later he said: No-one disputes that the programme is costly but it is anticipated that the rate of escalation will be more controlled than it was in the days prior to the introduction of universal provincial medical care insurance plans. When universal hospital and medical care insurance plans are introduced the evidence is that total costs (public and private) generally increase at a lower rate than that experienced when private carriers insure only a portion of the population. That is the experience in Canada. The subscriber in Saskatchewan having had to pay experience in Canada under that universal much less in order to receive each dollar of scheme compared to that of the United benefits whether he was a member of an insurance States of America is further evidence for group my argument that universal schemes are industry could administer group medical care more successful in keeping down costs of insurance with comparatively low administrative health insurance. In 1958 the cost per hospital bed in the insurance, United States of America was SUS25 and and other business expenses in some cases such in Canada $Canl6. That was the year the as the need to make a profit and pay dividends. hospital insurance and diagnostic services programme commenced. In 1967 the figure had increased to $US59 in America and $Can42 in Canada. The differential increased from $9 to $17 in Canada's favour. I will quote the experience of Canada from an official document of the Canadian Government. That document states: Thus, during the past decade, despite the fact that the United States did not have a universal government-operated hospital insurance programme and there were and still are millions of Americans without any protection against hospitalisation costs, the costs per day of hospitalisation have risen by a substantially greater amount than in Canada and, in fact, the differentia] between the average costs of hospital care in the two countries has almost doubled. In the period 1963-66 in the province of Saskatchewan the per capita cost of physicians' services under the new arrangements for health and medical insurance 1 increased at an annual rate of just under 4.9%. This compares more than favourably with the increase for the remainder of Canada which, during this period, had not introduced this scheme. The rate of increase for the rest of Canada was 7.9% per annum. The Saskatchewan scheme involved an increase equal to only two-thirds of the increase incurred by the rest of the nation. All the people in Saskatchewan were covered by the scheme, but a limited number only were covered by the scheme that operated in the remainder of Canada. I like to quote from official documents from tbe Canadian Government because it saves the Minister for Health from making the error, as is his characteristic, of misunderstanding and therefore misreporting what the Canadian experience has been. In another official document the following appears: The experience of tbe commercial insurance industry and of the governmental plan in Saskatchewan clearly indicate the definite economies of scale and of uniformity of coverage, the or not. There is no reason to doubt, in theory at least, that the commercial insurance costs, but their costs inevitably have to be much higher to cover such factors as the cost of selling higher administrative costs resulting from the administration of a multiplicity of plans, Surely this is fairly much the experience in Australia and this is the problem which is bedevilling the scheme as it operates under the Government's principles at present. The other problems we are confronted with in Australia today are the problems which the Hall Commission, a royal commission on medical and health services in Canada, grappled with. That Commission indicated that private insurance carriers, for a number of various reasons, collected substantially more from their subscribers in the form of premiums than was required to pay the claims and administrative charges, due to such factors as sales commissions, pronts and accumulation of reserves. Surely to goodness we can learn from the experience of Canada. For goodness sake do not let the system again fall on its face. To suggest a universal scheme is to propose a fairly efficient scheme. Frankly, from a Socialist point of view-and I claim to be a democratic Socialist-ou r scheme is not a radical scheme. It is a concept for the funding of health protection in Australia and it is the sort of proposal which would be accepted by any reasonably minded and responsibly directed government. With universal health insurance we can get a better distribution of doctors because they know it will still pay them to go into the poorer areas. At present one cannot blame doctors. They are highly skilled people who must undertake lengthy study. They have higher skills than most other professional men, because they have to study for the longest period required of any professional person in the community. They are entitled to a fair return for the degree of skills they acquire. It is too much, under the Australian scheme which the conservative Government operates, to expect them to go into poorer areas and carry the cost and the risk burden of operating there. Under universal health insurance these risks are eliminated and adequate income is guaranteed. Health protection for all people in the community, regardless of means, is available. Under our scheme, as an extension of what we have in mind, we would seek to obtain a better distribution of the services of general practitioners by conscious policies of financial inducements to persuade doctors to practise in under-doctored areas. I should imagine that supporters of the Country Party would find some attraction in this proposal. Our scheme seeks to preserve the family doctor. We are not going to coerce and bully the doctors as the Government is doing at the present time. Our scheme would provide treatment according lo need and would not be inhibited by the cost factors preventing low income earners who, although they may be above the margin provided by the government subsidy, nevertheless find cost to be an inhibiting factor in obtaining health proteccare is beyond the reach of many tion. There would be no limitations on the right of patients to choose their doctors or on the right of doctors to choose their patients. We are not talking about state health. We are talking about a public responsibility to ensure that all people have adequate health protection. Finally, the low income subsidy has failed expenditure on health must rema n in balto differentiate between people with a large number of dependants and those with few or none within any given income band proposed to be covered by the amendments. I regret that I cannot deal with this any further, nor can 1 deal with what I feel is the real central issue-the real challenge before Australia today-that is, the total supply of have to be corrected; but basically the plan health services. What are we to do about hospitals? What are we to do about the provision of community health services? Are we concerned about the lack of planning over the next 10 years, not the next 10 months? Our planners are scarcely prepared to lift fheir heads above this sort of limited objecnot primarily for themselves but for the tive because they have insufficient nnances for that period. We need a foundation to foster investment in research ancl development of health services. Australia provides only $50,000 a year for this purpose, but the United Kingdom provides $9m and the United States of America S40m. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded? Dr KlugmanI second the amendment and reserve the right to speak later. care of a developing commun'ty such as ours is one of the most important and, at the same time, one of thc most difficult tasks of government. In this debate we are considering only I aspect of a complex problem. Other aspects, such as hospital facilities and care of pensioners and the aged, will, I presume, be considered in later debates. In considering a health plan one has to steer a course between 2 dangers. One can see the perils of an over-regimented medical system such as in England, which aims at equality but only achieves inefficiency. On the other hand one can see the danger of a system such as that in America where medical resources are allocated mainly on Ihe ability to pay and proper medical people. We must avoid both these extremes. There are certain principles which ] believe we must follow. The first is that no-one must be denied reasonable med'cal care because of his financial status. The second is that there must be a reasonable freedom of choice for both the patient and the medical practitioner. The third principle is that the national ance with our expenditure in other areas such as education, national development and social welfare. This new health benefits plan has had some vicissitudes and there are still some anomalies in the proposed fees which will is sound. In this country, where we are endeavouring to achieve an efficient voluntary health scheme the co-operation of many parties is required. The medical profession, the insurance firms and the Government should all aim at achieving the best results, community as a whole. If this co-operation can be maintained a voluntary health scheme will work belter for the community than any compulsory socialistic scheme, but if this",31,National Health Bill 1970

62,Mr Hamer (Isaacs) [4.19],"The healthco-operation falters there will be pressures from the community for a system of nationalised medicine, and this would be a disastrous step for the health care of the community. Many members of the medical profession seem to think that the Constitution is an effective bar to the nationalisation of medicine as in England, but there are at least 2 ways in which the Constitution can be circumvented by a Socialist government determined on nationalisation. The most obvious of these would be a participating doctors scheme under which medical benefits would be payable only to patients whose doctors practised in a manner and at fees fixed by the government. To avoid the muddle and inefiiciency of nationalised health services we must all work together to sustain and improve the voluntary scheme, of which this new health benefits plan is a vital component. The first principle of the voluntary health scheme is that no-One shall be denied reasonable medical care because of his financial status. The differential rebates in ihe new plan are essential if we are to achieve this aim. Whatever we do about the fees of general practitioners', it is certain that specialists will still charge more for similar services, and without differential rebates patients who have to have specialist treatment would be financially penalised. These differential charges are not the invention of the Government; they merely recognise a feature of medical fees which has been in existence for many years. It is not unreasonable for specialists to charge more. The cases which are referred to them are usually the more greatly improves the fairness of the health complex and difficult ones.

It has also $42.50 a week get Government assistance been suggested that patients will insist on to pay all their health insurance premiums; being referred unnecessarily to a specialist, people on less than $45.50 a week and but I believe that the confidence of patients more than $61.50 a week get two-thirds of in their general practitioners and the inconvenience of making a separate visit to a specialist will make this type of abuse relatively rare. If it does become prevalent, it will be possible to adopt some variant of the proposal of the College of General Practitioners so that the higher specialist benefits would be payable only of the general practitioner in his referral certified that it was a case beyond his personal capabiilty. But, even when the costs of the various procedures are agreed, there will still be a number of anomalies that require urgent attention. The first is the extraordinary discrepancy between charges for similar services in different States and, in the case of New South Wales, between parts of a State, lt seems that the medical profession was previously unaware that these discrepancies existed, and I hope that we will soon see machinery set up whereby these anomalies will be eliminated. It would be absurd if future adjustments to fees were based on such insecure foundations. We also need, of course, some agreed machinery whereby these charges can be updated at intervals of, say, 2 years. This will be one of the most difficult problems because the medical profession is traditionally jealous of its rights to set its own fees. But each doctor in private practice in Australia next year will receive an average of $8,500 of public funds from the Federal Treasury, and the Government has a responsibility to the taxpayer to see that any increases in these amounts are economically and socially justified. Although this new health benefits plan scheme, one great anomaly remains. I refer to the allowable deductions for medical tlieir insurance premiums paid for them; people on less than $48.50 a week and more than $70 a week get one-third of their insurance premiums paid for them; and the people in the middle-that is those on between $48.50 and $70 a week-ge t least. They have less than one-third of their insurance contributions paid for them. I believe that this situation needs examination. The best estimate the Legislative Research Service could provide for me was that the deductions allowed for health Treasury revenue by about $30m a year. I think we should consider eliminating the income tax deductions for insurance premiums and use the $30m increase in Federal revenue to increase the Commonwealth contribution to health benefits and thus reduce the insurance contributions of everyone equally. No matter how good our health insurance arrangements are, they will avail us little if we do not have enough doctors. It has been suggested that this new health benefits plan will cause a decline in the prestige of general practice and a fall in the number of general practitioners. I do not think this is true. The decline in general practice is a world wide trend, and the trend is most advanced in the United States, the country the health policy of which is most under the control of the medical profession. What is the situation in Australia? The most recent study of medical manpower was made in 1967 by Mr R. B. Scotton. In an article in the 'Medical Journal of Australia' he suggested that, in terms of the number of medical practitioners per head of population, Australia was at that time better off than England and New Zealand, and by now would probably be better off than Canada and nearly as well off as the United States. He also pointed out that the number of medical graduates from our universities would cause a steady improvement in the doctor-patient ratio. But this refers to the total number of This has resulted in a large number of clever medical' practitioners. Our number of boys, looking for the most rewarding progeneral practitioners does not seem to be fession in which to employ their talents, rising in proportion to the population, and choosing a medical course, although their there is some evidence that their average age motivation towards medicine may not be is increasing. Why is the proportion of strong; they are more interested in the general practitioners in the medical prosocial and financial rewards. Of course, they fession steadily falling? The reason does are a minority, but I understand they are not seem to be financial. From the results an increasing proportion. I think the entry of a survey recently carried out by the University of Melbourne, it seems that the average earnings of a general practitioner in Victoria are higher than those of any other profession and are exceeded only marginally by his specialist colleagues. In fact, the average lifetime earnings of a general practitioner seem likely to be higher than those of the average specialist. Of course, the general practitioner has to work hard for his income. He has long and erratic hours-muc h longer and more erratic than most specialists. But on the other hand, benefits contributions reduce the general practitioner, as the family doctor, has a most important role in the commun tya role that is most rewarding to those who are motivated in this way. The recently established College of General Practitioners is working hard to improve the prestige of general practice. The most important means to this end is an increase in post-graduate ' training of general practitioners. It is a sobering thought that a general practitioner can practise for 50 years or more after qualifying without ever undergoing any further formal training or qualification, or even any private study. Of course, the great majority of general practitioners endeavour to keep themselves up to date, and the efforts of the College of General Practitioners to formalise and extend this postgraduate training are altogether admirable. I think that ultimately periodic postgraduate training will have to be made mandatory. Although the postgraduate training efforts of the College of General Practitioners are excellent, other measures will also be needed to increase the number of general practitioners to meet the needs of the community. The first of these measures is to study the entry standards into medical schools. At present all our main universities have quotas for the medical faculty, and all of them use academic attainments, usually matriculation results, as the sole criterion. requirements should be widened to include such factors as common sense, humanity and desire to serve the community, as well as academic standards. Admittedly these would be subjective judgments and would be time consuming, but I believe their use would result in a more desirable motivation among medical students and an increased proportion of them would be likely to be attracted to general practice. These entry qualifications should be one of the first targets of the new advisory committee on educational research. After all , it costs the 1 community-the taxpayer-a n average of something like $40,000 for each medical student who completes his university training. So it would be worthwhile taking some additional trouble with their selection. The second area to which we should give attention is the guidance given to medical students in the later stages of their course. At present they are instructed almost entirely by specialists during the period when most of the students are making up their minds on the direction their careers will take. I think that there is no alternative to the continuation of instruction by specialists, but the university medical schools should make a determined effort to balance the influence of the specialists with a programme showing the attractions and advantages of general practice. I would hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these two measures would provide the necessary number of general practitioners, but we must face the possibility that they may not be sufficient. The laws of supply and demand will probably keep the correct balance between the various medical specialist fields, but the laws of supply and demand cannot be relied upon to keep the overall balance between general practitioners and specialists. If there is a shortage of general practitioners the average general practitioner will have to refer patients to specialists or to hospitals-patient s whom he could normally have treated himself. As he becomes more and more overworked and achieves less and less professional satisfaction, there would inevitably be an increasing and accelerating trend towards specialisation. There must be, in any community, an celled anywhere in the world. This new optimum balance between general practihealth benefits plan will minimise the finantioners and specialists. The community as cial problems of the patient. We must a whole is making very substantial financial supplement these financial provisions with sacrifices through the universities to provide an increasing number of medical practitioners. As I said earlier, we are very well off overall by world standards. I believe that, as a last resort, if other measures fail, it is up to the medical profession to control its own internal balance. If the proportion of specialists is becoming excessive, I think the medical profession must restrict entry into the various specialist bodies. If it is thought that this is an unreasonable interference with medical freedom, I would draw attention to the arrangements in the legal profession. In the legal profession the number of junior counsel advanced to Queen's Counsel is controlled by the profession in. co-operation with the State governments, so that the number of Queen's Counsel is determined not only by the desire and attainments of the individuals but also by the number of Queen's Counsel the Bar can support and the balance between senior and junior counsel. This system seems to work very well, except perhaps in South Australia. Although the problems are different, I think a similar level of internal self-discipline in the medical profession could preserve the balance between general practitioners and specialists. Although the three suggestions I have made concerning the general practitioners are primarily the constitutional concern of the States, I believe the Federal Government must act as an initiator and catalyst in trying to solve the problem, because the general practitioner is an essential component of an efficient and satisfying health system. He is the only one who can provide family medical counselling, preventative treatment and early recognition of the presence of disease. No-one else can fill this role adequately. If there are not enough general practitioners, as is the case in America, for instance, home visits will be cut out and patients will have to go to specialists or hospitals for advice and treatment which could have been given by the local general practitioner. This will be expensive to the community and often highly inefficient and inconvenient for the patient. Here in Australia we have a medical profession whose prestige and ability are not exinitiatives aimed at ensuring that the general practitioner remains, as the family doctor, the keystone of the health system. n>r KLUGMAN (Prospect) [4.38]I congratulate the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Hamer) on assimilating extremely well the medical briefing from the College of General Practitioners without accepting its political propositions. 1 would certainly agree with him. It gives mc great pleasure to second the amendment proposed by the Opposition. Today we are debating this Government's panic amendments to prop up tbe failing health legislation. I think it is important to have a quick chronological look at the origin of this amending Bill. Until about 3 years ago the Australian Medical Association and the Minister for Health talked about Australia's leadership in this sphere of health schemes. The basis for this was similar to the basis for the Minister's claim that Australia's hospitals were the best in the world; in other words, non-existent. It is interesting, by the way, to read the speech he gave in 1967 and note that the only authority he quotes in support of his claims is Mr Enoch Powell. However, during the last 3 years at least many attacks began on the scheme. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), with the help of such medical economists as Messrs Scotton and Deeble from the Institute of Applied l l t h April 1970 Dr Knight of East MelEconomic Research at the University of bourne wrote: Melbourne, not only exposed the iniquities of the Liberal scheme but went further and paign last year announced its 'new' scheme, the proposed Labor's alternative national AMA should have made it clear that doctors health programme. The Minister for Health, a man with impressive academic qualifications, has doggedly defended the present scheme. I feel that his statements often have obviously been briefs from the Voluntary Health Insurance Council, a pressure group financed by some of the larger funds. One of the most depressing and yet interesting aspects of the defence of the Government's scheme and the attacks on Labor's plan has been the faceless men preparing handouts for the Minister and the AMA. Most prominent amongst these men in New South Wales have been Mr Cade and Mr the country are realising that the leaderTurner, tsars of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd and the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, respectively. Dr KLUGMANI did. It is in pencil. That is why I am taking some time to Tead it. We have reached the stage where Sir Clarence Rieger, Federal President of the AMA, is also a director of one of the Sonth Australian medical funds and the President of the Voluntary Health Insurance Council. We never know when he is speaking as the Federal President of ths AM A and when he js speaking as the representative of the Medical Benefits Fund, but I feel, as a member of the AMA, that more often than not he is speaking as a representative of the Voluntary Health Insurance Council. Only recently has it become obvious to AMA members that as their President he is acting as a spokesman for the directors of the larger benefit funds. Please do not interpret this to mean that he is speaking for the ordjnary members of these so-called mutual benefit funds. Not only do the members have no say in their funds but they are not even told who the directors are. The Articles of Association of Mr Turner's Hospitals Contribution Fund are not even available to this House. Some weeks ago I asked the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) to supply these. He has apparently been unable to do so. In the Medical Journal of Australia on When Ihe Government during the election camhave no part to play in patient-government relationships. Instead thc Federal President oi the AMA issued a statement which . appeared to be nn instruction for doctors to campaign actively on behalf of the Liberal Party's scheme and oppose that of the Labor Party. This apparent incursion into the political arena had led many to believe lhat the AMA is actively joining the Government and the benefits societies . . . Dr Knight is not the only doctor to wake up to this. At an extraordinary general meeting of the New South Wales Branch of the AMA on 22nd March this year in Sydney 1,007 proxies were received.

63,Mr Robinson,"Who wrote your speech?Let us return' to recent political history. Until2 or 3 years ago we had claims by the Minister, the Liberal and Country parties, the AMA and the so-called open funds that ail was well with their1 emphasise the word 'their'-scheme . Under the leadership of the leader of our Party the contributors, who had been grumbling but leaderless and I emphasise this-un represented on the boards of the funds, showed the conservative politicians that ihey were dissatisfied. Even the Australian Democratic Labor Party expressed its support. On 3rd April 196S the Senate agreed to the appointment of a select committee. to inquire into medical and hospital costs in Australia and, in particular, to examine the operation and administration of the medical and hospital benefits schemes, and to recommend such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the constitutional division of. legislative power in Australia, enable the provision of the optimum standards of medical and hospital care for all. Although the Government parties had a majority on the Committee the Government panicked and on 18th April 1968, a fortnight later, appointed the Nimmo Committee to review the voluntary health insurance system in Australia. Its terms of reference were quite restrictive and it had no authority to hear evidence in public. The Government's aim was to divert attention from the Senate Select Committee and to take the heat off health insurance as an issue. It was only partly successful. The Nimmo report of March 1969 was highly critical of this best of all systems, although it was restricted in its terms of reference. The findings of the Nimmo Committee included: 1. The operation of the health insurance scheme is unnecessarily complex and beyond the comprehension of many. 2. The benefits received by contributors are frequently much less (han the cost of hospital and medical treatment. 3. Thc contributions have increased to such an extent that they are beyond the capacity of some members of the community and involve considerable hardship for others. 4. The rules of many registered organisations including the so-called 'special account' rules the lot', meaning pathology, X-rays, anaespermit disallowance or reduction of claims for particular conditions. The application of these rules has caused serious and widespread hardship. 5. An unduly high proportion of the contributions received hy some organisations is absorbed in operating expenses. 6. The level of reserves held by some organisations is unnecessarily high. 7. The cost of illness may include, in addition to hospital accommodation and treatment and medical services, a wide range of other services which have never been covered by the health insurance scheme. These 'other' services include nursing home accommodation and treatment, physiotherapy, home nursing, chiropractors' services, chiropodists' services, optometry and dentistry. Whilst future increases will be necessary from time to time as costs rise, health insurance contributions are in present circumstances as high as most people are prepared to pay and as many people can afford to pay. . . . In addition to the findings the Committee made 42 recommendations. Nothing more happened until September 1969. Let us remember the political context; at this stage the Government was supremely confident over the coming election. The gallup polls tended to justify this confidence. Then suddenly things changed. In August 1969, according to the gallup poll, the Liberal Party had over a 5% lead when people were asked: 'How would you vote if an election was held today? By 4th October the Australian Labor Party had a 3% lead. The Government panicked. It looked back to see what the reason was for the sudden change in its standing. One of the questions that had been asked at the gallup poll in August was: 'Do you support the present system of health insurance, or do you support the ALP's scheme?' The ALP's scheme had a 58% to 39% margin, which was the biggest margin in relation to any of the issues which the gallup poll organisers thought were up for discussion at the last election. At that stage the Government decided that it had to pull a rabbit out of the hat. The Prime Minister then made h s rather sudden announcement. : Following the rather embarrassingly disastrous opening of the election campaign the Prime Minister lost his nerve. Having announced a $5 maximum payment for any medical service he was astounded to find that a number of doctors and procedures were involved in an operation. When challenged on this he rather characteristically did not bother to check w'th his Minister for Health. He stated bluntly: 'It includes thetics, assistants, surgeons and aftercare. As usual he then produced 2 arbitrary figures, no doubt supplied by the Press Coordinator for the Royal Visit, Mr Tony Eggleton. Not unexpectedly, these figures showed that the Liberal Party's scheme was better and cheaper than Labor's. Also not unexpectedly, the figures were completely wrong. Not having done anything about the 42 monwealth and almost no extra cost to recommendations in the Nimmo report contributors was out by over 100% as far as brought down in March, the Government the Commonwealth was concerned and that passed amending legislation in September the increase in subscriptions from con1969, just before the dissolution of the tributors would be at least $22m per year.

However 142 Let us look at the rest of the amendmedical services so as to include a small number of procedures performed by oral surgeons but even these are restricted to those performed in operating theatres of approved hospitals. The schedules are to be changed by regulation, but we are not told on what basis. Both doctors and contributors are vitally interested in this. We have amendments assuring contributors of maximum cost of $5 for medical services provided the doctors charge the common fee and provided the cure is surgical. Should doctors opposing this are saying is that the a contributor be unlucky enough not to be curable by surgery but to require repeated examinations, visits, tests, transfusions or infusions, each one of these can cost $5. A coronary occlusion, a stroke or a diabetic coma can still cost a lot in medical fees alone. There can surely be no reason why a cancer victim treated surgically should pay only $5 whilst if treated with radiotherapy or with drugs he has to pay much more. I think that in many ways this is symptomatic of the Government's approach to issues. I think the Government's motto is: 'We will deal with the dramatic aspects, but where logic and reasoning are required that is not our cup of tea'. There is still 1 no refund for patients attending outpatient clinics at hospitals. There is no attempt to encourage preventive medicine; there is no rebate for routine overhauls which take a long time; there is no extra rebate for cancer smear tests or immunisations, apart from the usual consultation fee which would often be less than the actual fee charged. When dealing with the registration of funds there is still no obligation on them to let members have any say in them or even for members to know the directors, the method of election or even the constitution. We have recently heard in this House that Mr Turner of the New South Wales Hospitals Contribution Fund was appointed to the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales in return for appointing P. G. Huxley Esq. as a director of the HCF. Apart from him how many more Liberal Party protegees are there amongst the directors? These amendments, whilst they will be beneficial to some contributors, of course do not change the basic weaknesses. We still have a scheme based on equal and now greatly increased contributions. We have, because of tax concessions, the spectacle of the net cost decreasing as the taxable income increases. It is indeed a cornerstone of Liberal legislation. I now want to say a few words regarding some of the medical criticisms. The main attack has been on differential rebates between general practitioners and specialists and the common $5 specified excess in case of operative procedures. Let me say that I support the Government on this. I hope that the Minister will not accept any amendment after he hears this. What the poorer people should be financially, deterred from seeking specialist treatment in order to preserve the jam on the butter of general practice, lt opposes a fundamental concept of an effective national health service, which is that the best medical care should be available to everyone regardless of his financial resources. Personally I am very concerned that the Government will use regulations regarding referrals financially to deter patients from seeing consultants. If there are those on the Government side who say that specialists are necessary for some of the minor conditions such as confinements, let me ask them whether their wives or daughters had general practitioners or specialists for any confinement in a city in the last 10 years. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners last week produced a leaflet entitled 'You and Your Doctor' for distribution to patients. It is in the form of question and answer, and I give this example: Q. Why should doctors determine their own fees anyway? A. . . . This matter is part of the doctorpatient relationship, which has existed for centuries. Once an outside party is involved in the setting of fees, the relationship begins to crumble. Doctors realise that medical care is everybody's right, regardless of the patient's ability to pay, and many an account has been settled with a dozen eggs, or a basket of fruit, or nothing more than the spoken thanks of the patient. In no other field of business or commerce does this relationship exist. Do you wish to see it destroyed? . . . This is a statement from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. It is no wonder that Her Majesty left this country on Sunday. I certainly would like to see this necessity to depend on charity destroyed. There is no need in a country such as Australia to depend on the charity of a doctor or for a doctor to accept certain services from a patient rather than to have the services paid for by some public authority if the patient is unable to afford it. It is similar to last year's handout by Sir Charles Rieger in which he said: . . . that delicate, personal, doctor-patient relationship where the patient is personally responsible for his fees. No heaith scheme such as this one will ever be fair or even effective and apparently only a Labor government will provide these changes. The scheme must be based on general taxation to be equitable. By the way, it is interesting to note that the Commonwealth contribution of $2 per bed day to a contributor's hospital costs has not been altered since 1962, even though this year there was an opportunity to do so. During the Chifley Government the Commonwealth contribution was 60c last remarks made by the honourable memper day for every bed but now it is SOc ber for Prospect (Dr Klugman), who has just for non-contributors and $2 for contribusat down, show quite clearly how little the tors to hospital funds. The approximate Opposition has understood the intention of bed day cost in New South Wales was SI.60 in 1946, with a Commonwealth contribution of 60c, or 37%. Under the Menzies Government in 1962 when the $2 was brought in the cost was $12; in other words there was a Commonwealth contritwo speakers from the Opposit on to date bution of 16% to the cost. Now under the that they are jealous of the fact that the Gorton Government the Commonwealth Government has introduced a Bill that is so contribution has dropped to 10% of the much more advantageous to the patient cost because the cost per bed has increased than the Labor socialised scheme, of which to $20 per day and the contribution has we heard so much of during the last election, not altered. Even in the case of pensioners could possibly be; they know that this is the Commonwealth, which pretends to what the public will want. No doubt the shoulder financial responsibility for their honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) health, only contributes $5 per day which made a very erudite speech but I am afraid is only 25% of the cost. It is no wonder I was not able to follow his thoughts all the that the hospitals cannot even begin to live time because he quoted so many opinions of up to the Minister's claim of being the so many people that his speech became a best in the world. Let us further remember disjointed mass. that the costs mentioned are only maintenance costs and do not include capital expenditure. It is no wonder that the Minister's statement that people could get a hospital bed at the standard they desired almost at will in Australia is far from factual. May1 conclude by quoting from an be cheaper. He also said it would be ' l i % editorial in what is not exactly a left wing based on income'. I need hardly remind the paper-the 'Australian Financial Review'. people of Australia that this H % is a figure It states: What started off as a serious exercise in social engineering with the avowed purpose of removing estimates made of what it may be but there the financial penalty that occurs through ftl-health, have been no checks as to its accuracy 15361/70-R-[61 ] has become a battleground of pressure groups with the public left forgotten on the side lines. Where does the patient rank in the policymaking now? The Minister for Health, Dr Forbes, who is not even a member of the inner Cabinet, apparently interprets his position to be that of an adjudicator between pressure groups that have been institutionalised by Government machinery-listenin g to the health funds here, tut-tutung at the Australian Medical Association there, speaking sternly to hospitals everywhere. He is the embodiment of what is wrong with the Liberal Government of today. Somewhere along the way the guiding principles of Liberalism have been subordinated to defending the policies and values that have been handed down from another era. At all costs (to the public) nothing must be done or said to antagonise tbe organised and vocal pressure groups. In Australia only the silent majority is defranchised. the Government in bringing in this Bill. The main thought behind this was: What is going to be the benefit to the patient? It is obvious from what has been said by the jointed statement wh'ch did not cover the basis of this Bill. The honourable member said a little about what the Australian Labor Party's scheme is going to be. He said it will that has never really been authentically checked for accuracy. There have been some",43,National Health Bill 1970

It was a disThe estimate of l Jr% was made in 1966 by a couple of researchers at a university who were filling in spare time and hoping to make a few bob on the side by preparing some sort of submission which presumably the Labor Party took up. If the estimate in 1966 was l i % it will certainly be a lot more now. There is a very important point here. The l i % of income tax that is talked about means an 8% increase in what is paid in income tax. This is pretty important. This is something that escaped the people opposite, but is obvious to anyone who has really tried to follow the development of our scheme through. In my view, the only thing that matters in the long run is what will be best for the patient. I can remember what happened when the national health scheme was introduced. Honourable members will recall that the Labor Party was most anxious to nationalise the doctors, to regiment them and subject them to some form of compulsion such as tbere is in the British scheme. This is exactly what Labor wanted to do. The Labor Party wanted to nationalise the doctors in the early stages of the scheme. However, it never learns-i l is still trying to do the same thing. By the introduction of this tapered means The British scheme is not only a failure; the ambit of the service. But the doctors it is a costly failure. It is a failure because would not take them. I believe that the people have fo wait months and months doctors are being well paid for their work in before they can receive medical attention. the service. If one worked out how many They have to line up in a doctor's surgery; doctors there are and how much the service they have to sit on a long bench and move has cost over the year in total one would up in the same way as people have to do in find that, taking the average amount that veterinary surgeries. The British scheme is a doctor receives, it is a very, very nice also a failure because it has not been able basis on which a doctor can start his to develop 1 new hospital over the last 10 practice. Some doctors get a very great years or more. People are being deluded by deal more than the average. the fact that the Labor Party savs that it is a free service. There is no such thing as a free service. The people of Britain are payfaced last year. Over the period since the ing for it all right; they are paying for it scheme was introduced there had been through the nose. When the Government first introduced practical for the Government just to follow this national health scheme the main the doctors' rise in fees by increasing its thought was to see that the doctor's bill was payments. It was not possible for the funds paid. It was a scheme that was drawn up to do so, and the public was paying too to enable people to pay the doctor's bill. much. The Government decided that it Tbe idea was to put the scheme on an would appoint the Nimmo Committee to insurance basis and 90% was to be recoverexamine the whole position although, quite able. I would much prefer to see the frankly, I do not really think that the scheme conducted on a 90% basis than Nimmo Committee was necessary. Its perhaps the $5 that is spoken of now. But report is very interesting. I think all the over the years the doctors became caught information contained in it was available up a little with the fact that they were to us. I believe that many honourable getting such a wonderful bonanza out of the scheme when the bills were paid that they proceeded to lift their charges to the stage where, roughly speaking-and I do not want to drag out the statistics to put it into actual terms, and the position varies in the several States-the patient had to pay one-third instead of 10%, the fund paid one-third and the government made up another one-third. That breakdown of the figures is near enough for the purposes of the argument. But in spite of this unexpected and perhaps I could almost say unwarranted prosperity that the medical profession had enjoyed doctors failed to co-operate with the Government over ail these years in the way that I believe they should. We have a wonderful example of this in the lack of co-operation given by doctors to the pensioner medical service. Last year the Government brought in the tapered means test. This covered a lot of people in a deserving area. The Government saw a need to help people who were right on the border line and on the fringeretired people on fixed pensions and so on. test a lot more people were brought within There is the position with which we were some changes in the economy. It was not members are better acquainted with this problem of health benefits than the Nimmo Committee has shown itself to be. We are quite aware of the difficulties that exist and are capable of bringing forward amendments which would have brought the scheme up to date. But the practice these days is to seek the advice of outside experts and so we got the Nimmo Committee, which made a number of recommendations. Its first recommendation was that a commission should be appointed. Earlier today we heard the honourable member for Oxley, who led for the Opposition, move an amendment to the motion for the second reading in which he sought the appointment of a national health insurance commission to run medical and hospital services. It is clear that if the Nimmo Committee had not been restricted by its terms of reference it may have gone overboard and advocated the Socialist scheme which the Labor Party has adopted, because the Nimmo Committee did advocate the appointment of a commission. From discussions I have had I understand that a commission is to be appointed to run this scheme, although there has as yet been no oflicial announcement of this. I am not in favour of a commission, but this is not the place to go into my reasons except to say that I think this is a Socia'ist move. The Government proposes that the commission shall have certain functions. The Labor Party has made i: clear that it would operate the scheme under a commission, which would decide the nature of the scheme, the percentage of income that would be taken from people to run the scheme and which doctors patients would get. If we have a commission running the scheme it would be so easy for a future Labor government, if Australia ever has the misfortune to get one, to change the system overnight into this Socialist dream that would completely ruin the historic relationship between patient and doctor. Faced with the necessity to amend the structure of the medical side of the national 1 health scheme the Government decided to go ahead firstly with thc medical scheme. I would like to go on record now as saying that at this moment there is too much confusion about the differential payments to allow us to go ahead and pass this Bill before we are sure of the best way to handle the matter. The medical profession has been consulted and it has told us what it wants. In the main it has been the Australian Medical* Association to which the Government has turned. This was natural because this is the body with which the Government has dealt over the years. The other groups have in the past remained in the background, content to let the AMA do the talking for them. This does not mean that the AMA is representative of the entire profession. Now we find that the general practitioners have many fears. Personally I think they are baseless, but nevertheless they are held by the general practitioners. Then there is a group calling itself the Section of General Practice in the New South Wales branch of the AMA. Surely if this is part of the AMA its representations should have been made through the AMA. But the Government consulted with the AMA and came up with these differential payments. Unfortunately the Nimmo Committee said that the fees charged by specialists in the practise of their speciality should be ascertained separately from the fees charged by general practitioners. I suppose you can read that to mean that there should be a differential payment, but that is not the way I interpret it. Last year when we had quite a lot of discussion about this matter I was under the impression that we were arriving at a common fee basis. Everybody accepted this nnd I believe that in putting its scheme forward the Labor Party would have adopted the common fee basis. The Labor Party has not toid us whether it would have consulted the AMA or whether the 5 doctors in its ranks would have been the authorities to decide. We do not know what would have happened. But the idea of a common fee was, I believe, accepted by all of us. However, in the last few weeks we have been confronted with this disparity between what a general practitioner should get for a certain procedure and what a specialist should get. There is within the medical profession throughout the world such an obvious move towards specialisation that it is not surprising to find that the number of general practitioners is not growing. In one of the notifications that we have had from one of these bodies-so many come along that we tend to forget who sends themwe were told that there are 6.000 general' practitioners in Australia and that the number has remained static for the last 5 or 6 years. This is a section of the profession whose numbers are not increasing. The young fellows enter the profession with the idea of being specialists. They are rather horrified at the prospect of general practice, where they have to accept responsitime going into this matter. I was trying bility. This is what is wrong with the young men of today and their university training: They are not prepared to accept responsibility. They are not prepared to face up to rhe fact that they have to make decisions concerning the health of people. They feel that it is much more attractive and more remunerative to specialise. I am not altogether sold on the idea that specialist practice should be better paid than general practice. Some specialists are not as good as other specialists. Do we have a common fee for specialists? Who is to stop the top specialists in Australia from getting higher fees than their colleagues receive? What will be adopted. What they mean in effect is happen to the concept of the $5 maximum to be paid by the patient if he goes to the top man for surgery? Will the patient still pay only $5 out of his own pocket? This aspect is very confusing at the moment. The AMA had many consultations with tomies and hernias, for example, when the the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) and cases are complicated. I do not see much the Minister addressed many AMA meetdifficulty in working thu suggestion into ings. After having stuck to the differential the scheme by means of adding a few basis for weeks or months we now And numbers. that the AMA, in a letter dated 1st May which I received only today and which 1 have not had time thoroughly to study, has be confusing and I was not able to follow split its differential list into a number of exactly what the general practitioners meant. sections.

The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has gone to a lot of trouble to list the 340 numbers set oui in the back of the book. It has stated that some of these things should be paid for on the basis of the common fee of thc general practitioner nnd that the others should be paid for on the basis of the common fee of the specialist. Believe me, 1 spent a lot of hard to get the picture of what thc medical profession wanted. I found that the general practitioners want to add one procedure to the 340 joint procedures and I will come back to this matter later on if I have the time. They want to amend 14 of them. They want to include things which only specialists do. They want to delete 239 of the lower priced benefits and to delete only 86 of the higher priced benefits based on the specialist figure. In the case of the numbers which they want amended, they have not exactly asked that either one or other of the figures should that there should be a number referring to tonsils and then, if the case is a complicated one and the general practitioner has to refer it to a specialist, an A number should be used and the case then should attract a specialist fee. This applies to tonsillectomies, removal or adenoids, appendecNot being a doctor I found the list to Under the heading 'Anaesthetics' 20 or 30 ters anaesthetic must be a specialist, because he has to be qualified in this respect. They argue that the fact that he happens to be a general practitioner is no reason why he should be paid less than a specialist who is called in to administer an anaesthetic. 1 can see that the Government would have trouble in acceptng this 'idea. Every anaesthetic ad: ministered by a general practitioner would have to be paid for at the higher price. Therefore the present rather high cost would be increased, and I would like to know by how much it would be increased. How often is a general practitioner called upon to administer an anaesthetic? This could happen very often n a country town because a ; specialist would not be available. If a doctor has to perform an operation then naturally he will ask one of his colleagues to administer the anaesthetic. practice? proficient iri the procedure. What is the difference between being proficient and being classed as a specialist in anaesthetics? Let us consider what happens in Melbourne when one goes into a hospital. The anaesthetist has a consultation and for that he receives a fee. Then he receives a fee for what is done in the theatre. It is all very fine business. I have gone through thesefigurescarefully and have compared them in order to see what they are. It is obvious what has been done. Let us take the case of a simple procedure involving a hand. They wanted the specialist fee to be brought down to the general practitioner fee. But if a complication arose in connection with that same procedure they felt that the general practitioner, if he did the work, should be paid at the same rate as the specialist. The question is: What do you pay for-the skill of the man who does the job or the job that is done? I find this legislation very difficult to assess. AgainI say that I would like more time to find out more about what has happened. I received this submission from the general practitioners only on 30th April. At that time Parliament was in recess. The submission from the Australian Medical Association I received only today. It seems to imply that there is some problem facing the medical profession as to what should oe done. I have said already that my opinion was that there would be a common fee. NowI would like to throw in a third consideration. The general practitioners have gone through ail the numbers in the Bill and have said which services should be paid for at the general practitioner rate and which should be paid for at the specialist rate. But have they done this on the basis of which is the most common fee charged? Originally we were told that computers were used to decide which was the most common fee. Has this been done now for the full range of general practitioners and specialists and have they come out with a common fee? If this has been done, it might alter the submission of the general practitioners. Presumably an adjustment on these lines would fit in with the principle behind what they are trying to do. It also would fit in with the principle of what the AMA is trying to do. I believe it would satisfy a lot of doubts in the minds of people who are wondering just how far we should go in making this service a benefit for the doctor rather than a benefit for the patient. This is my problem when I consider the Bill. There is one other aspect I would like to mention before my time expires. I refer the House to clause 8 of the Bill which deals with definitions. The Government is proposing a concession to the dental profession. For many years the dental profession has complained that no matter how good an oral surgeon might be in practising dentistry such patients were debarred from receiving a benefit whereas if a doctor performed some procedure within the field of dentistry the patient would receive the benefit. The Government has now decided upon the definitions set out in clause 8 which states: 'professional service' means(b) a prescribed medical service that is rendered in an operating theatre of an approved hospital by a legally qualified dentist or dental practitioner approved by the Director General for the purposes of this definition: I do not have time to go into it now but I give notice that I will move an amendment in Committee that the words 'rendered in an operating theatre of an approved hospital' be deleted so that where it is more convenient for an oral surgeon to do a procedure in his surgery he could do so.

This aspect was brought to my attention only over the weekend. My time has elapsed and I will defer my further remarks to the Committee stages. 1 wind up by saying that I have always maintained in this House that the national health scheme, as we understand the basis on which it works, gives the people of Australia a better health service than any I have been able to examine, whether in Canada or the United Kingdom, and certainly a lot better than the United States of America. We should stick to the principles upon which our present national health scheme is based. I would like time to digest some of the information that has been brought forward by the doctors in the last few days. Debate (on motion by Dr Everingham) adjourned. Inquiry into Drilling for Petroleum Ministerial Statement -by leaves1 am pleased to announce that the Premier of Queensland and 1 have agreed on the details of establishing Commonwealth and State royal commissions to inquire into the risk of damage to the Great Barrier Reef from drilling for petroleum. The royal commissions have been established under the Commonwealth's Royal Commissions Act 1902-1966 and the Queensland Commissions of Inquiry Acts 1950 to 1954. The Commissioners and the terms of reference will be identical for each royal commission. The Commissioners are: The Honourable Sir Gordon Wallace, Sydney, New South Wales, Chairman; Dr James Eric Smith, Plymouth, England; and Mr Vincent John Moroney, Calgary, Canada. The terms of reference for the royal commissions are: (1) Taking into account existing world technology in relation to drilling for petroleum and safety precautions relating thereto, what risk is there of President of the Law Council of Australia an oil or gas leak in exploratory and production drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef? (2) What would be the probable effects of such an oil or gas leak and of the subsequent remedial measures on(A) The coral reefs themselves; (B) The coastline; (C) The ecological and biological aspects of life in the area? (3) Are there localities within the area of the Great Barrier Reef and, if so, what are their geographical limits, wherein the effects of an oil or gas leak would cause so little detriment that drilling there for petroleum might be permitted? (4) Jf exploration or drilling for petroleum in any locality within the area of the Great Barrier Reef is permitted, are existing safety precautions already prescribed or otherwise laid down for that locality regarded as adequate and, if not. what conditions should be imposed before such exploration or drilling could take place? (5) What are the probable benefits accruing to the State qf Queensland and other parts of the Commonwealth from exploration or drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef and thc extent of those benefits? The area of the Great Barrier Reef referred to in the above terms of reference includes the entire area from low watermark on the mainland of Queensland to the outer line of tbe Reef and includes also the area outside and adjacent to the outer line of reefs. These agreed terms of reference incorporate some improvements and changes of a drafting nature from the agreed terms announced on 29th January following the conference on that date between the Premier and myself. The Premier and I are pleased that 3 persons of such eminence have agreed to be the Commissioners. Sir Gordon Wallace recently retired as President of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. He had previously been a judge of the Supreme Court of that State. While at the Bar he held office as President of the New South Wales Bar Association in 1957-58 and Vicein 1957.

He graduated from thp Georgetown University and is a member of the Canadian Institute of Mining anj Metallurgy and of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers. The inquiry would be an open one and the royal commissioners have sufficient authority to collect any evidence required. All interested parties could appear before the commission and siate their views and adduce evidence to support those views. The commissioners will make announcements on arrangements for the hearing of such evidence. Counsel assisting the royal commissions will be Mr A. E.

I present the following paper: Great Barrier Reef, Royal Commission on Drilling for Petroleum-Ministeria l Statement, 5 May 1970. move that the House take note of the paper? That the House take note of the paper. DR PATTERSON (Dawson) [5.37]I make this request because the Opposition has considered this matter and would like to move an amendment seeking to make an addition to the terms of reference. The Opposition has no argument with the terms of reference. The first one deals with the risk and this calls for a physical interpretation. It asks: What are the risks involved? They may be reduced to mathematical standard errors or they may be a generalised standard based on experience in other parts of the world. The second term of reference deals with the probable effects of such an oil and gas leak on the coral reefs themselves, the coastline and the ecological and biological aspects. I admit this could have some cost put on it. On this commission are two scientists, technical people, and I am sure the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) would agree that these matters are in the realm of physical science. They deal with the physiological aspects of the inquiry. A third term deals with the safe areas. I would take issue here because I think that the commission has an impossible task in defining an area. There are very wide areas within the Great Barrier Reef area itself which are still virtually uncharted and for a royal commission to define geographically some of these areas, such as the eastern part of the Cape York Peninsula, as being safe or not safe for oil drilling would be a tremendous task involving tremendous knowledge of the Reef. The fourth term of reference relates to safety measures. Up to this point I think that everybody would agree that these are physical measures. However, we must ask what beneiits will accrue to Queensland. Benefits in every language mean benefits in terms of dollars. If it means simply qualitative benefits, it is virtually meaningless. It has to be benefits accruing, and I am sure this is an oil strike what can this mean in terms of dollars to Queensland and to the economy of Australia? We have no argument about this, but I suggest that it would be extremely difficult to measure. However, if we can measure the benefits, as anybody trained in economics knows, we have to be able to measure the cost. That is why the Opposition proposes as an amendment an extension to the terms of reference. It is virtually the same as the fifth term of reference. There are benefits if there is an oil strike, but what are the costs that will accrue to Queensland in the event of a blow-out, for example? This is really what has been the great argument throughout Australia. On one hand the Queensland Government has been talking of tremendous development benefits, but on the other hand biologists",52,Great Barrier Reef

71,Mr Gorton,"Yes. I move:and others have been referring to tremendous costs, l t is of no good for the Prime Minister or anyone else to say that costs cannot be measured. Of course they cannot be measured in their entirety. The 'Torrey Canyon' disaster, with the oil spilt, involved about $30m. The Santa Barbara incident involved another quantitative factor. In the Royal Commission's findings some ind cation should be given of the tremendous cost to this nation in the event of an oil spillage or a gas leakage. The Opposition is moving an amendment, because it believes the proposal is lopsided. The first 4 terms of reference deal with phys cal aspects and relate to risk, the been, during that period of time, discussion ecological balance and the effects on the not only on who should form the members coral reefs and coastline. They are physical of this commission of inquiry but also aspects. As1 have said, it will be difficult to some considerable discussion as to just what define safe areas in the Barrier Reef. 1 doubt the terms of reference should be.

For that reason I move: That the following words be added to the motion: rather, it would have some effect because 'and (hat ihe terms of reference of the Royal it would have the effect of delaying the Commissions be extended to include the probable beginning of this commission of inquiry costs which will accrue to the State of Queenswhich, I regret, has been delayed so long. land and other parts of the Commonwealth from oil and gas leaks in the area of the Great Barrier Reef and the extent of those costs'. I should (hink that the Prime Minister decision of this House. Of course, we would welcome this amendment because it could take a stand and say: 'We will not is consistent with all the statements he has agree with what has been decided between made. We have to consider the 2 sides of the 2 governments'; but this would really, the question-the benefits and the costs. If 1 think, militate against the kind of comit is good enough to consider the benefits, it mission of inquiry which I think all of us is good enough to consider the costs. Is the amendment seconded?

It has been, as the honourable member will remember, some considerable time since it was first decided that such a commission would be set up. There has to by the other government concerned; This is not a matter entirely within the want to see set up.

But I feel, as I said before, that we should not accept this amendment because I believe it is to all intents and purposes covered by the terms of reference and because acceptance of an amendment here woutd only delay the 2 royal commissions from being set up, and I think that the time has come for this to be done and for these commissions to be begun without any further delay.

Australia today has a solidly established tries to sell their products overseas. But industrial capacity. It is undoubtedly a firm much more needs to be done to build in foundation for further growth. Most AusAustralia an industrial structure which can tralian manufacturing is geared to a smaller be a principal source of export earnings scale of production than that of older industrial countries. But opportunities for worldscale production, especially in industries based on new mineral resources, are increasingly appearing. The question is only whether we have the capacity and will to take advantage of them. Australia has emerged as one of the most competitive suppliers of basic materials for the industries of the world. This is a source of great strength. Our resources can be the springboard to a great industrial future, manufacturing goods for world markets, from our own low-cost raw materials. It is, however, a basic feature of our developing economy that, as the gross national product increases, so do our import requirements to sustain our industries and meet consumer needs. We face a growing burden of income remitted abroad. Income remitted overseas by companies in Australia has in 5 years risen from 8.3% to 10.5% of our export earnings. In addition, income being earned by overseas investors and ploughed back in further investment in Australia has more than doubled in 5 years. This means a building up of commitments for further income to be paid abroad in thc equity form, there is no end to the commitment. Traditionally, exports of rural products have earned the bulk of our foreign exchange needs. But, witb the difficulties which our exports of farm products face in overseas markets, we have to look for export earnings more and more to the products of our factories and our mines. In leave-presente d by Mr recent times while the value of our imports has been increasing at the rate of 8% per annum, the value of our rural exports has We hnve to increase our industrial exports. We must get the maximum capacity of Australian manufacturing indus-",54,Great Barrier Reef
78,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister for been increasing at less than 2% per annum.-in Ihe future and which, in the process, will bring lower costs in Australia through the economies of larger-scale operations serving wider markets. We have a ready made opportunity to develop further exports of industrial products from our abundance of high grade, competitively priced raw materials. Each ton of iron ore, or bauxite, or wood chips, or copper, or nickel concentrates, if processed to just one further stage would multiply its earnings many times over. Processed still further, as I believe it can be, and finding some growing access to world markets in the more highly processed form, the rewards in terms of export income would be still greater. The capital which comes from abroad into our industries is itself a major and growing element in Australia's balance of payments. Five years ago total capital inflow was running at $500m to $600m in a year. In the past 2 years it has been well over $ 1,000m a year. Capital inflow brings benefits, but also commitments. We must do everything possible to see that it is used to best advantage. The proposals outlined in this Bill will encourage the establishment of industries which will contribute most to permanent development in Australia and the long term strength of the balance of payments. The Government clearly approves, and will continue to encourage, the inflow of investment from abroad. It is nevertheless a matter of national concern that overseas capital is usually obtained on terms which have resulted in predominantly foreign ownership of many of our greatest industrial enterprises and fastest growing industries. Hardly a month goes by when we do not hear of an overseas takeover of an important and growing Australian enterprise. In 1969 alone, at least 15 Australian owned companies, with assets worth $100m, disappeared from the lists of the two largest stock exchanges because of takeover by overseas interests. There are also, of course, have, and even seek, Australian participation many other companies which have continued in existence but with the overseas ownership growing and becoming dominant. Overseas takeovers and mergers are not necessarily bad. Indeed, they may be part of the process of an Australian industry growing up, becoming more efficient. But too frequently in the pattern of such arrangements, when the Australian partner cannot meet his share of the capital requirements-whethe r equity or loan-h e will at best become the minor partner in the new enterprise that results. We cannot let ourselves be lulled into feeling that all is well because comfortable aggregate statistical figures show only 20% to 25% foreign ownership of manufacturing. Manufacturing industry, in the statistical records, includes thousands of small establishments designated as factories because they have 4 or more employees or use power. Looking deeper into the statistics, we see a vastly different picture. If we look at the situation in factories with over 20 employees we find, for example, that the motor vehicle industry is nearly 90% foreign controlled. The industrial and heavy chemicals industry, and the pharmaceuticals industry, are over 80% foreign controlled. In the electrical and electronic industries, including in the total many small enterprises, overseas ownership is around 50%. Production of alumina and aluminium is about 75% owned overseas. Foreign domination is not confined to the largest industries. The production in Australia of such day-to-day items as roller bearings, electrical hand tools, abrasives, and glazed ceramic tiles, to mention a few of the smaller and more specialised industries, is carried out predominantly by foreign-owned companies. This degree of foreign ownership has come about in a variety of ways. Some foreign firms, for their own reasons of company policy, are not prepared to allow any Australian participation in their ventures. There are others who regard some minor Australian ownership as desirable, to give a measure of recognition to Australian national sentiment and, under the borrowing guidelines, greater access to local finance. A growing number of more. enlightened foreign companies are willing to to the point of an effective Australian voice in the board room. They aim to make the foreign company a good Australian corporate citizen. But these companies often cannot find Australian interests able to participate with them to the extent necessary to achieve a significant element of Australian ownership. There are many demands on our limited capital resources. Scarce Australian investlack in Australia of the means for Ausment funds do not easily flow to new projects which may take many years to reach the earning stage. Foreign domination also arises in circumstances where established and growing Australian enterprises, with a small foreign holding in the Australian firm, reach the stage where they must expand tbeir scale of operations very substanowned in whole or in part by overseas tially in order to compete against imports on the Australian market and to operate effectively in world markets. These Australian companies too frequently have to accept the fact that they cannot attract the investment they need from within Australia. Overseas they are unknown and lack the stature and investment appeal to borrow in their own right. Under these circumstances, it is left to the minority foreign element to provide the funds, and hence become the controlling element. There are enormous difficulties for an Australian manufacturing enterprise to achieve world scale and competitiveness under substantially Australian ownership. And foreign corporations do not, by and large, have the objective of bringing Australian industry to the stage of competing on equal terms with overseas industry. There are export franchise limitations, arrangements that limit competition with a foreign parent, processing of raw materials here, and sale at cost, as inputs for industry overseas, and fabricating industries finding themselves at the mercy of foreign-owned firms who control the prices of their raw materials. These are some of the consequences that can follow from excessive foreign ownership of industry and resources. It is increasingly evident that what is best for a multi-national giant is not necessarily best for Australia. Again, too often, there are cases where Australian innovation and research benefits foreign, rather than Australian, industry because the resources to develop their full potential cannot be found within Australia. Australians are not lacking in inventive capacity. But the cost of turning an idea into a product ready to be marketed and then to develop the markets can be beyond the capacity of Australian industry. So the idea lapses, or is sold overseas. In what I have said I speak not to criticise foreign companies, but to point out tbe circumstances which indicate a tralian companies to marshal adequate financial resources for major expansion and development under Australian ownership. I know of no important country, other than Australia, where the Government exhibits an indifference as to whether its natural resources or production opportunities are interests. In practically every other nation of the non-Communist workl there are policies or procedures or institutions designed to exercise authority or influence upon ownership of industry. Many countries achieve their objectives of domestic ownership in major industry by means of controls and administrative regulations. Approvals have to be obtained before foreign companies can set up operations, or merge with or take over a domestic company. A host of regulatory devices applying to foreign investment are to be found. We have no intention of following this example in Australia. It is the firm intention of this Government to preserve in Australia the free enterprise system. We will maintain Australia's unique open door to investment and ownership by private enterprise. It is because of this intention that the Government now proposes a constructive means of fostering the objectives of industrial development and maximum Australian ownership in it. I have explained some of the problems and the needs which have prompted us to take a new initiative. I have explained that we will completely avoid trying to solve the problems by regulation or controls. Instead, we are going to create a new facility which will be in a position to assist an Australian venture that seeks its help to undertake a viable and important industry development. The facility will be fashioned and equipped especially to assist projects in export industries, and industries founded on Australia's natural resources. It will direct itself to giving assistance in ways which will help Australian companies to gain or preserve a greater Australian participation than otherwise would be thc case. By establishing this new institution, to be known as the Australian Industry Development Corporation, we believe we are taking a major step forward in policies for development and for Australian ownership. The Corporation will operate expressly to assist Australian industry to expand its capacity and scope, and increase its efficiency and competitiveness. It will assist in retaining and expanding Australian ownership of industry and resources. The Australian Industry Development Corporation is designed to fill a very significant gap in the Australian investment scene. Its role will long term balance of payments position. be to assist Australian interests in marshalling financial resources, particularly from overseas, for major industrial development. It will have the capacity to help where the existing banking and other financial institutions cannot meet the financial and investment needs of Aus1 tralian companies for development and expansion. It will assist in cases where the development would otherwise not take place, or would otherwise be possible only with undue loss of ownership and control to overseas. That there are great resources of capital overseas willing for investment in Australia either as equity or fixed term lending does not have to be demonstrated. The facts of capital inflow speak for themselves. If we could get more capital from overseas in non-equity form, carrying a terminating liability for income payments abroad, our balance of payments would be the stronger and our industries less dominated from overseas. What we want to do by establishing the Australian Industry Development Corporation is to create a facility to tap some of this overseas capital for Australian industry, getting it more in the form of loans and less in overseas equity. The Corporation will do this by the same means used successfully by overseas owned industrial companies with their own vast dimension and obvious credit worthiness After very thorough study in Australia and overseas, and very full consultation with many of those with whom the AIDC would hope to do business overseas, we are in no doubt that such a corporation, established by the Australian Government, will be able to tap overseas funds for attractive industry development projects in Australia. The Corporation's objectives and the policies governing its operations are set out in detail in the Bill. The Corporation's task with the strength and security afforded by will be to encourage the development and expansion of Australian industry, including the mining industry and processing and manufacturing industries based on mineral resources, lt will have as a clear objective to facilitate this industrial development in ways which will promote trade both internationally and between the States. It must aim especially at expanding exports on a world-competitive basis, and enhancing our It must seek to enable Australian industry to conserve our foreign exchange by competing with imports without recourse to high tariff barriers. It must attempt to keep for Australian industry the advantages flowing from Australian invention and innovation. In these and other practical cases where its assistance is sought, it must aim to protect and maximise the Australian participation and ownership. The ATDC's task will be to obtain, principally from overseas, the funds required for particular projects which Australian interests themselves have not been able to obtain either in Australia or overseas. Mr Clyde Cameron-They are talking about Jeff Bate. member for Hindmarsh will cease interjecting. This is something very important to the Australian interest. The Corporation will apply these funds in whatever way the particular circumstances of the project require. It will be able to lend to projects, if loan finance is what the project needs. Or it may apply the funds in a mix of equity and loan investment, if the project needs this to avoid too heavy a burden of debt finance in the early stages. This may be the situation, for example, where a considerable time is likely to elapse before the project can become income earning. To enable it to carry out its functions, the AIDC will be set up as a corporation of significant stature and substance. It will be established as a corporation with a capital of $100m, paid up initially to $25m, and the S75m uncalled. The capital which the",55,Australian Industry Development Corporation

The Corporation will be permitted to borrow up to a limit of 5 times its capital and reserves. But it will be required to obtain its borrowings principally from outside Australia. It is, of course, quite properly provided that the AIDC must not be placed in a less advantageous position, in regard to access to local borrowing, than that of overseas companies operating and borrowing in Australia. However, its borrowings in Australia will not only be a minor part of its total borrowings, but will also be expressly subject to limitation by the Reserve Bank. The Corporation's capacity to call up capital beyond the initial $25m to the total issued capital of SlOOm will be subject to special conditions, it is, of course, made clear that the whole of the $)00m capital is available if required lo meet the obligations of the Corporation to lenders. The Corporation will not normally be able to obtain more than S25m of the uncalled capital in any one year, and then only upon 1 year's notice. The last $50m will not be available except to meet obligations, unless the Auditor-General certifies that the Corporation's borrowing has already reached the sum of 4 times its capital funds. As to the Australian Resources Development Bank Ltd, the 2 institutions will work side by side. They are conceived for different purposes. They both will have owed their origin lo initial substantial Government financial and policy support. But they have different objectives. They will have different ways of operation. They will for the most part tap different sources of funds for different types of ventures. The capital of the corporation, including rhe uncalled capital, will provide security for those who lend to it. In addition, the Corporation in its overseas borrowings, will have the added attraction to overseas investors of the opportunity of some participation in Australian development projects which are attractive in their own right. The Corporation, in borrowing overseas, may make it a feature of the loan that some proportion may be converted to an equity shareholding in the venture within a stipulated time. This device, known in financial circles as an equity sweetener, should assist both in obtaining funds from overseas and in the interest rates which have to be paid. The Corporation will have the stature to become a borrower of substance in international capital markets, without the need for Government guarantee of its loans. The point has been widely canvassed in overseas finance and investment circles and we have been assured that the Corporation, as a body established by the Government, with its status and its substance, could become a successful borrower overseas. The Government recognises that the AIDC in seeking loan finance principally from overseas, will be borrowing in capital markets where interest rates may sometimes be even significantly higher than in Australia, especially in comparison with finance from normal Australian banking institutions. This is consistent with the intention that the Corporation should supplement the rote of existing financial institutions and supplement scarce local resources of development finance with cap'tal from overseas. The Corporation will not be a source of cheap finance. But, by its stature and the variety of borrowing methods available to it, it should be able to obtain overseas loan capital otherwise not available except to a very few of the largest Australian industrial companies which could be regarded as having world status. It will obtain this finance for Australian companies at rates which viable industrial ventures should be able to bear-and in fact are in many cases already bearing. There are impeccably sound enterprises in Australia and elsewhere today borrowing at much higher rates than currently apply to institutional finance raised in Australia. Earnings or capital gains from the Corporation's investments will be used as capital reserves, to strengthen its capacity as an international borrower and broaden its assistance lo Australian industry, in accordance with its objectives. The AIDC, though set up by Government, will be a body entirely set apart from Government and operating only within the charter set down for it in the legislation. It is structured to become entirely a part of the private enterprise scene. Its role will differ from the customary role of statutory corporations, or even from a Government owned company or business concern. It will not earn any income for Government revenue or carry out any specific Government function. It will be subject to taxes on exactly the same footing as any public company. The Bill contains specific provisions to ensure that the Corporation will assist only viable projects. It is not designed similar assistance in other areas. The Corto be a supporter of lost or doubtful causes. In accordance with private enterprise principles, it will not be authorised to involve itself in enterprises which are not, in with any power or authority for regulation, the judgment of its Board of Directors, commercially feasible, its operations will be subject to the same tests of commercial viability as are ordinarily applied in business must not become involved in any enterprise planning by the experienced board of any great private enterprise venture. As I have already said, the AIDC will be controlled by an independent Board of Directors. This Board will consist, in the main, of part-time directors, drawn from private enterprise. But it is expressly provided that there must be at least 1 full time director with experience and expertise in finance, and at least another full-time director with a wide knowledge of industry. There will be the necessary provisions for audit and accounts. The Bill provides for Ihe AIDC to have the fullest freedom in its administrative and financial arrangements, so that it may conduct its affairs for all practical purposes as if it were a private enterprise company. An annual report and accounts of AIDC must be presented to the Government and tabled in the Parliament. If the Government, on receiving an annual report of the corporation, considered the Board was not operating in accordance with the policy principles laid down in the legislation, it-the Government -ca n meet with and inform the Board to this effect. In that event, to ensure that this world markets for more and more manuprovision will only be used in a responsible and open manner, the Government must then table in the Parliament its reasons for so acting. The Corporation must not seek a controlling interest in enterprises with which it becomes involved. Moreover, it must regularly review any investments it has acquired in the course of giving as'stance to various projects, and must dispose of those holdings which are no longer necessary to its policy objectives. It is, of course, not required to dispossess itself of these investments at non-commercial prices, nor is it to jeopardise the Australian ownership of an enterprise in the process of such disposal. These provisions are so designed to ensure that the Corporation does not become a dom.'nant element in the ownership of an industry, but continually turns over its borrowed funds to provide poration's role will be to provide a specialised service to Australian industry. There is absolutely nothing in its charter to clothe it intervention, or coercion. The Bill makes it clear that the Corporation may assist in a venture only when its assistance is sought. It except with the consent of the company concerned. There is one matter connected with the present proposals, but falling outside the scope of the Bill, which needs to be mentioned. To give maximum flexibility to the Corporation and other Australian borrowers wishing to attract overseas capital in loan form on the best terms and with least loss of Australian equity, the amending legislation on the taxation of interest on convertible notes, foreshadowed by the Government last September, is being reviewed. There will, however, be no concession applying to the AIDC that would not be equally available to any other company. In conclusion, the AIDC will exist not merely to provide funds for Australian industry, but to provide funds to Australian industry to secure or aid a particular result. It will help to structure industry on a world competitive basis, and to maximise the Australian ownership. No nnanciai institution exists which is charged with this responsibility. There are opportunities in factures produced in Australia, from raw materials at present exported so competitively in unprocessed form. There are pressing needs for Australian industry to expand, and in the process to improve its efficiency, and become highly competitive at home and overseas. There is no institution or facility in Australia which has the primary purpose of encouraging and aiding industrial undertakings to achieve a dimension by which they will be capable of competing in world markets, and of competing with imports in the domestic market. It is to our national advantage for Australian industry lo be able to develop, and grow, with minimum resort to foreign ownership. There is finance overseas which can be attracted by industrial projects in Australia. But Australian interests, in all but a very few cases, have not the stature or international appeal to tap these funds. There is thus a gap in the financial resources available to Australian, as distinct from foreign, firms operating in Australia. The Government believes that the AIDC, which is proposed, will help fill this gap. It believes the Corporation will be able to assist Australian interests, working alone or in association with foreign interests, by marshalling overseas funds in a manner at present only open to foreign corporations. The Corporation will use these funds as required by Australian interests to promote the objectives I have described. As I have said, the AIDC is completely non-regulatory and non-restrictive in nature. It is structured to function in a private enterprise environment and completely in acordance with the principles of free enterprise and the free enterprise system. With the safeguards for private business incorporated in its charter, no existing institution or firm need fear it as a competitor. It is so structured that it can assist Australian interests, where they seek such assistance, in a way for which other nnanciai institutions are not suited. It will not bave the status or privileges of a bank, nor will it function like a bank. It will be able to operate without the limitations that are necessary or usual in the field of banking. The Corporation will be able to participate in projects alongside private enterprise companies, assisting them in the provision of the financial resources needed. But, having become a participant it will be required to play only a passing role. As soon as it can adequately recoup its financial outlays in a project, successfully developed, it will move on to other projects, contributing again to the objectives I have set out. This Bill may well be called bold. It is certainly novel, creative and forward looking. I commend it to honourable members. Dr 3. F. Cairns1 have much pleasure in moving: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. Ministerial Statement Minister)-by leave-Fo r some years North Vietnamese regular forces, and other forces controlled by North Vietnam, have been withdrawing across the Cambodian border after battles in South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese have built, in Cambodia, base camps in whicb their forces could rest, refit, regroup, and be prepared for further military action against allied troops in South Vietnam. This military disadvantage was endured with great forbearance by United States and South Vietnamese forces-for even though the neutrality of Cambodia was being violated by the Communists, the Allies continued to hope that the protests of the Cambodian Government might lead to a cessation of the North Vietnamese invasion. This was a vain hope and since the displacement of the Sihanouk Government by the Lon Noi Government in Cambodia, North Vietnamese and forces controlled by them have extended and expanded their invasion of Cambodia's neutrality. There has been a gradually increasing violation of this neutralitya violation which was grossly wrong in itself-whic h was carried out by a nation which had signed the Geneva Agreement to respect Cambodia's neutrality-and which increasingly gave a military advantage to the enemy and posed growing military danger to Allied forces in South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese have extended westward from the bases they had been occupying. They have attacked, in Cambodia, administration centres, communications and populated areas in Eastern and South Eastern Cambodia. And along with this increasingly cynical and increasingly overt invasion, they have taken steps designed to create a zone in Cambodia, occupied by them, along virtually the entire length of the South Vietnamese border wilh Cambodia. As President Nixon pointed out, tbey have embarked on a programme to make Cambodia a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attacks on South Vietnam along 600 miles of frontier. They have in fact begun a wider invasion, and embarked on a course which poses greater military dangers to Allied forces",58,Australian Industry Development Corporation
83,Mr Gorton (Higgins,"Primethan before. This new military threat, increased in gravity, has led to South Vietnamese and United States forces taking action to protect themselves by crossing the border into Cambodian Territory occupied by thc North Vietnamese. The decision, reached by the President of the United States, was taken on operational military grounds and was designed to protect the lives of Allied servicemen. Those who condemn this decision, as the Government does not, must either argue that there has not been an increased threat to Allied forces as a result of North Vietnamese action-and this is scarcely arguable or tenable-o r they must hold that it does not matter whether there has been an increased threat or not-that regardless of increased danger Allied forces should be left in that danger from the flank and should not try to prevent it. We do not accept this. Our own Australian forces are not engaged in this operation and I see no prospect that they will be. But the effect of the operastatement and I believe that the Prime tion could well be to make all Allied forces in South Vietnam, including our own, more safe. Our own objective for Cambodia is known. We wish to see a neutral Cambodia a country which is not used by anyone as a base or a battleground; a country which enjoys in truth that freedom from interference, that real neutrality which it was guaranteed under the Geneva Agreement and which was breached by North Vietnam.

We do not seek a Cambodia which for the theory that Communist forces should is called neutral but which is occupied in be allowed to operate as and when they greater or lesser part by North Vietnam. like; that they should be excused for For this would be a continuance of the invading and occupying neutral countries; pretence which has prevailed. It would not and that it is wrong for action to be taken mean that the neutrality of Cambodia was to stop them and that such comments by real. And it would mean that South Vietnam giving that support, to me, Sir, show a was endangered. In the Government's view this is the or surrender of Allied forces in South situation. The neutrality of Cambodia has Vietnam. been consistently and progressively violated by North Vietnam. The increasing tempo agree with but I can understand-thos e who of the violation has posed an increasingly wish to surrender in Vietnam, and abandon grave military threat to the lives of Allied the South Vietnamese, and let aggression servicemen. It has also, by widening and escalating the war, threatened to prolong it, and to delay vietnamisation and to delay the time when Allied forces could be withdrawn. The action taken by the United States and South Vietnam was action to protect the servicemen against attack by an enemy which was increasingly occupying a neutral nation. We understand the reason for their action and we find it odd that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) should, on behalf of his Party, viciously criticise that action. It is worth noting, Mr Speaker, that so far as I know not one member of the Opposition, at any time, has criticised the violation of Cambodian neutrality during the last 5 years by the North Vietnamese.

Under Sihanouk the areas of Vietof refugees and immeasurable human suffercong control could be measured in miles or even yards from the border. They are now being measured in hundreds of square miles and even whole provinces. Under Sihanouk there were very few deaths from Communist presence or the occasional insurgence of troops from South Vietnam. The dead can now be numbered in thousands.

I do not want to go into the circumstances surrounding Sihanouk's removal. Undoubtedly the Americans have snubbed Lon Noi and have treated him with the contempt they never dared to show to Sihanouk. They have rejected his request for massive armed assistance. They have invaded his country without giving advance warning or seeking his sanction. The decision to enter Cambodia was taken on South Vietnam's initiative not on Cambodia's initiative.

The whole tone of President Nixon's speech on the Cambodian military presence was deeply depressing. President Johnson said he would not be the first United States President to lose a war. This was the whole theme of President Nixon's speech. It put politics and pride above pity and peace. The maintenance of national prestige was reared above the preservation of humanity. This extension of the war has been widely denounced by responsible sections of the United Stales-the United States Congress and the United States people. The Vietnam war has had terrible effects on America. It has produced the greatest internal social disruption and violence since the Civil War, 110 years ago.

Dr EVERINGHAM (Capricornia) [9.2]benefits scheme is the varying and unpredictable gap between fees charged and rebates received'. This weakness has not been met by this Bill. Whilst there is provision for a specified repayment in cases where the doctor charges a common fee, there is no suggestion that the common fee list will be reviewed regularly. There is no mechanism for this review or updating-. There is no suggestion that doctors will not frame their charges, as many have done in the past, according to the fee schedule, thereby increasing the contribution of the patient in many cases. There is no guarantee that there will be consultation with the profession to maintain confidence in the Government's intention to meet a reasonable proportion of the fee and to leave the patient with a reasonably small amount to find in payment for a specific service. Whilst there has been some improvement same organisation, as I have said, now there is still a very wide gap between the puts up the scheme of differential rebates. provision of a full health service for those who want it and the threat of the large costs of prolonged illness, lt is all very well to say against the proposition.

Therefore this is a hastily conceived schedule with the AMA because it has had scheme to attack what the AMA has second thoughts in view of the outcry from described as the greatest weakness of the the College of General Practitioners. medical benefit scheme according to the Minister's second reading speech. The College of General Practitioners of the fees charged and the rebates gained Australia is opposed to the principle of by patients. There is the Australian Labor differential rebates. The Australian Medical Association proposed this scheme not only as spokesman for the doctors but also largely as spokesman for the voluntary funds. Honourable members should remember that the scheme of voluntary funds is the Earle Page scheme. Earle Page grabbed it with both hands when it was put forward by the British Medical Association, as it then was, as the only alternative offering to a complete national scheme of health services. The BMA produced it in great haste in fear of being conscripted. Of course this is not possible by Federal Government action under our Constitution. However, we have this voluntary scheme and the Australian Medical Association supports it. The Federal President of the AMA is a leading executive of these voluntary health organisations, and he supports the scheme. The Several arguments could be put up There are other solutions to the question of differential rebates and the gap between Party scheme which offers patients an alternativea little bit of competition, which is espoused by means of lip service by honourable members on the other side of the chamber. They tell us they like efficiency which grows with competition. But what competition are they offering us in this scheme? It is the competition of competing insurance funds. The Government has done its best to stifle competition by preventing the more efficient funds from lowering their premiums. It has forced standard premiums on all the funds within rates that are set by the least efficient so that the funds would not go broke and so that the Government would not have to rescue them. The result has been an enormous build-up of reserves in the funds that are more efficient. This is no way to run a competitive system; this is no way to achieve economies of costs. These economies can be achieved without penalising the patient. The Australian Labor Party scheme, I emphasise, allows this competition because we will give the patient the option of going to a completely free service, where top-line top quality medical services will be available, or going to a private practitioner. One members of the otd Blue Cross ancl Blue of the alternatives that has been put inlo practice in another country that espouses free enterprise is the Kaiser scheme in America. We have been told that the moment a service is made free at the point of service, where the patient does not have to contribute a moiety for the service he receives, the service is swamped by overusage. But this assertion is based on the suppositions of economists who have never seen such a scheme work. When they go to a place like Sweden where it does work and they find the service is not swamped, they do not believe their eyes. Of course the people who formulated the Government scheme have not been there. ln America the reverse has proved to be reoources, but the doctors also are more true. For example America has a voluntary contented. They are getting more money scheme like our own. The Blue Cross, the because they have a built-in efficiency Blue Shield and group insurance schemes motivation, a loading for efficiency. They are in competition. The Blue Cross and get a bonus if they can run below their Blue Shield correspond to our voluntary budgets for hospitals, clinics, tests, rosters insurance funds. The group insurance and everything else that is involved. Tf schemes correspond to the Australian Labor they can work within the monthly Party's proposal for a complete service free premiums that are set every year they get at the point of service. Henry Kaiser set a bonus and this bonus ensures they are up such a scheme because he felt responbetter paid than are solo practitioners. What sible for providing a medical service to people in isolated communities where he had hydro-electric projects working. The scheme started with a fee for service system just like the Blue Cross and the Blue Shield and just like the Australian system. People were full of discontent. As the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) told us. they are full of discontent in this country. They showed their discontent in the gallup polls almost more strongly than on any other issue at the time of the last Federal election. When Henry J. Kaiser switched to the group service scheme, the prepayment scheme where the patient contributes a fiat rate and gets all his services on demand, satisfaction and contentment were the result. The scheme has been so successful that today only 3% of the members are his employees. He threw it open lo the public and it has now spread across the Rockies into Denver and it is starting to form partnerships with other group schemes. Other group schemes in other parts of the country have been equally successful. Their record is that members occupy roughly 30% fewer days in hospital than do Shield schemes, which foster the horse and buggy style solo medical practitioner practices on which we rely so much in this country and on which the United States relies so much. Some8 million Americans are now receiving medical care under these group plans. They are subject to the restraints of the market place, restraints which do not occur in the scheme that we have. Here competition is stifled, except the competition that occurs between competing and overlapping voluntary insurance bodies. One advantage that is evident in the American group scheme is this: Not only are the patients more contented and not only is there a more efficient use of is more, they have no worries about bills and they have no worries about whether a patient can afford a particular type of care. They are able to restrain overtreatment and they do so. Quite recently they relieved a surgeon who was a little too fond of the knife. There is a fraternal supervision of 1 man's standard of practice by his colleagues. It is impossible to get this in solo practices. There is a competition among the medical practitioners to see that they practise good medicine, that they get the regard of their colleagues. The final piece of competition, which is quite absent from the Australian scheme, is that patients are enabled to compare the work of different doctors in the clinic and so get some awareness of the quantity and quality of medical care they should be getting. That is something which is almost entirely absent from the Australian scheme. These are accepted market principles at competition which make for efficiency in every other type of industry with which n private enterprise government claims to concern itself. There is a sharing of the financial risks by the community so that people do not have to worry when they have a severe illness. Costs are supplied in some regions. There are autonomous regional organisations under the Kaiser scheme. There are even some alternatives allowing for the degree of cover a patient can have; he can decide whether he wants to cover himself for 111 days a year or for the whole year. By and large it is a comprehensive system; the existing voluntary schemes are not. The voluntary schemes have to be helped out and subsidised by the Government's special fund and by all sorts of patch-ups, help-outs and hand-outs. The other schemes are self-sustaining and they are multiplying at the maximum possible rate. They had a total cash flow in 1968 of SUS17.2m on revenues of $US16m and this has provided them with enough funds for expansion. They are expanding now at the rate of 200,000 members a year. This refutes the very widely held and widely sponsored belief among Government circles, medical circles and voluntary insurance circles that if a medical service is free or virtually free the public will stampede into it. The reverse is the case. Over-use, inefficient use and over-treatment occurs in the voluntary system because there the patient goes for the service where he will get the biggest return and this is built into the surgical rebate system in this Bill. It will be cheaper for the patient to have an operation, which will cost the Government and the community more, than to avoid the operation. This is a built in incentive to over-treatment. Not only do they get the virtues of efficiency due to group practice in these Ka ser centres with all the facilities on ; tap at one place and with the best possible hospital equipment, but they are actually going way ahead of many hospital administrations because of the integration of doctors with hospitals and their interest in seeing that these hospitals are efficient. They are aiming at cable electronic recording of a patient's medical history right through his life. Many of them are already on computer tapes. The Minister, the Government and their friends, in their opposition to the Labor Party's scheme, have spoken out of poor knowledge, incomplete knowledge, out of ignorance of the comparative virtues of a pre-payment scheme as against a voluntary insurance scheme. We have had thrown up at us the British scheme and have been asked why doctors leave the United Kingdom. We are not seeking to bring in any British scheme. We are seeking to maintain a fee for service scheme and alongside it a free public service which the patient may have if he wants it. We are not afraid to see the two of them competing. We believe that we will see which is the better systemwhether the doctor will rather earn a salary as a specialist in a well equipped centre with regular relief, with regular study leave and refresher courses, with the proper facilities for research and teaching that have never been available in this country, or whether he will prefer to go on struggling along being half the time businessman, half the time doctor, and never knowing when he will have all his facilities in the one centre instead of having to spend a lot of his time travelling from hospital to hospital and from surgery to clinic. One of the speakers from the Government side referred fo the qualifications for entry to medical school. This has already been taken up by the College of General Practitioners. In the last issue of the journal of the World Medical Association, which was largely devoted to the question <f general practice, a very strong argument was put up for the general practice section of the medical school to be the dominant section. Now it is the also ran, the after thought, the thing that is tacked on if a place can be found for it somewhere when all the money that is necessary for all the specialist departments has been provided. This is not the way to run a medical education system. If we want doctors who are primarily doctors and who think primarily of patients-that is, primarily of health-and not primarily of specialist compartments into which a body can be carved up, then we have to put the prime emphasis on the whole patient. We will not get this under a system that is dominated by specialists. The general practitioner must be of at least equal status. As the editorial in the journal points out, quite possibly the dean of the medical school will have to tell these specialists, who are forever trying to enlarge their empires within the medical course, what their proper place is and what is allotted them in the medical course. The Bill has touched on the production of certain vaccines. Goodness knows, it is high time that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in particular did have a freer hand to produce and to provide all kinds of medical supplies and not be limited in the way that it is out of deference to private drug firms. However, there is a subject that is of even more importance from a public health point of view than vaccines. It has been brought up and discussed time and time again during my time in this Parliament and for years before that. It is a subject on which the Government has shillyshallied, hedged, shuffled and referred back to the States and to a conference of Attorneys-General to see what laws they think ought to be made. I refer to what was described in the 'Medical Journal of Australia' of 21st February of this year as the principal avoidable cause of premature death-smoking . It is a long time since smoking came under this cloud of suspicion. On llth January 1964, after 15 months of intensive study, the Surgeon-General's Advisory Committee said: Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient vision stations and the radio stations: Importance in the United States to warrant appro'Business as usual', and so it is. We had a priate remedial acdon. It stated unequivocally that cigarette smoktobacco companies here about 4 years ago ing is causally related to lung cancer in I think-it does not matter, because we men and far outweighs other factors. Air have not seen any change intiieadvertising i pollution was found to be a very minor factor in the cause of the disease. It noted that the death rate from heart disease was 70% higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers-enoug h to assume that it was a cause to take action against. This was in 1964. This subject has been debated in all the newspapers and journals around the world since 1964. The Committee found that cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of chronic bronchitis in the United States and that it increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Doctors knew this when I was a student. More than 4,000 published reports were studied and more than 150 investigators were personally interviewed. Members of this Committee were not ratbags. They were eminent scientists who had never made any public statements on the question of smoking and health. Their appointment was approved by the tobacco industry as well as by the American Medical Association and other health agencies. Half of them were cigarette smokers. This report was the most comprehensive and authoritative report ever made on this subject and every report since has confirmed it, including the Public Health Services reports of 1st July 1967 and 1st July 1968. Every paper and survey that has come out since, some of them trying to be more comprehensive, if at all possible, have only served further to confirm these facts. Well, what has the Government done? In America the Government has done little enough. The tobacco lobby-it lobbied very intensively-manage d to water down the Bill which was recommended by the Committee. The Committee wanted to have all cigarettes and all smoking advertisements labelled with the warning: Warning. Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases. This is how it came out through the sieve of the Senate: Caution. Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health. The sign was hung on the doors of the teleconvention, gentlemen's agreement, with the as a result of it-that they would not do anything in their advertisements to show teenagers smoking or to show sportsmen and spectators of athletic activity smoking, and half a dozen other very cleverly worded restrictions of this kind. But the cigarette as went on as before showing near teenage people, near sportsmen and observers of virile activities smoking. Of course, there is every kind of subtle suggestion to lead viewers, particularly young people, to believe that cigarette smoking is the key to fun and games with the opposite sex, good times at home and abroad, world travel, social success and virility. Finally the Federal CommunicatiOHS have been more confused than previously Commission decided to do a little bit. It as to what the Australian Labor Party's was shamed into doing something about policy on health was, and I am sure that broadcasting and television. It must be they would have nothing to do with any remembered that the non-smoker never of the suggestions or ideas of the Opposition reads this watered down warning on the on this Health Bill.

In fact, the concluding portions of the amendment moved by the Opposition. In second reading speech of the Minister for doing that, I must confess that there are Health (Dr Forbes), when he mentioned one or two matters in this National Health the position of low income families, bring Bill about which I have some doubt and home to us some of these problems.

Families with incomes this legislation. If one looks at some of the between recommendations and suggestions that have been put forward by the medical profession one realises that there is some contradiction even within the profession. However, following the establishment of the Nimmo Committee and what is now known as the 'Nimmo report', it was obvious that the Government had to take steps to improve our national health scheme. I am sure that anybody who listened this afternoon to the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) leading for the Opposition in the debate on this piece of legislation would, from the moment that the honourable member for Oxley finished, The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr of the complexities of this legislation. He pointed out some of the difficulties, particularly in relation to the benefits that are As a result of the increase in the Commonproposed to increase the eligibility level for insurance for low income families to In future, families with incomes of up to per week will be entitled to full medical $42.50 per week and $45.50 per week will be eligible for the same benefits on payment",63,Cambodia

That is why the Minister in his second was first brought into being some little while reading speech mentioned assistance to those ago there was a certain restriction upon in the low income group.

They might say: ""We pay taxation, people. I feel that there is a need to examine therefore to this degree we are contributing the relation between the payment under this to the scheme'. But I believe that in any scheme and the attention given by the doccontributory national health scheme there tors to see whether there should be some should be an acceptance of a degree of alteration. responsibility by some of those wbo are receiving the benefit.

Tbis is, perhaps, an area in There are 2 factors which could contribute which there is a degree of concern in the to this. One is that so many cases would be medical profession. I think we can say referred to specialists that there would without any hesitation that the concern of almost be no need for the general practimembers of the medical profession is not tioner, except as a person who would refer e concern for their own financial position, a patient to a specialist. The other is that profession one would find some people who are more concerned with thefinancialreturn than with the care of their patients. But in the very large majority of cases the concern There is general agreement on the prinbe seen in the extension of the pensioner medical scheme. Whea this scheme those who were receiving the benefits of 1 would also use that as an example of of my worries is that if this disparity those entering the meiiical profession might feel that in the circumstances they should study to be specialists and not go through the period of being a general practitioner. This would be detrimental both to the patients and to the profession. To my mind it would be of greater detriment in the country areas where specialist treatment is not always available. The general practitioner has a tremendously important part to play not oniy in relation to the physical welfare but also the psychological welfare of the patients. This is a very important part of the medical profession. Those of us who have had any experience at all know the tremendous value cf a general practitioner, the old famtiy doctor. That doctor is a very important person to ihe family not only in providing medical care but also in providing assistance to the family in many other ways. As1 said, those of us who have had any experience of this relationship realise the tremendous value of the family doctor to family life. If this were to be lost, as I said, it would be of great detriment not only to the medical profession itself but sented by the Minister. I have some doubts, also to the community at large. The other matter 1 wish to mention is that if we follow this to its logical conclulegislation has become effective and is in sion we will see that because so many practice there cannot be a certainty in people are being referred to specialists by relation to some of the queries and doubts the general practitioner the specialist will that we might have. To that degree I am lose his value. The extent of a specialist's glad to know that the Minister has said that practice is limited and he has more time it after a period of time it can be proved to devote to the study of his particular that anomalies exist in the legislation he will speciality and to keep himself up to date certainly take steps to eradicate them. with those matters that are of vital importance to him as a specialist. If, by the fact of so many people being referred to him, he has to participate in surgery or even year, as my colleague the honourable in the examination of patients who in the member for Calare points out. I am sure normal course of events would not be that, the doctors having presented their under his care, to this degree we are in point of view, the Government will have the danger of weakening the position of the support of the medical profession and that specialist. I do not want to go into greater further discussion with them on the legisladetail on the matter of funds or any other tion will be of benefit to both the medical aspect because these have been covered profession and the people of Australia. and will be covered by some of my colleagues on this side of the House when honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Hamer) they make their contribution to the debate opened his speech by suggesting that a on this legislation. Those are general comSocialist government would be determined ments that 1 wish to make in relation to to nationalise the medical profession, that this legislation. The Government has been criticised practise at their pads-the y have been because all the recommendations of the called drug pushers, so I presume that 5 MAY 1970] National Health BiU 1613 Nimmo Committee have not been followed. Because a government appoints a committee or asks a committee to investigate a particular matter, it does not mean that the government has to accept any or all of the recommendations of the committee. The purpose for that committee is to investigate certain circumstances related to the subject matter that it has been given the authority to investigate. The Government has an understanding and an appreciation of the total position. This is not necessarily held by the committee which has been making the investigation. The Government must always retain the right to accept or reject all or any of the recommendations made by the committee. I would anticipate in any particular sphere that a government would be mindful of the knowledge of the men who have been on that committee, whatever the subject matter may have been that it was investigating. It would also accept the full responsibility for ultimately making a decision and putting that decision into legislation. As I said, 1 support the legislation prewhich 1 have expressed, relating to some of the matters. I appreciate that until the Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) [9.52]-The doctors would be sent here or there to",69,National Health Bill 1970
91,Mr England,Before the end of the year.,71,National Health Bill 1970
92,Mr Lucock,"Before the end of thethat is the right phrase to use-and that patients would be directed where to go. The implication is the use of force and regimentation. That surely is a lot of rubbish. Such a feeling seems to be rather common amongst some honourable members on the other side of the House. There are several reasons why it is rubbish. First of all-n o doubt the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes), or. the Attorney-General( Mr enough doctors being produced. Even worse, Hughes), both of whom are at the table, can reassure us on this-the Constitution would not permit the nationalisation of the medical profession. I take it that that is right. The Australian Labor Party has no intention of waiting until the Constitution has been amended by referendum before it undertakes to do something about a national health scheme. There is a further and, 1 suggest, much more serious reason why we would not be in favour of nationalising the medical profession. I lake it that we can all accept that the medical profession would be very unwilling servants. I am sure that I would not want to be treated by such a doctor. I am sure that no-one else in this House nor anyone in the community would, either. What confidence could one have in a doctor who is an unwilling servant? Apart from the law there is a perfectly valid psychological reason why we should not nationalise the medical profession. Of course, if honourable members opposite had bothered to keep up with their reading they would have noticed that that is no longer the policy of the Labor Party. The honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) suggested that the difficulty is that doctors' fees have been going up faster than they should have and that this has created a dreadful problem for the Government, that it has widened the gap between the actual fees and the payments from the benefit organisations and the Government. He suggests that this is imposing dreadful hardSocialists on this side of the House had ships on the community, that it is the doctors' fault and that the Government has had to do something about it. The sad reality is that this is a world-wide phenomenon. He also implied that doctors are earning a lot of cash, and he quoted a recent survey conducted by the University of Melbourne to prove this point. I do not doubt that at all. It is true. The reality is that, despite the high incomes, there are not enough doctors in this sort of Western society. Again, that situation is not confined to Australia. It is a world-wide phenomenon. I am not necessarily asking for more or less money for doctors. I am interested in having enough doctors for the community. It is no good belly-aching about how much money they earn or do not earn. The fact is, whatever they are earning there are not of those who are graduating not enough are becoming general practitioners, for very good reasons. For rather less dedication in terms of hours, with better conditions, with living in large cities and having all sorts of other facilities quite apart from their medical needs to make for a better life for them, doctors can become specialists and earn at least as much as, and often more than, general practitioners. All the incentives are against their becoming general practitioners. The community is suffering from a shortage of general practitioners. The doctors are overworked. If one goes along to see a doctor one would be lucky to spend 2 minutes with him before he started writing a prescription. It is not necessarily his fault. There may be fifty other people waiting outside in the consulting room. The reality is that the sort of medicine a general practitioner should be dealing with requires more time. He has to earn his living. At $2.80 or $3.50 a consultation, if he can push each one through in 5 minutes instead of an hour, he is obviously so much better off. These are the reasons why patients get short shrift. These are the reasons why I used the terms 'pad' and 'drug pushers'. To compensate and to cope the doctor too often is forced to prescribe a barbiturate rather than listen to the complaint. The honourable member for McMillan, in complaining about the Labor Party's vicious proposals, indicated that the received unexpected support from the Nimmo Committee. He indicated that it was fortunate that the Government had placed restrictions on the ambit of the Committee because, if not, it no doubt would have come up with full support for the Labor Party's Socialist scheme, which is none other than a national insurance commission. I was shocked by what the honourable member said. I have noted the composition of the Committee. It included Mr Justice Nimmo and Sir Leslie Melville. I doubt whether either of those gentlemen would be a Communist or a Socialist. I suppose the culprit must have been Mr Norman Mcintosh. He has not a title so I suppose he must be the suspect one who wound the others around his little finger. 1 think it is an incredible suggestion that the honourable member made. If the hint-it is a very broad hint -containe d in the Nimmo report is that a national health insurance scheme would be the best thing for the country, then I would suggest that that is probably what the facts show. One bas to consider the purpose of this whole expensive exercise, the national health scheme. It costs over 6% of our gross national product these days and it may be nearer 7%. By comparison, the British scheme is rather cheaper for rather more. It runs at about 5%. Thc Americans spend over 7% on their health service. The only point I want to make out of that is that health services are expensive wherever you go. Because you have a seemingly free health scheme, in the sense that you pay for it in tax rather than by direct contributions as the British do, it does not necessarily mean that therefore it will be more expensive, that there will be runaway expenses and that people will over-use the medical profession. I know that that is what we all love to say and what we feel, but it just is not true. Even in this country we have the example of the pensioner medical scheme to prove the point that I am trying to make. I give due credit to the Government for bringing in that scheme. When it was first brought in many critics claimed that the pensioners would so over use the medical profession that no-one with a real illness-becaus e it was automatically assumed that pensioners do not have illnesses; I do not know why that assumption was made but that was the assumption -and the ordinary paying patients-thi s was a key matter-woul d be able to get anywhere near the doctors. When you look at the statistics, they appear to confirm this view. The usage of doctors by pensioners went his income, expected to pay the bill? All up steeply and all tbe pessimists said: 'There patients, irrespective of their incomes, are you are. It will not be long and that will expected to subscribe to a medical benefit be tbe end of the doctors.' But after a few organisation. Irrespective of their incomes years it levelled off and it has stayed steady. they contribute the same amount. In real In my view this means that the rise inditerms this means that the poorer you are the cated the under utilisation of doctors by more you pay. The essential thing is the pensioners when they still had to pay. In fact, once their legitimate demands for medical services were met a ceiling was reached. It did not continue to snowball and in fact it was self-regulatory because no-one wants to go to see a doctor unnecessarily, lt is not fun. You go because you feel you need to see a doctor, and that is a good enough reason for going to sec him. Even if there is only a fear which he is able to cure by simple reassurance, that is good enough justification for going to a doctor. What is the reason or the purpose for for this whole expensive exercise confronting us in this BiU? Is it to ensure that the community has the best health services, or is it to ensure that the people can pay for whatever it is that they get? I would like to suggest that the present scheme is solely concerned with ensuring that doctors, hospitals, chemists and all the other services covered by the scheme are paid for, irrespective oi the need for the service or the quality of the service provided. Leave aside the whole question of quality and forget any doubts about that for the moment. The exercise then is to ensure that the health service providers-the doctors aud the hospitals-ar e paid for their services, irrespective of whether the person wbo receives the service is rich and able to pay for himself, or poor and clearly unable to pay for himself. Let us examine the present scheme and the proposed improvements and see how they will function. Any patient irrespective of his income is free to go to his doctor of choice. Let us consider the doctors simply because that is an easy illustration for the whole scheme but I do not just mean doctors. The doctor is free to charge and he is expected to charge and encouraged to charge the common fee specified in the schedule. It is true that he is not forced, but I think the moral pressure is there to impel him, ;o adhere at least fairly closely to the schedule, if not exactly to it. This fee is charged the patient irrespective of his, the patient's income. How is the patient, irrespective of final amount of money which has to pass out of your pocket for the insurance cover. As payments to benefit funds are tax deductible the poor man will get back in tax refund a negligible amount of the money he paid whilst the rich man will get perhaps half of it back. I am not concerned at the fact that a rich man pays more tax than a poor man. I accept that as I assume we all do as social justice which has motivated not only modern social welfare states but many other earlier and even ancient societies. The principle of 'the richer you are the more you pay' is not in question. I am concerned only with the specific December 1967. He said: payments for health insurance purposes. The fact remains that in a final analysis the rich were pay less than the poor for their hospital and reserves. The overall retention rate . . . 23.2%. medical benefits. But let me come back to In other words, for every SI paid in 23cthe patient paying his bill. If the theory is plus finished up going not to pay for the right, most of the bill will now be paid by the medical service but just to run the whole benefit organisation payment and the Commachine. He gave some comparisons with monwealth payment, leaving the patient to other countries such as America, a beautipay up to $5 directly out of his own pocket. ful free enterprise community. He said: Statistcally, most of the medical expenses in this community are incurred by patients large Blue Cross plans, retentions were only 7% visiting their family doctors. The patients of contribution revenue in 1961, compared with will expect to pay at least 80c per visit and 28.1% in Australia. Relevant Canadian data are many will have to pay more for ordinary limited consultations as the most common fee conprovincial hospital plans. cept means that many fees will actually be higher, and I doubt whether doctors now The Canadians are a bit ahead of us. In charging more will bring their fees down. 1960-61 the expense and retention ratios of That is business. When we again apply to Canadian non-profit medical insurance these payments the taxation rebate which organisations were 7.9% and 15% respecwill be much higher for those earning high tively. Thesefigurescompared with 15.2% incomes we again find the poorer sections of and 24.9% for their counterparts in Austhe community will be paying much more tralia. Deeble said: for their medical services than are the wealthy sections of the community. I take it that the purpose of the exercise is to ensure that the doctors' bills are paid. Boy, what an under-statement! In other For a given number of medical services words, the effect of this Bill is not only to the medical bill is a clearly defined sum. force people to pay the total hospital and The 12,000 or so doctors will charge their medical expenses, which of course any fees and they wiil get their money. But scheme would undertake to do, but in addiwhat will the community pay? That is the tion for the privilege of calling it voluntary question. There is no suggestion that the we are expected to add 25% to the total Government is contemplating that doctors bill. How does all this differ from the shall receive more than they are receiving Australian Labor Party proposals? For the at present, though as an aside I will take moment I will deal not with all aspects but a bet that if this scheme works the doctors only with the problem of paying the will in fact get more than they received doctors. There is no suggestion in our proin the past. But I must not digress. I am posals that anyone will be directed to go sure that was not the Government's intento any particular doctor any more than tion. The whole purpose of this exercise under the present scheme. There is no is to get a definite sum of money out of the pockets of patients and into the pockets of doctors, hospitals, etc. Let us examine the mechanics of the procedure. We pay taxes. A certain amount of the money we pay gets lost on the way in running the Taxation Branch. I believe it is about 2%. We pay contributions to benefit organisations. They cost money to run and that money has to come from the contributors, so it is added to the final sum which finishes up in the pockets of doctors. I would like to quote from an article by John Deeble in the 'Economic Record' of By 1965-66, operating surpluses of nearly SlOm achieved which with income from investments provided an addition of about $13.4m to For non-profit hospital insurance under the to medical insurance, since voluntary hospital insurance has been replaced by universal It would be unfair to attribute these differences to the deficiences of Australian management. The whole Australian system is intrinsically expensive, stronger suggestion of price control than is contained in the Government proposals, ln other words, we can assume that whatever are considered legitimate expenses in the Government scheme-doctor s and hospital expenses, that is-the Australian Labor Party would accept. The difference between us is in the way we would collect the money from the patients. Firstly, we would collect it through a single collecting agency. That would save all the running expenses of all the 114 or 120-howeve r many there are-hospita l and medical funds. The collection would not be On a flat rate irrespective of income so that when taxation rebates are allowed the rich pay much less than the poor. Our collection rate would be graduated according to income so that the rich pay more than the poora principle accepted by this Government for most of the taxation revenue in the country anyway. In the handling of payments to the providers of the health services, even if we do not improve on the present system one can accept the expenses of the so-called closed benefit funds now operating and show that the cost will be cut in half. Their expenses run at about 6% or 7%. This would be the effect if we were using in essence one closed fund, namely the national health insurance scheme. But the tragedy with all this discussion about money, money, money is that it is irrelevant to what should be the real concern of a national health scheme-that is fhe availability and quality of medical and hospital care. Much is made of the claim, as the Minister asserted it, if he can pause for a moment in his conversation to recall his statements in the House a couple of weeks ago, that people in the United Kingdom had to wait I hope that honourable members have the a long time for certain operations. The picture-the background of the study. This Minister made the assertion that one had is vvhat Dr Lawson found in general terms: to wait a long time for hernia operations in the United Kingdom and this pretomy, and hysterectomy for intermediate and prisumably meant that people there were not vate patients in Australia-i.e. , those who arc getting their operations when they should. surance supported fee for service system-appea r Other suggestions have been made at to be much higher than for American and British various times that if we had what we are patients who are cared for by physicians who do proposing, the usage rate would go up. 1 not receive fees for individual services have hinted at this earlier; I have tried to Oddly enough the operation rates for illustrate it with the pensioner medical hernias were similar in each category of scheme. Apparently, if one does not have patient. I will give some figures. In Austrato pay for it we would all want many more lia, where we have our glorious free enteroperations than we would want if we had to prise and fee for a service, the operation pay for the services, it is apparently fun to have an operation. If we do not have to pay for it, we are all in to get it. I would like to quote from the proceedings of the Australian Hospital Association 1969 Congress from a paper delivered by Dr Lawson, who is now the Director of Hospital Services in Tasmania. He discusses this business of the difference between fee for service and a salaried medical service when doctors do not get paid a fee for this service and they are paid irrespective of how much work they do or how little work they do. It gives them a chance to indulge in the government stroke. I h e data was obtained, Dr Lawson says, from the medical benefit organisations in New South Wales and Victoria and from the Commonwealth Department of Health. He used rates amongst insured members for hernia operations, tonsils and adenoid operations, appendix operations and hysterectomies. This information, he says, was then compared with data from the United States of America and the United Kingdom. It is done in terms of the operation rate which is expressed as the annual rate per housand members. He says: With the exception of herniorrhaphy or hernia operationsthese particular operations were selected for study as the criteria for these operations are not clearly defined and thcy are the most frequent types of operations performed on a given population. Herniorrhaphy was included because the criteria for operation are relatively clearly defined one either has a lump or one does not. Dr Lawson continued: These factors allow herniorrhaphy rales to be used as a guide to the comparability of data between countries and between methods of payment to doctors. Operation rates for tonsillectomy, appendiceccared for by doctors remunerated under an inrate for tonsils and adenoids was 7 per of medical care is inferior if the doctors 0)00 on a fee for service basis.

The whole previous speaker from this side of the concept of salaried service versus fee for House where doctors are paid a salary and service has been analysed. I shall read where it is not a fee for service, the operaanother quotation from the artitcle by Dr tion rate for the same sort of operation was Lawson: only 4 per 1,000.

In the United Kingquality dom where there is a free health service, that the contrary situation exists in that comthe operation rate was only 3.6 per munity, thc perinatal and infant mortality among 1,000.

The first relates to the concept of the common fee-the concept that is basic to the whole scheme. 1 would have thought that by now there would be little argument about this, but I find that this is not so for the Section of General Practice of the New South Wal'es Branch of the Australian Medical Association has said in a document very recently sent to honourable members that the Government has misused the concept as originally presented by the AMA; that the concept was developed by the AMA as a guide for the Government and the health insurance funds in setting rebates-in other words, a private matter, as they describe it. 1 could overlook these statements if the document did not go on to say, as it does, that the Government is now preparing a list of most common fees to fund members, which is said to be a break in faith. I assume this is meant as a breach of faith. It is unfortunate that this allegation of a breach of faith should have been made and doubly unfortunate because it is wrong. The first point to be made is that the most common fee concept was put forward by the AMA itself and put forward as far more than a guide. The AMA made submissions and recommendations to the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs and it made a specific recommendation on the common fee concept. Its recommendation was in these terms: Within each State a comprehensive table of more than customary charge has been made; and medical benefits should be available to contributors, here the complaint might well be levelled at the designed to return by way of rebate at least 80% particular doctor, rather than at the National of current customary charges for each service Health Scheme or the Funds. listed. The reasons advanced in support of that recommendation were what one would have expected them to be-that the public was faced on the one hand with varying medical charges from doctor to doctor and State to State but on the other hand fixed benefits were payable by the Commonwealth and the funds. Indeed, it was the great defect and criticism of the previous scheme that there was such a substantial gap between the medical fees charged and the rebate which the patient received. So it was natural that the principle should have been resolved to determine the fees most commonly charged or customarily charged, as the AMA put it, and that the rebates which a patient would receive would be based on that common fee. It was that scheme which the AMA advanced in its submissions to the Senate Select Committee. It was that scheme which it again advanced to the Nimmo Committee. It was that scheme which was advanced by the Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia to both committees. It was the scheme recommended by the Nimmo Committee itself. Now we see the Section of General Practice of the New South Wales Branch of the AMA alleging that the common fee concept was only a guidea private matter which the contributors were not to know about-and that there has been a breach of faith by the Government. I reject this, Sir, for no other reason than that the AMA itself recommended a system of common fees as the basis for calculating the rebates to be paid to contributors. The intention of the AMA, clearly, was that the common fee concept should be adopted, that it should be used, and that contributors should know about it so that no longer would they validly be able to complain about the unpredictable gap between doctors' fees and rebates. One segment of the AMA's own submissions to the Senate Committee and the Nimmo Committee should be enough to bury the myth that the New South Wales general practice section has raised. It said: With the establishment of such a schedule of benefits complaints from contributors about the amount to be paid in addition to rebates should disappear, except in an occasional case where a The second of the criticisms of the legislation to which I wish to direct some comments is the criticism of the proposal for differential rebates for the cost of medical services performed by both general practitioners and specialists. At the outset, I want to repeat that this criticism has come from well meaning and honest people who are influenced by the desire to keep the general practitioner as the fulcrum of medical practice, to keep him available as the general source of medical knowledge and experience in the interests of the general public. I know that the general practitioner groups who have criticised the scheme and have offered alternatives have done so honourably and with the welfare of the public and the type of medical service available to the public as their prime motivation. Nevertheless, criticisms of the scheme have been made and thos: criticisms need to be met or accepted. First, it is claimed that if this legislation is implemented general practitioners will die out and disappear; people will rush to the nearest specialist at no extra cost; and that the young graduate will be deterred from going into general practice because the financial rewards of specialist practice will be greater, and because of the danger that the general practitioner may become little more than an office doctor. After giving a great deal of thought to this argument I have come to the conclusion that, although there may indeed be some weight in it, it is certainly not sufficient to justify opposing this legislation or altering the scheme at this time. Nevertheless the Government will have to give close and continuing attention to the effects of the legislation on general practice. It will have to watch closely the trend of graduates to go into general practice or into a specialty. And if there are signs developing that general practice is not getting the stream of recruits it needs to provide the service that only general practice can provide, then the Government will have to amend thc rebates scheme or provide incentives to ensure that there are adequate numbers of general practitioners. I believe that the general practitioner is still held in such awe by the community that patients will be guided by their advice as to whether to consult a specialist. It should not be assumed that merely because in some cases a patient may receive specialist treatment at no greater cost than general practitioner treatment, there will be a mass migration away from general practitioners to specialists. Such a view overlooks the regard that the public still has and will continue to have for the family doctor and the natural desire on the patient's part to have one doctor treat him for all conditions for which he is competent to treat him. One can proceed only on one's own assessment of what is likely to happen when the scheme is operating and my own assessment is that there will not necessarily 15361/70-R-[62 J be a mass desertion of the general practitioner. If there develop signs that this will be so and that the consequence will be a loss to general practice, then I repeat that the Government will have to amend the scheme or make other arrangements to ensure that this vital section of medical practice remains the substantial and useful section that it now is. It is because of the fear of some of the critics of the scheme that the scheme will erode the position of the general practitioner that proposals for amendment have been put forward by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These proposals, it has been said, have been prepared after careful consideration and it is clear from the detailed nature of the proposals that this is so. The most significant of the proposals is a series of amendments which the College would like to see made to the Schedules. The principle on which these proposals have been made has been stated by the College in the following terms: A single scale of benefits be introduced so that those procedures carried out by and normally accepted as within the province of the General Practitioner would attract the present General Practitioner benefit, whilst those procedures more exclusively carried out by Specialists would obtain the present Specialist benefit. As I understand it, it is proposed that alterations should be made to the Schedules to delete one or other of those items for .which there is both a separate specialist Commonwealth benefit and a non-specialist benefit. Which benefit remains in the Schedule is determined by whether the medical service in question is one carried out and normally accepted as a general practitioner service or a procedure more exclusively carried out by a specialist. The first comment to make about such an approach is to question the desirability of using any such division and providing one rebate, whether the service is performed in fact by a general practitioner or a specialist. Such an approach strikes at the very basis of the Government's proposal that a patient should be able to have specialist treatment when properly referred and receive a rebate of his costs based on the fee commonly charged by specialists. To calculate his rebate on the fee commonly charged by a general practitioner when the service has been performed by a specialist and when the specialist has charged the specialist's common fee is an entirely different scheme and one which gives the patient less in his rebate and obliges him to pay more out of his own pocket. It seems to me that the Government's proposal is sensible, is based on the b trd facts that some services will be performed by specialists although they are also normally within the province of the general practitioner, that specialists will charge the specialist's common fee and not the general practitioner's fee, that patients will want to be referred to specialists and that general practitioners in some cases will refer their patients to specialists. All that being so, the which to make some comments on that. patient's rebate should be calculated on the specialist's common fee, as the Government proposes, and not on the general practitioner's common fee as the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners suggests. The second comment I make about these proposals from the College is that if there is to be a system of single rebates instead of differential rebates, it does seem curious that the test for a specialist's rebate should be whether the procedure is more exclusively carried out by a specialist. I would have thought a service was exclusively a specialist service or it was not. To describe a service as more exclusively a specialist service is curious because it suggests that a service is not exclusively a specialist service, and not within the province of the general practitioner, but somewhere in between. If this is so, it seems strange why there should be a higher rebate for that type of service even though it may be performed on a particular patient not by a specialist but by a general practitioner. This gives me some doubt about the manner in which the dual benefits proposed by the Government have been broken up by the College and distributed over all medical services as a single scale of benefits. However, having made those comments I want to repeat that the Government will have to keep a close watch on the operations of this legislation when it becomes law. It should remember that criticisms of the Bill and suggestions for amendment have come from responsible men and their professional organisations and that in particular they have drawn attention to the possibility of general practice suffering from the operation of the legislation. I am not convinced that it will suffer. But the Government must continue to examine closely the workings of the scheme, any excessive use of specialists that appears and the recruitment of young graduates into general practice. For general practice to suffer and lose its position as the basis of medical practice, as has happened in some other countries, would be a disaster. FinallyI wish to make some comments, very briefly, about another matter which is of considerable importance, that is, the lack of doctors in country areas. This seems to me an appropriate occasion on Many country towns are without doctors. There are whole areas in the country that do not have them. My own electorate includes some near country areas and one of them centres on a town named Whittlesea. The people of that area do not have a single doctor available to them and have to travel many miles to find a doctor or rely on a doctor to find time from his practice to travel to Whittlesea to see the patient. This is a quite unsatisfactory situation which should be rectified by some means or other. T put it as a bald proposition. If private initiative cannot encourage doctors and give them the incentive to go to country districts, and this is one area where it has not happened, the Government must provide incentives and other types of encouragement to get doctors into country areas. There is a desperate need for them and something should be done about that aspect because people in the country are suffering very severely. Having made those comments may I repeat what I said at the outset. In my view the Bill is a very substantial one brought about by a great deal of hard work and thought. 1 commend the Government strongly for the legislation it has introduced. Dr JENKINS (Scullin) [10.43]I cannot join the rather dewy-eyed optimism or admiration of the honourable member for Diamond Valley( Mr Brown) for this Bill. I must admit he left me speechless with his modesty with regard to his breadth of appreciation of relevant health services. I find it rather difficult to address myself to this Bill for 2 reasons. The first is the very breadth of the subject matter which has been opened up and the second is my complete contempt for the theory of payment, the theory of revision of medical and health services contained in this Bill. To me it heaps inequality on inequality, iniquity on iniquity. It is a complete fraud. It arises out of an investigation by a committee that was restricted in its terms to examine only voluntary health insurance. That committee did a good job within those terms but there are many other aspects of financing health services that should have been considered. Was the Government frightened when laying down the terms of reference that it would find its wailing over many years that this was the best type of health service was completely false, and was shown to be by a committee which it appointed? Of course it was. Today we have been led to the first bed of a rather didactic clinical wardroom. The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes), figuratively dressed in the flowing robes of a Ph.D., gave a preliminary oration earlier and today we have dissected the whys and wherefors of the Government's and medical profession's responsibilities for financing. But while we have gathered around the bed and drawn back the sheet from the patient, he has been left there shivering except when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) spoke of the quality of patient care and massaged some life back into him. What is this patient concerned about in thc provision of health services? Firstly he wants the best quality of medical care. Secondly he does not want the overwhelming cost of such care to threaten the whole economic basis of his life and his family's life. What guarantee has he of the quality of medical care? What steps have Federal and State governments taken to ensure this quality? They provide the majority of beds available in hospitals for the patients. They even subsidise private hospitals extensively, not only through the fees paid but through various other arrangements that are made. For example, in Victoria the interest rate on a loan for the construction of a private hospital was greatly reduced and guaranteed by a government. Admittedly it was not this Government but we cannot divorce the State Government from the Federal Government in the hospital held. Governments also in their own way deterearn his income. mine the nature of the government of hospitals, how thcy are run and the composition of their boards of managehas 323 beds. At least 60% of those are ment. But of quality they require for private and intermediate patients. The none, relying only on actions in tort for negligence or actions in criminal law for even worse to apply the necessary sanctions to encourage the practitioner to maintain his standard of care. The only other check is the knowledge of admitting officers and medical superintendents at these hospitals. Doctors notorious for cavalier or inefficient patient treatment find that when they telephone for a bed all beds are full. We have heard about bed availability and we have had comparisons made with the hospitals of Great Britain. But let us look at the situation of those unfortunates who have to use public hospitalsI am not saying they are unfortunate in the quality of care they receive because often here they receive the best care-and are waiting for elective surgery. I invite the Minister to check with some of the hospitals in which he should show an interest and find out just what these waiting periods are for hernias and such like, for the stabilisation of diabetics and other medical conditions. He will get a surprise. It is all right if a patient can pay to enter a private hospital. He can get a bed there provided he can pay. What responsibility does the medical profession accept in quality control? Surely it cannot be said that this type of health Bill is just a measure for financing where the agreement is primarily between the Government and the patient. Each trained doctor, even if he has paid his own fees at university, has been heavily subsidised by the Commonwealth and State governments. The cost of his subsidy during training is somewhere between $6,000 to $8,000. He does his further hospital training in hospitals which were expensive in capital outlay for buildings and equipment paid for by governments which also subsidise the maintenance and staffing. What is more, he is paid. This provision is made for him by governments. The profession does not supply it. When he goes into practice the financial basis of his practice will be repatriation and pensioner medical scheme patients. These are the fairly constant recurring factors in his income and they provide the basic bread and butter for him and his family. He will use hospital facilities provided by the Government and expensive equipment provided by the Government, to The community hospital in my electorate facilities there are paid for by the Government for doctors to obtain their income. So the doctor has certainly a great responsibility for the quality of medical care. I suggested that payments for repatriation and pensioner medical scheme patients are important but it seems that patients who are covered in these 2 categories are the only responsible patients we have because those payments require no contribution from the patient at all. Under this scheme all other patients are irresponsible. They must pay the margin between the rebate and the actual fee charged. They are irresponsible. They are out of the group. Once these people reach 65 years of age and become pensioners, they also become responsible patients instead of receiving the same privileges that repatriation and pensioner patients rightly receive. The honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) spoke on some of the quality control measures that doctors can use. As he pointed out, these measures were used particularly in the Kaiser Prepaid Health Scheme. I point out that not only is quality control imposed in that instance but also that this pre-paid scheme, which I had the pleasure of seeing in operation some 18 months ago, supplies medical and surgical treatment and also hospitals and training for nurses. In addition, it provides for research and all the other factors that make a complete health service. This is something that this Bill does not propose although it is called a National Health Bill. There are many other services like this one. I mention as an example the Windsor Medical Service. That is a pre-paid scheme whereby doctors contract and are subject to very severe discipline by their peers-that is, by their fellows-wit h regard to their rates of visiting, quality of service and so on. This scheme is so well respected that it is endorsed by the Essex and Kent County Medical Societies, by the Ontario Medical Association, chartered by the Canadian Government, and so on and so on. These are the sorts of comprehensive schemes that can cover so many factors. What is this quality control that is needed? I suggest that the medical profession has to accept, criticism in this field for this. They will have occupied hospital beds its lack of activity. It is only recently, because of the discussions that have arisen out of this Bill and because of the pressures of hospital administrators who are unhappy with the standard of care in their hospitals, that the accreditation of hospitals is starting to be talked about. This is accreditation of hospitals on the basis of buildings, facilities and the equipment that is applied there. This accreditation of hospitals would be done also on the basis of the competency of the medical practitioners working there, lt would be done not by a big brother committee but by members of the medical profession themselves. They would conduct medical and surgical audits of the performances of doctors. For example, a pain in the chest may indicate a coronary occlusion. They would determine how many cases involving pains in the chest DoctorX had admitted as coronary occlusion cases and in how many of those cases his diagnosis was accurate. This quality control is important for the major reason of proper patient treatment. Proper patient treatment in these cases requires intensive care units. Such units are highly expensive to operate and so will reflect on thc costs of services. Surgical audits assess the ability to diagnose and to perform an operation properly. Tissue committees can confirm this. I regret that the Minister for Health has no knowledge of this type of procedure although it is now pretty common knowledge amongst hospital administrators and doctors. A simple question related to this matter has been on the notice paper since 19th March. Simple ancl all as it is, and with his wide discussions on these matters, thc Minister for Health is unable to answer that question. What it leads up to then is a delineation of privileges of the individual practitioner and the privileges that should be extended to him in the hospital. His primary degree in medicine and surgery should allow him a limited number of procedures, in which most general practitioners can be skillful if they apply themselvesthe ordinary appendectomy and so onbut this work must be subject to quality control. It is of no good his ripping out 10 appendixes quite successfully and having the patients go home but when the tissue committee has a look at them finding that only 1 of the 10 shows any pathology at all. The patients will receive a rebate on unnecessarily and have been subjected to an unnecessary operation with the attendant risks that apply to any operation. And so these privileges are gained by constant training of the doctor-the doctor who wishes to apply himself to the use of new techniques and new procedures and who becomes well trained and improves the quality and skill of his work. If this is so, what argument is there for differential rebates? Surely the rebate is for service skilfully performed. Differential rebates merely serve to suggest to the community that there are 2 standards of medical care-the first rate and the second rate. The real speciality procedures would be carried out by specialists. If it is neuro-surgery, obviously a general practitioner would not try this procedure; the neuro-surgeon would do it. The speciality procedures clearly define themselves. But if a general practitioner is skilful enough to do the routine operation, as is the specialist, why should there be differential rebates? After all, if the specialist is so skilful he is probably able to do 3 appendix operations and rip out a pair of tonsils for an encore in an hour while thc general practioner is doing 2 appendix operations. It seems to me that we are forgetting the quality of medical care for the patient as being the criterion by which the medical practitioner is paid. We are taking too much notice of university degrees as the measuring stick for this. I have a degree in medicine and I admit that after a number of years in a State Parliament and now here I feel that I am obsolescent for expert procedures. I am not ashamed of that. I have applied myself most faithfully to parliamentary duties. If a man does this he is unable to keep up with the techniques of advancing medicine-no t the knowledge . of medicine, new procedures and the organisation of medicine but the actual techniques. This is why I come down hard on this matter of accreditation, audits and delineation of privileges as a way to ensure quality control of medical service and to allow this rather vexed question of differential rates to be got out of the way. What we have is really not voluntary health insurance. How can it be voluntary health insurance when there is such a large government contribution to make it viable? We hear that if our scheme for health services, paid for by a compulsory type insurance scheme, was instituted the payment by the Government would destroy the doctor-patient relationship. What a lot of nonsense that isi What a myth this is! I shall quote from an address given by Professor Griffith, who is Professor of Hospital Administration at the University of New South Wales, to the Tenth Australian Area Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in April of last year. I think he made a rather good comment on this financial relationship between the doctor and patient. He said: When not protesting about the possible loss ol professional freedom the less well informed members of the profession, and this seems to be a majority, protest that the present direct doctorpatient financial relationship is hallowed by centuries, if not millennia of sacred tradition. Debate interrupted. and in accordance with the Order of thc House of 16th AprilI propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr SneddenI ask for your indulgence for a moment, Sir, while I settle an issue of procedure. It has been indicated to me that the honourable member for Scullin wishes to continue for about 10 minutes in order to finish his speech. We do not want to interrupt him. For that reason I would require that the question be now put without debate. We would then negative the question. Upon the conclusion of the period required by the honourable member to complete his speech I will move the adjournment of the House forthwith. I propose then, if necessary, to close that debate because of the arrangement that there should be no adjournment debate on a Tuesday evening. That the House do now adjourn.

How many representatives did they have in the controlling body of this organisation? Out of a possible 52 members of the board controlling it they of the Victorian Branch of the Australian At the meeting at which the contributors' representatives were elected there were 51 voters remaining when the final vote was taken. But 17 of that 51 were senior staff members of the Hospital Benefits Association. This is the situation in which the voluntary health insurance organisations have been put under the present scheme. This Bill does not alter that; as I say, it keeps these iniquitous and inequitable matters going on. The present system means waste. It involves no suggestion of checking the quality of service by the doctors. Under it there is no attempt to keep down costs. IfI had time. I could also cite from this document the amount of money used by the voluntary health insurance funds in straight out political manoeuvring. They say that they reserve the right to answer unfair criticism or to correct misunderstandings of the present system of health insurance. That is their let out for opposing any scheme that does not envisage their continuing. I regret that I cannot have more to say on that matter. We look at their administrative costs and find that they range up to about 15% of contributions, whereas Windsor Medical Services Inc. in Canada has an administrative expense of 5.5 cents out of each SI. Although it has been said that general practice is dying off, we find from the document that office, home, night and hospital calls by medical practitioners cause an expenditure of 44.3 cents per $1. In rounding off I would say that it is pretty obvious that I reject materially the principles and ideas behind this Bill. We have said that we would not oppose it because there may be some benefit from it for the lower income group. However, 1 have grave doubts about this. I hope that I have indicated that there is a responsibility of government, of the medical profession, and of patients to be considered in what sort of care is given to the community.

98,Mr Bury,"The answer to the honourableQ o t h in g Industry (Question No. 194) Mr Stewart asked the Ministerf o r Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Can he say (a) how many people are employed in the Australian clothing industry and (b) what proportion is (i) male and (ii) female. (2) What is the capital investment in the industry. (3) ls the clothing industry a reasonably decentralised industry. (4) Is the industry efficient. (5) Are some sections of the industry experiencing grave difficulties from imports from countries which are noted for low wages and poor working conditions. (6) What is Ihe intention of the Government regarding protection for (his industry. able members question is as follows: (1) Employment in the clothing industry (including hosiery and knitted goods) totalled 101,266 in 1967-68. Of this, 17,692 were males and 83,574 were females. (2) Capital investment as at 30th June, 1968 in the clothing industry group was $197m. of which $142m. were invested in land and building and $55m. was invested in plant and machinery. (3) Statistics are not available on the number of factories located in decentralised areas. However the clothing industry like other textile operations is a substantial user of female labour. Labour of ihis type is available in country centres and the clothing industry has established in decentralised areas to take advantage of it. (4) The industry has been spending substantial sums of money and devoting a considerable amount of time to the matter of efficiency. In the year ended 30th June, 1968, for example, it invested approximately SI3m, in new plant and machinery. It is conducting a number of intcrfirm comparisons in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry. (5) Within the last two years, manufacturers of knitted outerwear, knitted shins and woven shirts encountered severe import competition. All three sectors of ihe clothing industry were referred to the Special Advisory Authority who found the need for temporary quantitative import restrictions on the knitted goods and temporary duties on woven shirts. The recommended temporary protection was imposed and the Tariff Board is currently conducting an inquiry into these sectors. The Department of Trade and Industry has before il no applications for review of protection in other sectors of the garment industry. (6) The long established policy of the Government is to afford reasonable and adequate protection to economic and efiicient industries. Careful consideration will be given to any further request for such protection. Post Office: Wages (Question No. 272) Mr Les Johnson asked the Postmaster General, upon notice: What is the number and classification of persons employed in his Department who receive a weekly wage (a) less than the basic wage and (b) with a margin over the basic wage of (i) less than $1, (ii) between $1 and $2, (iii) between $2 and $3, (iv) between $3 and $4, (v) between S4 and $5, (vi) between $5 and $6, (vii) between $6 and $7, (viii) between $7 and $8, (ix) between $8 and $9, (x) between $9 and $10, (xi) between $10 and $15 and (xii) between $15 and $20. able member's question is as follows: There is now no basic wage prescribed in Federal Awards or Determinations. For purposes of answering the Question, the average has been taken of the minimum wages prescribed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in respect of tbe various States of the Commonwealth. This figure at present is $42.40 per week. To answer the question on the basis of actual salaries presently applicable would involve Ihe scrutiny of thousands of pay cards decentralised throughout the Commonwealth. However, Departmental employees receive annual increments and adults generally attain the maximum of their salary range within a relatively few years. Therefore maximum attainable rates for adult males, which can more readily be ascertained, have been used in answe-ing the question. On the foregoing basis, the following details are given in answer to the question. (a) No Departmental employees receives less than the minimum wage. (b) No Departmental emplovees receive a margin of: (i) less than $1.00. (ii) between $1.00 and S2.00. (iii) between $2.00 and $3.00. (iv) between $3.00 and $4.00. (v) between $4.00 and $5.00.

(3) Did the Reserve Bank reject a request by the Australian Resources Development Bank lo provide such a cover in the early stages of its operations before it built up reserves. (4) Has consideration been given to thc circumstances in which the Reserve Bank can provide cover for the Industry Development Corporation. member's question is as follows: (1) The Banking Act 1959-1967 and the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. (2) , (3) and (4) Tbe forward exchange facilities provided by the Reserve Bank are designed primarily to facilitate export and other current transactions, and cover is available only for the normally short periods required for such transactions.

University of Papua and New Guinea: Staff (Question No. 572) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (1) How many (a) European and (b) nonEuropean expatriates have been appointed to the staff of the University of Papua and New Guinea. (2) For what periods have they been given (a) appointments to the staff of the University and (b) permits to enter the Terrilory of Papua and New Guinea. (3) Do non-European appointees have to obtain extensions to their permits at shorter intervals than European appointees; if so, why. able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 200 European expatriate staff were employed by the University as at April 1970, (b) 6 non-European expatriate staff were employed by the University as at April 1970. (2) (a) Academic staff are appointed for lerms according to their classification. Professors are appointed initially for six years, lecturers and senior lecturers for three years and tutors and senior tutors for one year. The contracts of nonacademic staff range from two to six years in duration, (b) Permits for appointments of less than two years are for the period of appointment only. Permits for appointments of two years or more are for two years in the first instance. (3) Yes. Extensions for Europeans are normally for two years. Extensions of non-European permits may be considered on the circumstances of the case but are normally for one year. This arrangement gives effect to the policy of admitting limited numbers of highly skilled or key non-Europeans for limited periods. The Administrators Council was fully consulted before this policy was introduced in 1966 and it recommended some amendments in the policy and administrative arrangements proposed. As adopted the policy and arrangements include the changes recommended by the Council. ' Japanese Moto r Cars (Question No. 593) Mr Hayden asked the Ministerf o r Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement made in Melbourne on 12 March by Mr William Bourke, Managing Director of Ford Motor Company of Australia, in which Mr Bourke attacked Japanese small car marketing in Australia and revealed that he had told Ford dealers that the Company was looking forward to the day when Japanese cars would not be seen in Returned Services League Club parking lots. (2) ln view of the Japanese motor companies' commitment to working within Australian government policy, will the Government dissociate itself from an attempt to restore old prejudices which are increasingly foreign to this country and which could lead to misunderstandings with our major trading partner. MrM c E w e n In reply to the question of the honourable member: 1 have not seen reports of the statement attributed to Mr Bourke of the Ford Motor Company hut in answer to the second part of your question I would point out that it has been Government policy to trade with the Japanese on a basis of mutual co-operation and advantage for many years and in 1957 a Trade Agreement was signed with Japan which formalised the trade relations between the two countries. The expansion in trade that has taken place since that date has proved beneficial on both sides and Japan is now Australia's biggest customer and took $822 million of our exports in 1968/69. On the other hand Japanese exports to Australia totalled $415 million in 1968/69. This volume of trade is indicative of the good relations that exist between Australia and Japan.",88,Local Government Authoritles A Revenue Debt Charges And Percentage

103,Mr Barnes,"The answer to the honourPapua and New Guinea: Contracts of Employment (Question No. 667) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (1) What penalties, if any, apply to agreement workers in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea for breach of a contract of employment. (2) Are wages due to such workers paid in full at regular fortnightly intervals. (3) Are all sucb workers granted annual holidays with pay; if so, what are the details of such paid annual leave. (4) Is an employer obliged to pay the return fare to enable an Agreement worker on annual leave to return to his native village for the duration of his annual leave. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Native Employment Ordinance 1958-67 under which agreement workers are employed in Papua and New Guinea does not prescribe penalties for breaches of agreements by agreement workers. The Ordinance provides that an agreement may be terminated by a court, upon application by the agreement worker or the employer. The court may: (a) make an award to the agreement worker for loss of wages, allowances, issues, etc., where the agreement is terminated because of thc actions of the employer; or (b) make an award to the employer for out-ofpocket expenses where the agreement is terminated because of the actions . of the employee. (2) The Ordinance provides that an agreement worker must be paid his accrued current wage or such portion as he elects to receive on the last day of each lunar month (i.e. 28 day period) after the commencement of the agreement. These wages may be paid instead at other times mutually acceptable to the employer and thc worker. The 'accrued current wage' excludes deferred wages which are paid on termination of the agreement. A minimum of one third or one half of the wages payable to the worker, depending on the length of the agreement, is paid as deferred wages. (3) The Ordinance provides that all agreement workers are entitled to: (a) recreation leave at the rate of 6 days for each year; and (b) long service leave at the rate of 18 days for each 5 years, of continuous service with the employer, plus Sundays and public holidays occurring within the period of leave. Recreation leave accrues annually for agreement workers accompanied by their families, and at two year periods for unaccompanied workers. Long service leave accrues at the end of each period of S years. Pro rata recreation and long leave is given in cases where agreements are terminated except on the ground of General, upon notice: serious misconduct hy the agreement worker. (4) No. Papua and New Guinea: Native Employment Ordinance (Question No. 669) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for External Territories upon notice: (1) Does the Territory of Papua and New Guinea Native Employment Ordinance apply to thc Kandrian District. (2) If so, what is the minimum wage and what are the provisions relating to (a) money in lieu of rations and (b) money in lieu of tobacco prescribed by the Ordinance for native plantation workers in the District. (3) How many of the workers are (a) provided with free accommodation, rations, medical treatment etc. and (b) paid money in lieu of accommodation, rations etc. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The prescribed minimum wage for the Territory which applies to the Kandrian sub-district is $52 per annum for the first year of employment, $58.50 per annum for the second year and $65 per annum for the third year and thereafter of continuous employment with the same employer. The minimum wage also includes payments in kind in the form of rations, clothing and other prescribed articles, accommodation, and medical treatment at specified standards. (a) Money in lieu of rations may be paid to an employee if a labour inspector appointed under the Native Employment Ordinance issues a permit either: (i) to an individual employee; or (ii) to an employer in respect of each of his employees who resides in the area specified in the permit. The issue of a permit is dependent in part on whether there is an adequate supply of native food readily available to the employee. A casual worker may be paid money in lieu of rations if there is agreement between the worker and the employer. (b) An employer, if requested, may pay a weekly amount equal to the value as assessed by the Secretary for Labour in lieu of tobacco to a person entitled to a weekly issue of tobacco. Currenly the money allowance in lieu of food and other articles, for the Kandrian Sub-district is $1.85 per week and the payment in lieu of tobacco is 13 cents per week. (3) (a) 97.

If the Post Office does the work, subscribers have (and often take) the opportunity to reduce their expenditure to varying degrees by assisting with either labour or materials. With the several alternatives offering to subscribers as outlined above, coupled with the subscribers having the right to choose between aerial and cable construction and since the number of subscribers on a common route, nature of the terrain, etc., all bear on the cost factor, it is not possible to estimate the effects of providing a 30% subsidy. (2) At 28th March, 1970, there were 2,650,717 services in operadon. Instruments connected totalled abut 3.75 million.

Prosecutions: Attorney-General's Consent (Question No. 139) Mr Whitlam asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: Has he given thought to tbe question of compiling and maintaining a list of the Commonwealth and Territory laws that render the consent of the Attorney-General a necessary pre-requisite to a prosecution for an offence. able member's question is as follows: Yes, 1 have given thought to this matter. The compilation of such a list would inevitably be a protracted task, since it' would be necessary to examine carefully not only the Statutes and Statutory Rules of the Commonwealth but also the Ordinances and Regulations of the Territories. However, I have concluded that it is desirable that such a list be prepared and maintained. Accordingly, I have given directions that the preparation of such a list be commenced by my Department but because other projects must be accorded higher priority I have not asked that the task be treated as urgent. Judiciary Act Committee (Question Nu. 137) Mr Whitlam asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: Will he, before the second reading of a Commonwealth Superior Court Bill, table the Judiciary Act amendments which the Solicitor-General's committee has drafted to implement the Superior Court proposal (Hansard, 26th September 1969, page 2140). able member's question is as follows: The Commonwearth Superior Court Bill that was introduced during the twenty-sixth Parliament 10 11 lapsed when the House of Representatives was 1 1 dissolved. I am at present considering whether the 8 3 Bill should be re-introduced and, if so, in what 1 form.

(2) What steps is the Commonwealth Statistician talcing to secure reliable figures on this subject. member's question is as follows: The Acting Commonwealth Statistician has advised that there is no one source from which statistics of registered nursing personnel in Australia can be derived. Some information can be obtained from the registers of nurses maintained in each State, the A.C.T. and the Northern Territory: from information obtained during the Australian population censuses: and from returns provided by hospitals and nursing homes.

The registers of nurses are not a satisfactory source of statistics for this purpose because of differing requirements in each State and Territory, double counting under different categories of nurses, duplication of registrations as between States and registration of nurses who do not follow the profession. Information obtained from the 1966 Population Census is inadequate for the purpose because nurses were included in a category which also includes trainees but excludes nurses working in other occupations at the time of the census as those would be listed under those occupations. Statistics of nurses provided by hospitals and nursing homes include student nurses, nursing aides and other nursing staff without full qualifications and exclude nurses employed outside those institutions. The Statistician has advised that he is examining the practicability of obtaining separate classifications of 'certified nurses', 'probationers or trainees' and 'nursing personnel not elsewhere classified', for purposes of both the next Census and the annual returns from health and welfare institutions. He is also examining the possibility of obtaining statistics which would include qualified muses working in other occupations at the time of the census.",99,Enterprises

Prior to that date work force figures were published only in respect of the actual population census data. A consistent and continuous work force series dating back to 1950 is not, therefore, available; however, estimates based on the information that Limited Coast Trade is available have been made in my department. A number of assumptions have been made in preparing these estimates and they are not. therefore, regarded as definitive.

The estimate is based on interest paid in 1968-69 on advances for the purchase of dwellings made by banks, life insurance businesses, superannuadon funds, building societies, publicfinancial enterprises and instalment credit companies, lt does not include loans from personal sources. The earlier estimate provided on 28th August 1968 by my predecessor related only to amounts identifiable as housing loans made by the traditional lending institutions. As was pointed out, the earlier estimate did not, for example, include the cost of allowing deductions for interest on loans for housing obtained from finance companies or from personal sources.

The Commissioner of Taxation is conducting a thorough examination of the arrangements involved and is pursuing the matter vigorously within the framework of our existing lax laws. It is not possible at this stage to indicate what courses of action the Government might take in this matter. Oil Drilling (Question No. 674) Mr Charles.

I refer the honourable member to the Ministerial Statement which I made in the House of Representatives on 23rd April 1970 on Migrant Education. The comprehensive programme outlined in that statement with respect to adult migrants and' intensive courses will provide remedies in a number of the areas to which Professor Connell referred in his paper 'Education for Adult Migrants'. Others will require research which will be a continuing process. There are some aspects to which Professor Connell referred, for example, the emphasis upon vocational education and the question of allowances to be paid to migrant students attending part-time accelerated courses or, as Professor Connell suggests, semi-intensive courses, which are receiving further consideration by my Department in consultation with the Department of Education and Science.

American Land Holdings In Australia (Question No. 16) Mr Calwell asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a news item in 'The Australian' of llth February last which quoted the Wall Street Journal as having recently published an article headed 'The Great American Land Grab' in which it was claimed that Americans now hold between 60 and 70 per cent of the 'Top End' of Australia where leases for station properties sell for between 10 cents and a dollar an acre. (2) If so, is it a fact that leases bave been acquired as claimed in the article and does the list of American landholders lengthen daily. (3) As thc 'Top End' of the Northern Territory consists of a tropical rainfall belt of rolling range and wooded hills, will he take steps to prevent American speculators from seizing more of the leaseholds of a very valuable and very vulnerable part of Australia. (4) Did the Gunn Land and Exploration Partnership recently buy the long-term lease to Coolibah, a 3,965 square mife 'Top End' cattle station situated on the Victorian River. (5) Can he say whether this partnership is a largely American syndicate and whether Sir WiUiam Gunn, the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, was active in the negotiations for the purchase. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. As thc Wall Street Journal article of 9th February 1970 specifically deals with the Northern Territory, I assume that the Right Honourable Member's question refers to the Northern Territory. (2) The position in the Northern Territory is greatly exaggerated by the article. In the Top End of the Territory, roughly north of latitude 16°, American interests hold 20 pastoral leases under pastoral leases. Only3 of these leases were purchased during the past 2 years, including 1 by an American immigrant who has settled in the Northern Territory. (3) No. Government policy is to encourage Australian participation in developing the pastoral industry rather than on limiting overseas investment. The Crown Lands Ordinance provides that if an applicant for a new pastoral lease is a resident of the Territory, the Land Board shall, in making recommendations, give due weight to the fact that he is such a resident. On the other position created whereby the owner of a pastoral lease in the Territory who wished to sell it was pective purchaser came from overseas.",103,Localgovernment Revenue A

The Northern Territory Administration has sought details of any recent share transactions concerning Coolibah Station but these have not yet been received. Electoral: Interstate Voting (Question No. 699) Mr Hansen asked rhe Ministerf o r the Interior, upon notice: (1) Are many persons who seek to vote for a candidate in another State often deprived of a vote because the Divisional Electoral Oflice is many miles away. (2) If so, will he consider allowing the Assistant Returning Officers at major polling booths power to receive interstate absentee votes during the hours of polling. able member's question is as follows: (1) Any person who, throughout thc hours of polling on polling day, will not be within Ihe Slate for which he is enrolled, may make an application for a postal vote any time after the tenth day prior to the issue of the Writ for an election, although ballot-papers cannot be issued in response to an application until after the hour of nomination. An elector outside the State for which he is enrolled who has not applied for a postal vote prior to polling day may, on polling day itself, attend personally at the office of a Divisional Returning Officer and there and then record a vote. The number of interstate electors who fail to avail themselves of the postal voting facilities before polling day and then find lhat they are unable to attend at the office of a Divisional Returning Officer for the purpose of voting is unknown. (2) When the Commonwealth Electoral Act is next being amended, consideration will be given lo extending voting facilities so that Presiding Officers may issue voles on polling day to electors absent from the State for which they arc enrolled.

Australian Capital Territory: Pensioners' Land Rents and Rates (Question No. 658) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for the Interior, upon notice: (1) When did his predecessor announce that he had approved legislation to provide relief from Australian Capital Territory land rents and rates for pensioners and other persons on fixed incomes. (2) Why did it take so long to make the Land Rent and Rates (Deferment) Ordinance notified on 26 February 1970. able member's question is as follows: (1) In April, 1967. (2) The primary reason for the substantial period of lime taken to finalise tbe Land Kent and Rates (Deferment) Ordinance was the solution of a number of complex legal and technical problems involving the protection of the rights of anyone associated with the subject land. Public Service: Annual Leave (Question No. 713) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact lhat 4 weeks annual leave has now been granted to employees in the stevedoring industry.

(2) Following my discussions on 1st December 1969 wilh a joint deputation of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations, the Government decided that having regard to existing relevant circumstances it would be inappropriate to grant an extra week's leave to the Commonwealth Public Service at that time. This is still the Government's view. Causes of War (Question No. 702) Dr Everingham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Does he support the principles of the Australian Parliamentary Group for World Government namely, that unbridled national sovereignty is an essential factor in war and that governments should give a lead in fostering the rule of law at world level. (2) Will he make an early announcement on Australia's attitude to the proposed United Nations Charter reforms to be considered this year, including modification of tbe veto and other moves towards democratic control of international causes of war. able member's question is as follows: (1) I assume that the reference in this question is to the principles of the Australian Parliamentary studies in connection with these projects.

(2) Has he any evidence to confirm or deny that napalm or white phosphorus is used as an antipersonnel chemical by allied forces. Mr Malcolm Eraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have read the newspaper report but believe there is room for considerable divergence of opinion as to its implications, and 1 would require to be given much more precise and detailed information on the matters reported by this newspaper before I could make 'any reliable assessment of them.

(2) If so, has he any information which would confirm or deny the figures. Mr Malcolm Frasei-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. Vietnam: Napalm (Question No. 313) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Is tbe atmospheric concentration of carbon monoxide produced by napalm combustion higher than that produced by other military incendiary substances. (2) Is he able to say whether the concentration of carbon monoxide is comparable to concentrations produced in vehicle exhaust gases by an equal am inclined, however, to think that the cost figure weight of motor fuel. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised the proportion of carbon monoxide in the combustion products of a given weight of napalm burning in the open is similar to that produced from the same weight of other organic materials burning under like conditions. Other military incendiary substances are inorganic in nature and do not themselves produce carbon monoxide: however, ignition of natural combustibles resulting from the use of these incendiary substances will produce some carbon monoxide, the amount depending on the conditions of combustion and the nature of the combustible material. plant, animal and human ecology studies of the (2) 1 am advised as the combustion of motor fuel in an engine is normally incomplete, carbon monoxide is formed, the amounts varying with conditions in the engine. Much work has been done on this subject inrelationto its contribution to air pollution. For example, one typical investiundertaken and reported. These are: gation has shown that the concentrations of carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases of 100 randomly selected cars ranged from 1 to 12%, the average figure being 7%, viz. 70,000 parts per million. On the other hand, such a concentration is only achieved within the flame, and one inch from the surface, of napalm burning in the open; immediately beyond the flame the concentration falls to less than 10 parts per million. (The maximum allowable concentration for prolonged human exposure is 50 parts per million). It is evident therefore that the amount of carbon monoxide produced from the combustion of motor fuel in an average engine would in normal circumstances be very much greater (roughly 1,000 times greater even for good engines) than the amount produced by combustion of the same weight of fuel in the form of napalm. Vietnam: Use of Herbicides (Question No. 314) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Can he say if Operation Ranch Hand involved aerial spraying over 5 million acres of Vietnam up to 1968, including over 600,000 acres of crops using over $l63m worth of herbicides.
