Given To Me Yesterday, That The New South Wales Traders Protection Associa","tion, after a meeting held on the 3rd June, 1937, announced that on and from the 7th June, J937, all butter must definitely be retailed at not less than Is. 5d. in 3 936-37. If I may refer honourable per lb., will the Acting Prime Minister draw the attention of the Government of New South Wales to this interference with the principle of freedom of trade? Will the right honourable gentleman also a.sk the retailers association to consider the rights of men who, for conscientious reasons, believe in supplying the general public with butter at a lower rate than that fixed? Further, will he use his best endeavours to persuade the Traders Protection Association to do the just thing liy the consumers of New South Wales? orable member's question appears in the records .of Hansard, I shall forward it to tection which the local manufacturers rethe Government of New South Wales for information and action. CUT-GLASS INDUSTRY . Trade and Customs in a position to reply to my question, which was asked the other day, hi regard to the dismissal of employees from the Crown Crystal Glass Company Limited? Trade and Customs) -by leave I promised the honourable member, in response to his inquiry, that I should order a full inquiry to he made into the matter. I have now received the report of those investigations, and it unfortunately verifies the fact that the cut glassware section of the Crown Crystal Glass Company Limited has been closed. Inquiries which I had made this morning, indicate that the principal reason advanced by the local manufacturers for the closing down of the works was the fact that large importations were being made from Czechoslovakia at prices with which the local company found it impracticable to compete. The company also stated that six months' stock of locally-made cut glassware was on hand at the time of the closing of the works. It is true that imports have increased. They were valued at £91,000 iu 1934-35, and at £109,000 in In view of the answer 1935-36, whilst for the first nine months of the current financial year the figure was £119,000. The sales of the Australian manufacturers, though, have also progressed. They were £42,000 in 1934-35, £56,000 i i i 1935-36, and £62,000 members to the Tariff Board's report on lhis subject, it will be found that, despite the high duties which have obtained in the past on this commodity, the local, manufacturers have secured only 25 per cent, of the local market. This definitely indicates that in a luxury line such as cut glassware, purchasers will exercise their preference, no matter what the cost. The local manufacturers .ascribe a further reason to the closing down of the works, namely, insufficient tariff protections, and higher wages. In this connection it might be of interest to honourable members to learn that the total proceive against German and Czechoslovak cut glassware is 85 per cent, ad valorem, made up by:Pelcent.

5,Mr Whi Te (Balaclava,"Minister forI n an examination of a matter of this nature, which is connected with an international treaty, one must consider the benefits which Australia is receiving consequent upon these treaties. Although treaties were concluded with only three European countries, namely, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and France, other countries, such as Germany, also received the same treatment as that accorded to the treaty countries. The principal overseas countries supplying cut glassware to Australia .are Czechoslovakia and Germany. Our export figures for the first three months of this calendar year during which the treaties have been in operation, comp&re with the three months of the previous year as follows:1937. £A. Czechoslovakia Germany. . It is therefore apparent that Australia is getting its share of the bargain. I cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the profits made by Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited over the la.3t few years:Net Frcflt. Preference. Per cent. 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 11.7 15.9 n9 1936 1937 Taking into account its action in dosing down the cut glassware section, these profit figures appear to indicate that this company's concern is rather the preservation of its dividends more than, the interests of its employees, by maintaining the cut glassware section in production. If this company considers it has insufficient tariff protection on the cut glassware section, because of wage increases or for any other reason, then, in the best interests of its employees, it should have made a proper approach to this Government before taking such a drastic step. I have always said that if those engaged in an industry think that the protection is inadequate they may approach the authorities with a view to having it increased. FILM PRODUCTION TS governments have passed an act dealing witha. film quota, while the Commonwealth Government has withdrawn its bounty on the production of films in Australia. Has the Minister for Trade and Customs seen the' report which appeared in the press yesterday, that Mr Stuart Doyle had said that the Commonwealth Government was not encouraging the production of 1936. films in Australia, that it had £A. .. 247,636 .. 223,917 withdrawn its bounty, and that he 1,140,290 .. 699,851 was going overseas to get business? Will the Government consider the desirability of helping the industry generally, and promote the production of films in Australia by the granting of a bounty? ber's question opens up a big subject. The Commonwealth has assisted the film Dividends. industry in Australia by granting it adequate protection, amounting to 4d. a foot, Ordinary. on ordinary films and 8d. a foot on feature films imported from foreign Per cent. Per cent. countries. I do not think that any section 18.3 9 of the Australian film industry can claim 17.0 9 i2ithat British importations, which are free, 6.95 0 6 have put it out of business, because, 8.35 9 7* strangely enough, American films still 11.1 9 9 predominate on the Australian market. 9 13 The Commonwealth encouraged the 18.5 9 15 better production of films in Australia 20.9 9 15 by adopting my suggestion that prizes should be offered for the best films of the year. That, I believe, definitely improved the quality of the film's produced. It was not intended to be an annual award, but at the time definite encouragement was given by it to scenario writers and producers. The comments of the Australian producer who is proceeding to England are hardly fair to the Commonwealth Government. The difficulty is that apparently Hollywood has very nearly a monopoly of production because of the greater facilities it possesses. In spite of the help given to the Australian industry, it has not been able to compete with Hollywood.",10,Setup

As a matter of fact, the original proposal was to make the duty Is. a foot, but the Opposition protested so strongly that the Government compromised. Treasurer say when the Government expects to receive the report of the commission that is inquiring into the disabilities of the States that have asked for financial assistance from the Commonwealth? Will he expedite the consideration of the report by the Government as soon as it is received, so that it may be released to the States and they may have an opportunity equal to that of the Commonwealth of considering it when framing their budget proposals? the report will he received within the next fortnight.

I pointed out that that loan had been approved by the Loan Council The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked me whether the approval of the Loan Council was given unanimously. I regret that my reply was not completely accurate, although, of course, I spoke as I understood the position to be. I said that there were no dissentients. In point of fact, there was one dissentient, the State of South Australia. LOAN CONVERSION. Mr W. Forgan Smith, who arrived by the SS.

Bill received from the Senate and (on time. ter for Health) [3.20] I move That the bill be now read a second time. This hill makes provision for organized research into medical problems, and for the establishment of a fund into which shall be paid moneys received from two sources, namely, moneys appropriated by Parliament from year to year, and moneys received by way of donations and bequests. The fund will be administered by the Minister for Health on the advice of the Nationa] Health and Medical Research Council, and it is to be expended, as provided for in this bill, for the assistance of Commonwealth or State associations, universities and institutions, and persons engaged in medical research, and also for the training of persons in medical research. Medical Research Council upon whose advice the Minister has mainly relied, is a most authoritative body composed of the Commonwealth Director-General of Health as chairman, and two other officers of the Commonwealth Health Department, the Chief Medical Officer of each of the States, a representative of the Australian College of Surgeons and the Australian Association of Physicians, a representative of the British Medical Association, and a nominee of the four universities having medical schools who jointly appoint one representative. Along with these there will be two lay representatives, a prominent layman and a prominent lay-woman. The object of this bill, as disclosed in its title, is for research into medical problems. A review of the vital statistics and the health conditions of this country makes it clear that such a measure is urgently necessary. It is perfectly true that the death and that the expectancy of life has been substantially lengthened. It is true, too, that many diseases that formerly levied heavy toll upon mankind have been either swept away or held in check. Many diseases from which our ancestors suffered, such as small-pox, typhus, and other diseases which either singly or jointly were responsible for epidemics like the "" Black Death"", which swept away very nearly one-half of the population of Great Britain, have been definitely conquered, and have disappeared almost entirely from the mortality tables. Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis have been reduced by 51 per cent, during the last 30 years. It is interesting to note, too, that the death rate from diphtheria, about which certain references were made in this morning's press, is much lower. Whereas in .1911 it was 154 per 1,000.000, in 1934 it was only 63 per 1,000,000. The position, although in some respects encouraging, leaves much to be desired, for, although medical science has made very notable advances and has definitely conquered some diseases, on the other hand, it has been hardly pressed by other diseases which in bygone days were not among the great "" killers "". It will come as a surprise to honourable members to learn that the number of The National Health and deaths from heart disease in this country last year was greater than the total number of deaths from cancer, tuberculosis, motor accidents, and diphtheria.

64,Mr Hughes (North Sydney,"Minisconditions must be clear and intimate. The pace of life has been speeded up. The dietary and habits of the people have been changed. We inherit the appetites of our ancestors, but our lives are ordered to a very different pattern. They lived a life in the open air and earned their living literally by the sweat of their brows; their skins were active, ridding the body of much of its waste products. Now things have changed. Our artisans have become mere machine-minders. Many people are employed as shop assistants, warehouse attendants, clerks and typists. Their work involves little physical effort. We, the descendants of one of the most vigorous, active and adventurous races, load sedentary lives, take little corrective exercise and live on devitalized food. it hie gentleman say that heart disease is due to the conditions of employment or to epidemics? demics. I conceive that the cause of heart disease is deep-rooted in the circumstances of modern life, and those conditions will exist no matter what form of government is adopted. It is necessary that a certain number of the people must be employed in sedentary occupations, and the ill-effects of their employment must be counteracted by a suitable regimendiet,' exercise, and personal hygiene. This is a most fascinating and interesting subject and the temptation to cover the whole field is almost irresistible, but I must endeavour to confine myself to the immediate objects of the bill. Medical science has accomplished great things, but there still remains many worlds to conquer. Cancer and heart disease-to name no other diseases-hav e so far defeated its utmost efforts. And although it has reduced tuberculosis by 51 per cent, in 30 years, it is still a reflecrespect of surgery of goitre, and genitotion on the community that tuberculosis exists at all in Australia. In 1930, Lord Passmore expressed the opinionI think on good grounds-that tuberculosis ought not to exist in Australia. The National Health and Medical Research Council, to which I have referred, accepted that view, and urged that, with a view to the entire eradication of the disease, contacts be examined and treated. F20 ] Medical research, as contemplated by this measure, is research in laboratories, and through clinical observation and investigation. Biological research may be said to date from the time of Pasteur. That perhaps, is not literally accurate, but it is undoubtedly true that since Pasteur's time great advances have been made in biological, biochemical, chemical and surgical research. I shall quote a few of the achievements of research in recent years. By the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best, diabetes has been held in check. The discovery 'by Sir Ronald Ross of the species of mosquito that carries the germ of malaria led to a new treatment which proved much more effective than the old treatment with quinine. Sleeping sickness, if not entirely conquered, has been held in check. Behring discovered an anti-toxin for diphtheria, tetanus and gas-gangrene. The preparation for combating pernicious anaemia has been most successful.. Messrs. Hunter and Royle, two Australians, developed a new technique for surgery of the sympathetic system, as applied to the treatment of various paralyses. Burnet, another Australian, gained distinction by his work on psittacosis. In chemical research the use of eusol, acriflavine, prontosil, and other disinfectants has proved most efficacious. During the war, Wright, an Englishman, together with other British medical men, evolved an inoculation against typhoid, which saved hundred of thousands of lives during the Great War. Australia won world-wide fame by the achievements of the Australian Imperial Force, ibut it would be a still grander thing if it could lead the world in the crusade against disease. Although labouring imder many difficulties, Australians have already led the way in the treatment of miners' phthisis, hydatids, and in urinary surgery, whilst the work performed at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute on snake venom is recognized as a classic. More could be. said of the achievements of Australians in this field, and since we are a small community; isolated from the rest of the world, and without those advantages which contiguity to great centres of population affords, these achievements speak volumes",18,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading
65,Mr Foroe,Would the right honor,19,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading
66,Mr Hughes,"Certainly not epifor our native talent, and the work of our universities and medical schools. Unfortunately, most, if not all, of the Ausworkers in one State do not know what tralians who have achieved distinction in medical research have been forced out of this country; they have won distinction elsewhere. I appeal to the House to stop this drain on our brightest and best intellects, and provide for medical research in this country. It is a matter of vital importance to Australia. Maternal mortality is taking too big a toll of our people, hut overshadowing all other considerations is the decline of the birth rate. The effect of a falling birth rate is shown by a comparison of the numbers of young lives in the community during the inter-censal periods 1911-1921 and 1921-1933. In the former period, the population under ten years of age increased by 217,085, whereas in the latter period, the increase of numbers in this age group was only 381. Had the average effective birth rate which prevailed between 1911 and 1921 continued until June, 1933, there would have been in Australia 350,000 more children under ten years of age than were actually enumerated at the census. We have become case-hardened to these facts, and yet they are for us the writing on the wall. We are a small community, scarcely more than a corporal's guard in this outpost of Empire, and we are. surrounded by nations whose crowded peoples look with envious eyes at Australia; yet we are not to have an army of children, almost equal in number to the Australian Imperial Force. 350,000 children would have gladdened the hearts of their parents and, in time, have swelled the ranks of the industrial army and helped to develop and guide the destinies of this country. Had the birth rate not fallen, we should not have had to consider the introduction of migrants, for we should have had the best migrants in the world at a cost considerably less than that of bringing people here from overseas, who may or may not merge into the community. But they have disappeared and not by disease. Research is many sided, but if it is to he effective, it must he organized. useless; it must he continuous and Mr Hughes. co-ordinated. At present research work of this kind is unorganized. Research workers engaged in the same field of research in another or even in the same State are doing. The council, which is composed of men whose authority cannot be denied, will superintend, direct and guide the research work. The scheme it has propounded and which the Government has adopted is well adapted to Australian conditions. It provides for(1) a central body to organize, co-ordinate and direct research; (2) tlie encouragement and training of young graduates to take up research as a career, with assured continuity in the research system now inaugurated; (3) financial or material assistance to universities, institutions, public and private, now engaged in research; and (4) a number of senior and junior fellowships with a tenure of not more than three years with a right to re-appointment. If this plan of work is adopted we shall be sure of competently advised, controlled and systematic research work. We shall also be assured that any moneys made available for research by appropriations of Parliament, or bequests, or donations, will be expended so as to yield the best possible results. the amount proposed to he appropriated ? has suggested a sum of £30,000 per annum. made in the budget for this purpose? honourable member will not expect me to say more than I have done on that point. The council which has proposed this wellthought out scheme suggests that an appropriation of £30,000 per annum will be necessary to give effect to it. A great deal of money has already been expended on research work in this country, particularly in connection with cancer, but the results have not been encouragingResearch is necessarily slow. When men delve into the secrets of life and seek to discover the various processes in which life manifests itself, progress must Sporadic research is necessarily be slow. It is certain, however, that this is one of the noblest careers",19,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading

70,Mr Hughes,"I am sure that theto which a man can devote himself. But obviously continuity of operations, thoroughly trained workers, and appropriate equipment are necessary to ensure success. Young graduates just entering upon a medical career are not likely to take up research work unless they can be guaranteed continuity of employment and conditions which will give reasonable prospects of success. I commend the bill to honourable members."" This is the first step the Parliament has been asked to take along a road which, willy-nilly, it will be compelled to travel sooner or later. The liealth of the people is of vital importance. The effect of sickness on economic output-to say nothing of the happiness, welfare and outlook of the peoplecan hardly be exaggerated. I have said over and over again that Australia is no place for weaklings. We want strong, vigorous men and women. No branch of human effort is so well worthy of the attention of honourable members as this to which I am now directing attention. The health of the people must be the first consideration of governments and Parliament. It is a national question entirely divorced from party politics. While I do not deny that economic conditions may he one of the causes of ill health, I remind honourable members that ir, is one of the easiest to deal with. If si family is under-nourished because insufficient money is available to buy the required foods, the remedy lies right to our hands. We don't want to appoint a commission to tell us what to do. We all know what to ""do. We must adjust the economic conditions so as to -ensure adequate nutrition. liealth is not confined to poor people. It roams at will among the community. It strikes the well-to-do just as it does those who are impoverished. If inquiry into this problem were to do no more than arouse public attention, it would still be justified. I have said that medical experts have indicated that 43 per cent, of the children of Australia are suffering from malnutrition. Some people brush that statement aside as though it were of no consequence, but others will give it the attention it merits. The Medical Eesearch Council has already done much useful work and made many practical suggestions, of which this is one. This Parliament has already authorized research work into problems concerning our flocks and herds and plant life. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done effective work in this direction. If it is desirable to discover the right kind of fodder for cattle, surely it is much more desirable to find the right kind of food for mankind. As Minister for Health, I have been dealing, lately, with the problem of undulant fever in cattle. It is recognized that this is a serious matter. I feel sure that no honourable member would suggest that the problem of human health should be treated with less seriousness. I ask honourable members to ""pass this bill, not with careless indifference, but with such manifestations of wholehearted support as will leave the community in no doubt how the national legislature regards its objective. The research work contemplated covers all phases of ill-health-materna l mortality, heart disease, cancer and dental caries. The Nutrition Council discovered, in the course of its inquiries, that an alarming number of children in Australia suffered from dental caries, a condition which has been accepted as inevitable. No condition is more general and none is a greater menace to health. Decaying teeth, no doubt, cause toxic conditions that affect health, but they are in themselves symptoms of constitutional disequilibrium. I have referred to heart disease, describing it as the great killer. It is significant that 40 per cent, of the deaths Buti l l from heart disease are due to the aftereffects of infectious fevers such as scarlet fever, diptheria, rheumatic fever and the like, contracted in childhood. gentleman say that scarlet fever, for example, always affects the heart? but these diseases always attack weaklings. Malnutrition, which does not necessarily mean under-nourishment, is one of the causes of heart disease in adult life. Inquiry into this subject would be of immense value to the whole community.",20,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading

Debate resumed from the 29th June (vide page 678), on motion by Mr decided to enable the States to utilize the Tliat the bill be now read a second time. The Opposition has no objection to this measure, and will facilitate its passage. The new agreement, which is of great importance in the relationship of the Commonwealth' Parliament to. the parliaments of the States, is to replace previous agreements, the first of which commenced in 1926. For many years the States complained that they were deprived of any share of the indirect taxes collected by the Commonwealth, and the decision to allow the States to use a part of the petrol' tax on road construction represented a distinct forward step. At present the Commonwealth and the States have to share certain responsibilities, and, in the nature of things, it would appears to me to be a wise provision. appear reasonable that the control of certain works or services should appropriately be left with the States. The responsibility of the Commonwealth is to raise the money, to allocate it fairly, and, where the circumstances warrant, to impose such conditions as are proper. The agreement of 1926 limited the States to the construction of roads in certain categories which I need not specify, because that scheme has now disappeared; but for every £ 1 contributed by the Commonwealth the States were obliged to Snd 15s., one-eighth* of which was to be provided from revenue and the balance from loan moneys. They had to pay interest upon the loan, and also to provide a sinking fund for its reduction. The States found the financial side of the obligation rather onerous, and before 1931 said that the conditions attached to the Commonwealth roads grant jeopardized the proper treatment of roads. For instance, they could not expend any money on roads previously constructed, and furthermore the rigid nature of the agreement, was not only a hardship financially upon the States, but if preserved it might also have resulted in the scrapping of roads upon whicli considerable Gapital expenditure had been incurred. In 1931 the Scullin Government conferred with the States and agreed to abolish the obligation upon them to expend 15s. for every £1 contributed by the Commonwealth. It was also money on construction, re-construction, maintenance and repair of roads. Furthermore, the agreement stipulated that at its expiration the sinking fund portion of the money raised by the States was to be reduced from 3 per cent, to 2£ per cent, until the debt was extinguished. Therefore the provision in this agreement in that connection was really agreed upon five years ago. The only important alteration which the new agreement provides is to increase the financial provision which the Commonwealth makes by §'i. from customs duty and -Jd. from excise. It also enables the money to be expended not only on the construction, re-construction, maintenance and repair of roads, but also on other works connected with transport as a State may think fit. That For the first five years the Commonwealth Government provided £10,000,000 from revenue, and the States £7,500,000 of which the greater proportion was from loan. I do not know whether the provision in respect of one-eighth to be provided from revenue was strictly carried out, but I am assuming that it was. During the last six years the Commonwealth has provided £14,100,000, assuming that the estimated expenditure for.the last year was £3,000,000, as stated by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) last night, while the States have provided onlythe debt charges on about £6,000,000 of loan moneys expended to the end of June, 1931. Since the introduction of the scheme the Commonwealth has provided £24,000,000, and so far as I can see' the States have provided £1,000,000 from revenue and £6,500,000 from loan. We can reasonably forecast that in the next ten years-the period which the agreement covers-the Commonwealth will give to the States approximately",21,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading
73,Debate On Motion (By Mr Fobde),,22,Menzies
74,Mr Cuetin (Fremantle) [4.0],"£35,000,000. This year the amount will be approximately £3,600,000, broadly speaking, we can regard that as the approximate distribution which will be made annually. During the next ten years the States will have a definite share of the petrol tax, which this Parliament imposes under various fiscal measures. I welcome the hill, because so long as the States exist as such, and this Parliament is, as it were, the central piece in the federal structure, it appears only right that some portion of the taxes collected by the Commonwealth shall be reserved for the States for expenditure on capital works, and thus provide employment for a considerable number of persons. Under our present method of distributing the functions between the Commonwealth and the States, the major burden of providing work for Australian citizens has devolved upon the States. But, under this measure, the States will be able to expend money derived from this source on aerodromes, fishermen's havens, roads and services in connection with petrol-driven trains. The bill, I think, gives elasticity to a practice which appears to me to be good, and also economically advantageous. The increase of the amount of petrol tax to be paid to the States which this measure contemplates does not mean that the Commonwealth Parliament will have to increase the tax. We are acting on the assumption that this tax will continue, and a considerable portion of it will be hypothecated for the construction of roads and works incidental to transport. The more comprehensive provisions will give additional service to the users of petrol, including those maintaining aeroplane services, and the users of petrol in connection with fishing launches. The new agreement makes it possible, within the discretion of the States, to ensure that all those who contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth by means of the petrol tax will, while not being relieved of the tax, have some service rendered to them by the Commonwealth or by a State government in return for the tax they pay. congratulate the Acting Treasurer ( Mr The new agreement introduces several Menzies) upon having introduced this new features, including an increased measure, which provides for the ratificagrant. The original grant was £2,000,000 tion of a new agreement, for a period of and, ten years, between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of roads. I am particularly pleased, to find that the Government has introduced certain new features in the measure which provide, in effect, that all persons who directly or indirectly use petrol will derive some benefit from the tax they pay on that commodity. When the first federal aid roads agreement was adopted, our main highways and country roads were in a chaotic state. The number of motor cars and trucks had increased tremendously, and it 'became necessary to make drastic improvements in the matter of road construction and maintenance to facilitate motor transport generally. The light construction . of many roads rendered them duckponds in the winter, and sandheaps in the summer. Since the adoption of the federal ai| roads scheme, there has been remarkabl' improvement in roads generally, and the work performed in. road construction, maintenance and repairs by the main roads boards and similar authorities, with the money obtained from the petrol tax, has been of great benefit to roadusers. It has also increased the number of motor vehicle owners, and resulted in an enormous saving in repairs, and a reduction of wear and tear. Since the first agreement was adopted, road construction authorities have been able to build additional roads and also to maintain and repair others. It is futile to construct a good road and allow it to get into disrepair. Since the first agreement was adopted, approximately £31,000,000 has been provided by the Commonwealth and States for road construction, which is the most important industry in Australia. The industry is decentralized, and uses a huge quantity of material, including log and sawn timber, iron, gravel, sand, stone, cement, wire and wire-netting, expanding metal, harness, drays, lorries, steam rollers, graders, ploughs, picks, shovels, fodder, tents, and general camping equipment. Thousands of persons are engaged in preparing material used in road construction, and tens of thousands in the actual work of construction.",22,Menzies

Today, when there is complete unanimity as to the desirableness of renewing the agreement, it may be well to recall that, 1 when the original agreement was before the Parliament ten years ago, unanimity was not displayed. The original proposal was submitted subsequent to, and as the result of, a visit overseas hy the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), who had observed the method adopted in the United States of America of financing road construction works. He consulted with the States, and brought before this Parliament the original agreement. On that occasion considerable apprehension was expressed on 'both sides of the House e regarding it, but the act has operated with complete success, and to-day we have absolute unanimity on the subject of its renewal on substantially similar terms. It would be well, perhaps, for us to recall, and, through the press, to remind the public that the petrol tax is not, and never has been, imposed for the purpose of raising revenue for road construction. It is generally believed that because specific customs and excise duties have been imposed on petrol the revenue derivedhas been gathered for a specific purpose; but an examination of their history shows that they were first to the of the additional 2d. a gallon a fiat rate emergency. In 1931, the States asked the Commonwealth Government to be relieved of their obligation to contribute 15s. for every £1 made available by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government agreed to this, and desired to be relieved of its obligation to pay £2,000,000 per annum. It suggested that the agreement should be Varied'in such manner that the Commonwealth's contribution would not exceed the amount of revenue derived from the imposition of the customs and excise duties on petrol of 2d. a gallon. A little later-stil l during the depression years-the States asked for, and the Commonwealth consented to, a further variation of the agreement so as to give to' the States an additional sum equal to the amount derived from a further i d . a gallon of the petrol tax revenue* That alteration was made. The States then became possessed annually of the revenue obtained from 2-H. a gallon of the customs and excise dutieSj and they were relieved of the obligation to contribute 15s.' for every £1 provided by the Commonwealth. About the same timeI think it was during the period of the Scullin Government-as one of the steps taken to meet the financial emergency, the petrol tax was further increased in two steps. There was a total additional impost of 4d. a gallon, bringing the total duty to 7d. a gallon The",23,Menzies
76,Mr Mcewen (Echuca) [4.22],"Iadditional duty of 4d. a gallon was imposed, not for the purpose of promoting road construction, but as an emergency revenue tax to meet special items of expenditure. This is a point on which the mind of the public has not ibeen clear, and the Commonwealth Government itself would be well advised to clarify the position. This, I think, is an appropriate opportunity to do so. To-day we are called upon to authorize the Commonwealth, to ratify the renewal of the agreeworks relating to transport. The proposal ment on terms that have been further varied. The agreement is now to be renewed on a basis which will relieve the States of the obligation to contribute 35s. for every £1 made available to them by the Commonwealth Government. In addition, they Avill receive a further share of the petrol tax revenue, equal to that representing £d. a gallon of the 7d. tax. Thus the States will receive 3d. of the 7d. additional grant be? in respect of this financial year, the States will receive £3,000,000 for the purpose of road construction, this sum representing 2-Jd. of the present tax, and. an additional £600,000 to be allocated from the additional revenue as I have already indicated. When this agreement was renewed six months ago, the Treasurer ( Mr ""public works connected with transport Casey) the new agreement would permit the States to use this additional grant of £600,000 per annum for considerably wider purposes than road construction; he said that they would be allowed to spend it in respect of general construction, forestry and general public works. On that occasion, as at every opportunity which has since presented itself, I strongly objected to any condition which would allow the States to spend any portion of revenue raised from a certain class of the community on works' other than for two particular purposes. I said then, and I repeat now, that any revenue derived from a tax on petrol should bo credited to the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth and be expended iu respect of the general purposes of government, or, alternatively, specifically allocated for the purpose of road construction or some undertaking from which the users of petrol would benefit. I am very glad, therefore, to see that the opposition which I , with other honourable members, have offered has, perhaps, been influential in persuading the Commonwealth to delete that proposal from the agreement .which the Treasurer outlined to us. Under this agreement, the expenditure of this sum of £600,000 by the States is to be confined to road construction or public is a good one, but I should like to have seen an indication in the bill, or at least a statement by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) that it was not the desire of the Commonwealth that this additional money should be used by the States for general railway purposes. Public works relating to transport must, of course, embrace certain public works connected with railways whilst, furthermore, State railway departments are employing a certain number of petrol-driven motors, but in its present form, the agreement will place no restraint upon the States in expending as much of this £600,000 as they deem fit in respect of public works which are part of their railway programmes. I believe that expenditure in that direction would be wrong and I doubt whether it is the intention of the Commonwealth that this money should be so used. I should have preferred to read in the bill the definition, informed Parliament that other than railways."" Failing that, 1 should be glad if the Acting Treasurerand it is not too late for him to do sowould indicate that it is not the desire of the Commonwealth that any of this money should be used by the States in connection with their railway reconstruction programmes. Under the original agreement, the States were called upon to contribute 15s. for every £1 they received from the Commonwealth, but during the period of financial emergency, they were relieved of that obligation. To-day, we are emerging from that period of financial strain and certain State governments are finding themselves with more money than they apparently need for purposes of road construction. During the last five or six years, Queensland, for instance, has made a practice of transferring £250,000 from",25,Menzies
77,Mr A. Green,Ho w much will that,26,Menzies
78,Mr Mcewen,"I understand that,tlie funds it raises from motor registration fees to Consolidated Revenue. This has the effect of selecting motorists in that State for the imposition of a special lax and such a development, I suggest, has only been made possible by reason of the funds granted to the Queensland Government under the federal aid roads agreement. In this l-espect also, I believe that a bad principle has been established and I am sorry to see that the Commonwealth Government proposes to continue a policy which will facilitate such a practice. The proposal now before the House is essentially good. I do not believe that it should be necessary to select motorists perposition in that respect and if any State manently for the imposition of so high a revenue impost as is represented by 4d. of the tax on petrol. Of the revenuederived from this tax, 3d. is devoted to grants made under this agreement, but as regards 4d. of the tax the motorist is specially selected to raise revenue for the ordinary purposes of the Commonwealth Government. I quite agree that during a period of emergency, motorists, in common with all other classes of taxpayers, should be called upon to pay substantial tax. We are still meeting budgetary repayments of an emergenc3 character, 7 hut there should be a progressive reduction in respect of that 4d. of the petrol tax which is now paid into consolidated revenue. sure that the release of this estimated amount of £600,000 by the Commonwealth under this agreement will be greatly appreciated by the users of petrol. I am one of those who have held the opinion for some time that the petrol tax should he reduced. affords at least some measure of compensation. to to apply the whole of this sum for any purpose which they might deem fit, found no favour with those who paid the tax'-user s of petrol-and I am glad that it has now been stipulated that the amount of money given to the States from this particular sum must be utilized in, or towards, improving transport services in this country. I feel, however, that we could improve upon that condition. Under the agreement now before the House, the money to be provided from £d. a 'gallon of the tax on petrol may be expended by the States on the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of roads, or other works connected with transport as the States may decide. Of course the basic principle of the agreement is that this money should be applied substantially for the purposes of transport, but any State government, which is unscrupulous enough to prefer to adhere to the letter and not the spirit of the agreement, can apply the whole of this extra money to its general consolidated revenue. I hope that this Government will carefully watch the government fails to adhere to the spirit of the agreement, will bring it forward again for amendment. The complaint of motorists that they are forced to pay a class tax is wellfounded. The revenue derived from the petrol tax originally was very small. A t that time, of course, not much motor fuel was used. In 1926, the tax was increased by 2d. a gallon for the purpose of providing the funds necessary to give effect to the federal aid roads agreement. Under that agreement, the States were obliged to contribute 15s. for every £1 made available by the Commonwealth, but subsequently they were relieved of that obligation and the amount spent on roads by the States in the meantime has been less to that extent. There is every justification, therefore, for the Commonwealth to stipulate that this extra money shall be applied, in the main, for the benefit of not only users of roads but also all other people who use petrol. These people are entitled to some concession of that This proposal nature. If petrol is used on our railway systems, then the State governments are The original proposal entitled to apply portion of this money in permit the State governments respect of their railways. One point which I emphasize, however, is that this Government should not permit any of this extra grant to the States to be used for purposes other than purposes of transport, and especially road construction [4.44] I do not propose to deal with the history of this legislation which is welUknown.

80,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"support this measure, but I am not so sure as the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) has suggested, that the people, in whose interests some of us are most concerned, will be safeguarded in this agreement. For the last five or six years, we have been endeavouring to have some of the money derived from the petrol tax and made available to the States, allocated for the purpose, of . helping users of petrol engaged in the fishing industry, and it has. been assumed that this agreement meets their case, because this Government has suggested that the State governments could, if they so desired, use some of ..this money in that direction. On this occasion the amount has been increased, .making it more easy than it was before to help these people, yet no definite mandatory proposal is made to the States, and the fishermen are again protesting against being overlooked. I received this morning a long telegram from the secretary of the League of Fishermen, which represents the whole of thefishermen""of Australia, protesting against having been again overlooked by the Federal Government. I do not think that"" the Government has overlooked them; but it has hot laid it down, or even suggested, that the States should apply a portion of the money to the building of shelter sheds, breakwaters, or havens that.,the States must use .a certain percentage. ., . Mi*.;'HOLLOWAY I agree with the right''honbrable gentleman. Last year, several honourable members protested that tlie' fishermen had been overlooked, and the Treasurer placed the matter before the States.' Two years ago the majority of the'fishermen around the coast of Australia had half their kit or more destroyed by the extraordinarily rough and stormy weather then encountered. In the two electorates that I have represented in this House-Flinders and Melbourne Portsthe fishermen were put back to "" scratch "" ; the savings of a lifetime were fishermen. The fishermen themselves destroyed in the stormy weather of that period, because there were no breakwaters or havens to safeguard their possessions. Last year, when several honourable members mentioned the matter, the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) agreed that a portion of the money could be devoted to the provision of shelter but said that there was no particular way in which the Commonwealth could order the States to do it. These men are professional fishermen, who live practically all their lives on the sea. In some cases, two or three generations man the one boat. Although large users of petrol, ny roads are provided for them and they derive no advantage, either directly or indirectly, from the collection of the tax. Petrol is one of the largest items in their costs of production. Last year some honourable members contended that the fishermen were largely foreigners. That is not true; Britishers comprise 80 per cent, of their number, and the majority are Australian natives, the balance being Australian citizens by adoption. The reason for the spread of' the rumour that they are foreigners is that many of them have foreign names. They are descendants of Scandinavians and Greeks, some of whom came to Australia 30 or 40 years ago. But even if they are naturalized foreigners, they should receive assistance. Having examined this measure, they still fear that the State governments will again wink an eye to the suggestion of the Federal Treasurer that they should be given consideration. Fishing is a very necessary industry. Lifeboat crews are recruited from the ranks of the fishermen. Everybody knows what service those crews render for very little ... . . . pay; they receive only the basic wage for putting out to sea to assist in the rescue of those who are shipwrecked. They are of a very fine type, and ought to be assisted. I urge the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) to try to get some assurance from the States that a portion of the money will be spent in assisting them. I admit that it is almost impossible to ascertain the quantity of petrol used by those who derive no advantage from the tax, so that in such case3 the tax could be remitted. In ' Great Britain and New Zealand taxes of this character are not imposed on professional suggest that if the Government will not earmark a portion of this money,,to he spent by the States in giving much needed service in return for the amount",27,Menzies
81,Mr Menzies,"We could hardly say-that they contribute to the petrol tax, they should have some rebate or remission of the tax. I am confident that the Acting Treasurer will not neglect to impress upon the States the necessity for the expenditure of a portion of the money in the direction that I have indicated. The return of a portion of the proceeds of the petrol tax to transport in the shape of roads originated in the party that now sits on this side of the House. It is interesting to note that to-day the foresight displayed by that government of ten years ago is appreciated by honourable members opposite. I understand that when the federal aid roads agreement was first introduced the Labour party opposed the measure very strenuously, only, four of its members supporting it. I am glad that in the intervening period the foresight and wisdom of the .government of the day has come to be fully recognized. [Quorum formed.] I shall say no more along those lines, except that measures of this sort, which are eventually seized upon by the party that sits in opposition, generally 'originate in the party of which I am a member.

A petrol tax is imposed on transport, and a portion of the proceeds is returned to transport by way of better roads. In this agreement, however, there is a departure from the original agreement in three respects. First, the proceeds of an additional halfpenny are to be returned to the States; secondly, tlie principle that the money shall be expended only on roads is departed from; and thirdly, Commonwealth roads, or roads leading to or through' Commonwealth property, will have to be maintained by the States. I , of course, am in agreement with the measure, and am very glad that the proceeds of an additional i i . , amounting to approximately £600,000 a year, are to be returned to the States and that the guiding principle of its expenditure is to be the improvement of transport facilities. When this measure was first mooted in this HouseI was one of the first, if not the first, to protest against the provision that the additional amount provided could be expended on works of any sort. I then adopted the view, and I have, not since changed my opinion) that in this country transport should be kept as cheap as possible for the mass of the people, as it is definitely of vital importance to the nation. The idea that the money could be used by the States for any -works am glad that this measure-.adopts-' the principle that the money shall go. back to transport. I admit that the clause as it reads is very wide, and allows a' good deal of latitude. I sincerely hope that that latitude will not be abused by the States. Another wise provision is that\roads leading to or adjacent to Commonwealth property shall be maintained by the Governments of the States. The wisdom of that lies in the fact that for a period Honourable of years the States have somewhat neglected such roads.

Adjacent to some of the munitions factories in Melbourne the roads are in a deplorable state of repair, simply because the municipalities and the State Government have been unable to come to an agreement to keep them in repair. I should like the Acting Treasurer to give the reason for the ten-year period; it seems to me to be inordinately long. The lessons of the past do not justify such a lengthy term. The original agreement, which was drawn up in 1926, had to be altered about 1931. appears that, as time goes on, conditions will alter. relation to transport are definitely alterportion whicli is returned to the States, ing. The financial condition of the States, and their financial relations with the Commonwealth, will certainly alter. Under the old agreement, the transport user benefited greatly by reason of the fact that the States had to supplement the Commonwealth's contribution of £1 by a contribution of 15s. Possibly in the very near future the States will again be in a position to make a separate contribution, and thus additional moneys will be returned to the transport user. I maintain that a five-year period would be ample. I draw the attention of the House to the amount collected from the petrol tax and road purposes. [Quorum formed.] Since 1931-32 up to this year, the huge sum of £35,220,000 has been realized from the petrol tax. Of that amount, £12,375,000, including the estimate for this year, has been returned to the States, so that £22,545,000 has gone into the Consolidated Revenue. indicate that an extremely heavy burden has been laid on one section of the community, and the time is opportune to request the Government to reduce the tax. As to the disposition of the money returned to the States, all honourable members are, I think, in agreement that the money should not be used for ordinary railway works, as for instance such work as the building of a new railway station at Spencer-street, Melbourne. The underlying idea is that the amount returned to the States from the proceeds of this tax should be devoted Mr Hutchinson. to the assistance of transport, which would, I presume, include railways improvement, the construction of new aerodromes, and the improvement of existing landing grounds, because aeroplanes are becoming increasingly important as a means of transport. I hope that the Attorney-General, in his reply, will give to the House some indication of what is in the mind of the Government on this point. I consider that some portion of the petrol It tax collected by the Government should < be set aside for the development of civil Even now, those in aviation. I am not thinking of that but of the share which the Commonwealth gathers into its own coffers from the users of petrol. Aviationfor transport purposes is becoming just as essential as motor vehicles, and the complaint I stress is that whilst companies or firms employing aeroplanes do not use roads to any appreciable extent, they still have to pay this tax of 7£d. a gallon on all petrol used ,by them. The tax may not press so heavily on people in the more thickly populated eastern States, where landing grounds are already provided for the well-developed air services; but it is a serious matter for people in the larger and sparsely populated States like Westreturned to the States for ern Australia. During the last nine years, the Commonwealth has received over £44,000,000 from the petrol tax and has diverted to its own use £25,000,000. It has returned to the States only £19,000,000 for roads and such like purposes. I am not at all pleased with the treatment which I have received from the These figures Acfing Minister for ' Defence( Mr Thorby) during the last few months in connection with representations on the subject of assistance for local governing bodies in the preparation of landing grounds. WheneverI approached the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) I could always be sure of a hearing, but, during his absence from Australia, my representations to the Acting Minister for Defence have usually resulted in the receipt by me of long letters, containing a medley of words which meant nothing. Eventually, I havcdiscovered that that was just what I got",29,Menzies
91,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [5.3],"-nothing . many local governing authorities in Western Australia to submit applications for financial assistance in the preparation of landing grounds, especially on the route of the north-west air mail service. Invariably I have been advised that the department does not hold itself responsible for the improvement or maintenance of landing grounds, unless they Are to be used for defence purposes. In the event of an invasion, which I do not regard as a possibility at the moment, the northern part of Australia would, by many people, be regarded as a point of danger. Therefore, we may take it that the north-west air route in Western Australia, as well as the Qantas air routes in Queensland and the Northern Territory, would be utilized for the transport of troops for defence purposes. This* being so, there is solid reason for the requests which I have placed before the department. As the preparation of landing grounds is quite beyond the financial power of local governing bodies, they have every right to expect assistance from the Commonwealth, but this, I regret to state, has been consistently withheldup to the present time. Some portion of the revenue which the Commonwealth receives from this source should be set aside for the improvement of landing grounds in sparsely populated States. I may be told that Western Australia, because of its size, benefits greatly from the revenue received from the tax on petrol, the basis of distribution under this ceeded by Dr. Alan King, another splenbill being two-fifths in respect of area, and three-fifths in respect of population, which means, of course, that the larger and sparsely populated States receive a relatively higher proportion of the revenue. This is as it should be, because of the heavier demands made on the taxpayers in those States for the maintenance of roads and other transport services. . The civil aviation department has admitted its responsibility for the construction and maintenance of roads leading to landing grounds. This being so, it may interest honourable members to know that some of the landing grounds on the north-western air route in my State are absolutely without roads of any description. The approach from Ajana to I have heen requested by a recognized landing ground on the north-west air route, at the 45-mile peg on the telegraph line at Junga, about 200 miles north of Geraidton, and 44 miles from the main road, is through a sand plain which makes for heavy going, and no provision is made for motor traffic. In the event of trouble, it would be impossible to get assistance to that landing ground under about two days. Within the last two or three years there has been a very welcome extension of the Australian aerial medical services, thus rendering imperative the adoption of a positive policy for the improvement of landing grounds in the north-west portion of my State. The resident medical officer at Wyndham now has at his disposal an aeroplane, and conducts from that centre a branch of the Australian aerial medical service. Dr. A. J. Coto, who was stationed at Wyndham for some years, and a number of jmblic spirited residents of the north-west, rendered splendid service in the organization of this scheme, which is sponsored and financed from Melbourne. Now, by means of pedal wireless transmitting sets, no fewer than 21 stations, covering a radius of about 400 miles, can communicate with Wyndham, and get prompt medical aid. Before the installation of these transmitting sets several weeks would elapse before people living on the various stations could get a cali through to the nearest doctor. I should add that Dr. Coto has been sucdid man. The pedal transmitting sets now being used at the different stations have been manufactured by Mr Traegar, an Adelaide wireless enthusiast, who produces them at the cost of about .£50 as compared with £150 charged by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for sets which have not proved efficient. In order to impress on honourable members the risks of aviation in that part of Western Australia, I may mention that if a call to Wyndham came from the mission station at Port George IV . , asking for urgent medical aid, the plane would have to fly over difficult and dangerous mountain country with no landing ground whatever. If the engine seized, as some day it may, the plane must crash and the occupants would have little hope of succour reaching them in time should they survive the fall, and these conditions obtain in every direction south of Wyndham. Having explained the difficulties of the people living in the northern part of my State, I again appeal to the Acting Minister for Defence to induce the Government to set aside a portion of the money obtained from the petrol tax for the improvement of landing grounds in distant parts of sparsely populated States. [5.15] -I , with other honourable members, welcome the introduction of this bill. I have repeatedly urged upon the Government the wisdom of remitting the tax on petrol used in civil aviation. I do not know of any other country keen upon the development of aviation that is taxing petTol used for this purpose. The remission of the tax would be welcomed by all those who are interested in the progress of civil commercial aviation generally in the Commonwealth. I know that one of the main civil aviation companies of Australia annually uses 300,000 gallons of petrol, and pays more than £10,000 in tax thereon into the federal revenue. pass the tax on in its charges? another matter. Owing to the severity of the petrol tax, several aviation companies which have made an effort to establish air services in this country have been compelled to abandon the enterprise. The fact that they w.ere obliged to pay the tax made all the difference between success and failure in the conduct of their operations. I agree with the 'honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) that we cannot, by any process of the imagination, connect aviation with the use of roads. It is only in tragical circumstances that an aeroplane has ever to make use of a road. Surely there can be nothing to prevent the granting of a re'bate on petrol used in aviation, because aeroplanes cannot land at any random spot, or pull up at any bowser pump to replenish their fuel supplies; they must obtain petrol at a registered aerodrome. For this reason, it should 'be a simple matter to control the use of petrol which is entirely devoted to aviation, and to grant a rebate thereon. A ll honourable members will agree that everything possible should be done to develop civil aviation in this country. Australia has already a tradition for greatness in the air. When recalling such names as Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Ulm, Sir Ross Smith, Hinkler, Hawker, Melrose, Parer, and many others, one must realize that they are an undoubted inspiration and example to the youth of this country. I have often said that I feel that the Australian people are indeed air-minded. The point that I desire now to make is that this measure gives effect to a suggestion which I have made in the past,'because it will be possible, in future, for the States to use a portion of their grants from the Federal Aid Roads Fund for the improvement of aerodromes and landing grounds. That is one of the most urgent requirements of civil aviation in Australia at the present time. I am well aware from personal experience of the difficulties with which persons engaged in aviation have to contend, and how fow and far between, are aerodromes and landing grounds throughout this great continent. ""soared stiff"". only necessary to provide suitable landing grounds in many parts of the country, but also a great deal remains to be done in connection with our main airports. Only recently, I was one of nine passengers in a modern airliner, aaid a landing was made at an airport in complete darkness. Knowing the pilot well, I had implicit faith in him, and he made a perfect landing; but the experience was not at all pleasant. It seems wrong that, in regard to ground organization, we should still be lagging far behind other air-minded countries. By giving to the States authority to spend a portion of the Federal Aid Roads Grant on the provision and improvement of aerodromes and landing grounds, this measure goes a long way to achieve what I have, from time to time, humbly advocated in this House to the best of my ability.

From time to time, I have requested the State authorities to contribute towards the establishment and upkeep of aerodromes, but they decline to do so, contending that the matter is a federal responsibility. When I have approached the federal body on this matter, it shifts the responsibility to the Defence Department-and upon inquiry in that quarter, I have learned that it establishes aerodromes only on subsidized routes. Civil aviation is making rapid progress in Australia, and whether or not collections from the petrol tax are expended on subsidized air routes, landing grounds at important centres should be prepared. such work is carried out by the Commonwealth or the .States; but it should be done from this money. If the Commonwealth declines to take the responsibility, it should ensure that, under this agreement, the States, are compelled to shoulder it. In stressing these facts, I hope that the Government will grant further concessions to the outback municipalities which are obliged to impose double taxation on their ratepayers for the upkeep of streets worn out by through motorists. with other honourable members in congratulating the Government upon this measure. It is pleasing to me to be assoand from experience the Government iu ciated with a bill which meets with sueh general approval. While all the aspects of the petrol tax have been fully discusscd by previous speakers, I desire briefly to support the remarks of the honthe petrol tax for the further orable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. (ii'fon) in regard to the utilization of a portion of the proceeds of tbe tax ""for the provision of aerodromes and landing grounds. A couple of years ago, I had i.he pleasure, or the trouble, of travelling of the States' share of the petrol tax through hazardous inland portions of this great continent upon which aeroplanes from time to time have been compelled to make forced landings. I am familiar with the type of country in which Sir Herbert Gepp and party were recently forced down, and where the late Mr their share of the tax on railways. As the Keith Anderson and the late Mr R. Hitchcock lost their lives. In these and similar inhospitable districts, "" the Flying Doctor"" is compelled to land from time to time in carrying out his work for the preservation of human life. In the light of my experiences, I heartily agree that a portion of the money collected from the petrol tax should be devoted to the purpose of providing suitable landing grounds in those areas. I recently received a request from the municipality of Albury to make representations to the Commonwealth for the purpose of having an aerodrome established in that district. Albury is regarded by the Defence Department as being an important strategical point, and an area of about S00 acres has been reserved there for defence purposes. I hope that the Government will sympathetically receive this It is immaterial whether request. Where aerodromes are necessary for defence, they should be built without undue delay from the federal aid roads fund. I asked the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) to give attention to this aspect and ascertain whether, in the interests of defence, suitable landing grounds could not be made at centres such as Albury and Wagga. [5.29] I support the bill. The Government is doing a great service to primary producers through the grants of money which it is making to the States from the proceeds of the petrol tax. In the past, many valuable method's of assisting our producers have been adopted, its discretion has decided to make a slight alteration of the agreement, before renewing it for a period of ton years, in order to make available money from assistance of the rural population. The bill provides that 3d. of the 7d. shall be paid to the States as a grant. The new' agreement differs from its predecessors by providing for expenditure revenue, not only on actual road constructional works, but also on other works connected with transport which is to include the fishing industry and aerodromes for civil aviation. I hope, however, that this will never permit States to spend railway authorities have their own means for raising revenue thoy should not he",33,Menzies

99,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"allowed to share in the proceeds of the petrol tax; this money is necessary for the development of roads in the country districts, and for other commendable purposes such as the development of aerodromes. Despite the fact that since the inception of the petrol tax more than £24,000,000 has been made available by the Commonwealth to the States for the development of main roads, there is still agitation in certain quarters in favour of the Commonwealth handing over the whole of the proceeds to the States for road construction. Two nights ago Mr ceeds from the petrol tax that it retains J. C. Watson, president of the National Roads and Motorists Association, issued a statement which is calculated to mislead the people of Australia, reiterating the claim that the Commonwealthhas no right to retain any of the tax. The demands of defence justify the Commonwealth in retaining that part of the tax collections over and above that payable under the agreement to the States. The persons behind this agitation do not bear in mind that the Commonwealth's means of obtaining revenue include customs duties and excise, and that although the Commonwealth does disburse some of its revenues from those sources, it was never iu tended that it should disburse the whole. It is to be hoped that the Commonwealth Government will never allow its responsibility for the defence of this country to be detrimentally affected by too large a disbursement of its funds to the State governments. The increase of the annual grant, to the States from the petrol tax by £600,000 will be of great value and there is a possibility that the States will consequently be enabled to assist in the provision of country aerodromes. electorate many aerodromes have been constructed, either hy the local authorities or by private enterprise, the bigger aeroplanes now in use and the consequent need for longer runways, it is necessary that those landing grounds be improved, but every attempt to obtain funds for this work cither from the State Government or from the ment has failed. bhe of aviation shows clearly that the development of country aerodromes is entirely a matter for the States. In my opinion a large portion of the extra £600,000 should therefore be earmarked for the development of aerodromes. I think also that fishermen should be given, some relief from the tax, but I oppose the continued disbursement of increased sums to the States without the Commonwealth having some say in regard to the expenditure of the money. I hope further that if it should ever be found that -the Commonwealth does not need for defence purposes, the whole of the profor itself, the proportion which it does not need will be remitted to the taxpayers, not given to the States. It is often the case when the Commonwealth Government hands to the States an increased share of the proceeds from the tax that the States divert into other channels equivalent amounts of money from their own motor taxes, which in the normal, course of events, would be expended on road development. I hope that before long an opportunity will occur for the Commonwealth to reduce the petrol tax and that the misconception which exists about the purpose of the tax will bo swept away. AgainI urge the Government to amend this bill so as to exclude any possibility of this money being expended on railways.

During certain periods of the year fishermen are unable even to make a living, but at all times they are using petrol in their launches. I appeal to the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) to take into consideration the needs of these people.

Apparently, I must go back and tell the fishermen of Hobart that they can expect no relief from the Government. When we remember that the Government has poured out millions of pounds for the benefit of one section of the community, and that the farmers are exempt from the payment of sales tax, &c, we find more difficulty in understanding why nothing has been done for the fishermen. A small section in this House is able to boast that it can get everything it wants for the farmers, and no doubt it can, because it holds an axe over the head of the Government, and if the Government refuses its requests, the axe. will fall.

No relief is granted in this measure to those who have to pay rates for the upkeep of streets and .roads in city and country districts for the benefit of motorists. Bates are a charge oh property, and the working man who is trying to buy his own home has to find anything from £4 to £S a year in rates. It is not right to ask such men, who are struggling to buy their homes, to make such a sacrifice for the upkeep of roads that are used, accept an amendment to exempt fisherto a great extent, by the wealthy members of the community. A certain amount of the money raised under this bill should be allocated to local bodies. licence fees. from the petrol tax, and I doubt whether they get anything from the licence fees. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government refused the request that part of .the money should be allocated to muniplea for assistance to the fishermen. At cipalities. The working man should be applauded for trying to own his home, so as to place his wife and children outside the reach of the landlord, and this is not the way to encourage him to do so. He is being asked to contribute towards the maintenance of roads that are used by people who drive their motor cars on pleasure trips. They drive out at night to their clubs, racing along the roads at high speed, so that the cost of maintenance is made even heavier than is necessary. I maintain that there should be a more equitable distribution of the proceeds of the petrol tax. Of course, I can understand why government supporters are not sympathetic. Those who are well off do not feel the burden of taxation, but States, some of which will be used for the the great majority of the people in my electorate have small incomes, and those who are trying to buy their homes find it very hard sometimes to pay the rates. The case for the fishermen is particularly strong, because the principle is generally recognized that those who pay taxes should receive some benefit from them. As a matter of fact, I doubt whether it is legal to collect petrol tax from the fishermen who use petrol in their boats, because they certainly do not derive any benefit from the tax they pay. Perhaps some of the legal members of the House can enlighten me on that point. There are no roads on the high seas. Although this Government has tried to carry out some extraordinary ideas m the past, I have not yet known it to lay down a road on the sea, or to smooth the waves for the benefit of the fishermen. Perhaps it will promise to do something of the kind during the next election campaign; in other words, it may pour some of the oil on the troubled waters. I trust that the Minister in charge of the bill will men from the payment of petrol tax. possible under this measure. I>ay them a bounty. suppose it would put a tax on the bounty. This has become known as the "" Bounty Government"", but if it goes on as it has been going, there will be another mutiny of the bounty before long. I make a serious least the farmers do not have to pay a licence in order to produce, but fishermen must, and, in addition, they have to pay tax on the petrol they use. These men have to go out in all kinds of weather in order to catch the fish which the wealthy members of the community enjoy at their club suppers, and we should do something to assist them. The Government should stipulate, whenever it hands over Commonwealth money to be spent by the States, that those who are employed from such funds shall be paid ruling wages, and shall work under prescribed conditions. It is proposed in this measure to hand over £600,000 to the construction of roads to aerodromes, and works of that kind. In New South Wales, much of this work used to. be done by municipal and shire councils by means of relief grants. Now such work is being discontinued, and the men are being put on to what are known as government works, that is, undertakings carried out by the Main Koads Board and similar authorities.

It has been the practice of the various road authorities in the States to utilize the road grant largely in the construction and maintenance of speedways 'running parallel with railway lines. The condition of many of the feeder roads over which our primary producers have to carry their products to the rail head, demonstrates the futility of the present policy of spending the greater part of the to life and limb. It is essential that money on main roads, and almost entirely, neglecting others. The construction of first-class roads running parallel with railway systems is responsible for the very severe competition offered to the railways by motor vehicles. Many of the feeder roads may be all right,, according to the old horse and buggy standards, but they are totally inadequate to meet the demands of fast moving motor traffic. 'Very many of them are often impassable during wet weather. The primary producers get very little benefit from the expenditure of the roads grant. [Quorum formed.] The present road policy should be altered, and a good deal of the money provided should be expended on the improvement of roads that do not compete with the railways. I am sure that all honourable members have been approached by representatives of shire and municipal -councils and other public bodies, and by primary producers, asking that better secondary roads be constructed. In variably, we have had to reply that no money is available for the construction of such roads, because the provisions of the Federal Aid Roads Agreement restrict the expenditure of the proceeds of the petrol tax to the construction or maintenance of main roads. ""Victoria. but honourable members will bear out the truth of my assertion that it does apply in New South Wales. mental road provision. mental work undertaken, apart from the aware, to provide relief work for men working practically for the dole. That position certainly exists in my own electorate. The highway connecting Sydney and Melbourne is a speed track. Once Liverpool is left behind there are few places on the journey to Melbourne where it is necessary to slow down. The feeder roads, however, that connect with that highway are in a very bad state, and in wet weather, particularly at night time, constitute a grave danger some of the money provided under the agreement should be diverted from expenditure on what may be termed "" polishing"" main roads to a fund specially earmarked for the improvement of feeder roads. No matter what objection may be raised by the States to any direction from the Commonwealth as to how this money should be expended, I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the necessity for the development and maintenance of feeder roads. I am rather surprised that Country party members have been silent on this point; every honourable member who represents a country constituency knows that the farmers throughout New South Wales are asking that this should be done. I cannot understand the.objection of honourable members opposite to such a proposal. In bad weather some fawners are almost isolated because of their inability to make contact with the railhead. Having discarded the horse in favour of motor transport, they now find that many of the feeder roads, even those within 70 miles of Sydney, are impassable during bad weather.

Provision should be made in the agreement for the payment of a specified sum to shires and municipalities to maintain the roads within their boundaries. councils have such a large area to maintain that it is impossible for them, with the limited funds at their disposal, to undertake extensive road work without imposing upon their ratepayers excessively high rates. The construction of roads necessary for the development of primary industries should be regarded as a national undertaking to be carried out by the Commonwealth in co-operation with the States, and at least one-half of the total amount to he paid out to the States under the Pederal Aid Roads Agreement, should be devoted to that purpose. member think that some of the money should be used for the development of roads leading to aerodromes? aerodromes is a Commonwealth responsibility, might also very well undertake the upkeep and maintenance of roads, leading to aerodromes. I agree with all that has been said by the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) in regard to the exemption from tax of petrol used by fishermen; but I rose mainly to stress the fact that too much of the proceeds of the petrol tax is being utilized on main roads to the detriment of necessary feeder roads.

So far, however, this Government has neglected to take any action. During the Gwydir by-election, the Acting Prime Minister hadsome experience of country roads in that part of New South Wales, which should have made him more than willing to take steps to ensure that money would be -made available under the federal aid roads scheme to improve them; but the Government is adhering to its policy of absolute Many shire contempt and indifference to the general needs of the community in this respect. It might have been thought that the Country party members of the House would have brought pressure to bear upon the Government to provide money for the improvement of country roads, but they have done nothing. The Government must be aware of the serious state of disrepair into which many of the roads in country districts have fallen. This unhappy condition of affairs can be rectified only by the adoption of the policy advocated by the Labour party. Honourable members on this side of the House are alone in their endeavours to bring under the notice of the Government the really serious problems which face the primary producers. I appeal to the Government to insert a provision in the bill to the effect that and the Commonwealth the additional £600,000 to be made available to the States shall be used on country roads. Even that amount will he as a drop in the ocean compared with what is required to put the roads into good order.

This Parliament should exercise constant vigilance, to ensure that money which it makes available to the States shall be expended only on works in respect of which award wages and conditions obtain. Award rates are low enough in all conscience, and the economic position of the people is such that this Government should not lend itself in any way whatever to a perpetuation of the miserable circumstances that now exist. . Unless the Government is prepared to insert a provision in the bill to the effect that award wages and conditions must obtain in respect of all works carried out by the money to be made available under the federal aid roads agreement, I shall vote against the measure. The Labour party has decided to support this bill, but it is nevertheless necessisted any suggestion that the Commonsary, at this juncture, for. me to make some observations concerning the method of distributing the money to be made available under it. The Government is proposing to alter the method of distribution. It is provided that the money raised by means of the petrol tax shall be expended upon works which are in some way connected with transport. That phrase has a very wide meaning, and the Government should define it. It is well known to all honourable members that motorists who speed along our highways very often cause accidents necessitating the admission of unfortunate pedestrians to hospital. Is it to be understood that on this account the construction of hospitals is a work connected with transport? Tbe dangerous driving of many motorists very frequently causes accidents. Any honourable member who has had the experience of riding in a car driven by the Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) will know what I mean. Pedestrians who are aware that the right honourable gentleman is at the wheel of the car approaching them, take good care to keep well out of the way of the vehicle. The Labour party desires a provision inserted in the bill that all works upon which money derived from the petrol tax is spent shall be carried out under award wages and conditions. We know that under existing conditions some of the money provided from this source is expended on undertakings in which government employees have regular employment, and obtain regular wages, but some of it is also expended on what is known as relief work. If we were in power, we would not agree to a continuation of that policy. We would demand from the State authorities a guarantee that award Avages and conditions must apply to all works carried out wholly or in part by money derived from the petrol tax. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) desires the Government to .obtain an assurance from the State authorities that a certain proportion of this money will be expended on the construction of aerodromes. The honourable gentleman has evidently altered his ideas somewhat, for hitherto he has very strongly defended what he is pleased to describe as ""iState rights"", and has rewealth Government should attach conditions to the expenditure of the money which it provides for State purposes. I well remember that when measures for the granting of financial assistance to necessitous States have been under consideration in this House, and we have endeavoured to influence the Government tc frame conditions in connection with the expenditure of the grants, the honourable member has waxed very indignant, particularly when it has been suggested that in the use of such funds award wages and conditions should be obligatory. Now the honourable gentleman is adopting a different attitude. Apparently he says one thing when the wages and conditions of the workers are in question, and another thing when the provision of the additional facilities for the more favoured classes of ..the community are at issue. The Labour party considers that the proceeds of the petrol tax should be used only on works which will provide full time employment at award rates. In view of the fact that a very large amount of money is spent annually by",39,Menzies
125,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [8.8],"the Australian people in purchasing imported petrol, I submit that a portion of the proceeds of the petrol tax should be devoted to the development in Australia of plants for the extraction of oil from coal. This work could surely be considered as being connected with transport. If the industry were properly developed it would not only provide employment for many men who are now badly in need of work, but also relieve petrol users of the necessity for sending millions of pounds out of the country annually for supplies of spirit. I suggest to the Government that much of the money raised by means of this tax could be used to develop such an industry. I am not concerned as to whether the Government desires to establish it in any particular district. No matter in what part of Australia works may be constructed, the time has arrived when the Government, after obtaining many reports on the matter and sending its representatives overseas to obtain the latest information, should do something of a practical nature. I believe that one of the objections of the Government in the past has been that it would cost a great deal of money to establish this industry. But is not a very large sum obtained by the imposition of the petrol tax? Eveni f the interests of motorists only were considered, the estabDenison in making an appeal on behalf lishment of the industry would be beneficial. The honourable member for"" Denison( Mr Mahoney) has mentioned certain members of the community who receive no benefit as the result of the tax on petrol. I bring under the notice of the House the position of the residents of Lord Howe Island, where there are no constructed roads. These people use petrol, principally in their fishing boats and passenger launches. They pay the petrol tax, but receive no benefit whatever from the agreement. Until recently there was no medical practitioner on the island, but a doctor has recently been provided as the result of representations made by Labour members. The residents have no hospital or operating theatre, and a portion of the petrol tax which they are compelled to pay should be used to provide these facilities. Otherwise the residents should be exempt from the tax. ber must discuss the question before the Chair. tribution of the ""money obtained from the imposition of the tax. for a distribution of the money for certain purposes, and the honourable member is not in order in suggesting every other purpose to which he thinks the money could be devoted. cuss only the amount available to the States? ber may discuss the bill and all matters relevant to it. bers have referred to the construction of aerodromes. I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that an aerodrome might be provided on Lord Howe Island. I have noticed a suggestion that the island could be used as a stopping place for aeroplanes travelling from Australia to New Zealand. Some of the money might be expended in the erection of beacon , lights for the guidance of airmen. I join the honourable member for of the fishermen who use petrol in their launches. These men pay the tax without receiving any direct benefit, and in my opinion they should be exempt. The honourable member for Denison suggests that if exemption is not granted to them they might be supplied with free fishing nets or be given a bounty on the fish they catch, or compensation for the fish they fail to cateh. Many people are injured in motor accidents and receive no compensation because many motor drivers are not insured against accidents. The Government should consider the advisableness of using portion of the money derived from the petrol tax in paying compensation to persons injured in accidents on the highways.

Those who walk the country searching for work which anti-Labour governments will not provide for them have to traverse some abominable roads, in which there are deep ruts, and they have to carry all their belongings with them. Since these persons have no motor cars, it is necessary that the surface of the roads should be smooth. If the State governments cannot build concrete or bitumen roads everywhere, grading machines should be employed to smooth out the roads, and make them comfortable for these men. Honourable members from country districts have appealed, I understand, for expenditure of this money in rural areas. The alleged representatives of country interests never fail to make some appeal for the expenditure of money in their electorates. I do not complain on that score, foi , in my opinion, too much of this 1 money is spent' on works too close to the big cities.

Prime Minister must confine his remarks to the bill. a few moments with the principle that underlies this legislation. When introduced by the Bruce-Page Government some eleven years ago, it revolutionized in many respects the whole of the roads problem, of Australia. Por the first time in Australian history, a definite ten-year plan was 'brought iuto being to deal with that problem. rime, every method applied had been .spasmodic. The matter was largely in the hands of isolated shire councils, who. because of restricted revenues, were unable lo purchase labour-saving machinery, and adopt modern devices for the provision of the best possible road services. But since this legislation was enacted, and money has been available to enable them first to purchase plant, and, secondly, to use whole year, thus avoiding loss on overhead, a remarkable change has taken place in road services throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ( Mr Ward) objects to this money being spent in the city areas, and argues that the whole of it should be spent in country districts. Does he remember that Mr Lang, who at that time was Premier of New South Wales, refused for many months to sign the federal aid roads agreement because the Commonwealth would not delete from it the provision that the whole of the money made available to the States should he spent in country districts or towns with not more than 5,000 inhabitants ? not continued? by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) while he was Leader of the Government in this Parliament in .1931. If the honourable member cares to look up the records he will find that the provision that the States should spend 15s. for every £1 received from the Commonwealth was taken out of the agreement in 1931. Up to that time, for every £1,000,000 of Commonwealth money expended, there was also expended £750,000 of State money, and that meant the provision of a very great deal more work for the people of Australia. As I have already said, the first thing which this legislation did was to provide an opportunity for the improvement of road conditions throughout Australia. One has only to travel to see what a remarkable improvement ' has been effected. It also made possible, for the first time, the bridging of streams which for 140 or 150 years had been a deterrent to transport. Ten years ago, I believe, Up to that there were not more than two bridges over all. the rivers between Brisbane and Sydney. But what is the position to-day? A bridge over the Coomera and the Logan, and two bridges over the Tweed, the Clarence, the Bellinger, and the Nambucca, and so on right down the coast. It has actually been suggested that the Hawkesbury should be bridged. This has been made possible by the beneficent provision of the Bruce-Page Government that plant throughout the eleven years ago. The next point in connection with this plan for the building of roads is that, for the first time in the history of roadbuilding in Australia, it has been possible 'to keep men employed regularly year in and year out, with the certainty that they will be able to make road-building their life's work, and become highly efficient in the handling of different road surfaces. It has regularized employment in connection with road-building. Many men who were unskilled ten or twelve years ago are now highly skilled, and receive the full award rates provided for such skill. We have also been, able to develop a scientific staff of trained men to handle difficult materials, as well'as engineers and surveyors to plot and plan roads. A wider opportunity has thus been provided for the youths of Australia to secure decent jobs with some definite prospect of continuous careers. If there is one thing which more than another in the history of Australian road development is responsible for that, it is the definite plan which was laid down eleven years ago to spend £35,000,000 in ten years. Under the measure that the House is now considering, the beneficent operations of that plan will.be continued for",42,Menzies

157,Dr. Earle Page,"I have alsocaucus in this Parliament and fight for this proposition. I believe that he fought for it because it gave effect to the new principle that the area as well as the population of the State should be considered. The official Opposition at that time-the Pederal Labour party-oppose d the measure. the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and all the senior members of the party, opposed it. I am showing what was in our mind, and what actually occurred. The Prime Minister of the day, Mr Bruce, in reply to the interjection, ""Who pays for the tariff; does not the primary producer pay for the tariff?"", saidIf the honourable gentleman is quite sure the primary producer payB for the tariff, he might agree with the idea that the States in which great secondary industries have been built up should assist in paying for a road transport system for the benefit of the whole of the people of Australia."" That was the motive, the driving force, behind the action then taken. Whatever opposition there was, arose from the desire that money raised in a State should be spent in that State. The Government succeeded in carrying the measure, embodying the principles to which I have referred, by a majority of sixteen in this House. the right honourable gentleman ought now to eaplain what the Scullin Government did with the agreement in 1931 in order to ease the burden on the States. exactly what the Scullin Government did in 1931. In 1930, that Administration asked the States to discuss the matter, and informed them that it was no longer in a position to find the £2,000,000 a year for which the federal aid roads agreement made provision. in effect, "" It looks as though we shall not be able to find for you more than £1,400,000 or a cut of £600,000 in the amount agreed on"". The Government said as a compromise: "" Instead of the actual amount of £2,000,000, which we cannot find, we are prepared to give to you 2^d. from the ""petrol tax, and we shall vary the agreement in order that you shall not have to spend any of your own money in conjunction with Commonwealth money, in the States."" A most ridiculous proposition! The most ridiculous I have ever heard put forward! Because, contemporaneously with withdrawing the money in connection with the planned scheme of road construction, the Scullin Government made available another grant to the States', and asked them to supplement it with other moneys for the purpose of providing relief work on unplanned roads. It said in effect: ""We shall reduce the amount of money for the ten-year planned system, and at the same time we shall give you money to enable' you to proceed with unplanned works in order to assist in the relief of unemployment"". One of the tragedies of the depression was that, instead of much of this federal relief money being ultimately handed to the main roads authorities, whose engineers could have speeded up planned programmes of work for the following five or six years, so that they would have been completed in two or three years, it was used by the States in unplanned efforts and much of it wasted on ineffective works. ter is quite outside the scope of the bill. Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill.) desired to reduce the amount to £1,000,000. of what the honourable gentleman endeavoured to do on that occasion; but I do know exactly what the ' Scullin Government did; and furthermore, I know what the Bruce-Page Governmenthad done in connection with this matter. It had so arr anged matters that the money could not be diverted hy any State Premier from the development of country roads. But the safeguards we had proI t said vided were removed by the Scullin Government.

166,Dr. Eaele Page,"Some honorableprinciple that the Government which raises the money should have some very definite say in regard to the way in whicli it should be spent. That is exactly what is being done in connection with this bill. Provision is made not merely to continue the original rate of £2,000,000 a year and the additional million of money due to the increased use of petrol; but, insofar as the extra £600,000 is concerned, two stipulations have been made. One is in respect of the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of roads, and the other is in connection with other works associated with ""transport. of them are reasonable stipulations and I think that they will meet with the general approval of honourable members. At any rate the provisions have met with the approval of. all of the governments of the States. During the last few days, I . have been in touch with those governments, and I ascertained that the original agreement, made at the instance of one of the States which required some money to spend on forestry, was unacceptable in many quarters. I then asked the States if they were prepared to accept an amendment confining the works to those connected with transport. All of them have now indicated that they are perfectly satisfied with the alteration. The Government of New South ""Wales has always indicated its past practice, which is that immediately it receives the money it pays it into the main roads fund, because out of its own revenues it finds about four times as much money as the grant received from the Commonwealth for road construction purposes. I understand that Victoria spends approximately times as much money from its own revenues, and I have no doubt that a similar position obtains in the other States. The assertion that the State Parliaments are hopelessly inadequate to deal with their own problems,, is strange, because this Parliament is elected on the same franchise as are the parliaments of the States. The Government is quite satisfied that the conditions which are set out in this bill associate the tax raised from petrol with the objects necessary to be carried out by the use of petrol. I urge that, instead of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and other honourable members enDr. Earle Page. deavouring to exercise their ingenuity in travelling under the sea and by air to Lord Howe Island and many other places for the purpose of finding a reason for delaying the bill, we should ensure it a rapid passage in order to enable it to go to the Senate and there be translated into law, so that in July the moneys payable from this fund will be available to provide work throughout Australia. am amazed at the anger which has been displayed by the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) in describing those Both honourable members who have made suggestions in regard to this measure as being extremists of the Labour party. In order to emphasize the fact that only the extremists oppose such legislation, the right honourable gentleman went back eleven years to quote a number of Labour supporters who, on that occasion, voted for this legislation and showed that they are no longer members of this Parliament, The right honourable gentleman omitted the important detail that some of those former Labour men subsequently left the Labour party and in turn were left by the party to which they deserted. Tn view of the fact that the Acting Prime Minister made a great point about ' only the extremists opposing this legislation, it is interesting to recall the names of the "" extremists"" who voted against the measure in 1926. The division list includes the names of W. M . Hughes, G. A. Maxwell, H . S. Gullett, J. H . Scullin, W. Watson, P. G. Stewart, W. A. Watt, A. S. Rogers, E. A. Mann, P. E. Coleman, and F. Brennan. Because we have three criticized the provisions of this bill tonight, we are called the extremists of 1937, by the Acting Prime Minister. the honourable member quote? division on the second reading of the bill in 1926. As a matter of fact, the Opposition supports this measure, because it entirely agrees with it in principle. For years, the Commonwealth has levied an enormous tax upon the users of petrol and yet it gives no service to this class. The Opposition claims that -it is only fair and reasonable that, in the distribution of proceeds of this tax, a proportion of them",45,Menzies

169,Mr Rosevear,"I quote theshould be given to the State governments who have the responsibility not only for the maintenance of roads, but also for giving some service to motorists and other persons who pay the petrol tax. The Opposition goes even further by contending that the Commonwealth at the moment is not giving a sufficient proportion of the' collections to the States who are called upon to maintain the roads. The petrol tax is largely an imposition on motorists and is therefore a class tax, so that it behoves this House to ensure that at least a big proportion of the moneys collected therefrom are spent for the benecraft. Incidentally, the honourable memfit of the people who pay the tax. If we agree with that statement in principle, we should see that the great bulk of the money is handed to the State governments who service the roads. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) was criticized by the Acting Prime Minister because he suggested that in the distribution of this money some consideration should be given to municipal councils and shires. Throughout the depression, these local governing bodies have played major part in the matter of providing work for the unemployed at a time when the Commonwealth Government had abandoned them. As the result of shouldering heavy commitments in this regard, many of them are in a difficult financial position at the present time. Werriwa did not attack the principles of the bill, but dealt with the matter of administration, and suggested that the shire and municipal councils, being the authorities which maintain 80 per cent, of the roads within the districts which they control, should receive some consideration in the distribution of this money. For making this statement, he was charged with having adopted obstructionist methods and with having directed damaging criticism against the principles of the bill itself. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) has been accused of being an extremist and an obstructionist, because he ventured to express the opinion that provision should be made for the establishment of aerodromes and landi n g grounds used by civil aircraft. Commercial aviation companies are large users of petrol and consequently make substantial contributions to the petrol tax fund. The honourable member for Darling contended quite logically that if special provision is made in this bill for the States to set aside, whenever they are required to do so by the Commonwealth, a certain amount of money for the purpose of maintaining roads leading to or adjoining Commonwealth Government aerodromes, it was only reasonable to insist upon some service being given to aerodromes used by civil and commercial airber propounded precisely the same argument as that used by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who was not accused of being an obstructionist. I agree with the statement made by the honourable member for Swan, that in handing over the money to the States, the Commonwealth should not entirely surrender the right to direct how it should be spent. In expressing that view, the honourable member has shifted his ground considerably in comparison with other a arguments which I have heard him make upon similar matters in the past. In this regard, the Opposition has been consistent, because it contends that when the Commonwealth provides funds, it should at least have some say as to the direction in which the money shall be applied. tion, then, is consistent in error. but the opinion of the Opposition is apparently shared by the leader of the Country party, who stated a few minute's ago that he has consistently advocated that, when the Commonwealth applies funds in any direction, it should have some say as to the manner in which the money should be spent. But unfortunately while he believes in that principle, he is not the leader in this instance; rather is it a case of the tail wagging the dog. The honourable member for Werriwa apparently aroused, the ire of the Acting Prime Minister when he drew attention to the fact that, although this Government is controlled by the Country party, that consideration which should be given to country roads is not",46,Menzies
170,The Honourable Member For Mr Archie Cameron,The Opposi,47,Menzies
171,Mr Rosevear,"That may be so;given to them. The honourable member pointed out that the vast majority of the roads in country districts in New South Wales Avere in a deplorable condition, and he argued that the Country party, at least, should lend its support to the Labour party in its advocacy that some of these funds should he spent on these particular roads. It is no defence for the Acting Prime Minister to say that the Scullin Government, in 1931, struck out of tbe act the provision that the whole of this money should be spent in country districts. iHe has now a glorious opportunity to restore that provision in this legislation, because we know that this Government could not exist without the support of the Country party. If he believes, as he professes, that the principle of the original act, that this money should be earmarked for the purpose of building country roads, and that the action of the Scullin Government in striking out that provision Avas Avrong, he should accept this opportunity to restore that provision in the interests of country districts Avhich he, and his supporters, claim are their special concern. I agree, however, with the honourable member for Werriwa that the claims of municipalities in the cities and suburbs to participate in this grant should be considered. These bodies have become almost bankrupt through assisting the State Government of New South WalesI speak of that State particularly, because I knoAv the conditions existing there-to carry out its-Avorks programme. For that reason they should be given every consideration in this respect. I agree also with the claim made by the honourable member for East Sydney( MT . Ward) that this Government should sec to it that, if any State government carries out Avorks through the aid of this grant, award wages and conditions should be observed, and such undertakings should be carried out, not under relief, but full-time, conditions. I also support the argument advanced by the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) that provision should be made in this agreement Avhereby fishermen, who are users of petrol, will be protected in their arduous and dangerous calling by the erection of necessary breakAvaters, lights and jetties. Mr Rosevear. It has been argued by the Acting Prime Minister that this legislation will help particularly to develop the smaller States. I say definitely that the Proportion allotted to Tasmania is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of that State. For six months of the year the motor traffic using the roads of Tasmania comes from other States and is exceptionally heavy. Although it might be argued that to a degree local motorists use the Tasmanian roads, the fact remains that, for at least half the year, touring motorists from the mainland make the most use of them. For that reason greater provision should be made in respect of Tasmania in the distribution of this money. It ill becomes any member of the Government to describe members of the Opposition as extremists, or obstructionists, because they have had the temerity to suggest improvements to this legislation. It is totally untrue to say that the Opposition is opposed to the principle of this bill. I repeat that that principle can be thoroughly justified, namely, that the enormous revenue derived from the petrol tax should be applied largely for the benefit of users of petrol. Because Government members themselA-es, like dumb, driven cattle, are afraid to make suggestions, or to vote in favour of any departure from the terms of the agreement as it is set out in the bill, the Opposition will not remain silent Avhen it is obAdous that the agreement contains mistakes which, if not adjusted, will inflict grave injustice on some users of ipetrol as a section of the community. position ( Mr Curtin) said that the Opposition approved of the bill, and hoped that it would have a very speedy passage. it in principle. I suggest that the Opposition's criticism of the measure has been most useful. .Should the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Menzies) be preserved after the next election and, by some remote chance have the honour to bring fonvard a bill of this character, he Avill adopt the suggestions Ave now make and, in that day, I have not the least doubt, he will take to himself full credit for these suggestions.

They appear in the guise of direct descendants of George Washington when they say that. Their opposition, the honourable member said, is not to the bill, but to the Government. We realize that; no matter what this measure contained or what was proposed to be done under it, they would be bound on principle to be opposed to it, notwithstanding the statements made hy their leader. The honourable member also said that country roads in New South Wales were in a most deplorable condition. Not so long ago, with the honourable member for Riyerina( Mr Nock) I made a tour of about 1,000 miles through the southern and south-western portions of that State, and did not find any of the roads in a shocking condition compared with those in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. I visited Western Australia as recently as last year. I subsequently was in Gwydir and saw the roads described by honourable members to-night. If the honourable member says that the country roads in New South Wales are in an atrocious condition-and I agree that they are-surel y he will recognize that had it not been for the money provided by the Commonwealth to the States through the federal aid roads agreement, during the last ten years, they would be in a much worse condition than they are to-day, or, alternatively, the burden on the taxpayers in New South Wales would now be much greater than it is. The grievance of the honourable member on that score, therefore, is hardly justified. Commonwealth get that money? taxpayers of various classes who are also word "" vigour "" to "" venom "" ? taxpayers in the States. Another point which the honourable gentleman endeavoured to make was in respect of that venom is the right expression to use. Tasmania's share of this money; he As a matter of fact, the gentleman I have said that that State was not getting in mind has never exhibited any venom. enough. We are thus faced with the He has always approached the matters proposition by the Opposition that Tasunder discussion in a calm and judicial mania should be given more of this manner. This agreement was called in money at the expense of New South question by the States of Victoria and Wales, or at the expense of the rest of South Australia. It is possible that the the Commonwealth, because, after all, it honourable member for Barker( Mr has to come out of the same body of taxpayers to which the honourable member for Werriwa, ( ^ Lazzarini) referred r by interjection. Erom what I have heard in this debate so far I have not been able to gather any point made by the Opposition which would lead me to believe that the Government has made a mistake in respect of this measure. After this legislation has been in operation ten years, on the basis of an agreement arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth, whereby the States receive a greater amount of money than they have ever previously received for road purposes, we shall still find honourable members opposite-as they are now, and have been for some time, and will be for a long time in the future-in opposition. It is with every care and deliberation that I approach this measure from a point which has not been touched upon so far in this debate, namely, the validity of this legislation having regard to the probability that the same set of circumstances will arise following its passage as did arise in similar circumstances a few years ago. It was interesting to hear the Acting Prime Minster (Dr. Earle Page) describe as extremists certain members of this Parliament who opposed the enactment of the original federal aid roads legislation. If it is logical to. call such men extremists it is equally logical to describe as extremists gentlemen who did not happen to be in Parliament at the time, but who used their prestige and their talents in other spheres with all the vigour they possessed to prevent the enthe actment of this legislation.",48,Menzies

It has occurred to me that all controversies regarding the validity of Commonwealth acts, and of this one in particular, have assumed much greater significance since the recent referendum, arising out of the decision of the Privy Council in the James case. If a State government were now to challenge i he validity of this legislation, we might be faced with the necessity to hold another referendum. ""When the agreement was challenged in 1926, the personnel of the High Court was not the same as it is now. on the Bench the Chief Justice( Sir Adrian Knox), Mr Justice Isaacs, Mr ment as it appears in the bill was actually Justice Gavan Duffy, Mr Justice Powers, Mr Justice Rich, Mr Justice Starke, and Mr Justice Higgins, who was the dissenting justice in the case. Now, of those seven justices, only Mr Justice Rich and Mr Justice Starke remain on the Bench. In that case, the State of Victoria was represented by a gentleman named Robert Menzies, who, in the words of the Leader of the Country party, now must also be classified as an extremist. This is what he said in his address to the High CourtThe FederalA i d Eoads Act 1920 is invalid because it is a law relating to road-making, and not a law for granting financial aid to the States. It is, therefore, not warranted by agreed to at the Premiers Conference. cither section SO or section 5.1 of the Constitution. Looking at the preamble to the act and its substance, and applying the rule in Rex v. TSwrger (].)_. the act is one to provide However, even though it be granted that for the construction and reconstruction of roads, and the States are only concerned as contributors to the costs of construction and reconstruction and as agents of the Commonwealth for tlie purpose of carrying out tlie works. The defence power would only authorize an act' for constructing roads for militar y purposes. The FederalA i d Roads Act is not within the power conferred by section 51 (xxxviii ) of the Constitution, for the will not be the same, and all the portents Imperial Parliament is not the only parliament which could legislate as to road-making. If the act is one for granting financial aid to States, it does not comply with section 90 of the Constitution. Under that section the Parliament cannot attach as conditions to its grant any conditions which amount in substance to tlie exercise of any legislative power which is not within section 51 of tiie Constitution. Alternatively, .the terms and conditions referred to in section 90 are financial terms and conditions unless they are terms and conditions falling within one of the legislative powers in section 51. The terms and conditions referred to in section 90 must bo terms and conditions imposed by the Parliament itself, and not terms and conditions fixed by executive authority. The interesting fact is that counsel who then pleaded the case of Victoria before the court, and who no doubt believed in the argument he advanced, failed to convince the court. However, as I have lDointed out, the personnel of the court then was quite different from what it is now. Another point is that it is open to a State government n,ow, through its Attorney-General, to cite a case in regard to this measure for decision by the Privy Council. No doubt I shall be told There were then that the substance of this agreement has already been accepted by the States, but it is not known to what extent the agreeaccepted by the representatives of the States. agreement have been accepted in the form in which they are presented in this measure. discussions on tbe bill have taken place in the vicinity of this chamber, namely, the party room of Government supporters, and I assumed that, as the result of those discussions., the bill might have been amended in some respects so that it no longer represented what was actually Nevertheless, I accept the assurance of the Attorney-General on that point. the agreement in its present form has been accepted by the representatives of the States, it does not follow that the States will be represented by the same persons next year, or by persons with the same view.

I cannot imagine that South Australia and Victoria, the State he represented Court, would have objected to the original likely that they would be involved in losses as the result. All other aspects of this bill have been so freely canvassed ihat I think there is not much left to say. I thought this point of value at this stage in view of the changes that are likely to take place. If there is a 1 i ttle more time left, I am sure the House would be greatly interested to hear the view point of the Attorney-General to-day in the light of the changed circumstances since he appeared before the High Court in 1926. I offer a few remarks in connection with this measure in an endeavour to put a suggestion or two to ""the Government in regard to the money provided from the petrol tax which appear to me not to have received the consideration 10 which they are entitled. At the outset, J want to express my gratification at the fact that the Government has succeeded in agreeing with the States to a slight alteration of what apparently was originally intended as to the purpose for which the additional £600,000 is being provided for the States. It is gratifying to see that the Government is able to provide this additional money. Another particular virtue of the agreement is the length of its term. It is essenthat a particular State should do sometial, from the view-point of the States, [27] that they should be able to make their arrangements with regard to road construction in accordance with a long-range plan; on that account the fact that the neAv agreement is to operate for ten years must be very gratifying to the States. Although the length of the term of the agreement is, in the way I have mentioned, a virtue, it can become almost a vice if the money is not allocated on an equitable basis. We were told a little while ago by the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) that the original intention of the Government in imposing the petrol tax was to provide funds for the States to enable them to improve roads throughout their areas. It cannot be denied that wonderful improvements have been effected to our roads as the result of the expenditure of the road grants, but as time went on the rate of the petrol tax was considerably increased. I may before the High say that it is a matter of indifference to the payers of the tax as to what governagreement if it was ment increased it ; they are concerned only with the fact that they have been forced to pay more than double the amount they were originally called upon to pay when the petrol duties were first imposed, the additional tax going into general revenue. There are one or two suggestions which I wish to make to the Government in regard to this matter. To the extent that moneys provided under the federal aid roads agreement are not spent on roads and facilities for tlie benefit of petrol users, the petrol tax becomes a class tax. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has said that the road grant is not being spent on district roads in New South Wales. I may inform him that, in Victoria, there are 2,300 miles of State highways, 6,300 miles of main roads and 3,600 miles of what are termed developmental roads, the last-mentioned being those district roads which run out at right angles from railway stations, which is sufficient evidence to show that that State has been able to make good use of the money provided. It is obvious that the States have the right to spend the money for that purpose, if they wish to do so, and it does not become the responsibility of this Parliament to see thing which it has not been doing in the",50,Menzies

Petrol, by my indefatigable friend from Bourke which a few years ago, probably when the first petrol duties were imposed, might have been regarded to some extent as being a luxury, is to-day an important factor in carrying on the industries of this country, and is of great advantage to the community as a whole. I presume that the basis of allocation of the additional £600,000 will be the same as that made in the past. It has been stated by the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria that 65 per cent, of the total revenue provided by the petrol tax is being collected in New South Wales and Victoria, and according to information which I have received, something less than 30 per cent, of the money collected in those two States is being spent in them. In other words, the other States are being mitted arguments to the High Court provided with good roads largely at the expense of the taxpayers of 5ew South Wales and Victoria. However, I quite agree that part of the general revenue of the Commonwealth from the more populous States should be handed over to the smaller States because of their disabilities, and the fact that the Government, during the last year has allocated some £13,000,000 of its revenue to those States, is evidence of that necesat one case. If he went over the course sity. But the point I particularly wish to emphasize is that, as the Government will, in the near future, be givmemory over some of the people on whose ing consideration to its budget proposals, special consideration should be, given by it to a reduction of the petrol tax for the who was charged with murder reason I have indicated-that the extent to which this moneyis not being spent on providing greater facilities for the benefit of the petrol-users, makes it class with the bill; but I was reminded of it taxation. The Government has in the past found itself in the happy position of being able to reduce taxation considerably, and I submit that the petrol-users are entitled to special consideration when the budget is brought down in the near future.

I feel that the gaiety of nations ought to be added to a little more after the speech delivered by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), aided, I have no doubt, ( Mr Blackburn), alongside whom he is now sitting.

As far as I remember, it disagreed with my arguments with the utmost contumely; I went out of court feeling quite battered after arguing a day and _ a half unsuccessfully.

Debate resumed from the 29th June (vide page 687), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. Without any reservations respecting the possible invalidity of this legislation, the Opposition will support the bill. The reasons which have been advanced by the Assistant Minister as to the necessity for this legislation have appealed to us as being reasonable, and we think it inequitable that those primary producers whose claims were posted on or before the 31st December, but were not received in time because of the holidays or postal delays, should be debarred from having their claims examined and, if in order, granted. We understand that certain claims for the fertilizer subsidy have been disallowed because they were not received by the Secretary to the Department of Commerce on or before the 31st December, despite the fact that they were posted in time. endorse what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has said with regard to this hill, because I have placed before the Secretary to the Department of Commerce and the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) a number of instances far as I am concerned, I in which claims for the subsidy had been rejected because they did not comply with the stipulation that they must be in the hands of the department on or before the 31st December, although they had been posted in ample time to reach their destination within the prescribed period.

They This bill represents the fulfilment of that promise. It would be hard indeed on primary producers if they were debarred from participation in the subsidy on technical grounds. 1 know of several applications fr.om my electorate which were posted before the 31st December, but which, owing to the intervention of the Christmas holidays, or because of postal delays, were not received by that date. which I placed before the secretary of the department showed that the application had been posted .on the 28th December. locli, a wine-grower of Povolbin, in my electorate. I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to remove this hardship. Under this bill, all that is necessary for claims for subsidy to be granted is for the claimant to prove to the satisfaction of the Minister tliat the claim was lodged before the 31st December. I take it that this legislation will have retrospective effect. [9.53] I support the bill, but desire to oi Commerce of the Commonwealth on or have an amendment inserted in committee. The provision in the principal act fixing the 30th June in each year as the date before which the fertilizers upon which the subsidy is claimed must be used, creates an anomaly because it cuts right across the sowing season for grain crops in certain parts of Australia. I speak particularly for a district which fronts the Southern Ocean and is subject to wet and cold conditions. There we have the anomaly that certain farmers whose properties are removed from the coast, sow early and receive the subsidy-i u this case 15s. a ton-wherea s who are closer to the sea-o n Kangaroo Island and in localities near the Victorian border-and who have to sow later in order to reap their crops at the same time as the inland farmers, receive only ]0s. a ton. The same difficulty would arise if the subsidy were abolished to-day. It would mean that those who havo already, sowed would be entitled to a subsidy of 10s. a ton, whereas those who have yet to sow would not participate. is overlooking, the fact that they would are one year ahead of the others. Assistant Minister seems to forget that the Government forgot all about the subsidy for six months during which period' no subsidy on super-phosphates was paid. The farmers have already suffered that injustice, and I seek to prevent them from suffering further injustices. I welcome the bill, but I warn the Government that The postmark on one envelope in committee I intend to move to have rectified what I believe to be an anomaly and an injustice to a fairly considerable section of primary producers, notably the barley-growers in the southern parts of Australia.

It is true, also, that should a reduction of the rate of subsidy occur, such producers would only be entitled to payment at the reduced rate. There are difficulties, however, in having an overlapping period in regard to this matter. I do not say that these could not be overcome, but it is undoubtedly an advantage that the period for which the subsidy is payable coincides with the financial year. The sum of money required for tlie payment of the subsidy can be much more conveniently voted when the period of payment is identical with the financial year, although it might be practicable to allow an overlap if that were necessary. The points raised by the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Wakefield will be reviewed by the Government when future legislation of this description is being considered.

I hope that the Medical Research Council will co-operate with the research institutes already operating in the various States. Four are established in Sydney, three in Melbourne, and one in Brisbane. If the work of these bodies can be co-ordinated and unified through the proposed Commonwealth institute, it will be an excellent thing.

As time goes on, the position will unfold and the requirements of the council can be more accurately gauged. council's request is too modest; but, perhaps, it was afraid to ask for more for fear that the project would not be proceeded with. This year, out of a total Commonwealth revenue, estimated at £81,000,000, the sum of £8,000,000 is to be set aside for defence purposes. Compared with that sum, £30,000 appears too _ small for research of this nature.

The economic struggle, with its spasmodic employment and attendant worries, is the root cause of much of the tuberculosis, heart disease, insanity, and malnutrition among the people of this and other countries. Medical research is an insurance for the whole nation; it is still true that "" Prevention is better than cure "". Professor Harvey Sutton, the Director of Public Health and Tropical Medicine' at the Sydney University, in addressing members of the New South Wales division of the Australian D a i r y Factory Manager? Association on the 26th May last, saidIf we want, physically fit adults we must provide a more adequate diet for children. There are 2,250,000 men between 18 and 45 in Australia, but only 750,000 of them are physically fit. We are spending millions on armaments for defence, and we should spend a few hundred thousand pounds to feed the In addition to their children who eventually would have to do the work of the nation. Evidence given at the recent inquiry into malnutrition revealed that there are thousands of cases of malnutrition in Australia.

It is true that I have criticized hi m for talking rather than acting; but I realize that his advice regarding the necessity to increase the birth rate and avoid race suicide should have good results. On the 4th September, 1936, in one of his many statements to I shall direct the attenthe press, the Minister deplored the low wages paid in Australia, and said that they were inadequate, having regard to the cost of food. He addedI commend that conclusion to those industrial tribunals in whose hands lies the destiny of the nation. Facts which have been cited to-day are, I think, conclusive evidence, and, in readjusting those wages in such a way, they would provide a means of ensuring for their children an adequate supply of nourishing food. If the wage received by the Australian people is less than will provide milk and a reasonable standard of living, it should be altered. A study of the last Commonwealth census figures shows that 2,200,000 breadwinners in Australia received less than £3 a week and are maintaining 1,000,000 children under the age of sixteen years. It is not surprising, therefore, that malnutrition is rife. Owing to their low remuneration it is impossible for breadwinners to pay house rent, and also to educate, feed and clothe their children as they should",56,Medical Research Endowment Bill 1937 Second Reading

228,Mr Foede,"As the health of thebe cared for. I admit that the problem is a very difficult one. It is regrettable that the wealthy members of the community do not take a deeper interest in it than they do. The bill provides for the establishment of a fund, to be subscribed to by the Commonwealth Government and any members of the community who care to contribute. Let us hope that the Lord Nuffields of Australia will remember this fund in their wills, and that it will receive large bequests similar to those made, to universities. The Minister for Health, himself, addressing the Millions Club in Sydney recently, pointed out that, of Australia's 2,000,000 children, 40 per cent, were suffering from malnutrition. I presume that, before making that statement, the Minister obtained expert advice on the matter. It is astounding to find, in a country like Australia, that nearly one-half of the children are not properly nourished. Harvey Sutton and Professor-Dew say. Commonwealth and State governments should have done a great deal more than they have to deal with this evil, since there are nearly 1,000,000 cases of malnutrition. I do not contend that these are all attributable to lack of food. Sometimes, through ignorance, parents do not give their children the right kinds of food. Even in homes in which there is an abundance of food, cases of malnutrition are discovered. the wealthy. quently in the homes of the poor. The facts that 1,860,000 persons were admitted to the public hospitals in Australia in one year, and that the infant mortality increased in one year from 48 to 50 in every thousand births, show that this subject is one of grave concern, and that something should be done immediately along the lines suggested in this bill. Speaking in Sydney on a recent .occasion, the Minister for Health, himself, saidI t is df no uae to tell the people what they should do if they are not given the money with which to do it. He was referring, no doubt, to the appeals which he had made to the public because of the serious decline of the birth rate in Australia and the numerous cases of malnutrition. It has been claimed by conservative governments that child endowment is not within the fealm of practical politics, because it could not be financed, but I think that such a policy is amply justified. Children born in Australia are of much greater value than' migrants brought here from overseas. It is estimated that each migrant costs this country £1,000 by the time his passage has been paid and he has been settled on the land. I trust that the subject of child endowment will engage the attention of the present Government. In some of the States, it has already received consideration, but no general scheme has been adopted. The latest report of the Melbourne City Council's infectious diseases office shows that of 1,000 children between the ages of two and six years who had been medically examined, only 17 per cent, were deemed to have no physical defects. At the age of two years, 16 per cent, of the children were under weight. At three years of age 18 por cent., at four years 23 per cent., and at five years 43 per cent, were undernourished. Figures mentioned by the Minister show that whilst, for the census period 1911-21, the population under ten years of age had increased by 217,000. and for the census period 1921-33 the increase was only 381, the falling-off of the birthrate had cost Australia 350,000 valuable young lives. This position is astounding and must arrest the attention of all thoughtful people. In reply to a question which I asked in the House this week, statistics were supplied showing the percentage of birthrate in various countries at ten-year intervals since 1906 to be as follows:Country. 1000. 1910. 1920. 1935. 1930.

231,Mr Mccall,Often in the homes of,58,Number Of Live Births Per 1 000 O F Population
232,Mr Forde,"Yes; but more freThat table discloses a very serious position. In a speech delivered some months ago the Minister said that if the birthrate in Australia declined at its present rate our population would 'be stationary by 1960. That is most alarming for a nation whose development, security and general financial stability depend upon its acquiring a large and virile population. The financial and economic depression played an important part in reducing our birthrate. 2,200,000 breadwinners had to support 1,000,000 children on an average income of £3 a week. birth control has had an effect upon tbe present position. encouraged largely by the publicity given to the use of contraceptives. I was told of one trader who perused the birth notices in the daily newspapers, and then sent his literature to the mothers with a view to disposing of his literature at a profit. Prompt action should be taken by the authorities against those trading in commodities which have a detrimental effect upon the general health and welfare of the nation. An effort should be made to prevent such literature going through the post. been warned that their literature will not be transmitted through the post, and that should be a warning to others. should be raised to encourage people to have larger families. neration received by the breadwinner, the fewer the children. How does the honourable member account for that? rather spend their leisure on the golf links or at afternoon tea parties, than care for healthy and happy infants. Unfortunately women find children embarrassing, and it is a national tragedy that families are much smaller than they were some years ago. The position can be improved by raising the standard of living of the masses, and preventing, so far as is possible, the circulation of literature concerning Honourable members are aware that while the white population is increasing very slowly the coloured peoples of the world are increasing rapidly. Some honourable members have seen the natural and happy conditions under which the natives in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea live. On a trip in the vicinity of KaviengI saw thousands of natives indulge in a sing-sing "" surrounded by happy children and an abundance of foodstuffs. They knew nothing of the depression or serious problems confronting the world to-day. During that period Nature is looking after them and their numbers are multiplying at a rapid rate. The members of the Labour party believe that one of the best ways in which the birthrate in Australia can be increased is. by raising the standard of living; a man on the present basic wage cannot support a wife and five or six children in reasonable comfort. In these circumstances, there is every justification to establish in Australia a childhood endowment scheme. Children are of value, and the nation should assist the mothers who risk their lives in bringing them into the world. The wealthy should be compelled to pay higher taxes to finance an ondowinerit scheme, which, eventually, would have a very beneficial effect upon the nation. I support the bill. measure, which will be welcomed by all sections of the House, is particularly satisfactory to those honourable members who have directed attention to the unsatisfactory health of the community. At present the general health level in Australia is second, only to that of New Zealand, but there is also proof that it is not as high as it should be. We therefore welcome the bill as part of a programme which should be a means of improving the health of the whole community. Quite apart from personal considerations, honourable members should have a very keen interest in the subject, because of the extent to which ""the health of the people affects Commonwealth, finance. For the financial year just concluded the Commonwealth had to payapproximately £4,000,000 to 84,000 invalid pensioners.

239,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [10.40],"ThisMedical' Research. Council. That council, which met for the first time this year, has submitted a series of recommendations. The first recommendation wasTlio council wishes to direct attention to the importance in initiating a national scheme of encouragement to research, of(a.) encouraging young medical graduates to take up medical research as a career, and [b) securing definite and assured_ con. . search system now being inaugurated. As graduates will not decide to take up research as a career unless the permanency of the system is assured and as. the success of this new development depends so materially upon continuity, tlie council recommends to the Government that such legislation be passed as -will ensure a definite annual sum allocated is now impracticable to appoint a reprefor purposes recommended by the council. . The, council recommends that this annual amount be at first £30,000. The formation, of such a council in the Commonwealth follows upon the formation of a similar body in Great Britain. The latest report issued by the council in Great Britain shows that the Government of the United Kingdom granted to it for purposes of research during the present financial year, an amount of £165,000, which was equal to the sum allotted to it during the previous year. In .addition to this money, considerable contributions to the funds of the council for the promotion of particular classes of research were made by many private individuals and organizations. In this connection it should, also be noted that Lord Nuffield made a generous and ...fafrsighted gift of £2,000,000 to the University medical. research. and teaching in medical science.. The council in G reat Britain has been proceeding : with tie class of w.ork which, we understand, the council in Australia will undertake for.the Commonwealth. The matter of. research into occupational disease which was raised .hy the Deputy Leader of, the Opposition ( Mr Forde) is given close attention by ..the council in Great Britain, and if the honourable gentleman .will,examine its latest report, he will find that. particular reference is made to cotton .dust asthma, a malady which affects certain workers in the cotton industry. We may reasonably , assume that researches into the occupational diseases Ur. Bolt. along similar lines will be carried on in Australia. The council itself must command the confidence of not only members of this House, but also the Australian people generally. It has an impressive membership and consists of distinguished representatives of medical science. I regret to note that there is no representative of dental science on the council, particularly as that tinuity and permanence to tlie rebody on page 7 of its report, recommended that dental research should be encouraged and recognized as part of the general scheme of its research. I understand that appointments to the council must conform with rules which govern the formation of the body; and I suggest that if it sentative of dentistry to that body, a subcommittee of the council might possibly be formed for the purpose of considering dental matters and a representative of dentistry could be co-opted by it. I make that suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will give it the consideration that I feel it warrants. However, something more than the valuable endeavour of talented research workers is wanted, and something more than the recommendations of gifted men of science is necessary in order to obtain the best results. This fund, if it is inaugurated and adequately financed, will go a long way towards securing the services of research workers and giving to them the security of permanence of employment which is so essential if the best talent is to be obtained. But of Oxford for after having appointed research workers post-graduate and set up a council to investigate their recommendations and matters akin to them, it is sincerely hoped that governments will not, as is too often the experience, simply shelve the. recommendations which the council itself will make. Having regard to the capabilities and the character of the men who are the present members of that council, their advice should receive close attention and their recommendations should be put into operation as soon as possible. It is too often found that the Department of Health, which has. . perhaps, little political significance, is neglected far more than the important subject matter with which it deals, warrants. It is further to be hoped that, in these more enlightened days, with the evidence before us of what can be done in medical research and medical attention for the community generally, we can envisage definite progress in this direction. The council, however, has made recommendations along lines other than those of pure research and I hope that this bill merely represents the first step in an ambitious programme for the improvement of health. In his inaugural address at the first session of the council, the Director General of Health paid particular attention to the subject of the hygiene of childhood, and following upon his remarks, special heed of the matter was apparently taken by the council, which made a series of resolutions in the following terms:The council directs the attention o£ governments in .Australia to serious neglect in adequate supervision of the bodily development of children before and during school age. The important influence on individual health in the community of supervision of the growing child up to and including the stage of adolescence has been abundantly demonstrated. While something is being done on sound lines already, a relatively small portion of the field has been covered. The council considers that the whole system of health supervision of children should be immediately reviewed with the object of securing:(a) Regular and complete supervision of bodily health during infancy and childhood to the age of sixteen years. (6) Regular instruction of a l l children in the elementary principles of hygiene and in physical culture. (c) Regular instruction of all girls in the composition and preparation of food. The council considers that every endeavour should be made to ensure that each child should be medically examined at least once a year; it is desirable that the family medical attendant should be associated w it h these examinations as far as possible. The training of teachers should include instruction in physiology, physical culture, nnd the composition and preparation of food. The council cannot accept the present state of supervision of child health as adequate, nor indeed as being the maximum that the public will permit. It believes that a definite extension on lines indicated w ill receive widespread public approval. That is another direction in which this direction in which governments might Government, and the State governments well act. in co-operation with it, may act with advantage to the general welfare of the community. There is no necessity for me has to express the desirability of children, and adolescents having a continuity of good health assured for them by adequate preventative, measures in early.. childhood. ""We have the cost.of .our invalid and old age pensions bill to guide us and,, as I have mentioned and has been stated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we have evidence that the general standard of health, among the youths of Australia, particularly those , who have volunteered for military service or who were examined for militaryservice in the days of compulsory training, is far lower than it should be. Dr. Cumps'ton mentioned in his address how small was the percentage of children in the community who were given this medical examination, which is considered'to be so necessary if any preventive measures are to be taken at a reasonably early stage. He pointed out that I n the year 1933, when the census was taken, there were in Australia 1,252,602 children of school age. Of these, 142,429 were medically examined. That is 11 -per cent -only who .were under medical supervision that .year. The classification does not permit of any exact statement of the number of these who were found to be in some way physically defective but it is safe to place the figure at a minimum of 50 per cent. We may well stop to reflect that, while we spend a great deal of money and a great deal of time in educating the mind of . the childj we spend no time in our effort towards educating and developing his body. ..We know quite surely that diet and exercise;, are important aspects in the retention of health, but in respect of the nature of these have we taken anything like adequate pains to secure proper results. In this matter, we may well adopt' the slogan, "" Public health is ' public wealth"". I have indicated two lines along which progress could he madealong the lines of research which the bill envisages, and along the lines of greater supervision of hygiene in childhood. On that point I refer to the recommendation of the Advisory Council on Nutrition, that it is not only desirable, but also necessary, that a daily supply of milk should lie given to children of school age, and, as far as practicable, to children of pre-school age as well. That is another The Deputy Leader of the Opposition dealt with, the subject of malnutrition. I suggest that the education of the people is even more imporSant than any consideration of whether insufficient food is available at the present time. All the evidence points to the fact that, malnutrition arises, not so much from an insufficiency of food, as from an insufficiency of the right kind of food. The report furnished by the honorary physicians of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, states:Malnutrition does not necessarily imply an insufficient supply of food. Malnutrition in children may be due to : 1. Insufficient food, due to the poverty or ignorance of the parents. 2. Unsatisfactory selection of foodstuffs as regards constituents or vitamin content. 3. Some neglect of general hygiene such as a sufficiency of fresh ai r and bodily exercise4. Some inability to assimilate food, however reasonably selected, resulting from some constitutional defect in the child or from the presence of some diseased condition. Here is an avenue along which the educaother matters that have been referred to, tion of the people has yet a long way to it is obvious that expenditure of governgo. ' The council refers in its report to ment money, whether Commonwealth or the necessity for greater education, but, State, will be necessary. It is an expenas I mentioned earlier, it is fruitless for diture which, to my mind, should not be such a body to investigate these matters shirked, however great the cost; because I and make recommendations after due feel confident that the ultimate saving to consideration, unless its recommendathe community, not only in pensions paytions are given effect by the governments ments, but also in the avoidance of to which they are made.

I feel confident that I can not refrain from expressing astonishassure the Minister that he will have the ment at one particular remark of Mr Bolt. whole-hearted support of the members of this House in pressing for the inclusion in the next budget of the full amount for which the council asks. If , the programme is to be carried out along the lines recommended by the council, the amount of £30,000 will be necessary. Any less amount would involve some cur-, tailment of the programme, and it would be not only a distinct disappointment, but also, I suggest, a distinct slur on gentlemen of the capabilities of those who are represented on the council, if, in connection with the first report that they present to the Government, they found that they were to be denied the consideration to which their qualifications entitle them. For my part I give the Minister every assurance of support in pressing for the full amount recommended by the council. On the general question of health, including such matters as the supply of milk, the education of the public, and the I congratulate the Minister upon having introduced this measure, express the extensive health programme, and commend it3 passa.ge to honourable members.

240,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [10.56].,"ihe Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) when introducing the bill. honourable gentleman re-erred to the fact that there are two main forces which make for ill health, one being economic, and the other being due to disease. The sickness of some persons is due largely to underfeeding, but the sickness of others is traceable to overfeeding and flvcr-drinking. That is well recognized liy medical men. The right honourable gentleman brushed aside the causes that are economic, saying that they are most easily rectified. I remind the right honourable gentleman that he has been in this .Parliament for a long time and has held important positions in a number of governments. What has he done to rectify the position? He said that he did not need experts to tell him what economic factors make for ill health; he knows what they are, and in his opinion they ;ire most easily remedied. I repeat: What i.« he going to do in the direction of providing a remedy? What action does the Government propose to take in regard to four families living in a four-roomed house and using the one sanitary convenience? The right honourable gentleman knows that such conditions are being eradicated in older countries; yet they are being transplanted into this country. Let members of the Ministry go into the -lum areas which those splendid men and women who are working on behalf of the different churches are exposing every day in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere. What are their intentions regarding the habitations to which I have referred recently-me n sleeping under such cover us is provided by bits of bags stretched across poles, on damp or wet ground, thus sowing the seeds of disease, not only in themselves, but also in their children. The extent to which the ravages of these diseases will spread in the community is hard What does the right honourable gentleman propose to do about the man on the dole? To-day, if he is single, he receives about 6s. worth of food weekly, but nothing to provide himself with clothing or * shelter. In other cases, a man is given £1. for two days work a week, and on this he has to maintain himself, his wife and one child. Surely the right honourable gentleman has cognizance of these conditions. He says he knows all abou; The right them and, repeatedly, on the floor of th! House, he insults our intelligence b. telling us they are easy of solution. Ye. such economic misfortune has confronted the human race for the past 2,000 years. If he reads The March of the Proletarian Army, by Eugene Sue, the right honourable gentleman will find that it has been the sorry lot of millions of human beings throughout history to be forced to live under such conditions. Whilst the view expressed by the Minister represents the psychological outlook of those in control of the Government of this country these difficulties are becoming increasingly harder to solve. I promise the right honourable gentleman that he is going to be kept up to his statement that the causes of so much of the economic misery existing in our midst are easy to remedy. He has said that he does not want any one to tell him about this misery; he knows that it exists. I admit that we must have recourse to the scientists, who, in the laboratory and elsewhere, are risking their lives in an endeavour to solve many of our health problems. I pay homage to these men; for their services to humanity they should be given the highest possible remuneration and should be -honoured with the highest titles, it is within our power to bestow. I _have no adverse comment to make so far as their work is concerned. Indeed, the Government should endeavour to see to it that these gentlemen are remunerated at least as richly as those who prostitute science in concocting all kinds of gases which used in warfare do untold in j u ^ to the public health. There would be a different story to tell to-day if the world had diverted to this end the tens of millions of pounds which it has so lavishly squandered in enencouraging warlike activities which have caused widespread injury to health and to visualize. left the heritage of misery which scientists are now trying to rectify. I ask the right honourable gentleman, as a man who has grown old in the service of this country, to exercise what influence he can upon the Government to persuade it to bring down those essential measures which will make it so easy, as he says, to sweep away those economic evils which, in fact, are not only responsible for two-thirds of physical ill health, but also devastate the moral health of the people. A judge in New South wales, who recently retired from other day that poverty was the cause of the diseased mentality which had made 95 per cent, of the criminals who had appeared before him throughout his judicial career. We must attack not only the problem of physical ill health, but also those moral diseases which are pregnant with greater disaster to our people. So long as I remain a member of this House and the' right honourable gentleman is a MinisterI shall not allow him to forget the utterances he has made. If it is so easy to solve these problems, then why does not the honourable gentleman set about that task? So long as he, and the Government of which he is a member, fail to act in that direction they are recreant to their trust. Let us have his remedies for these evils; if he knows all about them, he should hold his head in shame until he has made some endeavour to apply them. Because of certain conditions existing in this country to-day, i ll health is rampant, and the very lives of children yet unborn are in danger. So long as such conditions are allowed to continue we shall perpetuate those two deadly words which did not appear in common use in the English language until the time of Henry VIII -paupe r and poor-house.

WARD (East Sydney) [11.5] I wish to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) certain matters which I shall not probably have another opportunity to raise this session. In order to obtain information from the right honourable gentleman I placed a number of questions on the notice-paper relating to Judge Dethridge, Chief Judge of the Commonwealth the Bench, declared the Arbitration Court. One of my questions wasWhat reduction of salary was agreed to by Judge Dethridge during the operation of the reductions of salaries provided for under the financial emergency legislation? The reply I received wasThe Chief Judge voluntarily surrendered a substantial part of his salary during the period in question. That, I suggest, is not a full' answer to my inquiry. I wanted to know what was the actual reduction in respect of Chief Judge Dethridge's salary. I feel sure that honourable members generally will agree that the reply is unsatisfactory. nearly all of the replies furnished to my questions are evasions. Another question which I asked was as follows:Upon how many days, and for how many hours during the past twelve months was Chief Judge Dethridge engaged upon the work of presiding over the sittings of the court? The reply furnished by the Attorney General wasTo obtain this information would be extremely difficult, and would unnecessarily occupy the time of officers. In any event, the question misconceives the nature of the functions of"" a judge, much of whose work must necessarily toe done at times when he is not actually sitting in court. I did not ask the Attorney-General to describe the duties of the judge. I asked definitely on how many days, and for how many hours, during the past twelve months he had presided over the Federal AND DUTIES-INTERNATIONA L Arbitration Court, and the AttorneyRAILGeneral should know that it is not difficult to secure that information. A further Does Chief Judge Dethridge perform any duties in return for his salary other than presiding over the sittings of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? The reply furnished to me in respect of this questionwasYes, many other duties.

I directed these questions to the Attorney General for the purpose of securing information to assist me in raising certain questions which I have been asked -to raise by representative bodies in the electorate which I represent. The replies given to me have been purely evasive, or, it may be, the Attorney-General absolutely declines to supply the information I seek. It would have been much more to the point, and more honest on the part of the Attorney-General, if he had said that he was not prepared, or was not able, to reply satisfactorily to my questions. His action in this respect simply amounts to trifling with honourable members who, in the exercise of their duties, and according to their privileges, seek information in this House. I hope that my remarks will be brought under the notice of the Attorney-General and that he will, at the earliest opportunity, supply the information for which Is the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) in a position to make a statement concerning the reports at present circulating of increased gravity in the relations of European powers, arising out of the situation in Spa-in? The reports portend increased tension occasioning grave disquietude regarding the prospect of maintaining the peace of the world. Has the Government received any information from the British Government regarding this matter? I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) a request from the secretary of the Boilermakers Union at Port Augusta, and the secretary of the Combined Unions, for the introduction of a system of pro rata longservice leave for employees of the Commonwealth railways. Correspondence on this subject has passed between me and the Minister, and the reply of the Minister was to the effect that the request would be discussed with the Commonwealth Commissioner for Railways. At present, it is provided that men, after having completed ten years' service, are entitled to long-service leave, but the men feel that an employee, after having completed, say, eight years service or less, and which Australia has almost a monopoly. who is then dismissed for some reason, should not be deprived of all benefits under this provision. Naturally, the men appreciate what has been given to them in respect of long-service leave, and they now courteously request that the pro rata system, as suggested, be introduced. [11.14] -To-day , the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) was good enough to inform me, in answer to a question regarding the disposal of tantalite found in the Northern Territory, that no steps had been taken to secure this metal for the use of British countries, and he added that the output of the metal was very small. This metal is so rare and so valuable that it is quoted in the world's markets by the ounce, so it is not surprising that the output should be small. The mineral statistics of the United States of America show that the ore from which the metal is extracted was produced in that country to the extent of only 100 lb. The Pilbarra fields in Western Australia produce almost the world's total supplies of tantalite, which amounts to 14^ tons annually.

I now see the honourable member for Martin wearing his hat, and he is entitled to do so. the main uses to which tantalite is put 'is for the strengthening and hardening of steel. Recently, the press reported the presence in the Northern Territory of representatives of two foreign countries who are trying to secure control of Australia's production of this metal. The Government should take steps to ensure that rare metals of this kind shall not be allowed to get into the hands of those who might use them for purposes not in accordance with the desires of British people.

We should conserve our supplies of that metal, and take steps to prevent it from being used for offensive purposes against us. The total production of tantalite up to the year 1934, which is the last year for which figures are available, was 216 tons, valued at £52,372, the average price being approximately £250 a ton. Tantalite is claimed to be superior to steel for surgical instruments and special tools, because it does not rust. It possesses a high degree of resistance to rust and corrosion. A journal called The Mineral Industry, for 1935, statesAlthough small quantities of tantalite arc produced in the United States of America, the chief source of supply is Western Australia, about 12 tons being produced there in 1934. Tantalite, a pure metal, is used for a wide variety of purposes in the chemical and electrical industries, and as a carbide in machine tools of various types where extreme hardness and resistance to abrasion are required. If we have any national outlook, we should take steps to preserve for ourselves an asset of this kind, which cannot, be produced elsewhere. I have no wish I hat other nations should be deprived of the use of our products when we have more of them than we ourselves need, but here is a metal of which supplies are very limited, and the Government should take such action as is necessary to keep those supplies under our own control.

An alien migrant who is not a dependent relative is also required to be in possession of £50 landing money if his maintenance has been guaranteed; or £200 if his maintenance has not been guaranteed. 2.

What was the total value in Australian currency of imports and exports between Australia and the Dnited States of America for each of the financial years from 1928-29 to 1035-36? 2. On what date was the trade diversion policy put into operation ? 3. What are the chief items of imports affected by that policy, and what has been the falling off in sueh imports? In respect of questions 1 and 2 replies have already been furnished. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information in respect of question 3:The chief items of import from the United States of America by the trade diversion policy, together with the variations which have occurred during the first year of its operation, are given iu the attached table. It is perhaps necessary to note that, although the policy came into operation on the 23rd May, 1030, it did not become f u l l y effective u n t i l the following October. This was due to the fact that a l l goods, for which orders were placed with the overseas suppliers prior to the announcement of the policy, and which lef t the factory on or before the 30t)i June, 1936, were permitted entry. It was also necessary in the early stages to grant a large number of import licences, in order to avoid hardship to Australian industries during the change over to new sources of supply. These considerations are sufficient to suggest that the figures in tbe table f a l l short of revealing the f u l l results of the policy. OF WHICH TRADE IS BEING DIVERTED.

320,Mr White,"On tbe 22nd June, the honorable member for Boothby( Mr Price) asked me a question regarding rail freights between Sydney and Queanbeyan and Queanbeyan and Canberra, and also regarding the freight on a case of oranges over these routes. The subject of rail freights between Sydney and Canberra has been considered from time to time, and it has been decided to continue on the present system of rating. It is considered that it has little effect on the retail prices of commodities in Canberra as the price per ton works out at a very small fraction per lb. Regarding the freight on a case of South Australian oranges, tbe answer to the honourable member's question is "" 2sTo"". Thcrje is a fiat rate of 6d. per wise for fruit from Queanbeyan to Canberra up to a maximum weight of 112 lb. This rate is considerably lower than the rate for a case of South Australian oranges of smaller weight from Sydney to Queanbeyan.
