The report, which has been received by the Minister, is favorable to the alteration of the Broadmeadows Camp, and improvements are suggested that will involve the expenditure of £5,000 or £6,000. It is believed that when these improvements are effected, soldiers will find every comfort at Broadmeadows, An HONOBABLE MEMBEB -I s it private property ? of it? over to us until the termination of the war. although the Department will have to spend this large sum of money in making tihe camp dry, and in making roads, a good deal of the money will be returned to the Government by the sale of the metal which will be put on the roads to the local municipality after our vacation of the camp.

The reason for this is that active service pay is higher than home service rates, and, in addition, separation allowance is paid to the family of the absent soldier if his pay is less than 8s. per diem.

120,Mr Mahon,"Why did Parliamentof enabling the work of a High Commissioner to be reviewed at the end of five years, hut certainly not with the idea of dispensing with his services if he has proved to be faithful to the responsibilities reposed in him. If the Minister considers that tbe provision in the Act is to be taken to mean that at the end of the period the occupant of the office has to go irrevocably, he might just as well argue that the same thing applies when we impose a term of three years on the services of a member of Parliament, or limit the period of office of any high public servant. A general application of such a provision in that way would demoralize public service altogether, and it has only to he mentioned for its absurdity to be realized. Yet that is' the only statement we have had from the Minister concerning dispensingI can use no other term-wit h the services of the present High Commis# sioner in London. In a very important matter such as this, the Prime Minister might have been expected to tell us fully and frankly what is in the minds of the Government, and the reasons they had for intimating to Sir George Beid that he must cease to be High Commissioner at the end of the present year. The position of High Commissioner is certainly one of the highest gifts of the Government, and one of the highest and most important positions in connection with .our Commonwealth. The figure Australia is likely to cut at the seat of Empire depends upon the calibre and general ability of the man appointed as High Commissioner. Has there been any complaint as to the way in which Sir George Reid has performed his duties so far? I have heard of none.

135,Mr Joseph Cook,"That makesend of the year, his term of office would not be renewed. In the meantime, all I wish to say is that this decision of the Government cuts right into the teeth of the feelings and wishes of the people of Australia as a whole. If ever a man had the right to re-appointment to a high position, Sir George Reid has, for the splendid services he has given to Australia, and for the way in which he has established the status of his office at the seat of Empire. It is just as well to remind ourselves of the sacrifices he made in order to accept the position. I am in a position to know that he was earning a much higher income than the salary we pay to him as High Commissioner. His receipts from his work at. the Bar were very much in excess of the £3,000 a year we proposed to pay him as High Commissioner. So the right honourable gentleman made a pecuniary sacrifice in order to accept this oflice. saved much from his salary in London. knows that Sir George Reid would not save anything. I do not believe if he were paid £10,000 a year he would save anything from his salary. He does nob belong to the class of man who can do so. The more he had the more, I believe, he would spend-that is, in connection with his office. Every one knows that Sir George Reid was always a poor man, no matter what income he made, or what position he held. The point I wish to make is that when he was asked to accept the position he made a pecuniary sacrifice in order to become High Commissioner for Australia; and now, at seventy years of age, after having served the Commonwealth faithfully and with distinguished ability in the centre of the Empire, he is practically told by the present Government that they have no further need for his services, and that he must make way for some one else, who at the present time is nameless. I think that the Government should tell us what was in their minds when they agreed to turn away this high public servant in this manner. They should tell us whether they were dissatisfied with the way in which he had performed his duties, or whether they had any one else in view, who, in their judgment, would perform the duties of the office with greater ability, and gain a better status in London than Sir George Reid could possibly get for the post. There can be no reason for a change except for betterment in connection with a high office like this. If the Government are dissatisfied with Sir George Reid's opinions, and the way in which he has performed his duties, it is their duty to the Committee and to the country to say so. In the meantime, I cannot help feeling that a high public servant has been treated very shabbily by this Government, and in a way in which he should not have been treated. the right honourable member served George Ryland as he did. tion of Sir George Reid's appointment an act of revenge for the dismissal of Mr Ryland? the minds of the Government. * ing about Mr Ryland's dismissal. ber was Prime Minister at the time. dismissal did not come under the consideration of the Cabinet. he was incompetent, and other statements were made. are of the right honourable member's political kidney they are all right; otherwise they are all wrong. that Mr Ryland was dismissed because there was nothing useful for him to do in the office to which he had been appointed.

The Minister of External Affairs stated the other day that he thought that after six years a man might lose touch with Australia, but Sir George Reid has not been away from Australia for six years. Quite recently he spent six months in Australia. In view of that fact, it is absurd, to say that ono who has lived sixty-five years in this country has lost touch witb it.

But before Sir George Reid left Australia.

Time went on, and the matter was, I think, referred to by Sir .George Reid in another letter. About the end of July or the beginning of AugustI wrote to him to say that the Cabinet had not yet decided the matter, but that, personally, I desired that he need not be anxious as to his position, and that he might rest assured that, pending a decision of the Cabinet, he would have an extension of at least twelve months. I made that statement on my own authority, because I could not get a Cabinet meeting to deal with the question, but I tqld the Prime Minister what I intended to do, and he consented to it . I have here a memorandum containing the exact words that I wrote to Sir George. They are theseYou may at least act on the assurance that your term will continue fnr another additional in every way suited for the position that twelve months. July. curred the double dissolution, and the murder of the Austrian Archduke which. precipitated the present war. It was then very difficult to get the Cabinet to deal with this matter. All the Ministers were not present in Melbourne, and although I brought up the matter three or four times I was pressed not to ask for its decithe changes in modes of thought and prosion. With the knowledge that I have of Sir George Reid's competence, and of the high opinion held of him by the people, not only of the United Kingdom, but of the EmpireI speak to some extent from information obtained from correspondence with Canada and the United States of America in regard to departmental mattersI thought that, whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the ordinary term of a High Commissioner, Sir George Reid's case was exceptional. The first consideration that influenced my view was that Sir George Reid took oflice with a Treasonable expectation of remaining there more than five years. It was he who established the office, and its dimensions and usefulness have enormously increased since, as is shown by the Estimates. He has had to supervise one of the most important Departments connected with our external relations. I hoped that he would go to America in connection with the Panama Exposition to deal with some matters of tentative policy regarding our commercial relations with the United States bf America. fore. great reception. have got an equally good reception' on his second visit. There may, perhaps, be no great difference between the absolute ability of members, but there are differences in the manifestation of ability, and that of Sir George Reid was peculiarly related, to his office. Because of his bonhomie, his reputation as a member of this Parliament, and as Premier of New South Wales for a long period of years, because of his aptness of phraseology, and his ability to hit the exact mood of his audience, which he has displayed in the United Kingdom as well as, on one occasion, in America, he seemed he was chosen to fill. There were other on the 8th considerations. Sir George Reid told me that, from 1907 until he left Australia, he was earning about £4,000 a year at his profession, and he had, in addition, the balance of parliamentary salary left after the various demands made on it . If he returned at the age of seventy, although he has a marvellous buoyancy of spirit and a wonderful fund of energy, he could not be expected, remembering fessional relations that occur in such an interval, to obtain again within two or three years the volume of practice which he enjoyed at the time of his departure. That is a matter which the Minister might reasonably consider. Taking all the facts into view, I thought that. I was entitled to ask that his case be regarded as exceptional, and that his term be extended for five years. him of a renewal for only twelve months ? get a Cabinet decision on the point. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and when the matter was brought forward the election campaign was proceeding, and we could not get a full Cabinet meeting.

My copy does not bear any date, because it was enclosed in another letter, and Sir George Reid apparently desired me to note, when he despatched the memorandum, whether there was anything in it with which I did not agree. memorandum reads1.

In July last the Minister wrote me a letter, dated the 8th, stating that the Government had not yet dealt with the matter, but that in the meantime, "" you may, at least, act on the assurance that your term will continue for an additional twelve months."" I have done so. 10. When the war broke out I telegraphed, "" All questions of increased allowance are now dropped."" 11.

I do regret that Sir George Reid was not appointed for a further term before the Liberal Government left office; but, having been beaten at the elections, we thought it more becoming of us to trust to the good sense of our successors to ratify the apparent intention of the previous Government than for us to forestall their decision in the matter by making the extended appointment before we left office. Not only did we act in this matter according to what I consider the best traditions of administration, but we applied the same principle to other offices.

All I ask of the Government now is that they shall look into all the facts, and say whether or not the case of Sir George Eeid is not an exceptional one, and whether there are not a good many grounds, which might not weigh in other circumstances, for saying that the re-appointment of Sir George Eeid for a further term of five years might be made. I cannot miss the opportunity of saying a few words on this matter. I have great personal sympathy with Sir George Eeid, and great admiration for his ability. He and I differed in politics, but I certainly do not think that he received fair play from the late Government. I have made that statement before in this House, '-and the remarks made to-day by the honourable member for Angas, whom I highly regard, clinches my opinion. There was a very sinister report in circulation that a member of the last Ministry made it a sine qua non of his supporting the Cabinet that he should have either the High Commissionership or a certain other position. word of truth in that statement. the Opposition gives me his word that the rumour is not true I will gladly accept it. scintilla of truth in it. use any harsh language; but the Leader of the Opposition will remember that I spoke very strongly on a previous occasion on this very matter, and an interjection gave me the clue to what I have just now referred. without foundation I am afraid that nothing tliat can be that definite statement, which I accept most willingly. late Administration from the responsibility of not making a re-appointment which would have been one way out of the difficulty. If there was anything to criticise in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition to-day it was the interjection in which he spoke of "" spoils to the victor,"" for that is a question honourable members opposite should never approach. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition should have thus spoilt the speech on which the Prime Minister complimented him. what the Leader of the Government said ? He said that the Coalition was formed specially to appoint Sir George Reid. heard what the honourable member himself said. I am also glad to see that the Leader of the Opposition is a firm believer in the initiative and the referendum. There is no doubt whatever that Sir George Reid has done good work; and if there have been any faults I attribute them to the officers and subordinates of his Department. We all know that officials in charge of Departments make mistakes, for which the political head is often blamed; indeed, sometimes the head is made a mere rubber stamp. It is a matter for regret that a man at the end of a long political life should be called upon to forego, perhaps, the highest position that the country can bestow. I can quite understand the honourable member for Angas feeling regret in this regard, but he must remember that times change. The late is not a Government, simply because they were supported by only the casting vote of the Speaker, forced a double dissolution. No doubt this event found them somewhat unprepared; but had they done their duty, as expressed in their own words, is not a they would have made this appointment. Had that occurred, it would have been sacred, for I feel certain that the Labour Government would never have done what the Cook Government did in dismissing officers simply because they were Labour men; and, in my opinion,' they cast a stigma on their escutcheon, which, for me, will never be wiped out. said on this side will alter the determination of the Government, though I am conThat does not free the fident that if the House were consulted, a substantial majority of members would say that Sir George Reid is entitled to a renewal of his term of office.

If it were suggested for a moment that there was any failing of ability, or that discredit had in any way been brought upon the Commonwealth by Sir George Reid, there would, of course, have been ample reason for bringing his period of office to a close; but the contrary is the case. Sir George Reid has not only earned distinction from an Australian stand-point, but he has made a reputation that is really Empire-wide. offer to him some recognition in the form of a renewal of our confidence ?. Is there any honourable member opposite who has not the most complete confidence in the impartiality of Sir George Reid? Has that gentleman at any time shown any indication of his previous political leanings in the performance of his duty? is not the slightest doubt that, from an advertising point of view, Sir George Reid has done magnificent service for Australia. He is trusted by the Imperial authorities, and both the British press and Imperial statesmen have paid their tributes of praise to him; indeed, he has been recognised by Royalty itself as a most fitting and successful representative of this oversea Dominion. for the termination of his appointment is suggested by the Prime Minister, who has told us that Sir George Reid, on one occasion, said that any person away for over five years was not in immediate touch with the affairs of Australia. if Sir George Reid did incidentally make a statement of that kind, it cannot apply in his case, because he has heen here within five years, and then travelled throughout the length and breadth of the country. I emphasize the fact that, in the discharge of his duties, Sir George Reid has shown himself to be completely au fait with Australian affairs, and has kept himself completely abreast of the times. The only two honourable members opposite who have spoken on this subject-the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Maranoa-have indicated a desire that there should be a renewal of the term of office. And why Sir Robert Best. It should there not be? If a man does his duty he is entitled to some recognition j and it has not been hinted or suggested for a moment that Sir George has not done his duty with outstanding ability. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister of External Affairs is at present in, the chamber, but I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to bring the views that have been expressed from this side of the House before the Cabinet. I am sure that Sir George Reid has earned the confidence of honourable members on both sides, and there is not the slightest doubt that if re-appointed he would continue to discharge his duties with the same ability as in the past. We know that Sir George made sacrifices when he acWhy, then, cannot we cepted the appointment, and that he would return subjected to the disadvantage that, owing to his lengthy absence, he would be unable to step into his former nlace. Under all the circumstances, I hope that the Government will see fit to reconsider their decision. [4.10] -It is very plain that there is little gratitude in the public life of the world. Many years ago a famous lawyer named Holman, in America, gave up his practice, as Sir George Reid did, and went into Congress, where, by his efforts and watchfulness over the finance-, he earned the title of the ""watch-dog of the Treasury."" The day came, however, for his One reason annihilation by a younger man; and at the declaration of the poll, paraphrasing Cardinal Wolsey, he said, "" HadI served my family half as faithfully as I have served my country, I should not now be turned out to starve.""

Reforms and change come; and, unless you are a ""rubber stamp,"" you get the "" toe."" has a fellow feeling? affect me, because, thank the Lord, I am above and independent of it all. But it grieves me to think that in the public life of the world there is so much ingratitude. When Sir George Reid visited America he outshone all the great speakers at the Pilgrims' Banquet in' New York, although he took a very unpopular side, inasmuch as he pointed outhow much America owed to Great Britain for her",20,Department Of External Affairs

On that occasion, the newspapers described him as one of the five greatest orators in the world; indeed, a seat in Congress was offered to him if he would only take out his naturalization papers. Further, the Americans, were looking forward to see Sir George at the opening of the Panama Exposition. ""We ought really to be fair. We ought to have appointed three Inter-State Commissioners, and the Cook Government should have given Sir George Reid another five years' term of office. But this country seems like every other country I have been in-everybody , if he can, grabs the best job, [4.14] -It came to me as a painful surprise when I read the announcement that Sir George's renewal of office was to be limited to twelve months, and it came as a futher shock to learn that there was no intention to give a further renewal. I do not wish to say much, but simply to record my appreciation, as a member of this House, ancl as an Australian by adoption, of the magnificent services which Sir George Reid, in his capacity as High Commissioner, has rendered to Australia. His name is a household word in the Old Country. Wherever the name of Sir George Reid is known-and I think it is known in every village and in every hamlet, if not in every house throughout the Empire-it is associated with the word ""Australia."" That, in itself, is one of the most magnificent tributes to the fitness of Sir George Reid to continue in office. My feeling is that any change that may be made will certainly not be a change for the better; and I sincerely urge that this matter shall be further considered before a final determination is come to by the Government. I hope also that regard will be paid to what I believe is the general feeling of this House. It cannot be said, even after the most critical examination of Sir George Reid's work as High Commissioner in the Old Country, that he has in his capacity as the representative ol the Commonwealth in London ever betrayed the slightest party bias or the slightest predilection for one colour or another in connection with political matters. from all questions of a party complexion, and has devoted all the powers at his command-and every one will admit that those powers are extraordinary-to the welfare of Australia and to making Australia known throughout the world. Sir George has answered all the criticisms that have been levelled at Australia, and has done his besta magnificent best, too-to advertise its resources, its wonderful opportunities, its people and its institutions in the Old World. It will be admitted, I think, that during Sir George Reid's term of office Australia has become much better known than it ever was previously in its history; and I urge again that, before any final determination is come to, the question of renewal should be further considered by the Government. I feel sure that a decision to renew Sir George Reid's term of office will meet with practically the unanimous Indorsement, not only of members of this Parliament, but of the whole people of Australia. I hope the Ministry have not left this matter in such a position that it is impossible for them to give a further extension of time to Sir George Reid. The general opinion throughout Australia is that Sir George has occupied his office with credit to himself and distinction and benefit to Australia. Sir George has also rendered great service in the interest of the Empire as a whole, as well as of Australia. I still believe that the opinion of this House is the opinion that was expressed by the present Minister bf External Affairs when he spoke on the 27th January, 1910, regarding Sir George Reid. He then saidDuring the last three or four j'ears if the House had been called upon to elect a High Commissioner, the choice of Sir George Beid would have been practically unanimous. I believe if we had a free and secret ballot to-day, the House would again be practically unanimous in their opinion as to whether Sir George Reid ought to continue in office. Later the present Minister, again dealing with Sir George Reid's appointment, saidThe Labour party is immensely pleased with the distinct honour paid to Sir George Reid.

He is a man of uncommon gifts and strong individuality, and must necessarily imister to give us some information upon press the people of the Old World. There was prophecy in those words by the Minister, who was speaking at that time as a representative of the Labour party, and I think the terms of the prophecy have been amply fulfilled. Sir George Reid has reached the high ideal that was then expressed of him by the> Minister. I want now to deal with one or two other matters which come under this particular vote. Obviously, while the war is in progress, the question of immigration must sink in the background so far as regards the actual transportation of persons across the sea; but I saw the other day an article in one of the leading English newspapers dealing with the action of the Canadian Government in connection with immigration after the war. from the Canadian point of view. It raised the very important question as to what steps should be taken at the present time for the purpose of securing at the close of the war a stream of suitable immigrants into Canada, and I think it would be advisable for the Minister to give consideration now to that important question, with the object of developing a policy to be brought into operation at the conclusion of the war. Judging from the trade relations which existed before the outbreak of hostilities, there was an enormous demand all over tiie world for the primary products of Australia. When the war ceases that demand will not be decreased. It will certainly continue, and possibly may be largely increased. New markets may be opened up in direct consequence of the war, and it may become a serious problem as to how best the developments that will be necessary can be met, and how a steady influx of suitable immigrants can be maintained. The development of the Australian export trade to Europe is also covered by this vote, and I would like the Minister to inform the Committee whether he has received from the High Commissioner any suggestions on this point. On a previous occasion the High Commissioner did make recommendations. One was that an expert might be appointed to deal with the Australian exports. A recommendation was also made with regard to the advertising of Australian produce, though for the time being that will, I presume, be suspended. But the question as ro what new markets are likely to be opened important one, and I would like the Minthe point, particularly if he has been in communication with the High Commissioner upon the subject. I would also liko to know to what extent the Minister is carrying on his advertising campaign at the present time. It is quite conceivable that operations in this respect will have been cut down, but I can see no harm in -continuing the advertisements which deal with land settlement and immigration, and also those that will have the effect of creating greater confidence in tlie financial stability of Australia. literature.

A t the present time, when we are engaged in this great war, I think we should consider the advisability of following the example set by the Imperial Government, and drop all questions of party in order to deal most effectivelv 'with the great problems that have arisen. If the Imperial authorities have thought it necessary to take up an attitude of that description, I think it is equally desirable for us in Australia to continue Sir George Reid in his office, particularly as he is so closely in touch with all the interests of Australia as well as with matters affecting the Empire generally. This, of all times, is the worse to make a change in the most important office that we have in the Public Service. If a vote were taken throughout Australia as to whether Sir George Reid should continue in oflice for another period, I feel that the decision would be almost unanimously in favour of the retention of his services.

Only a few moments ago we heard honourable members on that side vieing with honourable members on this side in their eulogies of Sir George Reid. The honourable member for Darwin could not have spoken more strongly, and the interjections made by the honourable member for Maranoa showed what his views of the matter are. tween them. tice, which is stronger than that of politics. The Government have not given one reason why a change should be made. Can they find for the position a man who is incloser touch with public opinion in Australia, and who has done more for the Commonwealth, than Sir George Reid has done as High Commissioner? Can they find a man standing higher in the opinion of not only Australia but the whole of the British Empire? If his term of office be not extended, we shall lose the services of one of the most valuable officers who could be appointed to such a position. I hope that the Government will reconsider their decision, and that they will be fair to the House, as well ns to the country, by putting to avote, on who carry out examinations of this kinda non-party basis, the question of whether Sir George Reid should not continue, in oflice as High Commissioner. I should be glad if the Minister would make a statement as to the attitude of his Department with respect to advertising in Great Britain and Ireland, immigration, and the development of the Australian export trade in Europe.

The oil found at 320 feet was analyzed on behalf of the Department by Mr Wilkinson, and also by Professor Bell, who is, I think, chemical adviser to the Navy. Mr Wilkinson, who supplied to, the Department much information regarding the process of separating the elements of the oil in order to ascertain its general commercial value, reported that it was similar to that obtained in the Borneo and Sumatra fields, and that paraffin wax was obtained from portion of it. I mention this because last night the honourable member for Henty wished to learn whether this oil has an asphaltic or paraffin basis. Dr. Wade, in his report, mentions four or five of tlie elements, which include light petroleum, kerosene, lubricating oils, and coke and asphaltic constituents. fessor Bell expressed the opinion that the oil was of almost too good a quality to be used for fuel. Mr Wilkinson gave me a list of the elements of petroleum as they are taken off in the process of distillation. I cannot say how many of these are contained in the oil found at a depth of 320 feet in the Papuan bore, because at the time. I received this information it had not been so exhaustively supplied; but the order of elements in distilling is, first of all, benzoline, then motor spirit, a heavy benzine, and afterwards best benzine, up to 150 degrees test; then second-grade kerosene, clearing kerosene, fuel oil, lubricating oils, another the name of which I cannot remember, paraffin wax, sulphate of ammonia, and finally the gas. According to the reports, some of these elements were discovered in the first oil obtained at a shallow depth. vice that we received from Mr Grebin, who was acting for the Department before Dr. Wade was appointed, was that Two bores the commercial oil is not found in quantities until a depth of 1,000 feet is reached. It is found necessary sometimes to go to a depth of from 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet in order to obtain the oil in quantities, but I believe that the discoveries made in Papua are as good as those obtained at a similar depth in other parts of the world. Let me deal with this question for a moment'from an Imperial stand-point. About £15,000,000 has been invested in Russian oil-fields by capitalists in the Dnited Kingdom, and of that sum about £10,000,000, I believe, is productive. The balance has been sunk, as so often is the case, in connection with speculative companies. The Imperial Government a short time ago invested £2,000,000 in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and they are taking a keen interest in the oil-field operations in Papua. If we succeed, as I think it likely we shall, in obtaining the oil in commercial quantities, it will be of great value for the purposes of naval defence. As to the question of allowing private companies to develop the oil-fields of Papua, I think that the proper policy is that now being adopted-that we should wait until we can ascertain what the fields are likely to be. I was informed by Mr Grebin that in Russia two-thirds of each marked block is reserved by the GovernProment, only one-third being leased, and that the Russian Government engage in deep boring and geological examination on the reserve portion of each block. They bind the lessee also to carry on the work of developing in a genuine manner on the portion leased to him. The Standard Oil Comapny was refused a -licence to exploit any of the oil-fields of Burmah. The Imperial Government are very jealous of allowing outside companies to exploit fields that ought to be retained for the use of the British Navy. They allow opportunities to some British companies to deal with a portion of such fields; but, having regard to all the circumstances, I think we are wise in waiting'to see what the discoveries amount to before framing any definite policy. When we find oil in commercial quantities, as I believe we shall, at a depth of 1,000 feet, the question of policy can be disThe adcussed.",24,Department Of External Affairs

All these matters have been considered by the Department. years ago we set aside some £50,000 as a bonus to encourage the shale oil industry, which is not as good, when developed, and is more difficult to develop than is that of liquid oil; so that I think the Government expenditure on the Papuan oil-fields, which, up to the present is not more than £15,000 or £20,000, is more than justified. the other is in the air. try, and when a certain stage is reached an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, perhaps, will be involved. We shall then have a development on a large scale. Last night the Minister gave 'i.s some very useful information in regard to the development of Papua. The Lieutenant-Governor has pointed out that the reason for an apparent slackening in development is, that the plantations have now reached a certain stage where extension has ceased, and when the planters, after a period of five or six years, antisuggested as necessary for the purpose of cipate some commercial return. While the preparation of the land was going on there was a larger importation, and, possibly a more buoyant Customs revenue.

Parliament should consider the matter of helping the Papuan settlers to some extent in that direction, though possibly they would not get much relief from the remission of the duties on the class of produce they would export to Australia. The principal and most nrofitable industry is copra; rubber comes next in importance. I hone that the experiments made by the Government on four or five plantations will prove successful. In [142] 1911 Mr Batchelor obtained the sanction of the Rouse to the expenditure of £25.000 spread over five years on experiments for the purpose of encouraging the growth of rubber and copra. An area of 1,500 acres was set aside for the pumose, and to the end of June last, about £16,000 had been spent in this direction. I believe that there was an unexpended balance of about £5,000, while another A few £5,000 was in some trust fund, but the Administrator told me that he thought it would be necessary to get £10,000 more in order to bring these experimental plantations into bearing. This would mean a total expenditure of £35,000 on a limited area of 1,500 acres, the estimate being based on the experience in the matter of clearing and planting four of the principal plantations in Papua. I understand that the cost of preparing land for copra is about £23 an acre, but as there are considerable profits when a plantation is so developed that it will give a commercial return, the Administrator expressed the hope that when the plantations were in full bearing considerable profit would be yielded to the Commonwealth. I trust that this will be the case, though, so far, there have been some faults in regard to the estimates made. The Minister has explained that some works have not been carried out, owing chieflv to the war having broken out. BeforeI left office I went through some of the works which the Administrator had developing Papua, but complaints have been made that these works have not been pushed on. had not the war intervened, I believe that the Minister would have sanctioned a number of works for which provision had been made. As there is very little light thrown on the problems of Papua in this chamber, it is as well to mention a few of the works which it had been in 1 tended to carry out. These were: Coastal lighting. £720; lighthouse, Port Moresby, £15,000; Hombrom Bluff to Sogeri road, £1,600; Bootless Inlet to Astrolabe road, £900; Rigo to Kemp Welch road, £2,550; Gadagabuna (Milne Bay) to Saggarai road, £4,000; and roads giving access to agricultural settlement oh Woodlark Island, £2,000'.

It is necessary to add £3,000 or £4,000 to cover the cost of delivery at Port Moresby.

As a matter of fact, the figure I have mentioned was the tender of a Government establishment. slightly doubtful about the low tender received from the United Kingdom, and therefore we did not accept any tender. An attempt was then made to get a second hand steamer, but I would not accept any that was offered.

It must also be suitable for the carriage of prisoners. The means of communication in Papua being so slight, occasionally prisoners must be conveyed from place to place on the open sea. As all these things have to be taken into account, the task of securing a suitable steamer is rendered difficult. We have no reason to be despondent in regard to Papua. From my experience of him, I know that the Lieutenant-Governor is well fitted for the position he is filling. He is efficient and energetic, and never spares himself, and from what I have heard he seems to be the most approachable man we possibly could put in the position. New Guinea, or Papua, as we generally The lowest tender know it , though now that we have taken over the whole area the Territory will probably revert to its old name, seems to be capable of development in several directions. I intend to speak to one only, and that is the question of producing oil. We know that one of the severest contests of the war is being waged in Galicia for the sole purpose of gaining control of the oil wells, and it seems that in New Guinea, or Papua, we have every possibility of obtaining a good supply of oil I was for the British Empire. If there is one thing of which the British Empire is decidedly short it is oil. We are all aware of the agreements that have been entered into with Russia and Persia, by which the Imperial authorities have obtained concessions to get oil in those countries; and if we can prove that there are good oil-bearing beds in New Guinea, and can make them productive, we shall be doing a great deal to assist in the prosecution of the war. For this reason I make these few brief remarks complementary to the question I placed on the However, I did not accept any business-paper this afternoon, in order to impress upon the Minister, if such a course be necessary, the extreme desirability and urgency of doing all that can be done in the direction of developing the oil resources of New Guinea. terday I spoke at considerable length upon the subject of oil, but not with a view to discouraging the development of oil-fields in Papua.

That policy has been tried .and been found wanting even in countries easy of development, and yet Ministers expect to apply it successfully to the most difficult part of Australia, and to secure settlement there. It is like flying in the face of nature to expect it. Of all the land that remains to be settled in Australia, the Northern Territory should be shorn of every disability from which it is possible to free it. Even if that country . it will be difficult enough to get people to settle there. If the Ministry, in dealing with the most difficult portion of Australia, seek to impose the discarded principle of leasehold titles, they will make the settlement of the country absolutely impossible. For fifty years South Australia tried to get people to settle there, aud spent a considerable amount of money in their endeavour, until the Commonwealth took over the Territory with the idea of bringing about some improvement. The Commonwealth has also spent large sums of money there, yet there has been a gradual decline 330,000,000 acres in the Northern Territory, only 473,000 acres, or .14 per cent., have been alienated. In 1901 the occupied area was 113,000,000 acres, and in 1913 only 96,000,000 acres. During the time that the last Labour Government was in power, there was a considerable decline in occupation there. The Government [142]2 will make the Territory a failure, from the point of view of occupation, if somechange is not made in the system of .land tenure. The leasehold system was tried in Victoria, and failed. It is the freehold system that alone induces settlement. That has been noticeably proved in the case of the Mallee country of thisState. I challenge any honourable member to show that the leasehold system hasinduced permanent settlement in any part of the world, or brought about the cultivation of the land necessary for its maximum production. In New Zealand theBalia nee Government created a perpetual lease, having a term of 999 years, with a rental equivalent to 4 per cent, of the value of the land, the conditions being probably the easiest in the world. No civilized country has ever that, there was a constant agitation during the terms of the Seddon and the Ward Governments for the conversion of these leaseholds to freeholds, and the Massey Government was compelled to promise that conversion. hold system has been a success in connection with private holdings? success.

They have not truly endeavoured to develop settlement in the Northern Territory, and for that they should be condemned to everlasting obscurity. There is no excuse for their attitude, because they cannot point to any country in the world where the leasehold system has been a success. Australia, more than any other country, needs population, and mould offer every inducement to settlement, because its' position geographically is a perilous one. There is no justification for the action of the Labour party in re-introducing exploded theories and recommencing experiments that have proved a failure. Unless the Government are prepared to alter the system of land tenure in the Northern Territory, and to change conditions there in many respects, the country will remain undeveloped, and will thus be a standing menace to the future integrity of the Oommonwealth. the honourable member for Wimmera had been speaking against instead of in favour of the freehold system, most people would endorse his statements, because no other system of land tenure has proved so inimical to human liberty as that. member own the land that he farms? an island where only one kind of food was obtainable, I should be forced to eat that food. of leasehold land available in New South yy JIIGS the interests of the majority of the people before my personal interests should satisfy fair and impartial minds thaf> I am desirous of doing the right thing. We have only to look at the figures to see what a complete failure we have made of land settlement by the adoption of the principle of freehold tenure. I gave the information to the House when speaking on the subject some time ago. I then pointed out that, although our population is less than 5,000,000, and our territory exceeds in area 3,000,000 square miles, Governments, to create closer settlement, are buying back at huge prices ft little of the land which they had foolishly bartered away. As one who has been engaged in the administration of the Closer Settlement Boards of New South Wales, I say that by adopting freehold tenure in the Northern Territory we should forge new fetters for the future generations of this land. land is alienated. fertile areas, where illimitable wealth could be produced, to herd in the cities, and it is almost impossible to keep population in the country. The tendency of humanity is to oppress its fellows. The highwayman armed with a gun is able to exploit travellers by road, and men given land in fee simple are put in a position to control the lives of countless millions who are in no way their inferiors. Thinkers like W. E. Gladstone, James Anthony Froude, and John Stuart Mill have condemned the freehold principle as unsound, and the Labour party has an opportunity, if it possesses the courage and ability to use it, to institute a system which will be an object lesson to the world. I speak as a land-holder, who puts the interest of the genuine land user before everything else. Unless we adopt some policy of leasing for the land of the Northern Territory, there must be conthe honourable stant doses of land taxation, and that panacea is a crude and clumsy expedient compared with the perfect leasehold system by which reproductive labour will be set free. wishes to tax the leaseholder as well as the freeholder. freehold which has so long cursed the world makes us adopt methods which would be unnecessary under other circumstances. We have been told that the possession of a leasehold gives no incentive to exertion; that a man must own his land before he will exert himself to improve it. It is a strange thing that qualities which are shown when persons become the lessees of private landlords should disappear when they become the lessees of the State.

If the principle is sound, it is a reflection on human intelligence to say that we cannot provide for the details. Let us look at the contrary system of freehold, as we have it in New South Wales and Victoria. We find that before there is . a population anything like a tenth of that which a State could carry. pelled to buy back land. The same principle is applied to mining, to "" encourage capital,"" as it is called, and we know the sort of development that takes place; indeed, if the present system were specially designed to prevent true mining development it could not be more effective. In New South Wales, with the conditions of which I am the better acquainted, can anv man show me anv mines discovered simply because of the application of capital ? In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, mines are discovered in consenuence of the daring and enterprise of the man with the m'ck and shovel. are developed by capital. the discovery of mines. I wish it to be understood that I am not indicting capital, which does not receive, from either this side or the other, the consideration it deserves. I am now speaking of legitimate capital, used directly in assisting its parent, labour, to carry on production. We were fighting for years in New South Wales for a Mining on Private Lands Act, and the remarks I am making are applicable also to mining on Crown lands, except that I am stating the strongest case. If a man who has discovered some "" show,"" makes an application under tlie Mining on Private Lands Act, he begins, after certain preliminaries have been complied with, to develop the particular lode, or whatever it may be. Then a man, whom we call a "" capitalist""-thoug h I say this is an illegitimate use of the idea of capitalcomes along, and, if he thinks the circumstances warrant, he may lodge applications for as many leases as he likes, with the result that by the time the real miner has discovered something good, and a rush sets in, it is found that the country is pegged out all around, and those who hold the titles begin to float "" w i ld cat "" or genuine mines-al l based on the discovery of the miner. This is tolerated; and yet it would be very simple to prevent it, and enable the State to render the necessary assistance, and see that the real worker got the benefit of the discovery. As a matter of fact, the way is paved for monopoly, and those who support the system of freehold land, or the present system of mining, never stop to consider that the interests of individuals are always made subservient the Government is comto the favoured few who possess capital. The principle of Socialism is the principle I look forward to as that on which the development of the Northern Temtory depends, especially in the matter of land; and I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Flinders say, some time ago, that we of the Labour party went through the country at election time preaching direct opposition, and almost undying enmitv. to capital.

More particularly am I at variance with him in his somewhat peculiar historic view of certain Acts of Parliament passed in New South Wales. -It would appear that, before one can speak on land questions here, it is necessary first of all, to advertise the fact that you New South Wales. are a practical man; and in this regard I am fortunate, though, unlike the honourable member for Werriwa, I have no share-farmers to help me. whole of tlie work on my farm, either with my own hands, or those of my family, or of the men I engage and pay. came so successful that I need no longer do so. ber for Werriwa, when dealing with the New South Wales Act of 1908, seemed to forget that then, for the first time in that State, provision was made for leaseholders to convert their holdings at their own option into freeholds. I happen to know something of this, because I was at that time a member of the State Upper House, and assisted in some slight degree in making thab measure law. This conversion, it will be noted, was not compulsory, but absolutely voluntary. pulsory -in New South Wales, we are told that draw attention to the fact that it was not Sir Joseph Carruthers who brought in that Bill, but the Honourable Charles G.

The honourable member for Werriwa holds land under conditional purchase, or, for all I know, under freehold-a t any rate, he admits he owns the land-and , if he is such a "" whole-hogger "" for leasehold, how is it he has not taken advantage of that Act, (Hume) [5.37] I and converted his own land to leasehold tenure? If the honourable member has not done so, his position does not savour of that consistency that we all like to see, even in politicians. The honourable member knows as well as I do, or, at any rate, he ought to know, that ever since 1895 he could have converted his land into leasehold any Monday morning in any Cruwn land agent's office in cause the system of leasehold is not the true leasehold as supported by our party. I do the When I can get the purer brand of leasehold at which I am aiming, I shall do it. the honourable member for Werriwa must admit that he is in much the same position as the rest of us-w e are all imbued with an earnest desire to own our own little bit of land. However, as I say, if the honourable member is consistent, he will speedily convert his land into leasehold, especially after the speech he has made to-day. The honourable member is attempting to interject, and no doubt the facts I am. citing may be unpalatable; but I feel it my duty, as a representative of New South Wales, to correct some of the unfounded and unfortunate statements that have been made regarding the land legislation of that State. In tlie converted areas-the homestead selections and settlement leases the freehold is no good, because there is a certain limitation placed upon it . Tho point I want to make is that we in New South Wales who are of an agricultural frame of mind have no desire to assist in the aggregation of large estates, and the way in which we sought to prevent that was by placing a limitation upon the transfer. When we allow a man to convert from a leasehold to a freehold we argue that he should be allowed to conWhen Sir Joseph Carruthers vert only a certain living area, and if subsequently he desires to sell, that he shall sell only to an individual who, with the land he already has, holds an area tliat does not substantially exceed",32,Department Of External Affairs

What better example could we have in the fostering of small holdings than in the system which operates in France, which has been the bulwark of the French agricultural success, and which has resulted in a large number of small landed proprietors being placed all over the country? That system could, in my opinion, be applied to many of the territories that we dominate with very satisfactory results. I am one of those who refuse to condemn from A to Z the Minister of External Affairs for the efforts he has made to populate and develop the Northern Territory. I have gone carefully through the Estimates, and I find many items that receive my commendation. When we take into, consideration the fact that the Northern Terthe result of their efforts. ritory has been open for settlement for something like half a century, and that we are now no nearer the attainment of our object than when we started, I think it must be apparent to everybody that the Minister in charge of this Territory has a very difficult row to hoe. The subject is not one upon which we should indulge in unnecessary recriminations. should do everything we can to assist the Government. tory is ours now, and we should unite in making its development successful. There are, however, one or two matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, and I feel sure that he will listen to the utterances of at least one practical man on this side. original administrators of the Territory were quite right when they instituted a series of experimental farms. Obviously we must have experiments there if we are to be successful in our efforts to induce settlement; and I would impress upon the Minister that the most important man upon an experimental farm should be the experimentalist. discover, however, that the Minister is offering his experimentalist a salary of only £200 a year. That is the pay offered to the most important man' in the Territory, the man who is going to show us proper methods and introduce crops that will help to settle the country. I ask the Minister whether he thinks that is a fair remuneration to a man occupying such an important position? By that means we are An Honorable MEMBEB -The Inspector of Hotels is to receive £600. salary, does the Minister think that £200 is a reasonable sum to pay the experimentalist ? managers of the experimental farm will be the principal men there. experimentalists, then? managers get? require. that even they are underpaid, when we consider that everything depends upon is probably right. matter that I desire to draw attention to in regard to these experimental farms. It cannot be suggested that we do not know anything about the Territory. I am a comparatively new member of this House, but I have heard several debates On the other hand, I think we upon the subject, and yet, in spite of the knowledge thus acquired, we The Northern Terrifind that the experiments at the farms at Batchelor and Daly are all in the direction of agriculture as carried on elsewhere. If there is one factor that is going to make or break an experimental agricultural farm, it is the factor of rainThe fall. Yet what do we find there? The Meteorologist tells us that in the region where these farms are situated not a single drop of rain falls during the months of May, June, July, August, or September. Under these circumstances, speaking as a practical man, I say that agriculture as we know it can never be a success there. Why? Because we have I no rainfall during the growing period. Between the months of October and March or April there is a rainfall of something like 40 to 50 inches. Obviously, therefore, the experimentalists in that country will have to devote their energies to the growth of crops other than cereals, and to the development of agriculture on lines other than those practised in the more temperate zone. I respectfully suggest that the Minister should instruct the experimentalists in the Northern Territory",33,Department Of External Affairs

309,Mr Patten,"There is just one otherto devote their attention to some form of agriculture that will be in conformity with the prevailing climatic conditions. It is of no use anybody going into the Northern Territory from the southern States with the object of trying to grow such crops as wheat, oats, barley, or maize under the methods with which we are now acquainted. In my younger days I went through a considerable portion of the Northern Territory, and, as one who knows something of it, I have no hesitation in saying that it possesses some of the most magnificent country any one need wish to see; but it is pastoral country pure and simple, and in its development we shall have to follow the ordinary process of development. First, the pastoralist or the miner, then the agriculturist, then the manufacturer. That is the order in which all countries have developed. Before we can make any success of the Northern Territory we shall have to regard this part of Australia as pastoral country pure and simple. Mining, of course, may go on all the time; and, as far as mining is concerned, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, while he proposes to spend £15,000 for developmental purposes, including loans to prospectors, he puts down the sum of only £3,000 for the purpose of assisting settlers, presumably either pastoral or agricultural. Why should that distinction be made? Is not the agriculturist or the pastoralist as important to the development of the country as the miner? that we should subsidize the pastoralist? ing that at all. But I think that whatever you are doing in the way of assisting the mining industry you should, at least, do as much to assist agriculture. If it is the settled policy of this Government, as I believe it is, that the only tenure iu the available for returned soldiers. Northern Territory shall be of a leasehold character, then I would urge upon the Government the necessity of seeing that there is a fixity of tenure. The diffiin my possession from soldiers now at the culty we met with in New South Wales with regard to the leasehold system, and the circumstance that makes leasehold so unpopular with the majority of practical men, notwithstanding ail that the honourable member for Werriwa may say, is that there is a periodical re-appraisement of rent; and whether that period be short or whether it be long, the experience of New South Wales is that, as a result of the re-appraisement, the rent always goesup, never down. The result is that we have the somewhat startling spectacle that the older the land gets the higher goes the rent. Any practical man knowsthat that is an agricultural proposition which is the reverse of common sense. creased expenditure of public money in these districts increases the value of the land, and that, therefore, the tenant ought to pay' a little more rent ? public money is spent; but where a man is situated 300 or 400 miles from where any public money has been spent, I do not think it is fair that his rental should be increased, because of the expenditureof money somewhere else. you make? that there should be a fixed tenure at a fair rental. would be going too far if a forty-two years' tenure were granted.

Some criticism has been offered to the Minister in regard to hissuggestion that land should be made.

Unless you give a man the opportunity of getting his produce. to market, you will not, under any circumstances, induce him to go so far away from the benign influences of civilization. I am now going to make some observations with which I am afraid my honourable friends from South Australia, who insistently and persistently advocate the building of a north-south railway, will not agree.

I wish to know to whom these travelling expenses have been paid. The Administrator who, from my point of view, is neither of use nor an ornament, receives £1,750 per year, in addition to £500 per annum by way of allowance. On top of these amounts we have these travelling expenses. The Administrator is allowed £2 per day travelling expenses and a motor car, which he leaves out on the run. An investigation of the expenditure of the Department of External Affairs-of the Central Office here, and of the Northern Territory brancheswould lead to the greatest revelation that has yet been made.

On the question of salaries to which this division relates, I would point out that many of our employees out back, where the cost of living is excessive, might well receive an increase.

It was pointed out thenI do not know with what correctness-that the straight route involved a very high grade up the Macdonnell Ranges, and would leave the line some hundreds of miles from the eastern boundary, so that the StatesI have named would not be able to get beyond their boundaries to link up with the main line.

That company does not report to me regarding the progress of the work, and its rights are amply secured by the agreement made with the late Government.

Division 39 (Norfolk Island), £3,000. desire to say a few words in regard to the vexed question of the administration of controlled by an Executive Council, consisting of two elective members and fivo Government nominees. The residents of the island claim that they should have a much larger share in the government Indeed, at a public meeting we attended, they claimed complete autonomy. Of course, while the Commonwealth provides the money for the administration of the island, we cannot admit that claim. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the Government to give the islanders a considerable measure of redress. The recommendation of Mr Atlee Hunt was that there should be an Executive Council of twelvo members, six to be elected and six to be nominees. Possibly, for the time being, that would be a fair solution of thc difficulty, and would go far to satisfy the residents, especially if they were also given the assurance that gradually they would be given the preponderance of representation. That scheme would be reasonable, because the island can be made self-supporting, and the residents would be inclined to put much greater effort into the work of production if they were given a larger measure of responsibility. They strongly object to any increase in the cost of government. Rightly or wrongly, there is an increase this year, because a secretary has been given to the Administrator. I formed a high opinion of Mr Murphy as an Administrator. He is the right man in the right place, and if he has time to devote to the development of the country he will very soon be able to so encourage the settlers that greater effort will be made to increase the production from the soil. The industries of the island are numerous, and they can be fostered. Now that this island is under our control, we ought to extend to its settlers every possible consideration, and I think that we can legitimately go to the length recommended by Mr Atlee Hunt. I believe, too, that we may fairly act on the assumption that at a later stage we shall be able to afford its people a larger measure of self-government.

He declared that certain Pitcairners laboured under a substantial grievance in that they had been ejected from houses in which they had been permitted to dwell uninterruptedly for nearly fifty years. I desire to point out that these people were allowed to occupy those houses, which were in the vicinity of the gaol, by the Imperial authorities for so long a period that they began to claim thera as their own. to Great Britain, and proof of that is to be found in the fact that the titles which its settlers hold to their lands were issued by the Imperial authorities. The settlers petitioned the late Queen Victoria to grant them the absolute ownership of their dwellings. The Crown Law authorities of Great Britain would not accede to their request. They insisted that the settlers should sign a lease. The settlers were badly advised by a local lawyer, and declined to sigu the lease, with the result that the Imperial Government insisted upon them vacating their premises. Government. Government. I have a copy of tlie lease which they refused to sign. Dr. until the New South Wales Government had taken over the control of the island. Wales Government did not have control of the island at that time, which was under the administration of Great Britain. It has been stated that these settlers porting. were improperly thrust out of their homes. I hold that the Crown had no option but to insist upon their acknowledging its ownership of the houses in question or vacating the premises. All the islanders to-day recognise that they made a mistake. Had they signed the lease offered to them they would have had the houses at a peppercorn rental for three generations. They were not unfairly treated. do about it? day the houses are vacant, and are falling into disrepair. This shows the difficulties which the Minister experiences in dealing with a simple-minded people who are easily led. If the Executive Government were altered to some extent to suit the views of these islanders, it would be a great encouragement to them, and if they are sufficiently encouraged the island is capable of producing a great deal in the way of coffee, lemon-juice, &c. Since last Christmas no less than 700 barrels of lemon-juice have been despatched from the island. In the matter of whale oil the Executive Government can be of great assistance by providing the settlers with proper marketing facilities. A good deal has been said by the honourable member for Calare in regard to the necessity which exists for improved harbour accommodation. Next in importance to that is the establishment of proper marketing facilities for the settlers. Over and over again these people have failed to get anything like the true value of their products because they prefer to accept for those products whatever cash they can obtain from traders, to sending them to market. There is great scope for the Administrator to exercise himself in the direction of affording the people greater trading facilities. This is the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity to discuss the conditions which obtain on Norfolk Island. To my mind, there is a considerable future before that settlement. Whaling can be profitably carried on when adequate market facilities have been procan be largely augmented, as can also the supply of coffee.

CATTS (Cook) [8.34]. -The honourable member for Echuca rose to correct me, and I have risen to correct him. He stated that prior to its transfer to the Commonwealth, Norfolk Island was administered by the Imperial authorities. Theoretically that is quite true, but practically it is not correct. As a matter of fact, the Governor of New South Wales was appointed Administrator of the island under the Government of New South Wales.

When these people first went to Norfolk Island they found a number of residences-suc h as would be worth at least £1,000 each in Australiathat had been left by the authorities of the convict settlement, and these houses were well furnished and ready for occupation. The islanders were given to understand that they would occupy Norfolk Island under similar conditions to those under which they had occupied Pitcairn Island-that the island was for themselves and their descendants. They balloted amongst themselves for the houses, and for three generations families have been living there. It is quite true that the question of a legal title to the houses was raised locally; but, in my opinion, that was a mistake, for I firmly believe that if attention had not been drawn to the point those people would never have been interfered with. From what' I can gather, this question was answered in a spirit of annoyance. wealth Government? Mr J. H . CATTS -No; that was about five years ago, and it has rankled to such an extent that one cannot be on the island for five minutes without realizing the deep sense of resentment there is in the breast of every islander.

These islanders were actually told that if they did not leave the premises peaceably a British warship would be brought, and a landing the New South party called on to punish them. That is not the way to treat people like these. The honourable member for Echuca has said that these people admit they were wrong in not signing leases; but, as a matter of fact, they do not admit anything of the kind, though they do think that they were foolish in raising the question of a legal title. That it was realized that these people had some kind of title, is shown in the fact that it was arranged they should be left in possession for three more generations; and they are firmly convinced that the property was properly willed to them by their parents. We must remember that these people are quite a type by themselves, and do not look at matters in the same light as we do; and they deeply feel being deprived of residences which have been in occupation of the various families for sixty or seventy years. The latest occupants, and their parents before them, were born in the houses, and they cannot understand a treatment so different from that which they always received when Pitcairn Tsland and Norfolk Island were under the immediate control of the British Crown. leases. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is admitted; but they resent the idea that these houses, which have been held by their families for three generations, have been wrongfully willed to them. If a proclamation had been issued stating that, after a certain date, these houses must not be regarded as the private property of the occupants, but must be available to the Government, on certain notice, if they were required for public purposes, authority would have been fully vindicated. It was certainly not necessary to pitch these people into the road, and then leave the houses to fall to pieces; such an attitude is altogether too paltry and mean for a great Administration, and suggests the action of some sordid private landlord. It was the Government of New South Wales for the time being who were responsible, and not the Commonwealth Government. Government. Will he kindly give me the date? Mr J. H .

510,Mr Pigott,"But is not a part of thatofficial secretary, secretary to the Executive Council, Customs Officer, postmaster, and a number of other officers, not forgetting one policeman and two local auxiliaries. With every respect to Mr Murphy, I say that any man who has visited the island, and will express an honest opinion, will admit that one 'smart man would be capable of doing everything on the island, including Customs work, for there is a ship calling only once a month, and it arrives in the morning, and departs in the afternoon or evening. One man could do the whole of the work. He could have a local policeman to assist him aud to carry out those multitudinous duties which elsewhere in Australia fall upon police officers. The Police Court cases would be so few as not to justify the appointment of a policeman there at all for that purpose-only, but as I have said, there are other duties in which a policeman could be employed. There is just one other point that I want to draw attention to. Excellent coffee is grown on the island, and there is a great opportunity for the islanders if they can be given some encouragement in tbe way of marketing the product in Australia. Since the island came under Commonwealth control the duty of 3d. per lb. has been removed, but peculiarly enough the buyers in Sydney have refused to alter their price to the Norfolk Island people, so I would like the Minister to make a special note of it , and see if a remedy can be found. If the islanders could be assisted by a plant for skinning the coffee, and if they were given the opportunity of selling their coffee to a number of merchants in Australia, instead of having to sell to only one having a skinning plant, they would be very greatly encouraged to give more attention to the production of this article. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give these matters his earnest consideration. There is just one matter that I want to now-that there is not a member of this bring before the Committee in connection House who would evict any of these with this subject. When these people were people, even if he had the chance. Many asked to sign the lease, we were advised of them are now very old, even those of that they refused to do so. Rather than the third generation, and when they were sign it , they went out. That is the allowed by the British Government to rule sum total of the whole business, and I themselves, the position seemed to be cannot see that they can claim much symfairly satisfactory. No word of mine will pathy under these conditions. -This incident brings up one of the most I say that the island is suffering from the romantic episodes in Australian history, which sprang out of the wave of compassion that arose throughout the world on behalf of a little island"" which could not produce enough food for the people who inhabited it. I refer to the Pitcairn Island. It is also another instance of the many experiments in land tenure that the British nation has indulged in during the last century. The people did not care to leave Pitcairn Island, on which many of them had been born; but ultimately, on the sacred promise of the late Queen Victoria, they were induced to leave. They were promised the houses, buildings, and offices that had been in use when Norfolk Island was a hell upon earth, at a time when to be a convict wasto be a criminal punishable in the most severe manner that human intelligence could invent. The premises rendered vacant on the abolition of the penal settlement at Norfolk Island were promised to the Pitcairn Islanders; and I would ask the honourable member for Echuca if there is not on the mainland such a thing as adverse possession, under which an occupant may obtain the title to his holding after so many years' occupation ? Mr J. H . CATTS -That is twenty-one years; the people I refer to have occupied these premises for fifty years. borne in mind when considering the position of the Pitcairn Islanders, who came to Norfolk Island on the sacred promise of the late Queen Victoria. I visited the island in 1907, when the Federal Government was strong enough to abolish black slavery, on my way to the New Hebrides, to see the Kanakas who had been returned to their homes. A t that time. I was told by these men that they were feeling the grip of the New South Wales Government.

513,Dr. Maloney,"That fact has to becurse of large salaries, where they are not needed. When they had their own votes, the islanders, through their council of leaders, ruled the island intelligently, and sought to prevent the aggregation of large estates, though close upon 1,200 acres are held in one estate hy the Melanesian Mission. 1,200 acres. It may have been lessened a little since, but I think it is nearer 900 than 1,200 acres now. There was a law in operation that when a sailor came to the island and married, he had a right to 20 acres of land and a house. If one of the boys visited the mainland and took a wife back, tlie same right was given to him. tion came into existence, all that was swept away. I have never in my life allowed my brain to create a thought, or my lips to utter a word, against religion; but I say that religion to-day is not doing its duty. The islanders complained to me that motu-perhap s the best language that was spoken in the New Hebrideswas being taught. Mr J. H . CATTS -They are teaching it now. musical language than Italian, but why did they not teach the glorious English language, the language of our continent here? I do not say that good work is not being done, but quoting the words of one of the islanders, I protest against that one large estate of the best land being permitted in the middle of the cleared portion of the island. the church. You have only'got to eo down Little Collins-street and see there where the house of God was hidden by whiskeries, wineries, and breweries that were built against it. I raised my protest here against what was being done then, but if any honourable member goes past William-street he will see that the church has been taken, lock, stock, and barrel, from tbe slates of the roof down to the stones of the foundation, and shifted in order to make way for breweries, wineries, and distilleries, and other business places. on behalf of these islanders, if there is a single spark of humanity left in the mind of anybody who may care to go there, I am sure he will come back as strong an advocate of their claims as I am, if he will only mix with them and see them as I did. There are other members of this House who have visited the island lately. When the islanders of Pitcairn chose their wives from the South Sea Islands they taught their children their father tongue-English. The mothers taught their children the mother tongue, and to-day in Norfolk Island you will hear tlie English language spoken with the softness of the Italian tongue. I have never heard English spoken as sweetly and as softly as it is spoken on this island. I want the Ministry to see if they cannot send there a common-sense man who will teach the residents the latest ideas in cultivation. There is not a single fruit But when the late Administrabhat will not nourish in Norfolk Island, which could keep Australia supplied with citrus fruits or cocoanuts, and many of the other fruit} that we have now to import more or less regularly from the Mediterranean. All sub-tropical products might be cultivated there with advantage. There are about 600 people on Norfolk Island, and there is, perhaps, less crime there than in any portion of Australia. I hope that the people will be given a better chance than they had under the administration of the New South Wales Government. We should appoint some honourable member of this Parliament to represent the island Territories of the Commonwealth. In every State of Australia every adult should have one vote. Even in the mighty United States of America this does not obtain, because, in that country, the residents of the District of Columbia havo not the franchise. According to Mr Bell, the inventor of the telephone, that is because of the bribery and corruption of the native vote. Here, in the Northern Territory, Papua, and in Norfolk Island the white people are unrepresented. They should be enfranchised and thus remove what, in my view, is a stain on the good name of Australia. I hope that honourable members will discover some way to remedy that state of things. I shall lose no opportunity to voice a protest against the infamy of depriving white men and women of the right to vote. We have done that in the case of the Territories But speaking of the Commonwealth to which I refer, although we claim to have in the Commonwealth the broadest franchise in the world.

The people of that island produced an annual crop of palm seed, and the Goveniment of New South Wales appointed a Commission to find a market and distribute their products for them. We should find out what Norfolk Island is suitable for, and should, by the appointsuch diseases. When the matter was first ment of a Commission to market the products of the people, prevent them from being victimized by the people of Australia. They are not up to business methods, and it is necessary that the Government should take a paternal interest in them. We were shown over a coffee estate on Norfolk Island, where hundreds of bushels of coffee were produced, and were informed that the producers got something like 6d. per pound for the product. That is not a very remunerative price. They are prepared to sell large cases of luscious oranges at 2s. per case. Schnapper, trumpeter, trevalli, kingfish, and other fish weighing from 12 lbs. to 15 lbs. are sold there at Is. each. Beef and mutton can be obtained at 3d. per lb. In my opinion, Norfolk Island is an ideal place in which to spend a holiday. I hope that many citizens of the Commonwealth will pay a visit to the island. Provision should be made for better accommodation, and a regular steam-ship service should be provided to help the islanders. The exports of the island amount to about £1,500 per annum, while the imports total about £9,000. These figures, on their face, would seem to spell ruination; but the shortage in exing the Resources of the Commonwealth/' ports as compared with imports is made good by the amount expended by visitors; by the cable station, which employs fifteen or twenty hands; and by the Melanesian Mission, which also spends a lot of money in finding employment for the islanders.

The object sought to be accomplished by our representative at the Congress was to place before the representatives of other nations the exact position of Australia in respect to diseases of stock, and to obtain from the best veterinarians of the world information as to the most scientific method of dealing with brought forward, it was pointed out that the Australian representative would be able to disseminate amongst the States the information obtained by him; and 1 should like to ascertain whether the report of our representative has yet been printed and circulated for the benefit of the States who co-operated, I understand, with the Commonwealth in this movement. The Victorian Government went so far as to offer the services of its chief veterinary oflicer as a representative of the Commonwealth. Shortly after the despatch of our representative, the war broke out, and I am anxious to learn whether this International Congress actually took place. Australia stands out amongst the nations of the earth as tha one great stock-raising country which is practically immune from the most dread diseases of stock such as the foot-andmouth disease, and I was hopeful that an exhaustive report on the results of the Congress would be presented. shall see that ths honourable member is supplied with a copy of it .

The appropriation for this purpose for 1913-14 was £50,000, and the amount actually expended was £41,979; but ths estimate for this year was only £5,000. On the other hand, provision is made in these Estimates for an expenditure of £5,000 on advertising in the United States of America, in addition to an expenditure of £12,000 on the Panama Exposition. I wish to know why we should spend £5,000 in advertising our resources in America. It seems to me that Australia at present is securing, from our boys at the front, the greatest and most glorious advertisement she has ever had; and that this sum of £5,000 would be much better expended upon them, or upon those whom some of them will, unfortunately, leave behind.",51,Maloney Tha T Was Not Done Vided The Production Of Lemon Juice

534,Mr Mahon,"If I have the report, I",52,Maloney Tha T Was Not Done Vided The Production Of Lemon Juice
535,Mr Fleming (Robertson) [9.19],"of External Affairs) [9.21] -The explanation is a very simple one. It is that these Estimates were compiled before the outbreak of the war, and that, in view of the expenditure on the Panama Exposition item of £L2,000 in connection with that Exposition. object was to avail ourselves to the fullest extent of the opportunity which that Exposition offered for advertising the resources of Australia, not only in California, but in the other States of the Union. expended ? has been spent on advertising in America, so far as I am aware, since the outbreak of the war. It was recognised that during the continuance of the war we could not reasonably expect to obtain the desired result; and beyond what has been expended upon literature for the Panama Exposition at San Francisco I think very little of this money has been spent, at all events since the outbreak of the war. [9.23] A few days ago the honourable member for Ballarat asked in this House a series of questions concerning the appointment of Mr Deakin as one of the Commissioners to the Panama Exposition, and the answer given by the M i nister left it clearly to be inferred that Mr Deakin, in order to secure double payment for his services, misled his fellow Commissioners sitting in San Francisco. ference could be drawn from the answer. The question asked by the honourable member for Ballarat wasWas the Australian Commissioner at San Deakin) £43 10s. per. week, that f 1,000 had been paid into Mr Deakin's credit in Melbourne to cover his expenses? surely, to be answered "" Yes"" or "" No . "" given by the Minister wasNo: the Commission, at a meeting in San Francisco, after Mr Deakin's arrival, agreed his pocket, took £ 4 3 10s. per week fro m to pay him 30 dollars per day. The other members of the Commission were not aware at the time that Mr Deakin had been paid £1,000 in Melbourne. If Mr Deakin had received £1,000 while in Melbourne, then this answer by the Minister would leave it to be inferred that he allowed the other members of the Commission sitting in San Francisco to vote him a salary of £ 4 3 10s. per week, although he had in his pocket at the time £1,000 given to him by the Commonwealth to cover his expenses. That implies the most odious charge that could be levelled against such a man.

That is strange treatment for trusted public officials, who gave time, talents, and energies to the making of the Panama Exposition a success. Mr Deakin left Australia with the good will and good wishes of his fellow countrymen to be the representative of the Commonwealth at the Exposition.

I desire to explain that, in addition to the 900 acres, there was a grant whose acreage is not mentioned there, and that is how so many honourable members justifiably concluded that it was only 900 acres which the Melanesian Mission had. [10.2] I am sorry that the Minister of Home Affairs thought that I was treating him unfairly in asking a question regarding railway policy. I was not criticising him in regard to any particular item. Is there anything unfair in asking a Minister whether the Government, after having been in office for nine months, have a policy with respect to the Northern Territory, and, if so, to tell the Committee what it is? The reply I received from the Minister was that it was an unfair question to ask. What was the object of placing this large Territory under the Government if their duty is not to frame and develop a policy, and ask this Parliament to follow their lead 1 The Minister has told us that it is the policy of the your Estimates; I am asking for your Government to carry the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. Is it part of their policy to provide for communication between that main line and the railway systems in other States? Eor instance, is it intended to make a connection with Queensland? I would remind the Minister that, when the Agreement regarding the Northern Territory was being discussed here, the late Mr Batchelor said that the very safeguard of the Agreement was the fact that such railway connexions could be made. While not desiring to embarrass the Minister in any way in regard to carrying out the Agreement as concerns the north-south line, I would like to know whether it is the intention of the Government to provide connexions between the Territory and the railway systems in the other States? gramme do you reckon that is? Do you expect the Minister to effect all thatnext year? after being in office for nine months the Government have some idea of the direcgo. A Railway Commission was appointed to investigate this matter. It will be remembered that, with the exception of the period in which the administration was carried on by the honourable member for Angas, a Labour Government have been in charge of the Northern Territory from the very date on which it was taken over. Any one who glances at the report of the ex-Minister can see that he had a complete, comprehensive policy, which did include the possibility of a connection with Queensland-in fact, a definite proposal. It is not unreasonable to expect a Government who have always chided other Governments for doing nothing to be prepared with a statement of policy in this regard. I shall be glad if the Minister can give some information on the subject to the Committee. Minister of Home Affairs) [10.5] I do not know that I have any other answer to give. I think that it is decidedly absurd to ask for a railway policy to be declared when we are considering Estimates for a financial year which will expire in about three weeks. policy. the honourable member to have a bit of common sense. The answer to the honourable member is obviously that when the Treasurer submits the Estimates for the next financial year, and when he makes his policy statement to the House, will be the time for the Government to declare their policy in regard to railways. But so that there may be no misunderstanding, I may inform the Committee that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the construction of the north-south railway. I may further say that it is our intention to follow up the railway policy in the north proposed by the honourable member for Angas, because we propose to extend the line from Katherine River to Bitter Springs.

Soon after the Government took office, the Leader of the Opposition asked me whether it was our intention to establish a Lithographic Department, and I answered in the negative. My reason for doing so was that, although I believe that such a Department would be a wise innovation, the time was not opportune for embarking on expenditure of that nature. My defence of the Estimates as they appear before the Committee to-night is based on that ground alone. Any one who has, as Minister, had the honour of receiving the assistance of Mr Bingle can vouch for his ability and loyalty to the Service, but I may inform the Committee that he has never pressed upon me his claims for a reconsideration of his salary. On the contrary, ho has always taken the ground that the present was not the time for the adjustment of salaries. I do not say that the Committee should be guided by that fact, but it is right that I should mention Mr Mr Bingle the pay that is his due, and Bingle's attitude. to me,on the subject, either. be the last person to approach a member on a matter of this sort. His present salary is due to the exigencies of the war, and will be adjusted as soon as this great international trouble is over. Therefore, I ask the honourable member for Maranoa not to press his amendment. The Government may have committed an error of judgment. We might have increased the higher salaries, and given this particular officer the salary he ought to receive; but we decided not to increase salaries for the time being. I hope my explanation will satisfy, the Committee that the Government had no desire to act unjustly to Mr Bingle or to any other officer who may have thought that he was entitled to increased recognition of his services to the Commonwealth. [10.12] I was pleased to hear the Minister speak so well of Mr Bingle, but the modesty of that officer in not seeking what is justly due to him makes me feel that such a public servant ought to be protected. I cannot understand the Minister's statement about increases to salaries not having been given recently, because during the time Mr Bingle has been Acting Secretary of the Home Affairs Department, extensive and striking increases have been given to public officers. It should be remembered that Mr Bingle is advancing in years, and, in addition, he is fitted for the very highest position in the Service. He has been treated without due consideration by the present Government and by the previous Government. It is not in the interests of the Public Service to allow a distinguished officer of the capacity ancl character of Mr Bingle to reach his age without allowing him to enjoy, not only the position, but also the pay commensurate with his abilities and years of service. I hope the practice of taking a Secretary from the Department for more than two years, and appointing ah Acting Secretary, will be discontinued. The Secretary of the Home Affairs Department has been away from office intermittently for four years. I ask the Minister to further consider this matter, and give also the status which, to an officer such as he, means infinitely more than the pay. My principal purpose in rising was to ask the Minister to give the Committee a comprehensive progress report on the construction to date of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. The fact that we are dealing with Estimates, the votes in which arc almost entirely spent, is no reason why we should not know exactly how the money has been spent. In connection with a big undertaking like the east-west railwav. which will involve the expenditure of several millions sterling, it is the duty of",59,Department Of Home Affaibs

I do not ask the Minister to make such a report available to the Committee tonight, but, if possible, I should like him to supply us to-morrow with a statement of what work has been done, and of the precise character of that work. The Minister has stated that since he assumed control of the Department a certain mileage |of railway has actually been laid down, and he has implied, if he has not actually avowed, that infinitely better work has been done during the past few months than had been accomplished previously. am delighted to hear it, because I am satisfied that there was plenty of room for improvement in connection with the whole business. I imagine that the accountant of the Department could, with very little difficulty, supply the informathe absence of railway communication tion which I desire. I should like to be informed how much has actually been ' expended upon the construction of the line, how much has been spent upon rolling-stock and plant, how much upon rolling-stock for traffic purposes, and also upon making the requisite provision for water supplies. I further ask for information concerning the work that has been done which was not anticipated at the commencement of this undertaking, and for which provision was not made in the original estimate of cost. Then the Minister might tell us what amount has actually been expended to date, whether that expenditure has been within the official estimates of the Engineer-in-Chief, and, if not, by how much those estimates have been exceeded. If the Minister will supply us with these particulars, I am satisfied that the debate upon several items will be materially curtailed. not intend to allow any opportunity to pass without emphasizing the necessity which exists for getting a move on in conwhich will permit of the Commonwealth nexion with the construction of the northrendering necessary assistance to the south transcontinental line. I am aware that no mention of that undertaking is made in this section of these Estimates, and, consequently, I assume that I shall be debarred from referring to it at any length. The need for the construction of this line is obvious to anybody who has a genuine interest in the welfare of Australia. I have not any patience with a Government which will not take action in the direction I have indicated. Of course, the Estimates which we are now considering are those framed by the late Government, and the Ministry, therefore, may fairly plead that they are not responsible for them. Personally, I regard the need for the north-south railway as being so urgent that I am not prepared to accept any excuse for inaction. When the present war is over, it is quite probable that we shall have to recast our whole policy so far as the outside world is concerned. If the struggle should not end as satisfactorily as we desire it to end, there will be If so, I grave dangers ahead of us in the settlement of Australia, and in the absence of a transcontinental line from north to south, concessions may have to be made so far as our northern areas are concerned which we will all deplore. In settlement in that portion of the continent is impossible. I am inclined to think that provision might be made for the settlement of returned soldiers there. I am' prepared to go to any length in forcing the hands of the Government in initiating the construction of this railway. To-nicht the Minister of External Affairs informed us that he had received a telegram from those who are engaged in exploring the route of the proposed line. That telegram stated that they were pleased to report that certain areas through which they had passed, instead of being the desert tracts they had been represented to be, consisted of finelywatered and grassed country. That information is very gratifying, and merely confirms my idea that the line will be a payable proposition from a pastoral point of view. Arrangements should be made with the States under which their railways will be linked up with this great transcontinental line. There should lie some co-operative scheme devised States so as to ensure a grand trunk-line",60,Department Of Home Affaibs

Assuming that the whole of the country which the north-south line will traverse is of a barren character, it will still pay to construct that line, in order that we may be provided with quick means of communication with the East. This is a paying proposition, and what I told the House the last time. I spoke on the matter, namely, that, if the Government will not act, I should like an opporthat the Government should do is to pass tunity to form a syndicate to take it off the Government's hands, I repeat now. [10.25] I was not present when the honourable member for Maranoa raised the question of Mr Bingle's salary, but, in my judgment, he did a very proper thing. It is time that something was done to remove an anomaly that has existed for the past four. years. Had we on this side had the framing of these Estimates, I should certainly, have endeavoured to do something in that direction, and there is one way for which we have a precedent. When I went to the Defence Department five years ago Colonel Pethebridge was acting as Mr Bingle is acting now, during the absence of Captain Collins, the Secretary of the Department, ?n London, on special duty. been in London ever since, I think. for three years Colonel Pethebridge acted for Captain Collins, at a salary of about £700 a year. In order to meet the situagiven at least another £100 out of the tion, I placed an extra sum of £150 on the Estimates as au allowance to him as Chief Clerk, for acting as Secretary; in other words, provision was made to pay him half the difference between his nomicompetent and devoted officer Mr Bingle nal salary and the salary of the head of the Department. This meant that Colonel Pethebridge was paid a total of £850 per annum, or very nearly the salary of Captain Collins. I felt then-as I feel now of this sum on the Estimates was only doing a modicum of justice. For four years Colonel Miller has been away in the Federal Territory, paying only occasional visits to the office, and during the is so good a "" sort"" and so valuable an whole of that time the work of Secretary has been practically done by Mr Bingle. by Mr Bingle. Bingle has had to contend with all the limitations imposed by his anomalous position. tion in responsibility, but only limitation in salary and status. power in many respects; and the whole position requires putting right at the earliest possible moment. The first thing an Act creating a trust for the Federal Territory, and making Colonel Miller responsible Administrator in association with a couple of other experts selected because of their special aptitude and ability. Colonel Miller ought then to cut his connection with the Department so far as the Secretaryship is concerned, and then, of course, Mr Bingle would formally step into the position which he now actually fills. Pending that, there is nothing to prevent the Government from making an allowance to Mr Bingle to compensate him for his work and responsibility, and that could, easily be done by the means I adopted in the case of Colonel Pethebridge. Personally, I should like to see this matter go to a vote to-night, as there would then be a direction to the Government to act in the way I have suggested. Surely neither the war nor any other consideration should prevent us from paying reasonably for work performed. Mr Bingl© has been doing the work of Secretary for three years for £700 a year, and I see no reason why he should not be Treasurer's Advance, thus wiping away the reproach, for it is one, of requiring a man to perform these duties at the lower salary. .

Is anything being done to seriously modify Mr Griffin's plans? Once before there was an attempt at a serious modification, which might have had some temporary advantage, though I do not know, because I have not studied the matter sufficiently to say. However, if there is to be any modification in opposition to the views and wishes of the planner of the Capital, the Committee ought to know every detail and every step of the proposed modification, and the reasons for it . the plans himself. is quite a different matter from having his plans modified by other people, who, it may be, do not understand them as he does. It is all the more necessary that Parliament should have something to say on this matter, because Mr Griffin, so f a r as I know him, is not good at defending himself. Some of the best public officers in the world are not good at self-defence, and I fancy that Mr Griffin is in that category. Everybody knows that he is an idealist. You have only to get into conversation with him to know he is a man of ideas. able town planner, all the same. Mr Griffin lives and moves and breathes in the air and atmosphere of this Federal Capital plan. All his life he has shown that he cares nothing for money, or for the material considerations that affect men Tn their ordinary business relations. whole life bears witness to the fact that he does care for ideas, and I say that such a man is invaluable in connection with the planning of a capital like ours, which is to last for centuries to come. not sure that, while Mr Griffin is thinking of the position of affairs a couple of hundred years hence, the Minister and his officers are not considering the immediate requirements of the moment.

I know the Minister is just as sympathetic towards Mr Bingle as I am, but here is the position: Mr that this Parliament should keep this Bingle was getting £600 a year. He had already done the work for a long time, and I got him raised by £50. Then Mr Kelly got him raised £50 more. Now he has been doing the work of the Departmenta careful, studious, honest,' conscientious officer, who standB at the table, and puts the things before you, lecture. He said so and so,, and left it for me to decide. That was a great pleasure to a business man. Colonel Miller is a conscientious man; but as compared with Mr Bingle he runs on a different set of rails. I sent him up to the federal Territory as Administrator. He carried out my orders, and has done good work there. I instituted the digest system, and Colonel Miller kept it going. It has given me joy to find that my successor,the present Leader of the Opposition, and his successor, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, kept the system going. It is neither fair nor honest that a man paid £700 a year should be doing the work of a man who is paid . £900 a year. Mr Bingle, not as Acting Secretary of the Department, but as Chief Clerk, is still at the command of the Secretary of the Department up in the Federal Territory. put through constituting Mr Bingle Acting Secretary. [144] ter never knew, because Mr Bingle is a conscientious man, and is loyal to Colonel Miller. I discovered the matter by finding, that work was being sent up to the Federal Territory and coming back to me under the red-tape system of Methuselah. that now. I suddenly put a stop to it . did not stop it all, because I bad to stop some of it . started again after I left; and the present Minister of Home Affairs may have to stop it once more. Mr Bingle is doing the work, but is not getting the pay. He has tbe responsibility, but has not the power to act, because he has to wire to some other man for authority. It is not honest kind of thing going for four years. Until Mr Bingle is given his proper position, the promotion of the accountant and other omcers entitled to advance when' Mr Bingle steps up is delayed. The Committee should give instructions to have Mr Bingle appointed Secretary of the Department, and a permanent position made for and does not give you a Colonel Milleri n the Federal Territory. If that cannot be done at once, Mr Bingle's pay,. as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, should be increased by £100 a year. This officer, helped me to establish the costing system, the digest system, and the schedule system. I feel grateful to him for doing so He did not argue with' me and tell me that it could not be done because it was not done anywhere else in the British Empire. am glad that it was a supporter of the Government who moved the amendment, because, in the circumstances, the Minister can accept it with the feeling that he is accepting an entirely friendly direction.

Eventually I took bhe step of sending him a way to Honolulu to meet the British parliamentary delegation. As a matter of fact, I sent him away for the benefit of a sea trip. I knew that would do him good, and he came back restored to health. He is the sort of man uponwhom any Minister could utterly depend. That cannot be said of every man. It is a good thing to have an able man at one's side, but it is better still to have an able man who is at the same time absolutely honest with his Minister. Mr Bingle realizes that his duty is to the office, and not to any particular Minister. men in the Department. but there is no more loyal or tactful man there than Mr Bingle. Apart from his claims to recognition, we have to consider the injustice of keeping such a man for four years responsible for the work of Secretary of the Department at a chief clerk's pay. I am satisfied that the Minister realizes that that is not fair to Mr Bingle. vernment will .put this matter right. The difficulty of the last Government was that it was necessary to pass a Bill to deal with the matter' properly, and honourable members generally realize that it was not easy to get a Bill passed in the last Par; liament. I trust that measures will be taken to give Mr Bingle the full status of Secretary of the Department, and failing the passing of a Bill for the purpose, that he will be given the salary which should propeflv attach to the position. ister of Home. Affairs) f l l . 4 ] , I have already referred to the work done by my friend, Mr Bingle, as Acting Secretary ol the Home Affairs Department. It has given me very great pleasure to hear honourable members who have come in contact with him bear their testimony to his sterlingcharacter and. valuable public service. On behalf of the. Government, I assure the Committee that tbe matter will be considered in the preparation of the next Estimates.' 2 never pretended to defend the present position. I do not say that it was an adequate reason for the Kne of action adopted by the Government, but I repeat that the reason for it was that -we did not feel disposed when the war was going on to re-adjust matters of this character. ' So far as the future is concerned the Government .will undertake to see that justice is done to Mr Bingle. listening to the remarks of the Minister of Home AffairsI am satisfied that the object I had in submitting the amendment is attained, and I therefore ask leave to withdraw it.
