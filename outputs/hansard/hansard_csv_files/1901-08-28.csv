27,Sir Philip Pysh,"Though I symamendment would duplicabe bhe work.whichheavy additional work which the proposed amendment would throw upon it ? that the Minister has entirely failed to catch the true meaning of tlie proposed amend-' ment. The object which the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, wishes to attain is one which has been very much desired by the public in Victoria. Tine present condition, and the condition which the Minister apparently desires to perpetuate, is that a man living, in the country who has a parcel which is liable to duty sent to him from outside of the Commonwealth cannot receive that parcel at the address to which it is sent. He must depute a Customs agent, and pay him to see his parcel opened, to effect a settlement with regard to the amount of duty to bepaid, and to pay the duty. Tlie honourable membei.' for Tasmania is quite prepared to see that system continued, inconvenient though it has been found to be in tlie past. He requiies, however, that the Post-office should also forward a parcel to the address which it bears after duty has been paid. Tliat is a very reasonable amendment to make. Sir PHILIPFVSH ber will pardon me, the amendment requires duty to be paid at the time of delivery to the addressee, not prior *to delivery -I s it necessary to alter this paragraph ? system is a faulty one, and any amendment of it must be iri the direction of facilitating public business. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that the great difficulty in regard to this proposal would be the question of audit. If one of the departments concerned remained underState control, then there might be some objection : but, as both the Customs and Postal departments have been transferred to the Commonwealth, there should be no-difficulty in giving-this advantage to tlie public. Tlie Customs-department in Melbourne has found it practicable to utilize the services of' railway officials in collecting revenue, and why should not postmasters be allowed to -do the same ? I fail to see that tins would occasion any grave necessity for keeping, a mass of records, and I think that the Minister might very, well consent to the amendment. to find that the Postal department of"" the Commonwealth is not going to make a move forward. This-is not one of an original character either, for a movement on similar lines, but of' for larger extent than that which I propose, has been made by the Postal department in India, which practically undertakes the purchase of certain articles to order. The department presents the order, receives and delivers the goods, collectsthe purchase money, and forwards it to the retailer of the article. If the Postal department in India can make such extended use of its services, I foil to see why the Commonwealth Post-office should not be able to do as-much for the convenience of'the public. The amendment will, I am sure, commend itself to those who are desirous of preventing unnecessary inconvenience to those who have parcels sent to them through the post. Fees have to be continually collected by the Postal department, so that the objection that a check on the officers would be necessary, if the amendment were adopted, is one to which we need pay little attention. In using the terms "" transmitted and delivered,"" I have adopted the phraseology used in the B i ll to cover all that is necessary in the delivery of a letter to its proper destination. The principle of the amendment is, I think, sufficiently plain If the honourable memto enable honourable members to vote upon it, leaving the wording to be altered afterwards if necessary. Sir EDWARDBRADD ON (Tasmania). We are here providing that regulations may be made for the discharge of the duties of the Post and Telegraph office within the compass of. the Bill. It is all a matter of regulation, and I think one might very well trust the Postmaster-General to frame such regulations as will best secure public convenience in this as in every other matter. It is going, a-little to® far to declare, under this clause, precisely what regulations are to be made. If we followed that line of conduct to its logical sequence, we should have to frame to its fullest possible extent every possible direction that is proposed to be left to regulation.

I know of no other country where a similar convenience would be more appreciated than in this, and so far as to the objebt of the amendment, I are providing here for a general regulation which would enable the Post-office to undertake this very duty, or to adopt some other scheme more in accordance with our requirements and gradually to develop. Those are courses which are to which would be shut out under it. adopt the amendment we shall be tied down to attain one excellent object, and to attain it directly under a direction of this committee in a matter which is really after all a question of administration. The honourable member will be quite right in taking the Post-office to task if, in its administration, it does not come up to what is requited. We should have better reasons before we bind Post-office to carry out this proposal only. Asi t stands, the paragraph prescribes a mode of dealing with postal articles supposed to contain dutiable goods. That covers this and a great variety of other circumstances.

MightI suggest to the honourable member that this is a matter of administration on which the Postmaster General can be asked to either make some analogous proposition or submit reasons why he should not do so. If the honourable member will withdraw his amendment, the Ministeri n charge of the Bill will undertake to lay such a statement before the House. The House, on the Estimates or on any other occasion, has a matter of this kind under its Post-office musb and ought to obey. Thus, if the Postmaster-General's statement is not satisfactory, the House can direct the work to be done.

We should leave proper up-todate regulations to be made under this clause by the Postmaster-General, but I feel conthe vinced there is no difficulty whatever in carrying out the proposal. The official objection to it is that it might give a little trouble, and that therefore the Postal department prefers to leave it undone, but there is no practical difficulty in the way. goods of any kind clothing, weapons, ammunition, cutlery, lamp glasses, and all sorts of things-throug h the post and pay for them on delivery. difficult matter.

In the first place, I move That the following be inserted to stand as subthe Government, for the purposes of the clause (ol) ""For voting by post at elections under the law of the Commonwealth, or that of a State, but in the latter case only at the request of the Governor of the State, and on such terms as the Governor General prescribes.""

That the following be inserted to stand as subclause (o2):"" Providing for tlie payment by the receiver or by the Governor of any State, instead of the sender, of the rate payable on any postal article.""

83,' Mr Deakin,"I agree that there is-a dealthe whole of the clause if we attempted to alter it . would point out that there are some very difficult things which the accused will have to disprove under these regulations. For instance, the clause says "" with evil intent, privately or fraudulently, stamps or marks,"" &c. that he did not stamp or mark 1 nniy have much less reluctance in accepting this clause than they would have in ordinary circumstances, because it relates to the postage stamps which are used by the public. If any person to use an Americanism is found "" monkeying "" with stamps it may be said-unles s he is a stamp collector-that he is seeking deliberately to defraud the public for his own gain by committing a forgery which it is very difficult to next word "" whereof "" should be altered to detect. Consequently, it has been found necessary everywhere in this regard, as to adopt very severe precautions against public robbery. There can be no object in a man having these dies in his possession unless it be to defraud the public, except he be a. philatelist. He is either a philatelist or a forger, and the chances are that he is the hitter. that honourable members ought to take notice of the fact that the whole of these provisions involve a complete reversal of the basic principle of our criminal law, which is that a man should be presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty. These sub-clauses, however, are all drawn from the opposite stand-point. the principle which is here laid down -should apply when a man is found using a State seal. In that case, it seems to be perfectly reasonable that the burden of proving a negative should be thrown upon the accused. phrase used, in this clause, namely, "" privatelyorfraudulently."" Whatdoesthatmean? "" Privately or fraudulently "" are not alternative terms. people are dabbling in philately and are using these stamps, privately or fraudulently, either will be sufficient. Therefore if a man privately causes to be used any die, plate, or other instrument he must be convicted. It is all covered by the words "" w it h evil intent."" a tremendous innovation. I have come to (North Sydney) -I place no reliance in marginal notes as to Acts of Parliament from which clauses are said to have been taken, and I therefore must accept the Attorney-General's assurance that he has looked carefully into the matter. out that the words "" clandestinely and fraudHonorable members ulently "" often appear in Acts of Parliament.

96,Mr Piessb,"I would point out that i nable and learned -member for Parkes has called attention to a distinct omission. The clause, as the marginal note shows, purports to be taken from the Queensland Act of 1891 and the Victorian Act of 1897; but whilst the draftsmen have adopted the language of the Queensland Act in regard to the offence, they have omitted an important part of the penalty. I therefore move That the words ""or to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any period not exceeding twelve months"" be inserted after the words ""Fifty pounds."" That is the provision in tlie Queensland statute, which has been omitted from tlie Bill. A reference to the Victorian Act does not explain the omission. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to Clause 100 (Penalty for falsely sending letters, &c, as exempted). necessary to make a similar amendment in this clause, and also in clause 98 1 followed out exactly in clause 9S, except that the penalty is increased. prisonment is provided for in the Queensland Act, nor is there in tlie Victorian Act any term of imprisonment provided for in regard to the provisions of clause 100. vide that in the event of non-payment of a fine there should be imprisoment. generally ; not in each clause. not see why an offence which involves an element of fraud should be accompanied by the penalty of a mere fine. Many people may commit this offence and maybe perhaps more tempted to commit it because they have no means. The clause as drawn simply indicates that such persons would go scot free. The mere fact that no imprisonment is provided for in the Queensland Act is not sufficient for us. We have to consider these matters for ourselves on first principles. I do not know that the Queensland legislation has acquired such an extraordinary reputation that we should consider their Acts conclusive as models when Ave are dealing with a similar matter. trative measures, has been suggested by the department from the various Acts of the 12 T I think that the honorStates with which they are familiar. The clause we have now before us appears to be taken verbatim from the Victorian Act, which attaches no other penalty than a fine. The only variation is that the minimum fine is increased from £ 1 to £2. In neither case is there any other penalty, and there is no general clause which attaches any other penalty. It seems to me that a money penalty is sufficient. Clause agreed to. Clause 103Any person who knowingly sends or attempts to send by post any postal article which(a) encloses an explosive or a dangerous filthy noxious or deleterious substance,, or a sharp instrument not properly protected, or a living noxious creature,, or any other thing likely to injure, other postal articles in course of conveyance, or to injure an officer of the-, department or other person ; or (0) encloses an indecent or obscene print, painting, photograph, lithograph, engraving, book, card, or article ; or (c) has thereon or therein, or on the envelope it not* be or cover thereof, any words, marks, or designs of an indecent, obscene, blasphemous, libellous, or grossly offensive The Queensland Act is character, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £100, or to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, No imfor a term not exceeding two years.

""We were told by the Prime Minister tbe other day that, according to Coleridge's definition, no blasphemy is blasphemy unless it is offensive, and therefore the word "" offensive"" in this clause covers such matters. I am glad to say that I succeeded in having the word "" blasphemous"" struck out of two or three previous clauses of the Bill. to take away from the Postmaster-General, Deputy Postmaster-General, or any subordinate in the Postal department, the impossible function of determining what is blasphemy. tion will not be left to anybody of that sort, but will, I presume, be decided by a Supreme Court Judge, who will/be able to determine in the fairest possible way what is blasphemy in its legal sense, and punishable, as such.

What one may deem an indecent picture, may be. a perfectly harm-less and artistic production in the opinion of another ; and yet such a question is to be left to bwo justices of 'the peace. There are many highly respectable justices, but there are also some very narrow-minded men amongst them, with no judicial experience whatever.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I move That the words "" o r therein "" in paragraph (c) be omitted. These words seem to give power, by inference at any rate, to open any letters, packets, or newspapers. Supposing that a letter contained anything that was objectionable, the letter would have to be opened to enable the postal authorities to ascertain whether it would come within the provisions of this clause. It is perfectly reasonable that we should stop from passing through the post any packet containing on the outer cover anything offensive, but the same objection does not apply to a letter, the contents of which are closed up and concealed from observation. member for South Australia, in order to be consistent, should have moved to strike out the words in paragraph (b), making it an offence to enclose an indecent or obscene print or other document. If there is anything in the argument of the honourable member, it would apply to these words -vehicle for carrying obnoxious or filthy The clause, however, is intended for bhe protection of those who may be offended by the means indicated, and the provision made is a proper one. Sir. DEAKIN out that the question at issue now is entirely different from that which we have already settled. The quesbion previously submitted 12 T 2 to ^us was whether the Postmaster-General or his officers should be entitled to stop newspapers if, in their opinion, they contained anything bhat was blasphemous or seditious, and as bhe righb honourable 'memThere is something in what the ber, SirEdward Braddon, 2>ointed out, the they doubted the ability or the impu-tialifcy of the Postmaster-General or his officers, who would have to determine such delicate questions. This provision has nothing whatever to do with the sending of newspapers through the post, as far as the Postmaster-General or his officers are concerned, but it provides a penalty for offences for the carrying out of which the Post-office may be made the vehicle. It is provided that those who send filthy or noxious compounds, or filthy or offensive statements, bhroughthepost--whether , in the case of bhe sbatements, they are on the inside or In this clause the the outside of the packets-shal l be liable to be punished. If the committee are going to adopt tlie proposal now made by the honourable member for South Australia, it will amount to this : that, provided a person pubs anybhing objectionable into an envelope so as to cover it up from view of the Post-office officials, he can make the Post-office the vehicle for conveying any filthy or obnoxious matter or sbabement, and will not be held liable bo any punishment. Under the Queensland Act, bhe offences mentioned in this clause are marked down as misdemeanours, and are punishable as such, and I trust that, although the committee have decided to restrict the power of the postal officials with regard to newspapers, they -will not prevent the just punishment by a judicial tribunal of those who may try to make the Post-oflice the' vehicle of their malice or vindictyveness. Amendmenb negatived. That the woid "" blasphemous "" in paragraph (c) be omitted. I am quite in accord with the Attorney General in what he has just said as to not allowing the Post-office being made a documents, but I think it is absurd for us to allow newspapers to go through without any restriction as to blasphemy, and yet to passa clause of this kind which would I would like to point enable any person who might receive a letter or newspaper containing what he considered to be a blasphemous expression to call upon the Post-office officials to prosecute",25,Deakin Perhap S Prevailing Measure

The word ""and"" should be substituted for ""or.""

According to the way in which the clause is now worded, an act may be unlawful without being malicious, or malicious without being unlawful. If an act is unlawful, what does it matter whether it is malicious or not ? I think that this furnishes an additional reason for adopting the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa. words are to be read in the exclusive sense suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi, but that the object is to relieve the department of the necessity of proving malice, and simply to require them to prove intention. A thing may be done deliberately but not maliciously, and a negligent act would not be a malicious act, but the word "" unlawfully"" would very probably cover cases of that kind. The difficulty we are faced with in all these clauses is that they may be looked at from extreme points. We may look at the accidental breaking of an instrument which would merit no punishment, but on the other hand the damage to an instrument might be . the result of a deliberate wicked desire for gain. I confess that I do not like the antithesis suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi, and I. will endeavour to find a new phrase, which will give protection against the more serious offences, and omit the lighter ones. latter part of this clause provides that any man found guilty of the offences set forth in the clause, which include the interruption or impeding the use of any line, or the transmission of any message, shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding tliree years. No option of a fine is given, and I think the provision as it stands is very unreasonable. A messenger carrying a telegraphic message might be obstructed in some way only technically malicious, and yet the person obstructing him would be liable under this clause to imprisonment for three years. We have made provision in another part of the Bill that any person who obstructs an officer in the execution of his duty, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £ 1 0 , and I think that a fine, especially if the limit is fixed at a high amount, would be quite sufficient to meet all the necessities under this clause. A t any rate the option should be given to the courts to inflict a fine. land Act power is given to the courts to consider whether it is expedient in the interests of justice that a man should be prosecuted for an indictable offence, or be allowed to plead summarily.",30,Jtoes

Sir LANGD ON BONYTH ON (South Australia) I move That the words ""of the Postmaster-General"" be omitted. It seems to me that the omission of these words will not in any way weaken the clause, and that the amendment will operate fairly to companies which construct lines with the authority of the Government. regard this as a very serious provision. Indeed the effect of its operation would be to stop the extension of the electric tramway service of Sydney and other cities. W.e cannot extend that system under the present conditions without affecting the telephone service, and the fault is largely the fault of tlie Post-office in that it has not the metallic circuit. Yet this clause provides for the imposition of penalties, although it is recognised that the postal department has not the metallic circuit and consequently cannot be properly protected. lines not to be protected 1 service without the metallic circuit must be affected by the construction of the electric tramways, and to a lesser extent by the construction of electric lighting mains. Is tlie fact that this service has not and will not have for a good many years the metallic circuit to prevent the extension of the electric tramway system 1 If not, this clause becomes a dead letter, and we should not pass a dead letter which will give to some obstructive Postmaster-General the power if he chooses to enforce it .

I think that a line should be distinctly drawn between the cases of electric tramways which have been authorized in the past and those of similar bodies applying to Parliament for like powers in the future. Even sub-clause (3) T h a t is the alternative I of clause 142 will not meet the case. We ought to provide that electric tramways which are already authorized, and which have constructed works under an existing law, ought not to be made subject to the prohibition contained in this Bill so long as they are using all reasonable and known precautions to avoid injuring the telegraph lines. to add my protest to what the honourable member for North Sydney has already said in connection with this matter. I have received a very strongly worded protest from the town council of Perth in regard to the operation of this clause, which I can conceive will, if allowed to stand, do a great deal of injury to the development of my electorate. We have a very up-to-date electric tramway system there. We are extending it into various suburbs, and it is proving of immense advantage to the whole electorate, and indirectly to the whole of the State. The Tramway Company use every reasonable precaution, and I cannot see why such electric companies should be penalized, simply because the postal authorities neglect to adopt necessary measures to prevent their service from being injured. The Postal department has the remedy in its own hands. This matter ought to receive very careful consideration at the hands of the Minister before he decides upon a course that will inflict very decided hardship upon electric lighting and tramway companies. bers are fully aware of the large amount of attention which has been given elsewhere to this clause. The amendments which have been suggested and the letters which the Postmaster-General received from the various electrical authorities, both for lighting and traction purposes, whether from Brisbane, New South Wales, or Tasmania, have been, as far as practicable, dealt with in another place. Provision has been made for respecting the rights of existing companies. tion. It will be observed that where great power is expended b}' an electric lighting or tram way company in close contiguity with the telegraph lines the Postmaster-General may decide upon the removal either of the wires of the company or of his own wires.

AVe want, therefore, some power in the State, and the Government think that the power to protect the rights of the people should rest with the Postmaster General as the representative of the people. If it be necessary from time to time to extend tlie existing lines of tramway or of lighting, and if those lines have been first in the field, I do not think that there w ill be anj' great difficulties. telegraph line has been established first, then, owing to the enormous power which must pass along electric tramway lines, the latter must keep out of tlie way. Arbitration Board to settle the dispute between .tliem ? the Postmaster-General tlie power to deal with this matter on behalf of the people ? Seeing that for a very long time we cannot establish the metallic circuit except at enormous expense, why should tlie Government, after having been first in tlie field, have to incur a huge outlay in order tliat some tramway or lighting company shall be benefited ? If it be necessary to run the telegraph wires down a back streeb, bhen leb it be done at the expense of the company which is going to monopolize a road that ought to belong to the public. the municipalities control and own the tram lines, and the argument is that the mur.ucrpaliti.es have bhe firsb call upon and should have bhe firsb use of bheir roads. WhatI fear is, however, that electric lighting and tramway authorities will be very much restricted, not only in regard to the running of electric trams, but also in ing, if the provisions of this clause be carried out in their entirety. I would therefore ask the Ministeri n charge of the Bill to try and modify these powers. The tendency is for these electric lighting and tramway undertakings bo be under the control either of the Government or of the municipalities, and the power of the latter is paramount to bhat of the Governmenb. AVe have I should like bo see bhe Postmaster-General modify the clause, and not make it restrictive against such aubhoriby. provision is wise so far as it relates to private companies. There is one matter, however, to which attention has not yet been drawn in bhe discussion on bhis clause. In Sydney bhe falling of telephone wires on the electric tramway lines is a source of great danger. Many of the wires used by the department break and fall upon the electric tram wires. Recently tlie department's cable house was set on fire owing bo a belegraph wire falling on the overhead tram cable, and. in another case a cab-horse was killed in the same way. Buti f the The telephone and telegraph wires must be carried through the main streets, and. the telephone wires must cross the electric tram lines. In Sydney the tramway system is part of the Railway department. We canAVhy nob have an not have a divided authority, and as some of the Sbabes do control the erection of electric tram wires, altogether separate from private companies this matter should receive attention. Some provision should be made for determining the conflicting interests of the parties. It is manifestly unfair bo confine bhe whole authority to the Postmaster-General and to enable him to say to a State or municipality"" You must erect your tramway system, or put up your wires, in a certain ""way."" Some provision should be made in such a measure as. this to enable the matter to be dealt with either by arbitration or by other means. I quite agree with the last speaker so far as private companies are concerned. The absence of a provision dealing with matters such as this, and making private companies correct the mischief they do to the telephone system, recently cost the Western Australian Government between £7,000 and £S,000. A t the same time. I would be sorry to see the ful l powers proposed by the clause given to the Postmaster-General.

179,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"Th eof the Bil l do not really touch tlie question. over all these services they would have It was not in connection with private companies that I raised this point, but rather in the transfer of them to tlie Commonrelation to Government and municipal electric works. If private companies have these powers under an existing Act, then they are protected by clause 142. But a company not yet in operation has no such power under any existing Act. In such cases it is quite competent to deal with them, and their interference with any telephone or telegraph line, when they are given the power. That, however, is not the question. Tbe question affects' the municipal or governmental, service. Isi t not an astonishing thing that the Minister in charge of the Bill should argue--""Why should not tlie Government have power to go into these streets which are tlieir own property; do what they choose with their telegraph and telephone lines-, and compel others to submit to their decision""? These streets are not the property of the Federal Government. They are the property of the States, and under the States the property of the municipal bodies that have been given control of them. It is on the assumption that we should be all powerful in these matters that this clause has been framed. The Government of New South Wales owns all the trams in Sydney and in several other cities. They have adopted tlie electric system, which is the most advanced, and which will no doubt be universally adopted eventually. The telegraph, and telephone wires are extended along and across all the streets of Sydney and suburbs, so that there is no street along which a tram coidd be put without affecting them. The tramway system must come into close proximity with these wires, because they are running throughout the city and suburbs. telephone wires underground. . in all. AVe say that an electrical authority shall not construct any electric line or do any other work for the generation, use, or supply of electricity whereby any telegraph line of tlie Postmaster-General is or may be injuriously affected* a far worse definition. tion states that ""injuriously affected"" means affected in. any manner. If the people intended that the Federal .Government should have such a power provided under the Constitution Act for wealth. They did not do so : they simply handed over tlie one service, and I venture to think there is not such a provision i u any other Postal Act so stringent as this. ' .Although the State authorities conduct telegraph and telephone departments, in the States, there is no such stringent and unworkable provision. This clause would affect the Government of New South Wales, and probably the Governments of some other States, so far as the running of electric trams are concerned. All extensions of electric tram lines would be absolutely blocked by it. It would also affect the municipal council of a city like Sydney, which is now undertaking the lighting of the city by electricity. They would be told-""They are your roads, but we, the Federal Government, order you off, you shall not go on to any street in tbe city or suburbs on which our lines are extended."" Surety the committee would never pass such a clause. I would urge tlie Minister to hold back the clause for reconsideration. Failing that it should be rejected. vernment will see the wisdom, of reconsidering this clause, and ascertaining whether it is not possible to erect some proper tribunal as between the Post-office and the State or other authorities which may desire to extend their electric systems. 1 am quite in sympathy with the idea with which this clause is put forward, namely, that the Post-office should' not be put to enormous expense in regard to metallic returns, simply because some one comes along and erects an overhead or underground system of electric traction wires contiguous'to tlie department's works. The principle underlying it , that no one acting in that way should do so without contributing something to repair any damage done to the already existing lines of the Postmaster-General, is a very proper one. The fact that we have not had anything of a like character in our various State Acts is due to the primary reason that the developments of electric traction are so recent that there has been libtle time to have special legislation on the subject. In the old land there exists the Board of Trade to act as arbitrabor bebween bhe conflicting interests of tlie companies and municipalities who engage in these-works, and in view of that fact I think that some body should",33,Jtoes

I do not want to vote against this clause, although I do not like it in its present shape. If the not only for Post-office purposes, and there Government can see their way clear either to postpone it or promise recommittal a little later on, so that they may consider whether the course I have suggested should not be adopted, I think that will meet the point fairly well. The Attorney-General shakes his head at the idea of any one outside the Commonwealtli having any claims as against the Commonwealth. All the people, against a portion of the people. ple are to prevent development on the part of a section of the people, then that section may have very large claims at equity. The city of Sydney, and towns which desire to adopt the electric lighting or tram system, may have good ground for complaint if their claims are not submitted to a third party. I really think the Postmaster-General and his officers are likely to be prejudiced in these matters. They look, very naturally, to their own department first of all, and very secondarily to the interests of other parties, whether represented by a municipality or a private company. ought to be a court set up to which application might be made to draw a distinction in equity between the interests of the parties. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). In this and succeeding clauses, the Government has treated too cavalierly the claims of municipalities. It is a mistake to suppose that the main interests of the people are centred in the use of electricity as applied to telegraph and telephone lines, because the advantages the community obtain from electricity in the shape of traction in the Bill, but some of the objections are and illuminating power are of greater value. The Government propose to assume control and prevent people having the great use of electricity they can have in municipal government. In clause after clause, the posithe determination of what is best in the tion is assumed that in every way the Commonwealth shall protect its own lines of telecovered up to the present is the Postmasterphone communication, and exclude the powers municipal authorities ought to have of using this force for municipal purposes. Day by day we see the extension of electrical power in cities and suburbs, and the municipalities of Redfern and other places will find their powers very largely interfered with by this Bill. The greatest good to the greatest number is to be achieved by using electricity for municipal purposes, and ought to be some authority to settle between conflicting interests. Some of the clauses interfere with powers given to municipal corporations under existing StateA c t s; and municipalities are called on to comply, not only with State Acts, but also with this Bill. The suggestion of the honourable member for Bland is an extremely wise one, and the Government ought to postpone the clause, and take advice as to how far the two powers come into conflict, with a view of devising some means of settling the conflict not altogether in favour of the Post-office. the Government will accede to the wishes of the committee, and postpone the clause with a view of having it more carefully considered. I doubt very much whether the Minister's interjection, that this is a question of the whole of the people against a section of the people, bears very much on the case. If we continue to insert clauses which so directly affect the interests not only of one State, but of the different States, we may be clashing with the interests of the majority of the people; I therefore think that there and I question whether it is advisable, even though we may possibly have the power, to practically nullify State Acts in the way some of the clauses propose. All the rights that corporations have under existing State Acts must be regarded and jsreserved by the Commonwealth Parliament, and some board ought to be appointed to settle differences between the two bodies. doubt one of the most difficult questions hardly rightly taken, because this law, almost in the very words, is in existence in some of the States. 1 suppose it has been found necessary to give to some authority public interest, and the only authority disGenerali n the several States.

We must all admit that this House would be adopting a reactionary policy if in this measure it endeavoured in any way to set bounds to the development of electricity, from which Ave hope so much in a great variety of ways. what this clause does. clause creates a predominant authority in the Post-office, which honourable members fear may be used to serve the selfish ends of tlie department, and be exercised with some indifference to the claims of other users of eleotricity. That may possibly be so, but the clause itself contains nothing injurious or improper, inasmuch as it only asserts tlie dominance of the Post-office in these matters. dominance is Avisely used there can be no complaint. What honourable members Avant -if matter is not subject to control-is that there should be some guarantee afforded to others interested that they Avill be offered an opportunity of gaining a better hearing than the Bill noAv -provides-that they may have an opportunity of putting their case before the public, and securing impartial consideration. I take it that we all desire the uses of electricity, both municipally and otherwise, to be multiplied on every hand, and all realize that the path of progress lies in the direction of electrical development. Therefore, the Commonwealth Avould be untrue to what should be its traditions if it acted in any dog-in-the-manger spirit. What Ave are confronted with, however, is this. A t the present time the Post-office is able to have a telephone service working with fair efficiency at a moderate cost, until enormous quantities of electrical force are generated in close vicinity to them. Where that happens the telephonic service becomes very seriously impaired, if not absolutely destroyed. Eveni n Melbourne, where the City Council cany out the electric lighting of the city, not altogether in considerate fashion so far as the telegraphic department is concerned, but still without coming into' actual collision, if honourable members use the telephones at night they will notice a rumbling noise like that of a miniature Niagara. If the electric light had been distributed in a somewhat different, and perhaps more expensiA'e fashion, all this might have been a\'oided. Now, in connection Avith this matter, it simply becomes a question, in regard to existing works of any kind, "" who is to pay,"" and the same question also arises in connection Avith future works. ' No one disputes but that, at a certain cost, the telephonic service UOAV in existence can be either renewed or fitted up Avith a metallic circuit, as it is called, in No t necessarily. This such a way as to get rid of existing disabilities, and the question is, who is to pay for this 1 In some cases the telephone system Avasi n possession first, before either tlie tramways or the electric lighting systems came into A'Ogue, and then it may fairly be asked Avhether the last-comers ought not to pay the cost of making the alterations. The method of priority is one way of settling the matter, and If this if the method of priority is not to be adopted, Avhat plan is to be resorted to I I do not think honourable members Avill look the absolute authority in this forward Avitli any satisfaction to the prospect of the Commonwealth always having to pay. Whetheri t be the State or the municipality or the private company Avhich brings an electric lighting system or a traniAvay system along the streets, the question is whether the expense of any alteration that may be necessitated by them is to come out of the pocket of the CommonAvealth or of those who are responsible for such neAv services. In cases Avhere the telephone is to be erected after the other electric services are installed, it seems to me to be reasonable tliat the proprietors of the telephone should pay all expenses. As far as I can follow honourable members they desire that we should modify our proposals in some Avay so that this vexed question as to AVIIO is to pay for the metallic circuit shall be capable of determination. But I do not think that any number of honourable members have agreed upon any common principle.

199,Mr Deakin,"But honourable memAmerica, where the tramway and iselephone services, which are mainly owned hy private corporatioils, have come into conflict, the American courts have held that the roads are intended more for the use ofvehicle traffic than for conveying intelligence by means of telephone, and that when the two clash, the tramway service is to take tlie first place. In the United States, owing to private corporations being chiefly concerned, the case presents many points of difference from our own, but the circumstances are more analogous in the United Kingdom, where a great conflict has been maintained between the Post-officeauthorities and the telephone companies and electriclighting companies. There, at lust, the difficulty was settled by tlie Board of Trade rules. I have laid down conditions upon which electricity might be employed either for trams, electric lighting, or telephone services. As far as one can learn, these Board of Trade rules have worked well, and have given satisfaction in Great Britain, where they have, at all events, removed most of the causes of friction. 'Here our circumstances are somewhat different, but still it is possible that the Board of Trade rules, or some modification of them, may furnish us with the solution we are seeking. I am not competent to speak on this subject, but we might consult the Postmaster General and his advisers. I understand that a conference of electrical experts was held recently, and their report, which is now being printed, may throwsomelight upon this question and upon the applicability of the Board of Trade rules to our circumstances. If the committee will pass this clause now, giving us the benefit of their practical suggestions, we will have the whole matter reconsidered with a view to making any necessary alterations. There is no desire on the part of the Government to discourage the use of electricity, but we have to be careful to protect the public interests, and to guard the Treasury against raids. Consistent with that qualification, any amendment that would have the effect of facilitating the use of electricity in every way would be welcome. We do not wish to postpone the clause now, because there are one or two amendments which we desire to make, which cannot"" be inserted at this stage if the clause is postponed. As the subject is not as clear as it might be, it is desirable to have the criticisms of honourable members upon these clauses to-night, now that the committee is fully seized of their meaning. We can pass them subject to recommittal. If we pass them, having the benefit of the practical criticisms and suggestions of honourable members, now that we have grasped what are our points of difference, we shall be the better able to consider the Postmaster General's future proposals when we lay before him the result Of this debate. that this clause involves a very grave responsibility. The first question which I ask myself isHave we the power to pass such a clause 1 and the next is-If we have the power, is it desirable that we should exercise it? I am convinced that it would not be wise for the Commonwealth Parliament to endeavour to exercise this power. Just as in other parts of the Bill we have strong evidence of tlie trend of the official mind, so we have it here in its very quintessence. We have here exT pressed the feeling which has been engendered by years of trouble on the part of the postal authorities, b}' reason of the conflict which has arisen between the vaiying interests mentioned in these clauses. For a considerable time the postal officials have been -endeavouring to cope with tlie curse of induction, which has caused the telephonic communication in one of the States at a certain period of the day to become almost useless. But the solution of this difficulty is not to be found in retarding the development of electrical science. It is to be found rather in the grounding of the wires used in the telephonic service. There are certain aesthetic reasons why we should do away with the overhead wires, but the purely commercial reason is that we should then get rid of the induction, which undoubtedly to a large extent limits the use of the telephonic system. Last year the Victorian Government considered this question of grounding the telephone wires. Estimates were prepared, and had the McLean Government remained in power they would have started the work of grounding the wires in the metropolis. The adoption of that plan would obviate the trouble with, which Ave are confronted in this Bill. I am very loath to do anything which may be regarded as an interference Avith the rights of the various States. A t tlie commencement of our federal existence it is very necessary that everything should Avork Avith the utmost smoothness. We were told only",37,Jtoes
200,Mr Salmon (Laanecoorie),"I thinka few hours ago of the derangement of the finances of the State of Victoria owing to the federal expenditure exceeding the amount which it was thought would be incurred. true; but that matter would be a small one compared with the outcry which would be raised if we passed such a clause as this. The adoption of this provision means that we shall stop electrical development within the Commonwealth. In Victoria, I am proud to think that we have made tre.mendous strides in the use of electricity. We find that the machinery for our mines is being driven by electricity. The passage of such a provision as this would _ mean almost the complete stoppage of that machinery. In one mine that I know of, there is electrical communication between the power house and various portions of a very large lease. The cables are laid along . the public roads. It would have been impossible to have had those cables there if this clause had been in operation. Not only do I think that it is advisable to postthe scissors and paste principle with unpone the clause, but I believe that the committee should strike it out altogether. It is provision is inserted for no other reason far better to leave matters as they are, than to commit what I think would be an undoubted interference with the rights of the States. The federal authority might in the future find itself barred by this clause if it were passed into law. It might be considered advisable some time hence for the federal authority to take over electric power in any part of the Commonwealth. apply in that case. What we surely desire is to encourage, by every means in our power, the introduction of the up-to-date methods which are being found so successful in other parts of tlie world. If we are«anxious for the progress of the Commonwealth we need to be very careful to avoid the creation of friction between the federal authorities and the States. We should do everything that can possibly be devised to advance the Commonwealth, and not take what I consider would be a retrograde step, which would stamp us as reactionaries rather than as progressionists. purport of this clause apparently is to place the whole control of the use of electricity in the hands of the Postmaster-General. I should like to say that such a step is totally opposed to the tendency of the times, which is to place all electrical power, so far as cities are concerned, in the hands of the municipal authorities. In all the great I do not say that it is cities of the world there is a tendency on the part of the State to divest itself of certain powers, and to vest them in the local authorities whenever that can be done with benefit to the whole people. Thati t can be done with benefit to the whole people is very apparent in these days of specialization, and I do not think it requires any argument to prove that the municipality is the proper authority to control the telegraph"" wires, and, indeed, everything which runs through the streets. If I had my way I would give to the municipal authorities supreme control of the streets. In Sydney there are five or six authorities, each one apparently having concurrent powers, and no one having supreme control. We have witnessed most ridiculous episodes as the result of this divided responsibility. This Bil l has evidently been constructed on limited elbow room, and this particular than that it is contained in the Queensland Act. the English Act. It is an adaptation from the English Act. direction. There does not seem to beany reason why the control of this electric power, which, as my honourable friend has remarked, is just in its swaddling clothes, should be vested in every Postmaster-General. tween us is as to who shall pay. Postmaster-General power to do certain things. Nothing can be done without his approval. Under this provision no authority can lay down a line of tramway without the Postmaster-General's consent. The subject bristles with difficulties. The Attorney General is not in a position to say what is likely to be an injury to or what is likely to ""prejudicially affect"" the working of the telegraph lines. I should like to obtain some definite understanding as to the limitations of the clause. I do not wish to delay the committee, but I certainly think the powers it gives",38,Jtoes

Their report may give us an opportunity of settling this question. I pointed out before that, so far from desiring to discourage or interfere with, it will be tlie desire of the Government to encourage, the utilization of electricity by municipalities or States, or even by companies, where these are not available. The only question for which we have to find a solution is as to who is to pay, under the various conditions, for the necessary outlay to enable the telephone system. to be continued without injury from either the electric lighting or tramway system. In one case it may be the business of the department, and in the other it may be the business of tlie person who owns the electric tramway or lighting works. It is for that purpose that I am asking tliat these clauses be passed with a few amendments, of which notice has been given, on tlie understanding that they will be recommitted. of those who pre-supposes, because some drastic powers are given to the Government, that necessarily they will be exercised. I think it is essential very frequently that we should give the fullest powers to the Government in order that they may deal with cases which do require very arbitrary-measures. The Government must have realized the enormous interests which exist in connection with electric lighting and power works, and also the great interests which have yet to grow up in relation to them. I think, therefore, we cannot be too guarded against giving the slightest suggestion to these -various interests that they are going to be -interfered with. 12 u fallen from honourable members must have convinced the Attorney-General and the Minister in charge of tlie Bill that there is a fear that the placing of these arbitrary powers in the hands of the Government may be prejudicial to these great interests. They are, of course, private interests, in some cases, while in others they are the semi public interests of municipalities or the in terests of the States, while the Commonwealth has also interests which must be considered. I am of opinion that it is hopeless to think of effectively dealing with the enormous interests which have to be safeguarded by means of a few clauses in a measure of this kind. My feeling is that the matter can only be properly dealt with by a comprehensive measure relating to electric light and power. Therefore, I would venture to suggest to the Attorney General whether it would not be possible to so adjust the mandatory clauses which exist. in the Bill that for the present session, and during the recess, the powers which exist iri the State laws may be exercised by thedepartment; and that he should make a promise that in the coming session the Government will bring forward a comprehensive measure dealing with all thesematters. I am perfectly certain that . if he does he will remove the objections which several honourable members entertain. He will also remove the fears which are held by representatives of a large number of vested interests tliat they are to be seriously affected if these clauses are put into operation. My own feeling is that the fears may be exaggerated, because I do not believe it is the intention * of the Government to apply these provisions . in any way to the disadvantage of the interests involved. There is a large amount of outside capital now being introduced into the Commonwealth for the extension of electric lighting and power systems, and this great power of electricity has to be safeguarded with many conditions which do not apply to almost any other great undertaking. The railways, and our streetsand roads, and all other public concerns can be safeguarded on known lines, but electricity operates in so many ways, and is being so constantly improved upon, that what is a novelty to-day is ancient a few months hence. Electric power is increasing rapidly, and I feel that if we are to attract capital for these great enterprises The remarks which have we must not convey the impression to the",39,Jtoes

I venture to suggest that the matter might be. so adjusted, that until, the whole question is dealt -with in a comprehensive manner by a separateBill, the Postal department shall deal with these interests under the State legislation as it exists up to the point at which new legislation is created. electricity is very limited'. that improvements can only be brought about by a conference with, and. a proper recognition of the rights of, the various States. This is only one of the many conferences which will have to be brought about before the machinery of the States and the Commonwealth will work well together. I hope-the Attorney-General will see his way clear to consider the suggestion I have made. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -The suggestion made by the lasb speaker that the present provisions of the State Acts relating to electricity should, continue to be administered, and that the Government should bringforward a comprehensive measuredealing with the whole question next session might be a good one, but I""do not think the Commonwealth has the power tobringforward such a Bill'. It might be possible to stretch a point and makethis one of the matters to be -dealt with by the Inter-Sbabe Commission. There is a -sort of Subtle assumption on the part of the Government that they, having controlof the Post-office; should in a somewhat oblique way; have control of'the electric forces which play such an important part in municipal affairs. When the A t borney-General urges the committee to pass this clauseon his promise that it will' be reexperbs have considered bhismatber in concommitted, I think he is asking too much. This is an invasion of State rights toa certain extent, and-the committee would be wanting in' its duty if* it did not attempt to safeguard those-rights. The assumption of the Government is that all these powers -whdc'hi may interferewith beldphone wires-should be completely under tlieir control. Despite theargument of the Attorney-General, that the Commonwealth, as dealing with' the whole, should be ofprime importance, I wouldpoint out bhat for every onewho is interested in the use of belephones, there-are some 500 or 600 people interested in electric trams within the Commonwealth. In facb, in a city like Sydney, with the development of its electric tramway system; nearly every member'of the conir inunity is interested in it , and if the CityCouncil carries out its proposals to illuminate bhe city by electricity; just as is done in Redfern and' obher places, bhen all the citizens will be interested in the exercise of that right and privilege. On. the other hand, there is only some one in 500 or 600 interested in telephonic communicaI admit that it is; and tion. We should look bo. each side, and remember the recognised principle in alllegislation that the right of the greater number should rule-. Most certainly the greater number is on the side of giving free play to the m-unicipality and other local government bodies intaking advantage of electrical power. Thecommittee would not act wisely in accepting the AtborneyGeneral's suggestion that we should pass this clause and allow it to be reconsidered later on. The Attorney-General has already received suggestions from honourable members, andthey are likely to be tlie suggestions given in „ regard to every clause dealing with the same subject. Those suggestions mean that the Government have arrogated too much power to themselves in regard to the control of electricity, which, as has been said, is as yet in its swaddling clothes. As time goes on, themunicipalities will largely extend their vise of electricity. Where we have £1,000 invested in telephones, we will probably have a million invested in other channels of elecbrioiby, and, in view of these facts, we should press -the Ministrybo wibhhold these clauses-until they-have had time to consider the' -way in which they may amend them in order-to meet public opinion on the subject.

The suggestion made by the honourable member for Bland that we should erect some authority to settle these matters is a very excellent one. The Ministry should consider, that proposal, and come to some decision by which they may be able to propose to the committee some provision, vesting an authority with, the right of dealing with these questions. 1 would, therefore, ask for the postponement of these clauses. in response to the invitation of the Attorneyelectrical authority likely to involve any General to express some of the objections to these clauses as they stand. As has been stated there are several great spheres of electrical energy. Only one of these will be under the control of the Commonwealth Government, whilst the others are at tlie present time almost equally important, and bid fair to become stall more important in the future to the people of the whole of the Commonwealth. Under these circumstances it is only proper, especially when the command of these enterprises is for the most port in the hands of the State Governments or municipal bodies that, whilst every consideration is given to the Post and Telegraph department, the other services should riot be interfered with by the Commonwealth any more than is absolutely necessary. One strong objection to the clause is that no cognisance is taken in these clauses, except in one limited respect, of bhe Acts under which the municipalities or other bodies already work in the various States. No recognition is given to the fact that these bodies have already fulfilled the terms and conditions of Acts of Parliament .which have been passed by the States, which were at the time controlling the electrical departwhere most of these electrical enterprises ments of the telegraphs and telephones. It is not recognised that these bodies have fulfilled the conditions already imposed, but it is sought to bring about fresh conditions which will hamper them, and upset the work already done. No consideration is given to the State or municipal electrical departments, as against the Commonwealth eleotrical department. I i work has to be done by the State or municipal bodies, notice must be given to the Commonwealth Government; but, on the obher 12 TJ 2 If we do. so, hand, theiCoinnionwealt^i maypu^sue.its own courseand; may injuriously .a%qt. certain works .of. the municipaliibies o.r State Go.yerii; mepjbs .without requiring, to give any., nptice whatever of, its intentions, The Commonwealth Government may tear up the streets which are not their pj^opepby bujb are the propeiity of the States, given in.tq.the hands of the miun-icipal autiiprities,, whereas the municipal authorities themselves cannot, until they give notice, tear up their own streets for their own electrical purposes if such work should approach the lines or works of the Commonwealth. Then again the conditions are in no wise mutual, because under clause 139the most drastic provisions are made that nothing shall be donjs by any alteration in the lines of the PostmasberGeneral, and yet there is no provision that the Commonwealth authorities shall have to submit to any such condition if they are in their turn likely to interfere with the works of the other electrical authorities. Other Governments b.ave had to provide for similar conditions, but they have not attempted to meet them in this way. Another peculiar point is that, in the event of any injury resulting bo bhe lines or works of tlie Commonwealth electrical department, the other electrical authorities will have to pay the cost. It may be that the electrical works of the Commonwealth are entirely behind the times-as in fact bhey arewhilst the other electrical authorities may be absolutely up-to-date in every respecb, and yet no consideration is paid to any circumstances of thab kind. If bhe Commonwealth has not the metallic circuit which is now found necessary in all parts of the world, they make no allowance for any inefficiency on their own part, but claim that the, municipal or State authorities shallbeliablefor ajl the consequences of their own systemnot being up to date. In America, are carried on by private corporations, and where there is no preference, as between one body and another, such as it is now sought to secure for the Commonwealth, the courts have held, as the Attorney-General has told us,, that traction is to take precedence of the means of conveying telegraphic or telephone messages. This decision was arrived at for the. apparently good,, reason that it is much easier fpr the telephgnq or telegraph lines to be removed from the influence of other electrical works",41,Jtoes
216,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"I risethan for those, other works, such as tram lines, to be removed. The Attorney-General also alluded to the fact that in Great Britain the circumstances and conditions are more similar to our own, and it was further indicated that the clauses dealing with this matter were to some extent a digest of the British Acb. There is some similar provision in the BritishA ct which, providesNo alteration in any telegraph line of the 3?ostmaster-General shall be made by the undertakers except subject to the provisions of the Telegraph Act 1878. The undertakers shall not in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Act or by any licence, order, or special Act, lay down an3' electric line or do any other work for the supply of electricity whereby any telegraphic line of the Postmaster-General is or _may be injuriously affected. . . . This reads very much like the clause in the B ill now before us, but bhe words appearing in the Bil l have been torn away from their context. The section in the English Acb goes on, without even a full stopand before any such electric line is laid down or work is done within ten yards of any part of a telegraph line of the Postmaster-General. This describes the position the lines must ""be in before they are dealt with in the way provided for in the section, which goes on to make various other provisions. Then again towards the end of the secbion we find this provisionAny difference which arises between the Postmaster-General and the undertakers or their agents with respect to any requirements so made shall be determined by arbitration. Now there is an enormous difference between the EnglishA ct and the proposals in this Bill. It is true that there is a provision for arbitration in another part of this Bill, but there is no such provision as that contained in this clause standing by itself in the English Act. The clause as framed would absolutely prevent the construction of any work's, and no provision is made for any compromise or modification, but the Postmaster-General is left as the sole judge of the whole matter. I think that the Minisber in charge of the Bill should consider the necessity of making alterations in this Bill, so that no undue interference may take place with the proper development and extension of electrical enterprise in those spheres of energy which are not under the control of Government. If we wish our communities to progress and advance as others are doing, we must not throw any obstacles, in the way of electrical development. Mr Thomson. trol. not be an arbitrary control or an unreasonable control. I would suggest that bhe clause should be postponed with a view to giving the fullest consideration to all those factors which require to be taken into account, so that while we may safeguard the Post and Telegraph department from injury, we may also give satisfaction to those States 'and municipal bodies which, on their own lines, are trying to develop electrical facilities for the public good. are three interests involved in this matter. The interests of the Commonwealth in connection with the Telegraph department, the interests of the Construction branch of the Public Works department and the interesbs of the various municipal bodies who are carrying on elecbric enterprise. In speaking to a gentlemen connected with the Railway department in New South Walesyesterday, he expressed the opinion tliat unless this clause were altered it would very materially affect the interests of his department. It becomes a question now as ,towhether we, as a Parliament, should endeavour to retain as many rights -to ourselves as we possibly can, or whether we should not give every reasonable right to municipal bodies and State Governments consistent with the conservation 6f our own immediate interests. W ill the State Governments consider our interests where they think that they have any rights ? While we are passing our laws ought we not to embody in them eveiy power which is conferred upon us by the Constitution 1 I am sure that the Commonwealth Government will not exercise any power to the injury of State rights. I presume that the States have their rights. But under the Constitution Acb we also have defined rights, and whilst we would naturally give every consideration to the rights which belong to the State Parliaments, I do not know that we should be acting wisely by doing anything to weaken our own position.

That, I think, is the trend of the argument which has been urged this evening. I do not think tliat we need go so far out of our way to consider those interests. We should enact laws which will reserve to ourselves the fullest possible power. It would be advantageous if the Attorney-General could give the committee some intimation regarding the date to which the consideration of these clauses is to be postponed. There are many interested in them, and now that the matter has been discussed it will attract public attention, and be more fully thought of than it has been up to the present. It would be well if the Minister could discuss this matter with the railway constructing authorities' branches in the different States, ancl ascertain how far they are affected. -We know that in Sydney a number of the telephones will not work because of the electric trams. ber forgets tliat the municipality of Sydney is about to spend a £250,000 in lighting that city. to be consulted. sent in the amendments which they desire. important matter, and I think the Minister should give some intimation as to the date to which the consideration of this clause is to be postponed, so that honourable members may have an opportunity of taking further action in the light of the discussion which has occurred this evening. I hope that, during the interval which will elapse before this matter is again discussed, the Minister will take into consideration the monstrous character of the clause in its present form. Here is an authority for interference by the in matters of electric lighting and electric traction in which the federal authorities are armed with no power whatever. wires. no absolute assurance that the telegraph An Act of this kind lines will be interfered with, but this provision is inserted because they may be interfered with.

I hope that in the modification of the clause, the Attorney General will see that the broader rights of the people, of municipalities, and of State Governments are not interfered with to anj'thing like the degree that this clause proposes. It is somewhat unfortunate that the Postal authorities have not taken the opportunity of perusing the report of the officers who have inquired into this question. the Senate for weeks and weeks. before this House for about a fortnight! The committee of electrical experts to whom I refer sat in Adelaide and finished their work about a fortnight since.

Let .us take the case of Adelaide, where the experience has been quite the opposite to that of Sydney. For a number of years we have had telephonic communication in Adelaide, but it is only just now that the question of electric lighting is being brought forward.

247,Mr Higigins,"I do not think clausethink, however, that we are jumping before we come to the stile. Let us wait until we come to clause 142. There has been some reference to the example of. America; but there the federal power has not got the televenience and private individuals proposing graph or telephone works at all. The Constitution in America does not give what our Constitution gives to us-tb e ownership of telegraphic and telephonic communication. But whatever the Constitution gives to the federal authority can be so regulated by the federal authority as to make the federal. works, whatever they are, superior to the works of other parties. Just as in America any interference with a post can be punished under the federal law, just as in America everything has to give way to the United States mail upon the highways and railways of the States, so it is thought that there should be incorporated here a provision that everything must give way to the federal telephone and telegraphic communications. I hope it will be understood by the honourable member for North Sydney, whose remarks certainly impressed me, that I think there must be some modification of clause 142, and that there must be some provision by which tlie Postmaster-General shall not have the sole right to say what are the conditions to be carried out. bowever, pass clause 136, especially when we see that it is limited and guarded by clause 138. If there is a division upon the matter I will vote with the Government. able member for Northern Melbourne has practically touched the points to which I desired to refer. W it h respect to clause 136, however, I think it would be eminently desirable to insert a provision by which any electric authority desiring to proceed with new works may have power to take the Postmaster-General to arbitration, even where a line already exists. realize that there should be some such provision as that contained in clause 136, I also way to those of the Commonwealth. I am realize that, where a matter of public convenience is to be carried out either by the State or other authority, the way should not be barred for all time by the Postmaster-General. It is. only within the last few years that we have had a case in point, the Postmaster General of Victoria exercising his powers against a private corporation proceeding with some electric lighting works that would have been a public convenience. I would remind the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, that we ought not to draw a line between a municicipality undertaking works for public conto execute works of a similar character. A private individual or corporation frequently undertakes works because the municipalities fail to carry out their duties, and they should have their rights safeguarded. W it h a provision for arbitration attached to clause 136, we might fairly accept it . They are not debarred from undertaking new works, but in the event of their not coming to an agreement they can resort to arbitration. It is a matter for considerationas to how this arbitration tribunal should be constituted, but it is certainly undesirable that we should come into conflict with the State interests in this matter, or hamper those who are undertaking the development of electricity in the best interests of the States. Under clause 13S ample provision is made for the carrying out of new works by the electrical authorities under clearly defined conditions, which, I think, we may safely accept. With respect to the further provision in clause 142, I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything in addition to the advice We might, which has already been tendered to the Attorney-General. very glad that the Attorney-General has agreed to postpone these clauses, because, after considering the nine clauses which follow clause 136, it seems to me that there is a much larger question to be dealt with than could possibly be met by a number of small amendments. No doubt we have arrived at one of those stages at which we find the Commonwealth interests coming into conflict with those of the States. I cannot assent to the proposition that has WhilstI been put forward during the debate that State interests must in all cases give quite prepared to admit that, if the whole Commonwealth were affected to just the same extent as the States in the aggregate, it might be a fair thing to ask the States to stand aside. But the extent of the interests is not to be measured' by the number of people affected.

248,Mr Kennedy (Moira),-The honor,47,Jtoes
249,Mr Brucesmith (Parkes),"I aminterests would demand greater consideration than those of the larger number. The attitude which the Commonwealth is taking up in connection with this measure is that of requiring all the other powers to stand aside, and bend to the necessities of the Commonwealth. fair thing to do if the interests on both sides were to some extent equal, but I think it will be seen that the telegraph and telephone services of the Commonwealth are, to a certain extent, standing interests, and are not increasing in anything like .the same ratio as those connected with the application of electricity to traction ancl illuminating purposes. The whole tramway system of New South Wales is now passing under the power of electricity after having gone 'through the steam-stage and the cable-stage, tric lighting system is also being very .largely extended on all hands. very little doubt, moreover, that when the existing arrangement between the Melbourne Tramway Company and the Tramway Trust comes to an end, the whole of the tramways of Melbourne will be converted to the electrical system. As to electric lighting, -the municipality of Sydney is about to embark on the investment of £250,000 in carrying out an electric lighting system under a special Act of Parliament, and various country towns throughout New South Wales are entering upon similar enterprises. The question is not necessarily whether the Commonwealth should give way to the States or the States should give way to the Commonwealth, but we should consider whether it is not possible to harmonize the two interests. Our tramway systems in the large cities must go through the main thoroughfares, but our telegraph and telephone wires might very well be taken along the back streets. Althoughi t may cost a little more to carry out such an arrangement with regard to it should be quite po'ssible, looking to this as one of the most important conflicts that has arisen under our Commonwealth legislation, to devise some means by which the two interests can be harmonized. The framers of this Bill have recognised this, because in clause 138, under which difficulties may arise between the Postmaster General ancl the States or any electrical authority, provision is made for arbitration, and at present I can see no better means of settling such conflicts, which must arise more' and more frequently in the future, than by establishing some permanent system of arbitration. It would be absurd for the Commonwealth to take up an attitude of dominating State interests in connection with the railways and municipal and That might be a very private enterprises. "" If the application of electrical power is to -develop in the way that is expected in connection with traction and electric lighting, the interests in those directions will entirely overwhelm in importance the conveyance of telephones and telegraphic messages. The amount of capital involved in these enterprises will be much greater, and the general public interests will on the whole be very much more important. When the Commonwealth Parliament acquired the right to deal with the post and telegraph services it was only and the elecintended that conflicts of this kind should be provided for as incidental to the carrying on I have of these services. The honourable member for Kooyong attributed to the Commonwealth greater powers than it possesses when he suggested that the Attorney-General should take into consideration the framing of a comprehensive measure dealing with the whole question of electricity. I think the Attorney-General will agree with me that there is no power in the Commonwealth Constitution under which such, a thing could be clone. In the provision in the Pederal Constitution which gives the Parliament power to deal with all matters affecting the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth in regard to postal and telegraph matters there is an implied authority to trespass on the rights' of others in order to cany out these objects effectually and economically, but there must be some limit. It could not be for a moment contended, that because the Commonwealth Postmaster-General has power to exercise certain rights under the fifth of the 39 articles of the Commonwealth, he could telephone and telegraph wires therefore compel a tramway system to be moved out of his way because it interfered with some of his lines of telegraphic communication. That would be a reduotio ad absurd/ivm, and the question as to how far State or municipal interests are to be subordinated to those of the Commonwealth must be a matter of negotiation. I am not going to propose any tinkering amendments in any of these ten clauses from 136 to 145 inclusive, but I hope the Attorney-General will take them into consideration and see whether some provision cannot be made for applying the principle of arbitration to -it is-impossible-for any tramway -or electric the -whole of them. I suggest that light line to be placed in the vicinity of a there should be one comprehensive clause telephone line with a .ground -cuirrent .withreferring to tlie whole of these ten clauses, out producing injurous effects upon the providing that where any dispute .arises latter.

259,Mr Speaker,"Order! I do not to -warrant them putting up stills of their own. question. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The B ill approaches very closely to it . It is pointed out that although a distiller has to pay £ 5 0 for his licence, and is under the most stringent regulations, it is doubtful, as the Bill stands, whether he has a right to sell spirits to the smaller wine-maker for the purpose of fortifying wines. upon a question of Tariff? MrV . L . SOLOMON I think it comes within a machinery Bill. I will content myself with calling the attention of the Minister to the matter. I am only alluding to what are deemed to be neeessaiy amendments by those who are interested in the vine-growing industry. Clause 14 provides that ho person who is licensed to retail spirits shall be licensed to distil, and thatIf any person licensed under this Act shall be licensed to retail spirits, his licence under this Abt shall thereupon cease. I can see exactly the object of tlie clause : that it would hardly be wise for a publican to be licensed to retail and distil spirits. In such a case the difficulty of preventing fraud on the revenue would be very great indeed. I am sure, however, that the word "" retail,"" as used in the clause, requires some closer definition. I have given notice of an amendment to deal with it in a way which I think will meet the case. It certainly does not mean to refer to a person who is licensed to sell spirits by the gallon. The word "" retail,"" in my opinion, refers really to licensed victuallers, and when we get into committee I propose to move for the insertion of the words "" in less quantity than one gallon."" The gallon licence in some of the States is issued only to storekeepers, and solely in respect of liquor to be consumed away from the licensed premises. exempting a licensee to sell spirits by the gallon, than a licensee in respect of a smaller volume ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -It struck me that the object of this clause was to prevent the retailer having a still on his premises. storekeeper having a still on his premises ? . MrV . L . SOLOMON -There may be. In submitting my proposed amendment to the committee I shall be quite open to be convinced that it will not meet the case, if the Ministeri n charge of the Bill can show me that there is good cause for placing a larger interpretation on the word "" retail "" than that usually given to it . Theni n clause 28 I find it is provided that every distiller, in addition to the fair sum which he has to pay for his licence, shall afford reasonable office accommodation for the supervizing officer-wh o is to be in constant attendance at the distillery for the protection of the revenue-and also, if the distillery is distant more than two miles However, from a licensed public-house, to provide board and lodging for the officer to the satisfaction of the collector. I would point out to the Minister that this clause goes a great deal further than present legislation in South Australia. It would be a very great hardship in many instances if, because of the fact that a distillery was more than two miles distant from a township, the proprietor should be required to provide board and lodging for the officer at his own cost. No doubt it would increase the cost of his licence from £ 5 0 to £150. It might involve the distiller in an expenditure of from 30s. to £ 2 per week to furnish board and lodging for the officer, and unless the Minister can show us that similar conditions obtain at present in some of the States, I think the committee will agree with me that this is a very hard proposal. It has been pointed put to me by some of the distillers that in South Australia an allowance of £ 2 0 per year towards the board and lodging, of the officer is made by the distiller, and that a similar grant is made by the Government. In these, days of cycling, when nearly every man can ride a bicycle, whether an officer has to attend .at a distillery two or four miles from an hotel is not a matter of very great moment to him. The distiller has to put up with the inconvenience of not having him on his premises as long as he would otherwise have him there. Clause 32 provides that no other trade is to be carried on upon the premises of a distillery without the permission in writing of the collector. There are distilleries and wineries in Australia where pretty well every business is conducted. I might instance Seppelts' vineyard at Seppeltsfield, one of the largest wineI making establishments in the world, and an",51,Distillati On Bill Second Heading

SOLOMON I will come now to clause 3.4, in regard to paragraph (d) of which there is a complaint. That paragraph provides that no distiller shall-Mix any wort, wash, or. fermented liquor made in his distillery with any wort, wash, or fermented liquor made elsewhere. It is pointed out by some of the distillers and wine-makers that it is sometimes necessary to use what is called brewer's yeast, or yeasty beer,which is obtained elsewhere, for the purposes of fermentation, and that this paragraph would prevent its introduction into a distillery. not speakingof vignerons. MrV . L. SOLOMON I think the objection refers to both. distilling. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Nevertheless , tlie clause wants some alteration. again, in clause 39 it is stipulated thatNo entry authorizing theremoval of spirits shall be passed in respect of spirits of a lower strength than 25 per, centum under proof, nor in respect of a smaller quantity bhan 10 gallons. It is not in regard to bhe quantity that bhe provision is awkward; but. it is pointed out by those who are best able to. know whabis required-and honorabiemembers will undersband that I am putting forward the objections of those gentlemen--that there ought to be an exemption in regard to sweetened gin. Theneis. an exemption in The the Stabe Acts, because the sweetening itself pcevemts. the determination of the strength by hydrometer. This -sweetened gin issometimes much lower than 25 per cenb. under proof, and,no doubt; the Minister if he looks at, the State Acts w ill find that it is necessary to make analteration in this, particular clause. Coming to. clause 41, I would point out that it provides for entries being made for bhe removal of spirits for three purposes, namely-hom e consumption, removal to a warehouse, and exportation. It is suggested that three additional paragraphs premises which is should be inserted,, providing, firstly for the removal of spirits for the purpose of fortifying wines. bhe head of ""home consumption."" Mi'. V . L . SOLOMON -There is no definition of "" hom.e consumption,"" and in tlie ordinary acceptation, of the term the removal of spirits for home consumption means that the full duty has to be paid, and bhe spirits immediately pass into the ordinary trade channels. The removal of spirits from the bonded store on the premises of the distiller for home consumption, I bake it, means that the fullest duty chargeable will have to be paid, bub under the existing State Acts a much lowerduty is chargeable upon spirits removed for the purpose of fortifyin g wines. They are taken from the bonded warehouse into another warehouse and mixed with the wines that are to be fortified, the whole process being conducted within the sight and under the control of tlie Customs officer in charge. Still less duty is paid on spirits which are of such an inferior characber as only to be useful for It only refers to grain the purposes of methylation-that is, spirits bhat are absolutely destroyed as far as their value for human consumption is conThen cerned. Then, again,'a certain quantity of spirits is sometimes used in distilleries and wineries for the manufacture of vinegar, and the removal of such spirits is allowed under the State Actsat a very much lower rate of duty. All these removals for the purposes I have mentioned are carried on under the eye of the Customs officer, and I propose to add three new paragraphs, (d), (e), and ( / ) , covering the removal of spirits for the purposes I have indicated. I am sure there is nothing unreasonable inthese suggestions. If the Minister thinks they are not required, hV would be well, I think, to",52,Distillati On Bill Second Heading

Thei Minister must admit that it is necessary to clear spirits £uom> distilleries and wineries for the purposes mentioned, and. it is desirable that every facility should be ottered. Clause 49 pro*vides that certaincomputations shall be made of the spirit which should have been produced in a distillery under ordinary circumstances, and that if the actual quantity of spirits and feints produced during the month is less in proof gallons than the quantity computed by the officer, the officer shall serve ivpon the distiller an account showing the deficiency, and the distiller shall, at once pay duty on such deficiency. That, is a very drastic provision, and although it is no doubt necessary to some extent, those whoaife interested in the business say that some reasonable distcretion should be given to the collector. It is, therefore, proposed to add the words "" unless tlie distiller can explain the reason of the deficiency to the satisfaction of the collector."" That seems to be a perfectly reasonable provision. In clause 53 it is provided that no vigneron's still shall be used for distilling from any material other than wine or lees of; wine, and that spirits made by vignerons can be used only for the purpose of fortifying Australian wines. Having paid for a licence the vigneron will be confined to' tlie use of his spirits for the ""fortification of his own wines, and he will be absolutely debarred from using spirits for the manufacture of vinegar, a branch of trade that is largely followed by some wine-makers at the present time. In clause 54 it will be. necessary to add words which will permit of the use of spirits for the manufacture of vinegar as well as for the fortification . of wine. I am sure bhat if bhe Minister inquires closely he will are of a reasonable character, and that the provisions which are suggested have been found useful in the various States of the Commonwealth for many years. In clause 57 I have an amendment bo suggesb. It is provided that no spirits shall be used for fortifying.wines unless they aceof bhe strength, of ab least 5.0degress -ahoyeproof, and the duty, if any, has been paid. It is pointed out that in many instances where it becomes necessary to fortifythe finer classes, of port wime;it is tbe practice to use fine old brandy which is very little a-bo-we proof, the crude spirit of 3D or 50 degrees above proof which is used for fortifying, the morecommon Australian wines, being, altogether too crude and rough for the more delicate wines. I do not think there can beany objection to an amendment of the clause which will permit of this practice still being, followed. My only desire is to. assist the-Gewernment in making this B ill a thoroughly workable measure which whilst proibectingito the fullest extent bhe revenues of the Commonwealth will in no way hamperthose who are engaged in an, industry of great importance to the welfare of the Commonwealth. miucli more importance than it appears to be on its face, because it deals<with some of the leading, industries, in Australia,-industrie s which we look to to conduce largely to the prosperity of this great continent, industries that we have been endeavouring to foster at veiry great expense for very many years pasb. It is not a machinery Bill. It is veiy far indeed, from being a machinery Bill, and I hope the Housewi l l not treat it as such, but will treat it as a measure dealing, vitally with vary great interests in .bhis and tlie other States. The Ministeri n introducing the Bil l only occupied Some ten or twelve minutes, and he told the Housei t was a measure dealing only with the regulation of the distilling industry. But the B i ll is more than that, as I have said, and as I will show direcbly. I must compliment the Minisber on bhe structure and phraseology of the Bill. Like obher measures he has favoured us with, it is easily understood. The phrases are short, and we shall be very glad, indeed, if all the legislation of the Goweratment is framed on similar lines. ButT think the Minister ought to have told the into these, matters House of the very great changes which this find that all these requests Bill wffi!bring<about in the particular industries .with which it deals. It will bring about very great and serious changes very much to the. detriment of many of the-people engaged in these industries,, and therefore it is a Bill which I think ought to be thoroughly",53,Distillati On Bill Second Heading

It ought not to be breabed as solely a technical Bill, but should go far beyond that, and be so framed that it will conduce not only to bhe advancemenb of bhe industries which it affects, bub also give to the people, in the productions that will be fosbered under ib, somebhing which will nob hurb them, but will be good for them physically. toms officials have a greab aversion to dealing wibh anybhing in Customs Bills beyond the mere matter of revenue. I am only speaking of Customs officers generally ; and I had some experience in the matter in 1885. In 1S89-90 a select committee sat in Great Britain and inquired into the question of the liquor traffic; and through out the evidence then given there was the strongest disinclination on the part of Custom-house officials, whether chemists, revenue officers, or any one else connected with the department, to interfere with anything beyond the mere protection of the revenue. If we are going to confine this Bill to the protection of the revenue, we shall fall very far short of our duty. tunity here of conbrolling bhe liquor traffic at its source ; and that is where it ought to be controlled. If we want to change the character of a stream, we do not wait until it branches out and then deal with it, but we go right to the head, or as near to it as we can, and make the change bhere. In this Bill we are dealing with the very source of the liquor traffic of bhe counbry. We are nob dealing with imporbed liquor; the measure has nothing to do with that. in the Bill to conduce to the beresbs of bhe industiy secure to the people that what they take as liquor shall be wholesome and sweet, and not destroying. officials only look at the fiscal question, and simply want to protect the revenue; to moral and physiological considerations bhey pay uobthe slightesb regard. I am only speaking of my persona] experience. We musb not, of course, ignore the revenue of view, but must always keep it before us. opportunity of dealing with ' the question not only from that point of view, but also It is from bhe physiological and moral stand-point. The annual consumption of spirits in all It deals with Australia, according to Coghlan, is 3,181,430 and very considerably gallons, very little of which, I am sorry bo say, is locally made. The whole of the locally made spirits consumed in Australia . is 278,209 gallons, or only about one-eleventh of the whole consumption. I ' fancy these figures are not correct, because I knowI have not the later figures, although I have endeavoured to get them from the department-that in 1894 there were some 450,000 gallons made. I know very well that Cusin Victoria alone. I think, therefore, bhat -Coghloyn's figures as to locally made spirit are understated. The States are not all equal in regard to this matter. In New South Wales the consumption of local spirits was 6,428 gallons. that a good deal of the spirits are manufactured in Victoria. tion of local spirits was 18,923 gallons, and in Queensland 59,409 gallons, which was nearly all rum made from sugar and molasses. In South Australia the consumption was 23,141 gallons. It will therefore be seen that Victoria uses a much larger amount of local spirits than any of the other States. We have an opporI do not know that there are any distilleries in New South Wales, but there are one or two in Queensland, which simply use the local molasses or sugar for the manufacture of rum. There are a number of distilleries in South Australia, used principally in connection with the vineyards, but in Tasmania and Western Ausbralia, I bhink, bhere are no ' distilleries at all. In Victoria there are eighb distilleries, so it will be seen ""that the question affects Victoria at the present time very We have it in our power much more than it affects any of the other inSbates. Of course, in time to come, the and also to question will affect the obher States, when the industries get established there.. In 1894 there were made in Victoria 462,702 I know that Custom-house gallons of spirits, of which one distillery alone made 328,155 gallons. I cordially agree with the honourable member for South Australia,, Mr Solomon, when he points out that Australia is eminently suibed for growing wine. Not only is Ausbralia point suibed for growing wine, bub also for growing all bhese products from This Bill, however, gives us an which liquor is made, such as barley, and various other grains.

While I am not strongly in favour of the use of ardent spirits we know that ardent spirits are used. We cannot prevent them being used, and used in very large quantities, and it is our duty, lirst of all, to see that our people get a sound and pure article. That we can do under this Bill, and we should encourage our own productions as much as we possibly can. revenue that way. the Treasurer will get less revenue if we encourage our local production. We can put the excise at such a figure that the same amount of revenue will come in, with the difference that, instead of our people having dreadfully inferior stuff from foreign countries, they will be insured the pure and healthy product. Mr .FOWLISR -You do not mean to that Scotland sends bad whisky here. its best whisky, any way. We can exercise supervision over whab is produced here, and that is what we cannot do in regard to w'hat comes from outside. Here we can follow the process from the gathering of bhe grape or bhe grain, until it is burned out the finished article, and we can see that nothing deleterious or hurtful is used in the process. Amongst the main objections to the Bill is, first of all, that there is no provision whatever for pure liquor. Nothing in the Bill prescribes, so far as I can see, what the age of the liquor shall be, or what it shall be made from, and there is certainly nothing prohibiting deleterious or noxious materials being used in the manufacture. The next objection is that the Bill plays into the hands of thelarge distillers and vignerons with large inberesbs, and to a great exbenb crushes out the small men in both these branches of indusbry. Then, the Bill does not properly regulate or encourage local production. In regard to the first objection as to pure liquor it only requires honourable members to glance through the Bill to see that my statement is correct, and I need not say more on the point. fere with bhe smaller men ? by; but that the Bill does play inbo the hands of the' large men is shown in a good many of the provisions. Clause 57 provides 12 x that no spirits shall be used for fortifying wines unless they are at least 50 per cent, overproof. The strength at present is fixed at 25 per cent., and there are many stills in this State which cannot produce liquor 50 per cent, overproof. It is a well-known fact that the larger the still and tlie swifter the operation, the poorer the liquor-that the slower the process, and the smaller the still, the better and purer the liquor. Then the distilling licence has been raised from £ 1 0 up to £ 5 0 ; and it seems to me unfair that a distiller who is only turning out a few thousands of gallons per year should pay the same licence as one who is turning out 300,000 or 400,000 gallons. ected, and .we do not want liquor consumed at all if we can manage it, though tthe Treasurer does. particularly addressing myself at present is say that the Bil l plays into the hands of the larger men, and crushes out the smaller men. The 3rd schedule, paragraph 6, provides that the still shall be capable of exhausting at least 150 gallons of wash per hour. There are many stills-indeed , I think the great bulk of the stills in this State-whic h cannot exhaust that amount, and if that be the case, distilling operations must be left to one or two of the large distillers. We should not aim at playing into the hands of bhe big men. In addition' to that, I would point out that the slower the distillation the better is the product which is obtained. was shown in the evidence given before the select committee in England, and it is shown by the various books which I have read .upon tlie subject.' These provisions will mean the absolute remodelling almost of the premises of distilleries in this State at the present time. Paragraph 44 of schedule 3 provides that vats shall be of at least 500 gallons in capacity. A t the present time there is no limit regarding bhe capaciby of vats. Some of these have a capacity of only 150 gallons. Many of the smaller distilleries would, under the operation of this Bill, have to clear out their vats and replace them by larger ones for which their buildings are unsuited. The same schedule also provides that a vigneron's still shall be capable of putting through 50 gallons per hour. The present limit is 25-",55,Distillati On Bill Second Heading

281,Mr Mccoll,"It is an absolute fact. I tgallons an hour. This provision, therefore, strikes at the small vigneron. Clause 25 is a very arbitrary one, which virtually provides for confiscation. As I have already pointed out, some of the provisions cannot apply to our present distilleries. volve the remodelling of the premises in some cases, and the pulling down and rebuilding of them in others. saysNothing in this Act shall prohibit a licence from being issued in respect of any still or premises lawfully in use for distilling at the commencement of this Act. It would appeal', therefore, as if the distilleries now in existence were to be'allowed to carry on their business. But clause 25 providesWhen any premises or plant in respect of which any licence to distill is in force under any State Act at the commencement of this Act, are not in accordance with the prescribed conditions, the collector may fix a time, not less .than three months, witliin which the distiller must comply with such prescribed conditions. This provision shows clearly that the intention of the framers of the Bill is to abolish the smaller distilleries and to play into the hands of the larger men. Clause 26 readsIf the prescribed conditions are not complied with within the time specified by the collector, the licence may be cancelled by the Minister by Gazette notice. Thus a man's livelihood is to be taken right away from him. I think I have shown from ihe few extracts which' I have made that the Bill helps the large man and assists to crush the small man. Eurther, it utterly fails to grasp the requirements vignerons. vignerons is that they are allowed to have fortifying wine the product of their own vineyards. ten acres under vine cultivation before they are allowed to have this still. There is also a £10 licence granted which is taken up by the*, larger vineyard owners who are supposed to distill the. products of their own vineyards only, but who have been allowed through lax supervision not only to distill the product of their own vineyards and to sell it, but to buy largely from their smaller neighbours, turn the material into spirit, and also trade upon that. which are issued in Victoria only six or eight are £10 licences. licences. In this State alone there are over '25;000 growers of grapes. There are therefore only 50 of these who have licences to distill. Consequently by far the larger number who cannot afford -to pay 'for a still are in the hands of the bigger vineyard They will inowners. If their .grapes are not fit for market, or if their wine is not fermenting properly, the small vignerons simply have Clause 24 to sell their grapes to the larger owners for whatever they can get for them. These smaller people nave not a chance to get a riving. The provision that a still shall not be of less than 200 gallons capacity, and that they shall be compelled to put through 50 gallons an hour will press very severely upon them. In Victoria there are 22,500 acres under vine cultivation, and 3.2,900 acres iri the remainder of the States. It is absolutely necessary that in treating many of these vines fortification shall be indulged in. Two opinions are held upon'this point. Some hold that the wines do .not require fortifying. But there is an immense difference between the wines which are grown in Victoria north of the Dividing Range and those .grown south of it. South of the Dividing Range the wine grown is of a much lighter character and .requires no iortifying at all. I have sometimes been amused to see how ardently the growers south of the Dividing Range protest against any fortifying being indulged in at all. North of the Dividing Rangei t is necessary that fortification shall be resorted to in order that the wines may be preserved. of the 32 per cent. quire a strong wine, not only to suit the a still for £5 a year for palates of the people, but to insure its being kept in good condition during its transit They are also required to have from Australia.

I learn from the newspapers published in Perth that a considerable amount of excitement has been engendered amongst the industrial classes there by the discovery that Hindoos are being employed in some of the tailoring establishments in that city. This is a subject of some importance in view of the fact that we, are about to seriously consider the desirability of prohibiting these people from entering the. Commonwealth at all. The fact that they are now to be found in the tailoring industry gives a great deal of point to the contention that if immediate steps are not taken to prevent undesirable immigration, we shall find in the near future all manner of industrial enterprises overrun by these people.

In view of these facts, should nbt engaged in the manufactureof clothing for the Government ascertain whether^ any a Government department. one who knows the insanitary condition I taken by the late Sir Henry Parkes, prevent 12 x 3 under which these people live, will agree with me that the unfortunate individuals who are compelled to wear uniforms manufactured in such .quarters are very much to be commiserated indeed. I hope this little incident will arouse the Government to the necessity of adopting the most stringent sbeps possible bo obviate 'the danger there is to Australia in connection with people of this race. ' matter brought forward by the honourable member for Perth deserves the attention of the Government. W it h reference to the interjection inade by the Minister of Defence-on e time Premier of WesternAustralia,-to the effect that these peoplecannot come into Western Australia now, I think it is about time for -him to quarrel with the Government statistician of that State, for that officer says that in the first three months of bhe present year some 89 Malays came into Western Australia.

The increase in the number of these immigrants is a sufficient menace to the State to justify action of a decided character on the part of the Government. Jfc seems to me that advantage is being taken of the present state of the law to cram -as many of these classes as possible into those only object in rising is bo assure honourable States, where, I believe, there is no prohibition against the introduction of Afghans, -with a view to their subsequent distribution jierhaps over, the more northern States, where they may find more congenial work in <camel driving. The Government should -consider whether it is not advisable to take steps to prevent any large bodies of these people from landing. Surely in view of the fact that a number were landed a little -while ago, and that 51 were landed in Melbourne to-day, the matter is one of sufficient importance to be taken up at once. .1 should like to support the remarks which have been made on this point by drawing attention to a communication which I have received with regard to the number of Assyrians employed in onion culture in the western district. They are engaged there i u large numbers. They receive about 5s. A week, keep themselves, and live in a kind of a mia-mia. These are statements which are sufficiently alarming, and only add to the urgent necessity for restricting immigration -of this class. The letter which I have re-ceived is more or less authentic, and I think it ought to be inquired into. The Government should hurry on some measure which will stop . this practice. It will be impossible vety soon to gain that which we all desire, ""a .white Australia,"" if these j»eople are allowed to be landed indiscriminately as at'present. has appeared in the press, and what has been said in the House, there can be no doubt that tlie necessity for hastening restrictive legislation in regard to this matter IK being emphasized. I have in my possession -a letter from Mount Garnet complaining of tlie invasion of that district by Afghans under contract to carry copper to the nearest railway station. They have displaced a number of teamsters the bone valid sinew of bhe north-wh o have wives and families to support These coloured people have been baken there simply to benefit a soulless corporation. The people who have engaged them are making a little profit out of them to the detriment of the whole of the north, and to the speci.il detriment of the men they have displaced. This is a matter which is crying out for the attention of this Parliament, and I hope action will be taken at once. members, that since 1897-when the I m migration Restriction Act was passed-ther e has been no introduction of coloured persons into ""Western Australia, so far as the southern portionsof bhat Sbabe are concerned, conbrary to the provisions of that statute. There is a large pearl fishery on the north-west coast, and under the provisions of the law'the Malays engaged in pearling there are allowed bo land at Broome during the off season. A stricb account is kept of them; they are not permitted to go into the country, but are re-embarked after spending a short time on shore. I have not heard of any instance in which these people have gone into the country. It may be that the census has taken.into account a number of these Malays while they were on shore for a short time. Very much against my wish coloured labour is allowed, to go to the Abrolhos Islands, off the coast of Western Australia, to work the guano deposits that exist there, and it may be that these coloured labourers have been included in the census returns. I say, without any fear of contradiction, that the A ct has been carried out faithfully, and that there is no place in Australia where greater care has been taken to. shut out coloured labour. Western Australia was the first State to pass restrictive legislation. Care is not only taken there to keep them out, .but to see that those to whom passports are issued do not sell them. Some people may ask why passports are issued, but I would point out' that if they were not given the men would not go away, and that when they receive them there is a possibility of their not coming back.
