312,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (4.58 Pm),"Thursday, 4 September 2008 ----Swan Electorate: Schools Funding in my electorate by the Carpenter government in Western Australia over the last two parliaments. In particular, I want to give examples of the poor maintenance and funding provided by the Carpenter government to two schools in the north of my electorate. The area concerned is covered by the state electorate of Belmont, which happens to be the seat held by the Deputy Premier and Treasurer of WA, Mr Eric Ripper. We have had announcements from Mr Ripper advising that he has given a state grant to the Belmay Primary School. How much would you expect for a school maintenance program? How does $200,000 sound? Not bad. But the Carpenter government has rolled out the pork-barrel and announced funding of $1 million. As much as I welcome the funding of any educational institution, this reeks of vote buying. When the Principal of Belmay Primary School, Mr Chris Leed, was questioned by the local paper, he stated that the announcement was unexpected and the school had been in need of repairs for some time. Would it be mischievous of me to say that the repairs had been required for four years or more? Of course it would, but I dare say it is probably true. Have the Carpenter government sat on previous budget surpluses to roll them out now as vote-buying slush funds? Of course they have. People in my electorate should be angry that the Carpenter government have treated them with contempt. This is blatant electioneering and pork-barrelling by the Labor Party, who earlier this year in this same room had the cheek to accuse me of pork-barrelling during the 2007 federal election. Just because I tried to get a $90,000 grant for the bowling club in my electorate, the members on the other side interjected with calls of pork-barrelling. The Labor Party have proven they are a party of hypocrisy. I have received phone calls at my office from the people at Redcliffe Primary School, which is just down the road from Belmay Primary School. Redcliffe School is in need of the same repairs and infrastructure being provided to Belmay Primary School in a vote-buying grab. Redcliffe Primary School is older than Belmay Primary School and it is in its centenary year. I congratulate this place of education, which has provided 100 years of service and education to the community. The school needs repairs to its roof, the gutters need replacing and the verandas are in a disgraceful condition. But the Carpenter government ignore the school’s needs because it does not suit them and their re-election plan. Redcliffe Primary School has been trying to get funding for nearly three years but it has not received any funding at all. It suits the government to ignore it. Redcliffe Primary School is in its centenary year and it has been overlooked for purely political reasons. The students are expected to learn and be educated in these substandard conditions. The WA government are showing signs of desperation. They are spending money and porkbarrelling with huge amounts from a war chest of surpluses that actually belong to the taxpayers. The WA government are a disgrace for having sat on this money for so many years.

314,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.30 Am),"TodayI rise to speak about the poor treatment of schoolsof the treatment the government have meted out for the last eight years and to toss them out at the WA state election on 6 September 2008. Lowe Electorate: Meals on Wheels Volunteers wish to pay tribute to the work of volunteers, in particular those who work for Meals on Wheels. Last Wednesday was National Meals on Wheels Day. Meals on Wheels was established 55 years ago, offering meals to about eight people. Today that service has grown to provide meals to roughly 50,000 people a day. To provide so many meals to the elderly, frail and disabled, Meals on Wheels carries out this important service with the help of 80,000 volunteers and workers. It is important to acknowledge and pay tribute to the volunteers, who offer not only their time but their care and friendship. I am proud to acknowledge one particular couple in my electorate of Lowe who were each awarded a Commonwealth Community Service Award in April this year. Mr Noel and Mrs Catherine Richardson, from Croydon Park, have given more than 50 years combined voluntary service to the local community. The Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Justine Elliot, presented them with the national award for their tremendous community service particularly to the aged. To date, Catherine Richardson has been involved in Meals on Wheels for over 25 years. Her husband, Noel, has been her driver for the last six years, while continuing his charity work with St Vincent de Paul, of which he has been a member for some 40 years. All the while, Mr and Mrs Richardson raised five children. It is wonderful to see commendable citizens such as Mr and Mrs Richardson receiving recognition for the unpaid work they carry out in my electorate of Lowe. Their selfless hard work, like that of thousands of volunteers around Australia, has immeasurable benefits for our community and society at large. The Rudd government also recognises the vital role and the positive contribution that volunteers make to our society and the difficulties recently experienced by voluntary based groups with rising fuel costs. That is why the government has committed funding of an additional $15 million over the next three years to the Volunteers Grants Program to assist community organisations such as Meals on Wheels and their volunteers to pay their fuel bills. Many people go without recognition for their hard work and most do not expect any. However, on this occasion the quiet, unpaid work of those around us is much appreciated and should be acknowledged by those receiving the assistance, and I would like to show that appreciation here today. I call on those living in my electorate to nominate someone they know and who they feel deserves public recognition. I look forward to meeting and awarding more citizens for their fantastic efforts. I again commend the work of my constituents Mr and Mrs Richardson for a job well done. I thank them for their efforts and ask that each and every one of us consider what we might give back to our community. to welcome Colonel Theo Tawiah, the Marshal of the Parliament of Ghana to the Main Committee.

316,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"BeforeI call the next member, I would likeTangney Electorate: Schools Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.36 am)-I was stunned by the Prime Minister’s talk last week of what he laughingly called a ‘revolution’ in education, given that the ALP is closing schools in my electorate without having regard to students’ interests. While the Prime Minister was crying crocodile tears over the fate of the nation’s young, the students at Bannister Creek Primary School in Ferndale were shedding real tears as they prepared to be dragged to a new site by an uncaring Labor regime. Until recently, there were three primary schools in the neighbourhood. But now there is just one and it is slated to be closed next year with the opening of a new so-called superschool. Students from Lynwood and Kinlock primary schools were transferred to Bannister Creek, which was formerly Ferndale Primary School. A new school was pledged for the Lynwood site, scheduled to open in 2009, although construction has not yet begun. The Prime Minister’s talk of an education revolution reeks of hypocrisy given that his government are standing by while their cronies in power in Western Australia close down schools that are deemed unviable. It is all very well to talk about economies of scale, but at what cost to the welfare of our children? I am happy that the Prime Minister has apparently gone back to school; after all, his government obviously need to get some help with their sums. But he is really giving to education with one hand while his acolytes are taking with two. There are certainly some lessons here for the rest of us. We are learning just how unreliable Labor is on education. Schools in my electorate are now suffering from both state and federal Labor governments. We have a shortage of teachers, we have the laptop debacle-which demonstrates that Labor does at least know how to divide by two-and we have closures which threaten to destroy school communities. Is that what the Prime Minister means with his talk of a new era in education? The Ferndale students, in their most tender years, face being uprooted from their happy school community and being forced to run a daily gauntlet of traffic on an arterial road for no other reason than the fleeting whim of a heartless administration. I found it ironic that the member for Swan also talked of schools. We were discussing a little earlier the fact that schools are such a major issue concerning both state and federal governments. I call on the state government to clean up this mess. Newcastle Electorate Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.39 am)-Like all cities, the city I represent, Newcastle, is indeed a unique place. But, interestingly, our demographics reveal that we are quite reflective of the typical Australian communities where typical Australian families live and work. The last census revealed that average weekly earnings in the Hunter region were $836 a week, just below the New South Wales average. Almost 15,000 households in the Newcastle electorate were purchasing their dwelling, with a median monthly home loan repayment of $1,343. Those 15,000 householders in my electorate are among the millions of Australian households who are relieved that the Reserve Bank has announced a 0.25 per cent cut in the official interest rate, the first cut for seven years. This very welcome cut will put about $42 a month back into the pockets of average mortgage holders. The Treasurer’s determination to enlist the goodwill of the banks to pass on the rate cut in full has been quickly responded to, with most, including the Newcastle Permanent Building Society, Hunter United Employees Credit Union MAIN COMMITTEE and the Greater Building Society, expected to reduce mortgage rates within the month. Newcastle families deserve this rate cut and rightly expect their banks to pass it on to them promptly and in full. I congratulate our local banking institutions for doing so. Inflationary pressures have meant that many families in Newcastle and beyond are struggling to keep up with the cost of essentials like groceries, petrol, education and utilities. Ten interest rate rises in a row under the previous government have added around $400 a month to the typical mortgage and have meant that family budgets have been squeezed to breaking point. The stress on households has been reflected in the number of writs of possession issued in our region-about 24 a month, or almost one a day, over the two years to February 2008. As reported in the Newcastle Herald this week, fortunately not all of those writs are executed, but it remains a personal tragedy when even one family loses their home. Being able to access financial counselling and legal advice when mortgage stress starts to overwhelm certainly remains imperative, but the most important thing our government can do for mortgage holders is to keep a check on inflation through responsible economic management. Having inherited underlying inflation running at a 16-year high of 3.6 per cent, the Rudd government has done this by producing a budget that got government spending back under control after the blowouts of the previous government. Our budget produced a $22 billion surplus as a buffer against global economic instability and to provide for a productive future. By investing in the infrastructure that we need to free up our roads, rail and ports and by investing in a skilled workforce and an education revolution, we will continue to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates while keeping the economy strong and growing. But we can only do this if the opposition passes our budget, and I urge them to do so promptly. Petition: Telecommunications regarding the lack of mobile phone coverage at Walker Flat, a thriving community on the Murray River. Just about every adult who lives in Walker Flat has signed this petition. To put that in perspective, that would be like getting four million signatures in Sydney. That is how important this is to the local people in Walker Flat. Mobile phone coverage along this stretch of the Murray River between the towns of Punyeroo and Bowhill is poor, with residents, businesses and holiday-makers unable to make or receive any mobile phone calls whilst in this vicinity. Houses, businesses and houseboats have no communication along this stretch of the river other than through landlines. I point out that when you are on a boat it is a bit hard to have a landline. This lack of mobile phone coverage requires residents to walk to the tops of hills in the area to try to gain mobile phone reception. In Australia the use of mobile phone technology has grown significantly during the past five years, and more Australians have become increasingly reliant on this technology; in fact, many people use mobile phones as their sole means of communication. Mobile phone reception is essential in communities such as Walker Flat, and I call on the government to rectify this major communication failure. Labor are up to their tricks again. When I first came into this parliament nearly 10 years ago, Labor had already arranged to get rid of the old analog coverage, which was pretty important for rural areas.

317,Mr Secker (Barker) (9.42 Am),"I present to the House a petition with 489 signatureswith CDMA coverage, which it did very well. Unfortunately, six months after this the Rudd Labor government have turned off the CDMA network, which was very important for rural areas, and we still do not have satisfactory mobile phone coverage in large areas of rural Australia. We always made the point when we were in government that we would not allow the CDMA coverage to be turned off until we had coverage at least as good as the old CDMA network. There is no doubt that this government is failing in rural areas, and I call on this government to fix up this problem. It is with great pleasure that I present the petition. The petition read as followsThis petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that mobile phone coverage along a stretch of the River Murray at Walker Flat, South Australia between the towns of Punyeroo and Bow Hill is incredibly poor with residents, businesses and holiday makers alike unable to make or receive any mobile phone calls while in this vicinity. Houses, business and house boats have no communication along this stretch of river except for landlines. Those who do not have landlines in this area have to walk to the tops of the hills in the area to try and get mobile phone reception. In Australia the use of mobile phone technology has grown significantly during the past five years and more Australians are becoming increasingly more reliant on using mobile phones. Therefore, good mobile phone coverage is essential in Walker Flat, especially if an emergency phone call needs to be made. We therefore ask the House to support and encourage the Federal Government to ensure that the problem of poor mobile phone coverage at Walker Flat is rectified. from 489 citizens. Petition received. Gorton Electorate: Vocational Education and Training am)-A few weeks ago, on a large vacant block in an industrial estate in my electorate, I had the great pleasure of meeting Mr Kevin Kennedy, the General Manager of Gippsland Group Training-Apprentices Victoria, who, I am sure, is well known to the member for McMillan, and a number of his senior managers. GGT-AV are one of Australia’s largest and most experienced group training organisations. They have been employing, training and supporting young people in apprenticeships, especially in the traditional trades, for more than 25 years. In JulyI received the news that they had been successful in receiving $2 million in funding under the National Training Infrastructure Program towards establishing a new multitrade industry centre in Derrimut, in my electorate of Gorton. The industry centre is scheduled to open in 2010 and will cater for 720 apprentices in automotive, electrical, plumbing and building construction trades, with 450 of these apprentices being directly employed and placed by GGT-AV, a very good learning institution, as the member for McMillan would know. That is why I went to Mr Kennedy: to congratulate him and his team, and to inspect the site at first hand. I cannot overstate the significance of this announcement to my electorate and to neighbouring electorates in Melbourne’s west. Melbourne’s western suburbs suffer higher than average rates of youth unemployment. At the same time industry is crying out for skilled labour. At the moment many of the young people in my electorate who take up apprenticeships must travel up to two hours, each way, to the other side of town if they wish to participate in this particular type of training.

McMillan Electorate: Environment to see in this place a minister caring about his community-I know that love of a geographic area. I grew up near Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp, with Yallock Creek and its surrounds as my playground. I know of that love, when you have tilled the soil and worked the fields as a teenager and when you have run your business in your community, with your lifestyle tied to the total amenity of your family and all the surrounds of that geographic area of Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp. Now all the way across that area the Victorian Labor government is going to put some powerlines, right across the beautiful amenity of the area. At this time. I hold in my hand a press release from that same government lauding itself for undergrounding powerlines in urban areas. Consider the contradiction and the hypocrisy of the document that I hold in my right hand. It talks about the work that it is doing to improve the amenity of the area whilst at the same time it is going to build a coast-destroying desalination plant on the coast at Wonthaggi, in my electorate. Worse than that, it is going to cruel the amenity of so many lovers of West Gippsland, people who have run their farms, built their businesses and invested in that area for the future of themselves and their children. It is going to run these abhorrent powerlines right across Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp, to go from Wonthaggi all the way to Tynong. Why do I care so much? It is because I have been around this country by road and, while I have seen the beauty of what is New England, the beauty of what is Queensland and the beauty of what is central New South Wales, I have still come back to the beauty of the area that I grew up in, an area for which anyone would have a natural and immediate love. So when you see something like this happening to it, you know that you are not going to be handing that beauty on to the next generation. As for powerlines in particular, I have to tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I have powerlines running right through my property. They were there when I bought the property and they are still there today. They are the main powerlines from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne-but that does not mean that we go ahead and do not underground. The Rudd Labor government committed to this desalination plant during the election campaign. AllI am asking for is this: if, as a government, you have committed to something, you have to have regard for the amenity of the area and the individuals affected. That is a responsibility of government; it is a responsibility of individual members as well. That protection has to come in now, and the government should be undergrounding those power lines if they want this project to go ahead. It will double the price, but isn’t it worth it for the amenity of those people affected? Corangamite Electorate: Alcohol Abuse sue of alcohol and binge drinking, particularly among young people.

We have had some terrible incidents in Geelong involving binge drinking and a very recent incident where young partygoers, fuelled by alcohol, pelted police with bottles and debris. We have had people bashed to within an inch of their lives due to binge drinking. We have had knifings; we have had young women brutally raped. Every night we have young people arrested, babbling incoherently. Often drugs are involved, but almost always binge drinking is involved as well. Some local media in my region are running a very important campaign to educate young people and to get some action on this issue. Recently a very good piece was written in the Geelong Advertiser by Danny Lannen. Danny put the issue more succinctly than I could. I propose to read a part of his piece out for the benefit of members. It is a piece that deserves to be put on the record in this place.

Joining us as event patrons were local and National Rugby League legend Jason Stevens and former ironwoman, schoolteacher and President of the Wanda Surf Life Saving Club, Anita Pryke. We were also pleased and honoured to have local Gweagal elder Merv Ryan to provide a welcome to country and join us throughout the day. The summit was attended by some 50 young shire residents aged between 16 and 24 from all walks of life and backgrounds.

321,Mr Morrison (Cook) (9.53 Am),"I am pleased to report to the House on the Shirethat, while young people expect governments to do their job, they strongly believe the challenge to create a better society does not begin and end with governments. I was encouraged by the importance our younger generation placed on community and the need to take a proactive role to provide a positive future and confront problems in our society. With the proliferation of technology, where it is easier to text someone than talk to them, there was a strong sense of the need to get back to basics with our relationships and take a greater personal interest in the welfare of others, especially locally. The summit expressed more specifically a clear desire to create and foster a stronger community among young people in the shire and also between generations. Keenly aware of the impact that economic stress and family breakdown was having on their own generation, delegates also highlighted the need to ensure that young Australians were being taught the life skills for today’s modern world. This included more instruction on managing personal finances, how to have successful personal relationships and generally handling the stresses of modern life. Delegates also spoke of their willingness to get involved in local community organisations, whether it was sports clubs, lifesaving, bush care groups or our Rural Fire Service. However, they expressed a need to do it in a way that was relevant to their generation. With the average age of volunteers in the 60s, this is a challenge that will require new thinking from our volunteer organisations, supported by governments, on how they recruit and retain younger volunteers. They also recognised the corrosive effect that negative attitudes and behaviour have on society and how these attitudes manifest themselves through binge drinking, substance abuse, violence and other antisocial activity. Delegates said the challenge was to proactively provide an alternative to these harmful cultures and they are looking for assistance to do just that. They also want more chances for young people in the shire to get together and relate to one another in a more positive and inclusive environment. There was recognition of the need for global action to address climate change but, more significantly, there was a strong commitment for all of us to take steps to ensure we look after our own local environment-our beaches, parks and waterways. It was a privilege to spend the day with them. Their ideas are summarised on the event’s website, www.shire2020.com.au. I particularly wish to thank Kevin Ryan from Waterbrook as well as my youth liaison officer, Matt Versi, who, together with Britany Kenaly from the office of the member for Hughes, organised and brought the event together. (Time expired) Dental Health stituents in Hindmarsh on the need for a Commonwealth Dental Health Program in this nation. It is a big need, and especially in my electorate of Hindmarsh, which has many elderly people-in fact, it has one of the oldest constituencies in the country. This Rudd Labor government was elected on a platform that included the reintroduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. However, dental care for pensioners risks being stalled by the opposition as they continue to block funding for the government’s program. Currently, in South Australia the average waiting time for dental care restorative services is estimated at 18 months, for dentures 39 months and for specialist dental care 33 months. This MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Constituency Statements
322,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.56 Am),"I rise today to speak on behalf of my connumber is down from 49 months in 2001, after the Rann Labor government poured quite a significant amount of money into the program. After the Howard government abolished the Commonwealth dental program in 1996 as one of their first acts in government, South Australians were waiting an average of four years to see a dentist. As I said, the South Australian government has worked very hard to decrease the waiting times. However, we know more needs to be done. There are currently approximately 30,000 people on waiting lists in South Australia, many of whom are in my electorate and are pensioners. We have heard horror stories of some pensioners resorting to pulling out their own teeth to stop the pain while languishing on these public dental waiting lists. The opposition can currently give these pensioners immediate relief if they choose to pass this important measure in the Senate. They would be able to assist pensioners immediately, but by blocking funding for this program they are only doing harm to these people and making them wait longer. Pensioners across South Australia, and particularly in my electorate, deserve to receive the dental care they need and not have games being played in the Senate by the opposition purely for politicking. Australia-wide there are 650,000 people waiting for public dental care, and the average waiting list Australia-wide in 2007 was 27 months. The opposition is threatening to stop $290 million from reaching public dental services to help reduce these dental waiting lists. This will only be to the detriment of the Australian public and many, many pensioners. The opposition is jeopardising the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, leaving pensioners out in the cold. This is obscene, but it is not uncommon amongst the opposition. As I said earlier, one of the first acts of the Howard government was the initial cessation of the program in 1996. SoI urge the opposition to pass these very important measures as soon as possible in order to allow pensioners, many of them in my electorate of Hindmarsh, the dental treatment that they require. Under the new Commonwealth dental program, pensioners will receive up to a million treatments, which will provide immediate relief for those 650,000 people.

Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. It is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation that has the full support of the opposition. The legislation gives effect in law to a new tax treaty with Japan. The new tax treaty, which updates an older treaty, was negotiated and the detail was concluded by the coalition government before the change of government in November last year. BeforeI go into the substance of the bill, I just want to make a few comments about the importance of our relationship with Japan. I think it is important for members in this place to remember that Japan is one of our most important allies. It is, of course, our largest trading partner, although in many ways now you hear so much more about China. I am not trying to set up Japan in opposition to China or anything like that, because China remains terribly imMAIN COMMITTEE",136,Constituency Statements

324,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (9.59 Am),"I rise to speak on the International Tax Agreementsportant for Australia’s future, but it should be noted that Japan is our largest trading partner. In Western Australia it was actually the Japanese demand for resources that resulted in the opening up of the Pilbara. Those great economic advances in Western Australia were something that Sir Charles Court pursued very readily in his time as a minister and Premier. He established excellent relationships with Japanese political figures and business figures that opened up the north-west of Western Australia. That Japanese influence is extremely important for the whole of the Australian economy. Moves to improve our economic relationship, such as this bill which updates a tax treaty, are very important for Australia’s national interest and they have the full support of the opposition. This bill amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to incorporate into Australian law the Convention between Australia and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income. This convention replaces the Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income that was signed in Canberra on 20 March 1969. This was obviously at a time when the AustraliaJapan relationship, while strong, was not as strong as it is today and it makes sense that this treaty be updated to take into account changes in our respective laws. This new treaty was agreed in principle on 3 August 2007 between the then Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, and the Japanese finance minister, Koji Omi-and I apologise if that is not a particularly good pronunciation. The convention is based on the OECD model tax convention and is generally consistent with other tax treaties that have been concluded by Australia, including treaties we have with the United States and other important trading partners. The previous treaty no longer reflected the developments in the economic relationship between Australia and Japan, and those developments of course are numerous and vitally important to Australia’s interests. So in recognition of this the coalition government undertook a series of negotiations in 2007 to comprehensively revise the previous convention. The commencement of negotiations by the coalition government illustrates our commitment to encouraging foreign investment and encouraging opportunities for Australian businesses in overseas markets. Australia and Japan share a mutual understanding. I have had the opportunity to visit Japan on a number of occasions in a personal capacity and an official capacity. We are both market based liberal democracies. Our countries have a very long standing relationship. In Japan there is a very strong recognition of the importance of Australia to their economic well-being, which is obviously reflected in Australia. Since 1969 when the original treaty was concluded, Japan has been Australia’s largest export market. I think that is very important. Japan remains Australia’s largest trading partner. Japan is also Australia’s third largest source of foreign investment, and that foreign investment has been crucial, as I outlined earlier, for the resources, tourism and manufacturing sectors. Japanese investment, as I said, was vital in opening up those northern parts of Western Australia. I am optimistic that the agreement on this convention will encourage ongoing negotiations towards a free trade agreement with Japan. This has been something that has been on the agenda for many years. Negotiations, I think it is fair to say, have been patchy. I think initially there was probably more enthusiasm for this treaty in Australia than might have been met MAIN COMMITTEE with by our Japanese counterparts, but I detect that the mood is rapidly changing. I think it is terribly important that we do conclude this free trade agreement once and for all with our largest trading partner. The convention updates the previous convention by providing for reduced rates of withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties; improved integrity measures; and new rules for real property which bring the capital gains tax treatment into line with that of the OECD. The convention has a number of key changes from the previous convention, such as: the inclusion of anti-treaty-shopping provisions in relation to withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties; the inclusion of a limitation on the benefits clause to ensure treaty benefits pass only to qualified persons; rules to prevent tax discrimination; specific provisions for the taxation of business profits from natural resource activities, building sites and the operation of substantial equipment; specific provisions relating to the taxation of income derived through business trusts; provisions preventing double exemption of income derived by temporary residence; and provisions that will encourage the cross-border movement of people, capital and technology between Australia and Japan. The convention also facilitates increased cooperation between the Australian and Japanese tax authorities to reduce fiscal evasion. The convention will encourage the growth of Australian and Japanese enterprises by making it easier to obtain intellectual property equity and finance. The convention will reduce complexity and compliance costs for Australian businesses and their Japanese counterparts. This convention will lead to real economic benefits for both our economies and will build on the strong relationship between Australia and Japan. I think this is a non-controversial bill, but it is a terribly important bill and it will enhance one of our most important relationships. I commend it very heartily to the House. I congratulate the previous Treasurer for concluding the detail of this particular treaty and I urge all members to support it. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. This bill will strengthen the strong ties Australia enjoys with Japan, and I take this opportunity to focus in this debate on the strength and the importance of this relationship. This century is the century of the Asia-Pacific. Our region will become more important to global growth and security than ever before. Paul Keating once warned that if you do not succeed in the Asia-Pacific you succeed nowhere. Our relationship with Japan is integral to Australia’s achieving success in the Asia-Pacific area. This bill is one of many steps this government is taking to ensure that. It is Australia’s second comprehensive tax treaty with Japan. It will modernise the tax relationship between the two countries and will serve to facilitate trade and investment between Australia and Japan. The relationship between Australia and Japan is forged on many levels. Firstly, the two nations share many similarities. We share common values. We are both great democracies. We both share very similar values also on the direction that East Asia should take, having agreed to work together to strengthen various regional forums, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC; the ASEAN Regional Forum, or ARF; and the East Asia Summit, or EAS. We share the common goal of promoting peace, security, prosperity, development and sustainability in the Asia-Pacific region. Perhaps the strongest relationship we enjoy is through economic ties.

325,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (10.07 Am),"I rise to support the International Tax Agreementsbara to the cattle stations in Rockhampton. This has formed the basis of the strong economic bond between Australia and Japan. Japan is our biggest export market and has been for the last 40 years, with $32.7 billion worth of goods last year. We are the third biggest importer of Japanese goods-$17.4 billion worth. Overall, there is a two-way trade of $54.5 billion. Japan is Australia’s largest export market for energy and the second largest export market for beef. We supply 87 per cent of Japan’s beef. The chances are that, if you are eating a steak in Japan, it will have come from one of our cattle farms in Rockhampton or in the Kimberley. This enduring economic cooperation was solidified over 50 years ago when the Commerce Treaty was signed in 1957. Since then, our economic ties have continued to strengthen, and this bill is evidence of that. This new tax treaty with Japan enhances the existing bilateral tax arrangements between Australia and Japan, creating incentives for increasing trade and investment between our two countries. Already, Japan is Australia’s third largest investor, with an investment stock of $51 billion as at the end of 2006. This bill serves to further increase that investment. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs for signing the treaty in February this year, and I congratulate the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs for introducing this bill into the parliament. Australia and Japan have stood side by side on two major challenges that the international community faces. Australia and Japan have fervently supported efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. There is a great onus on both countries to be champions of the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of global nuclear disarmament. Japan carries the burden of being the only state to have experienced the consequences of nuclear weapons. Australia carries the responsibility of being the country with the largest known uranium reserves. We both have a unique perspective on nuclear disarmament and we share a common view on the importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Australia and Japan have stood solidly side by side on this issue. The new global challenge of the 21st century is climate change. Climate change is the greatest moral, economic and environmental challenge of this century and, again, it is an area where Japan and Australia share many common views. The international community met over a decade ago in Kyoto with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases. It was an important first step towards a global emissions reduction regime. Like the Australian government, the government of Japan has acted decisively on climate change. In an address to the Japan National Press Club in June this year, former Prime Minister Fukuda said: We must squarely face the current state of the global environment and, instead of repeating empty calls, step up real action that will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Japan has already provided real action on this issue. It ratified the Kyoto protocol in June 2002. There is a history of our two countries working together on climate change. Australia is Japan’s main source of coal and provides Japan with a quarter of its energy needs. We have also have been working together on clean coal technology. The government has been working closely with Japanese car maker Toyota to start building hybrid versions of its Camry model at its factory in Victoria. In June this year, when the Prime Minister visited Japan, he announced a $35 million subsidy to Toyota. However, the partnership between Australia and Japan is not limited to economic, security and strategic ties. There MAIN COMMITTEE are also very strong personal ties. In a speech the Prime Minister gave at Kyoto University on a recent visit to Japan, he said: Our relationship is strong and our friendship is enduring. Already, under this government, seven cabinet ministers have visited Japan this year. The Prime Minister has visited on two occasions. Australians and Japanese share equally strong ties. There are currently 64,000 Japanese residents in Australia, the fifth largest Japanese community outside Japan. In 2007, 570,000 Japanese visited Australia and 220,000 Australians returned the favour. Tourism is an area that continues to bind our two countries. In fact, it was through tourism that Australia gained arguably one of Japan’s greatest exports, Tetsuya Wakuda, the head chef at one of the top 10 restaurants in the world. Tetsuya grew up in Japan until the age of 22. Armed with his only piece of information about Australia-that there were lots of koalas and kangaroos around-and having only limited English he decided to travel to Australia, where he has stayed ever since. It is Japan’s great loss, but we have gained one of the world’s great chefs-and, I must admit, I am a big fan of Tetsuya’s restaurant. Sister city relationships also increase our cultural bonds. Japan and Australia share 102 sister cities. One of those sister city relationships exists in my electorate. The Japanese city of Suita is the sister city of Bankstown. As part of this arrangement youth exchanges take place between the two cities, promoting cultural understanding and friendship between our next generations. I look forward to meeting the 20 local students who will be travelling to Suita on 4 October. I also share a strong affinity with Japan. I am the chair of the Australia-Japan Parliamentary Friendship Group and I had the privilege of meeting the Japanese Ambassador to Australia, Takaaki Kojima, at the Japanese embassy earlier this year. It was an honour to meet him. In the short time he has been the Japanese Ambassador to Australia, just 10 months, he has done a fantastic job of strengthening the close ties between our two countries. In my role as the chair of the friendship group, I look forward to working closely with the ambassador and his team to continue to build on this strong and enduring relationship. As part of that, I will be visiting Japan in early October as a guest of the Japanese government. I thank the ambassador for his kind invitation. This visit will provide a great opportunity for me to gain a greater understanding of the importance of this significant relationship. I look forward to gaining a greater insight into the political, economic, strategic, security and cultural aspects of Japan. This morning as I was driving to work, I saw what I think is the most visually symbolic example of the enduring friendship between our two countries. While driving along State Circle, here in the nation’s capital, I noticed that one side of the road was lined with cherry blossoms, the national flower of Japan. The other side of the road was lined with the golden wattle, Australia’s national flower. It is a symbol of the strength and closeness we share. This bill further embeds the bond our two countries share, and I commend the bill to the House. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (10.17 am)-As I rise to speak on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008, I would like to draw the House’s attention to the fact that the three government members listed to speak on this bill are all from Western Sydney. That is quite easy to explain: with a population of nearly two million people, Western Sydney is the third largest economy in Australia. With our population growing faster than the rest of the country, there is perhaps no more serious issue than increasing the economic strength of our communities. We will do that not only by how well we engage the skills, imagination and MAIN COMMITTEE hard work of our own people, but also by how well we engage with the world. We are lucky in Western Sydney in that, in many ways, we have the world within us. The people who have migrated here have brought to this country their languages, knowledge and business experience and they are comfortable dealing with various parts of the world. We already have the world very much within us in Western Sydney. But our relationship with Japan, which has been strong and enduring over many decades, is one of the most important to us. I have worked on this bill and read sections of it over the last week. As I have said several times when I have spoken on tax law, it is all a bit dry. In fact, it is very dry. I come from a music background, so I am looking forward to seeing a bill which I understand and which other people have to read three times! There are paragraphs in this bill where, quite frankly, I fell asleep before I got to the end of them. But what underpins it, the purpose of the bill, what it is actually about, is really quite fascinating and has grabbed my imagination as I have worked on it over the last week. The bill underpins an incredibly important relationship. What it deals with is how people make decisions to commit more to Australia, to commit more to the relationship with Japan, to invest, to trade and to essentially commit over the long term to building a stronger relationship. It looks at what barriers there might be, it looks at the complexities, it looks at the burdens of complying with two complex tax codes. It also looks at the needs of the people of both countries in supporting those relationships. It looks at whether the people with businesses who live and work in both countries are getting a fair deal out of the taxation arrangements. So underpinning all of this very dry legislation is an incredibly important process that Australia and Japan will go through in order to strengthen our relationship into the future. The bill seeks to give force of law to a renegotiated tax treaty. The renegotiations began under the Howard government in 2007 and the new treaty was signed on 31 January 2008. It will replace what will soon become the old tax treaty, which was signed in March 1969 and came into effect on 1 July 1970. That is 38 years ago. During the 38 years of that treaty, the way that businesses think and work, the range of businesses in both countries and the way that business moves between the two countries with technology have changed quite considerably. So it is well and truly overdue that this incredibly important treaty, which underpins the growth of our relationship, be reviewed. The new treaty will come into force 30 days after both countries have completed their domestic requirements. Japan have already met theirs. This bill is part of the process of Australia meeting our commitment. It inserts the text of the new treaty, which was signed in January this year, into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 effectively replacing the old treaty of 1969. I hope I am speaking about this in English-I am actually trying very hard to keep this in understandable language. In order to allow the Australia-Japan tax treaty to come into effect, for the purposes of withholding tax from 1 January 2009 the bill needs to pass both houses of parliament and receive royal assent prior to 30 November 2008, so there are some time constraints on the House. If you are a business or an individual straddling both countries, this is incredibly important and interesting legislation. It is important for businesses operating, or planning to operate, in both countries and trying to deal with the complexities of two tax systems and for the citizens of both countries to ensure that appropriate taxes are paid. The treaty is essentially about removing or reducing tax barriers to cross-border movement of people, capital or technology; MAIN COMMITTEE tax barriers do apply to all three. It does this by relieving double taxation, preventing tax discrimination and providing certainty with respect to the tax treatment of cross-border income flows, thereby reducing the compliance burdens and excessive taxation on taxpayers and allowing businesses to get on with what it is that they actually do. The new tax treaty will improve the integrity of the tax system-and, again, it is required after 38 years of change-and will promote cross-border trade and investment with one of our most important trading partners, Japan. You cannot underestimate just how important that relationship is and how important it has been over the last 40 years, not only because of the size of the money flow-and Japan is still our largest trading partner-but also because of its longevity and strength and the quality of the relationship between our two nations. The relationship is not one of a quick buck and it is not one of quick import and export; there are very real long standing relationships and investments in capital in both countries that hold our relationships in very good stead. Japan is Australia’s largest export market and it has played a central role in Australia’s postwar economic development. At the moment, China is likely to overtake Japan’s position as the primary export market, but the complementary nature of the Australia-Japan relationship, its longevity and the strength of our personal and business relationships will ensure that that relationship remains vital to both economies long into the future. In 2007 Japan was the world’s second largest economy, measured in US dollars, and the third largest economy, measured in purchasing power parity. Economic growth is expected to continue at the rate of 1.5 to two per cent over the next two years. Japan’s economy is driven by strong business investment and export growth, with strong regional demand providing considerable input. Japan-this powerhouse to our north-became Australia’s primary export market in 1969, the same year that the old treaty was negotiated, and it continues in the No. 1 position today. In 2007 the two-way trade between our two countries was valued at $54.5 billion, accounting for a 0.9 per cent decrease on 2006. Trade between the two countries is largely stable as a result of the domination in our relationship by multinationals in the resources sector using very long-term supply contracts. Japan is Australia’s third largest source of investment-which, in 2006, was valued at $51 billion. Japanese investment has played a central role in Australia’s postwar economic development, particularly in the resources, manufacturing, auto and tourism sectors. The Australian-Japan economic relationship is significant due to its historical and contemporary importance, and the two economies enjoy a highly complementary trade relationship and relative geographic proximity. It is a very strong foundation on which to build. Again, this bill ensures that people-and they are people and businesses that build this relationship-are working under the best circumstances in which to do that. Stakeholders’ submissions which have been received are overwhelmingly supportive of this new treaty, particularly in relation to the 10 per cent withholding tax rate for dividends and the interest withholding tax exemptions. Submissions to the government’s tax treaty review largely suggested that the approach taken in the Japanese tax treaty be applied to future Australian tax treaties. The Convention between Australia and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income does a number of specific things. Probably the most significant of these are summarised by the Joint Standing CommitMAIN COMMITTEE tee on Treaties in report 91, which was tabled on 12 March 2008. It summarises the key differences between the 1969 Japanese tax treaty and the 2008 Japanese convention. I will just read into the record two of those paragraphs: 4.4 The Committee was advised that the proposed treaty is generally consistent with recent tax treaties concluded by Australia and includes a number of changes from the existing treaty. The key differences are reduced rates of withholding taxes (WHT) on dividends, interest and royalties, and improved integrity measures, particularly relating to rules for the exchange of information on tax matters. The treaty also introduces rules for real property which align the Capital Gains Tax treatment closely with that of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 4.5 Treasury advised that it sought greater clarity in the revised agreement. The organisations that would be subject to exemptions for interests to withholding taxes have been expanded to include the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, the public authority that manages the investments of Australia’s Future Fund, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance. The other key changes which were summarised in that report included the inclusion of antitreaty-shopping provisions in relation to withholding tax rates on dividends, the inclusion of the comprehensive limitation on the benefits clause to ensure treaty benefits passed only to qualified persons and rules to prevent tax discrimination. It is quite a complex bill. There are many people in the departments in both countries that have done substantial and really good quality work in a very complex area to put this treaty together. It has been incredibly well supported by stakeholders in the industry and it will, without any doubt, place this extremely important relationship between Australia and Japan in good stead to grow into the future. I commend the bill to the House. speak in support of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. The bill, once enacted, will implement into Australian law the taxing rights and obligations set out in the convention entered into earlier this year between the Australian government and the Japanese government-the Convention between Australia and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income. This convention between Australia and another sovereign nation, Japan, is what is typically known as a double tax agreement. These arrangements are not only common for us as a nation to enter into but absolutely essential in the context of the global economy that we all now live within. What does a double tax agreement do? Essentially, a double tax agreement, or tax treaty, seeks to allocate taxation rights to the respective jurisdictions. Where gains are derived by individuals or entities, there will always be a desire on the part of a domestic jurisdiction to tax those gains. But in a global economy there needs to be some balancing of the desire of an individual jurisdiction to tax those gains and ensuring that individuals doing business across borders are not being taxed twice by two jurisdictions. A double taxation agreement is about the coming together of two nations to reach some agreement as to how gains derived by individuals and entities in those two contracting states are to be appropriately taxed so that individual taxpayers do not have to pay tax twice. This is an essential element of having an open trading environment across the globe, and it is on that basis that we enter into many of these agreements on a bilateral basis. In most cases the terms of those agreements override the specific provisions of domestic taxation law in our MAIN COMMITTEE",139,International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill No 1 2008
326,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (10.29 Am),"I rise to add my comments to this debate and tocountry. It is worth noting that it is of particular importance in a case such as Japan that Australia modernise and update its arrangements with one of our most significant trading partners when it comes to taxation and our respective obligations and rights to tax individuals in respect of their gains. As a result of that recognition, the government has entered into that agreement and we are now implementing that agreement into domestic law through this bill. As one of our key trading partners, Japan has been Australia’s largest export market for over 40 years, with bilateral merchandise trade totalling $54.5 billion in 2007. Japan is also Australia’s third largest investor, with a total stock of investment worth $51 billion at the end of 2006. It is also worth noting that Australia is the third largest exporter of food to Japan, and those exports are valued at more than US$4 million. In trade terms our relationship with Japan is a significant one. But not only do we have a strong relationship in trading terms; we also have a strong relationship at the diplomatic level as fellow international citizens. A tax treaty is not only about allocating taxation rights between contracting states; it is also about ensuring that there is some mutual cooperation on stamping out practices that would challenge the integrity of revenue measures within each of those states. An essential part of this bill and the convention that it implements is that it strengthens some of those integrity measures. I think all members of this place would agree that that is a good thing. I would now like to turn to some of the technical amendments contained within the convention. The new treaty provides that the dividends, interest and royalties paid from one country, which is defined as ‘the source country’, to a person who is a resident in the other contracting state will generally remain taxable in both countries but with limits on the tax that the source country may charge on the resident of the other country. In respect of withholding taxes relating to dividends, interest and royalties, a number of significant changes will be implemented as part of this convention. In respect of dividends, under the existing treaty between the Australian and Japanese governments, which was signed back in 1969, the maximum withholding tax rate which may be imposed is 15 per cent. Under the new treaty, there are essentially four classes of dividends, which will be taxed in different ways depending on the nature of those dividends. No tax will be chargeable on intercorporate non-portfolio dividends where the recipient holds directly at least 80 per cent of the voting power of the company that is paying the dividend. This will be subject to certain conditions. There will be a five per cent rate limit, which will apply on all other non-portfolio intercorporate dividends where the recipient holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company that is paying that dividend. The treaty also contains a 15 per cent rate limit, which will apply to distributions from Australian real estate investment trusts. That 15 per cent limit will also apply to dividends which are paid by a Japanese company which is entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its beneficiaries in calculating its taxable income in Japan where more than 50 per cent of that company’s assets consist of real property in Japan. The fourth category of dividend, which will essentially be all of those other dividends that do not fit into any of the above three categories, will be subjected to a withholding tax rate limit of 10 per cent. This is a significant reduction in the withholding tax rates that apply to dividends across the board. I think this will clearly facilitate greater cross-border investment, both outbound and inbound. Clearly, the rationale of this bill is to enhance the already very strong economic relationship that we have with Japan. MAIN COMMITTEE In respect of interest, the ability of a source country to tax residents of the other contracting state will continue to be limited to 10 per cent. However, there are some alterations. No tax will be chargeable in the source country on interest derived by a financial institution resident in the other country, a body performing governmental functions, including central banks, the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, any public authority that manages the investments of Australia’s Future Fund, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation or Nippon Export and Investment Insurance. There are some safeguards that apply in respect of interest income earned from those particular entities. In respect of royalties, the general limit for royalties will be reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent. This is a significant change that will drive much increased investment in Australia. The new treaty provides that amounts derived from equipment leasing-this area has been a matter of some uncertainty in the past-including certain container leasing, will be excluded from the royalty definition. They will be treated and dealt with under the international transport operations article, which is article 8, or under the business profits article, which is article 7. In respect of the withholding tax that applies on royalties, intellectual property is one of the most significant assets to which royalties and royalty withholding tax will apply. We will see a greater capacity for our nations to share in some of the intellectual property that is generated and created in our respective states. I would also just like to comment more specifically on some of the measures contained within the convention that seek to preserve the revenue base here in Australia. Specifically, the convention preserves our taxing rights over income from real property and income arising from activities related to our natural resources. There is a clarification of our boundaries in terms of resources. That is of particular significance in respect of resources contained within those expanded boundaries. It is also worth noting that this convention enhances information exchange provisions which allow tax administrations of both of the jurisdictions to share tax information. This is an essential part of maintaining integrity in our respective tax systems but, importantly, those provisions will be extended more broadly to take into account the goods and services tax, which of course was not anticipated by anyone back when the original treaty was entered into. All in all, there are a range of integrity measures that are included within the convention. The measures go a long way towards ensuring not only that we are bringing down some of those potential double-taxation barriers that exist and might act as a disincentive to further investment between the two countries but also protection and preservation of our revenue base. There are a number of other features of the convention that are worth noting. Apart from expanding the list of taxes covered, there is a refinement of the definition of ‘permanent establishment’, including prescribed time limits for the creation of PE, permanent establishment, where an enterprise is engaged in the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources. A significant element of the convention is the provisions that relate to comprehensive alienation of property, which broadly align the capital gains tax treatment with OECD practice whilst preserving our taxing rights over Australian assets that have that physical connection with Australia. This is particularly important in relation to mining rights and other interests related to Australian real property. MAIN COMMITTEE There are special provisions that relate to a particular type of arrangement that exists with Japan involving sleeping partners-an expression that relates to the nature of the entities for taxation purposes and nothing else-which clarify the situation and take into account some peculiarities that exist in the legal and taxation arrangements within Japan. Importantly-and this will be an issue that provides much greater certainty to taxpayers in both countries-a time limit of seven years will be enshrined for the commencement of transfer pricing audits. But, ensuring the integrity of the system, there will be no such limit in the case of fraud or evasion, which is a very common carve-out in relation to time limitations in taxation matters. Fraud or evasion should never be matters that are protected by a time limitation. Importantly, the convention also creates new rules to prevent tax discrimination against nationals and Australian businesses operating in Japan and vice versa. There is also a comprehensive limitation-on-benefits article to prevent abuse of the treaty-specific integrity provisions that seek to ensure that taxpayers are not able to avoid their obligations by relying upon these particular provisions within the convention. That is a summary of some of the specific technical amendments that are contained within the convention. But it is worth reflecting more generally on the benefits of entering into this convention. Apart from the fact that, by reducing withholding tax, we are reducing the interest burden on Australian borrowers of Japanese debt-and I think we would all agree that that will certainly assist some of our companies looking to make inroads into various marketsthere will be an expected increase in economic activity between Australia and Japan. That will be a natural by-product of streamlining the taxation processes and arrangements with respect to the two countries. That is a great thing and it will benefit our economy and much of the industry within it. The cost of borrowing from Japanese lenders for Australian businesses will reduce, which will also assist many Australian businesses. The increased economic activity that is anticipated will lead to greater tax receipts in the long run. Taxation is one of those wonderful tools where, sometimes by reducing it and delivering a benefit to the economy, the revenue is able to recoup some of those reductions by way of additional tax receipts as a result of the benefit of that investment. The benefits of encouraging foreign direct investment are plain to see for all of us. The introduction of new technologies, governance standards and management concepts will directly flow from the updating of this particular treaty. There will also be training and skill upgrading, improved productivity, increased imports and exports, increased competition, more efficiency and lower consumer prices. It is a fallacy to think that higher withholding taxes are in the end borne by the nonresident from the other contracting state. We all know that they are very quick to pass on the additional costs to the consumers. Many of those consumers are people in Australia securing those goods and services. Regarding the impact of lower dividend withholding tax on foreign direct investment, the flows of foreign direct investment are highly sensitive to country tax rates. Therefore, we can expect an increase in foreign direct investment as a result of this legislation. OECD research shows that a one per cent reduction in tax rates leads to a 4.28 per cent increase in foreign direct investment inflows, which is a significant additional investment that we would expect to flow from some of the reductions that have occurred. MAIN COMMITTEE The benefits of a revised tax treaty include having a more modern and updated instrument that dictates these matters. That in itself is an end that should be supported. This particular convention removes some of the existing impediments to investment and trade between the two countries. Withholding tax removal prevents a lockup of profits offshore. As a result of these changes, we will see more Australian businesses doing business in Japan and vice versa. The benefits of that will be great for our national economy. I want to reflect briefly on the press release issued by the Assistant Treasurer in relation to consultation regarding Australia’s tax treaties. Whilst the consultations involved tax treaties more generally, it is worth noting that a number of the comments that came back through the various stakeholders that contributed to this debate were very much in support of and praised the elements of the Australia-Japan tax treaty, particularly in relation to the need for lower dividend and royalty withholding tax rates. Clarification has been brought about by the provisions that deal with real estate investment trusts, or REITs. There is also the treatment of capital gains and bringing that treatment into line with OECD practice and the issue of transfer pricing and imposing a time limitation with the exception of where cases of fraud or evasion are to be considered. In concluding, I want to bring this debate back to my local community and acknowledge the very strong friendship that the Penrith City Council has with a number of city councils and cities in Japan. Fujieda City in the Shizuoka Prefecture and Penrith City signed a sister city agreement back in 1984. A long and very strong friendship has emerged as a result of that agreement, which involves yearly student exchange programs-with more than 200 exchange students during the time since the agreement-and regular citizen exchanges. This has been of great benefit to both cities. In addition, the Penrith City Council has a relationship with Hakusan City in the Ishikawa Prefecture. This friendship agreement was signed in 1989, extending beyond friendship and involving increasingly developed and closer economic ties between the two countries. No doubt these great relationships and Australia’s great trading relationship with Japan will only improve as a result of this convention. (Time expired) sistant Treasurer) (10.49 am)-in reply-I thank the members for Stirling, Blaxland, Parramatta and Lindsay for their very worthwhile contributions to this debate on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. Responding to the needs of both Australian and Japanese business, the new Australia-Japan income tax convention comprehensively updates the existing tax treaty arrangements with Japan, which were last updated in 1969. The existing agreement no longer fully reflects the modern tax treaty policies of either country. The new convention, which will modernise and enhance the bilateral tax arrangements between Australia and Japan, was signed in Tokyo on 31 January this year. The bill will give force to the law of the new tax treaty with Japan by inserting the text of the new convention into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 and repealing the existing treaty. Tax treaties do facilitate trade and investment by minimising tax barriers between treaty partner countries. The importance of tax treaties is magnified where the relationship is as strong as that between Australia and Japan. So this is one of the more significant tax treaties that the parliament has considered in recent times. The new convention underlines the MAIN COMMITTEE",144,International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill No 1 2008
327,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Asstrength of the modern and sophisticated bilateral ties between the two countries and reduces obstacles to inhibit further corporate expansion into Japan. Japan is Australia’s third largest investor. Direct investment by Japan continues to play a key role in the development of many Australian industries, including export industries such as car manufacturing and the natural resource development activities that have driven Australia’s export performance. Australia is now one of the largest recipients of offshore investment by Japanese mutual funds. From Australia’s perspective, Japan is the fourth largest destination of Australia’s investment abroad and it has been Australia’s largest export market for more than 40 years. The new convention streamlines taxation arrangements between the two countries to the benefit of both economies. The key outcomes from the convention include: lower withholding tax rates on dividend and royalty payments for businesses looking to expand offshore and obtain access to valuable intellectual property, which the member for Lindsay referred to in some detail; specified interest withholding tax exemptions that will facilitate more competitive and accessible cross-border debt arrangements; and broadly aligning capital gains tax treatment with international practice and with Australia’s domestic law. The treaty also ensures Australia’s revenue base is appropriately protected by preserving taxation rights over income from real property and income arising from activities relating to Australia’s natural resources and by enhancing information exchange provisions which allow the tax administrations of both countries to share information-something particularly important in these times of heightened efforts to crack down on tax havens. Public submissions received as part of the review of Australia’s taxation treaty-again this was referred to by my friend the member for Lindsay-and policy announced by the government earlier this year strongly supported the outcomes of this convention. Modernising, updating and reducing our withholding tax rates have of course been key economic priorities of this government. The new convention will enter into force 30 days after both countries advise that they have completed their domestic requirements, which in this case includes this process of passing the bill. The treaty has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties-of which the member for Shortland is a senior member-which has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.53 am)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Forrest Electorate: Wine and Truffle Co. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.53 am)-I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Wine and Truffle Co. located at Hazel Hill Estate, near Manjimup, in my electorate of Forrest. Just over 10 years ago 25 Australian investors had a vision to establish the largest mainland truffiere in the Southern Hemisphere. Their aim was to produce French black truffles, a rare and expenMAIN COMMITTEE sive gourmet delicacy. To complement the truffles they also wanted to produce a range of fine premium wines. The location was selected because the climatic and soil factors are similar to the truffleproducing areas in France and New Zealand. The 15-acre Hazel Hill Estate property is very picturesque, undulating and surrounded by karri and jarrah forests. Thirty acres is devoted to the vineyard but the greater portion of the property is covered by 13,000 hazel and oak trees that have been inoculated with black truffles spores, making it the largest mainland truffiere in Australia. These trees have continued to mature under the guidance, nurturing and monitoring of the company’s expert mycologists. In July 2003 the very first and highly valued truffle was discovered by truffle dogs. It was a single massive 163-gram truffle, which caused great excitement. The annual harvests have increased each year and, although a warm, dry August cut short this year’s truffle season, the company’s 2008 harvest came in at a record black-gold crop in excess of 600 kilograms. My congratulations go to the owners of the Wine and Truffle Co. at Hazel Hill Estate for an excellent crop result. The retail price for the black truffle is $3,000 per kilogram. This equates to a $1.8 million harvest for the rare fungus crop and is a fine return for the vision, the risk, the investment, the nurturing and the hard work that the owners have put into their venture. Truffles are uniquely flavoured, edible fungi, usually classed with the mushroom family. They have a pungently scented aroma described as the ancient flavours of the forest. Think of a musty, garlicky, nutty flavour that can overwhelm the senses, and that is what they taste like. The cultivation of truffles requires a lot of scientific knowledge, skill and investment. Because truffles grow underground on the roots of inoculated trees, they are difficult to find. Trained dogs and dog handlers are needed. When truffles are found, the truffle hunters have to actually get down on their hands and knees in cold, wet mud and dig them out with their bare hands. Truffles are found anywhere from five to 30 centimetres below the ground within a metre of the base of hazelnut or oak trees. The Wine and Truffle Co. has six trained dogs that search for the elusive truffle, and that gives the hunters the option of covering the 40 kilometres along the truffle tree rows in less than seven days. If a truffle is ready to pick, it is guaranteed not to be missed by the dogs. Truffles are roundish, brown and dirty when they come out of the ground. That is why the name ‘truffle’ has been borrowed to describe small, fancy chocolate-and-nut balls covered with cocoa powder-delicious but not to be confused with the real truffle. The Manjimup truffles are sold to restaurants worldwide. Some of the international buyers include Japan, the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Italy, France and Indonesia. The venture has been so successful because the harvests in France have been declining due to urbanisation, climate change and pollution. In 1998 France’s truffle production was only eight tonnes. Truffles being added to the food bowl of the south-west has certainly set the Manjimup area up for tourism activity as it has broadened the appeal of the region for wine and food lovers. Truffles are used to transform very simple dishes into gourmet delights. Although considered a luxury item, the taste and aroma of truffles is so intense that only a small quantity is needed to produce exquisite meals. The black truffle is used predominantly in the cooking process of dishes such as pasta, risotto, soups, stews, sauces, even mashed potato, eggs, souffles, chicken and wild game. The best way to enjoy a fresh truffle is to shave it over risotto, pasta, fish, eggs, meat, soups or salads. MAIN COMMITTEE I wish the Wine and Truffle Co. all the best for the export sales of their 2008 harvest and also wish them every success for next year’s harvest. They hope to harvest more than 1,000 kilograms of black truffle then. The photo of the dog that found their first truffle is on their wall. He is a very important part of that truffle company. I congratulate them all. Postal Services: Jewellstown Plaza Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.58 am)-On 30 March this year I raised in this House the issue of a post office for the Jewellstown Plaza. This has involved a long campaign, one that has gone on over a number of years. It has had enormous support from the community. The shopping plaza has a very big feeding area. A lot of people throughout the electorate of Shortland in the near vicinity of that shopping centre use it. But I report to the House with great sadness that Australia Post have recently advised me that they will not support a post office at Jewellstown Plaza. This is despite enormous support within the community. I learnt of the fact that they were not going to support the post office not from Australia Post but, rather, second hand from Colliers International, who own the shopping plaza. They advised me that they had been informed by Australia Post that this was the case. I contacted Australia Post immediately I heard that on 31 July. They responded to my letter, saying that they were sorry that I had found out about it that way and, basically, that they had been going to get around to telling me one day. They said a number of factors had been involved-things like closeness to other outlets. I might point out that Jewellstown Plaza is further from other postal outlets than other centres within the electorate. On6 AugustI wrote back to Australia Post and informed them that I would like to bring all parties together to talk. I might add that we had had numerous discussions prior to this. Today is 4 September and they have not responded as yet. They can be selective about when they respond quickly and when they do not respond quickly. A matter of further concern is that it is reported in the Hansard of 1 September that the member for Fowler tabled a response in relation to petitions that had been submitted. In that was a response from the minister, who said Australia Post had advised that senior management from its New South Wales administration met with the petition sponsor-me-late in March to discuss my interest in the establishment of a postal outlet. It goes on to say: Australia Post has also advised that it has received few direct approaches, including from the local business community, requesting a postal outlet at Jewellstown. The one thing I can guarantee Australia Post here in the parliament today is that they are going to receive so many direct responses that they will wish they had never said that to the minister. They have received numerous petitions-but we will change our tack on this one. Further, they said: Australia Post has also informed me that, at this stage, no decision has been reached. So on 1 September the minister had not been informed that Australia Post had told me that they would not support a post office at Jewellstown Plaza. I have written to the minister about this issue. I have told him how dissatisfied I am with the response from Australia Post. I have told him that I am not prepared to sit back and just leave this. I would like to put very strongly on the record that Australia Post needs to listen to the local community. They need to make sure that they do not give one message to the local MAIN COMMITTEE member and a different message to the minister. I will be taking this matter further. (Time expired) Fisher Electorate ourable member for Flinders for his accommodation of me. My contribution in this debate will be somewhat shorter than usual as I have to speak in the main chamber imminently. not believe that elected representatives have a monopoly on good ideas and common sense. It really is important for members of parliament, regardless of their political affiliation, to consult with members of the community in as many fora as possible. I know that all members, regardless of where they stand in the political spectrum, do endeavour to engage with their community. I have been having a series of ‘meet Pete in the park’ events, which are sausage sizzles in various parts of the electorate. We invite constituents to come in and enjoy a sausage and in doing so we have the opportunity, particularly in those areas distant from the electorate office, to talk with constituents in their own environment. That means that those constituents are able to tell me about problems that they might be having with the government or a government department, how they feel the government is going wrong or what the opposition is doing right or wrong, as the case may be. I do find it quite useful to talk to people in their own local areas. For instance, on Saturday, 30 August at Jessica Park, Nicklin Way, Minyama, there was a sausage sizzle from 10 am until 12 noon and then at Dicky Beach Park, Beerburrum Street, Dicky Beach, from 2 pm until 4 pm. We had a very good roll-up of people. I have to say I personally value the interaction. Initially I started to do the sausages, but people want to talk to me and I suspect that their digestion benefited from the fact that someone took over that particular task from me. On Saturday, 6 September, in addition to having the inaugural meeting of the Sunshine Coast region of the LNP, I have three of the ‘meet Pete in the park’ sausage sizzles. One is at the bluff, the Esplanade, Alexandra Headland, from 7 am until 9 am. There is one at Kawana Forest Park, White Cedar Drive, Kawana Forest, from 11 am until 1 pm and then there is one at Ayliffe Park, the Esplanade, Golden Beach, from 3 pm until 5 pm. There is concern out there in the community about the way the government is operating. Many people were sold a pup in the election campaign. Many people, particularly on the Sunshine Coast, voted for the Rudd Labor government because the Prime Minister came from the Sunshine Coast. He grew up on the Sunshine Coast. I suppose there was a sense of reflected pride that a boy from Nambour could become Prime Minister of Australia. Many of those people are seeing that what the government offered is a long way short of the reality of what the community is now receiving. I suspect that if the election were held again the result would be quite different. That does not mean that the opposition do not need to look very closely at our policies with a view to making sure that, come the next election, we are electable. I was one of those people who was of the view that we might well be in opposition for two, three or four terms. But the current government seems to have the aura of Mr Whitlam about it increasingly. There are MAIN COMMITTEE",148,International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill No 1 2008

I dosome ministers who are performing well and some ministers who are not performing well at all, but the community feel quite let down because the government they got is not the opposition they voted for. They believed that the government was going to be a much better government than it actually has been. I now believe that we as a party have an opportunity to be re-elected next time as long as we engage with the people, as long as we continue to bring forward sensible, rational policies, as long as we listen to the people and as long as we remember the mistakes of the past and move forward. The government that was defeated on 24 November was a good government. That is not to say we cannot be better in the future. But these ‘meet Pete in the park’ sausage sizzles are a wonderful way for me to have community consultation and a wonderful way for me to listen to what people are saying. I feel I am able to come to the national parliament better equipped to speak on behalf of local constituents. I thank the chamber. Wakefield Electorate: Trail Bikes of trail bikes and monkey bikes in various parts of Wakefield, particularly in the northern suburbs, where I live, around Salisbury North, and where my office is, in Munno Para, and also along the coast in places like Middle Beach. For the benefit of the Main Committee, I might just explain what monkey bikes are. They are miniature versions of road bikes. You might get a tiny little Harley-Davidson motorcycle or a tiny little Honda road bike. While they are small, they are incredibly powerful. They are often powered by 50cc motors and they can hurtle along at incredible speeds. As far as I know, they do not have to meet the Australian design standards. These bikes are available for sale in various parts of the country but they do not meet design standards. The illegal use of these bikes has almost reached plague proportions in some parts of the electorate, as teenagers and some adults ride through parks and along walking trails like the Elephant Walk, near my office in Munno Para. I was walking down there after work one night and one of these bikes hurtled past me. People ride along roads, along median strips, along railway corridors and in car parks. The last two locations have been the sites of tragic accidents involving two riders. One was riding along a railway corridor in Salisbury North and fell off. He was not wearing a helmet and, tragically, he died. Another young person died in the car park at Munno Para. He was hurtling along on one of these bikes, hit the concrete stoppers that prevent cars from going into the next space, went over the handlebars and hit another one on the other side of the car park. These have been tragic accidents. Obviously, we do not want to see deaths. But my great fear is that we will see a nonrider-a senior or a child who is walking through a park or along a walking trail or suburban street-killed in an accident with these bikes. Such is the frustration with the illegal use of these bikes that there have been some incidents of people acting foolishly-stringing up bits of wire across trees to stop these bike riders. The bikes cause great damage to the native vegetation, they create visual and noise pollution, they create danger for other users of the area and they affect the local amenity. I have written to both the local councils and the state government and got a petition to the state government going so that special laws can be made to take action on this matter. I also want to see more effective policing of the illegal use of these bikes. As I said, they have been a problem in my area. I am aware that they are also a problem in Frankston, Victoria and that MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Adjournment
331,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (11.08 Am),"I rise to speak on the issue of the illegal ridingthe council there has taken some action. They have also been a problem in the United Kingdom, where special laws were made to confiscate and crush these bikes, which I think is definitely the way to go. Federal agencies also can look at this issue. I acknowledge that the ACCC will be looking at national product bans and the bans that states and territories make on safety grounds, and monkey bikes will be looked at in that process. I would like to see the importation of these bikes restricted. I think they are very dangerous. They are quite powerful but they do not have the manoeuvrability that you need, and the sooner they are removed from our communities the better. Flinders Electorate: Phillip Island the development of Phillip Island, in my electorate of Flinders. Phillip Island, of course, is a magnificent tourism site. It is the home of the little penguin and it has the Koala Conservation Centre, Churchill Island and incredible north-facing beaches with calm waters. I want to start by congratulating Amanda Drennan, who will, over the coming week, be part of the Australian Paralympic team in Beijing. I have met Amanda. At 20 years of age she has shown real courage, in the true sense of the word, in overcoming difficulties. She has a great, positive attitude to life and is a fantastic sportsperson. She will be competing in the 100 metres breaststroke, the 100 metres freestyle and the 400 metres freestyle. I want to wish Amanda all the best as she embarks upon her Paralympic campaign, as well as everybody else who is representing Australia more generally. I note that she is an inspiration to kids on Phillip Island. I have met young kids at the primary school who talk about Amanda as ‘one of ours’. She is a great example not just of personal endeavour but of taking a very positive message to everybody on the island and to young people in particular. This brings me to the second point. Amanda is a swimmer. One of the challenges she has had to overcome is that of training facilities. It is a considerable distance from Phillip Island to the next major swimming pool at Wonthaggi. The islanders have long had a plan for a swimming pool; it is a plan I believe in and support. We had it in a position where it was ready to go. It was prepositioned and had been through preliminary stages for approval under the Regional Partnerships program. That program has now been abolished. The source of federal funding for the pool has disappeared. I grieve for the loss of that source of funding. I say to the new government: please reconsider this decision or, alternatively, find a new source of funding for communities such as Phillip Island to have access to a swimming pool. The community have raised well over $1 million themselves, either in kind or in cash. They are on track to reach the $2 million mark. They have done all of the right things that a local community should do to support itself. Above all else, they had relied upon the notion that they would have support from government matching that which they have raised themselves so that young kids, inspired by Amanda, would have the chance to train on Phillip Island and to be part of not only the Olympic future, but, if it is less than that, the development of their own health and self-discipline. So to the federal government I would say: please reconsider what you have done to communities around the country such as Phillip Island with the abolition of the Regional Partnerships program, to no good end and with no effective replacement in sight. MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Adjournment
332,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.12 Am),"I want to raise three issues in relation to the people andThis brings me to my third point, which is in relation to a proposal by the Bass Coast Shire Council for closed-circuit TV in the town of Cowes, the main centre on Phillip Island. As I mentioned at the outset, Phillip Island is a great tourism centre. It attracts numerous people in summer and, increasingly, around the clock. The result is that, sadly, from time to time we have outbreaks of street violence or street crime. So the council did the right thing: it planned, under our National Community Crime Prevention Program, to install closed-circuit television cameras. It was to its surprise and to its great disappointment that, not long after the election, it discovered the program had been axed and its chance for community safety had been abolished. Assuming that the program would still be in place, it had completed its plans; it had applied for funding. It was something which it had done in good faith. It is not a large council; it is not flush with funds. It is trying to protect the people of Phillip Island and provide a safe environment for families visiting the island for tourism purposes. Bad move again, in abolishing this program. I would say to the federal government: please find a way of supporting local communities who are doing their best to reduce crime, to improve local security. It is a poor decision and was simply done, I believe, to abolish a previous government’s program for the sake of it. The losers are the local communities. (Time expired) Forgotten Australians those of us with fathers can show our appreciation for the role that our fathers have played in our lives and the love they have given us. Father’s Day is a family day. It reminds us that the most fundamental and nourishing social unit in our society is the family. As children, families protect, teach and nurture us; as adults, they provide us with a sense of connectionconnection with our immediate environment but also a connection with our childhood. They are the primary source of our identity. Our families are our life’s witnesses. As we celebrate Father’s Day this Sunday with our families, I ask all Australians to take a moment to reflect on those who are not so fortunate, on those who do not have families in quite the same way. This is the reality for half a million Australians who grew up as wards of the state and in orphanages. These are the forgotten Australians. For them, the connection which comes from growing up in a family is not there. For them, identity is far more complex. For them, childhoods did not occur with security or nurturing or familial love. For the forgotten Australians, this Sunday will not be a happy day. Rather, it will be a reminder of what they did not have. It will be a day of pain. Of course, the circumstances which led to their being in orphanages vary-their parents were abusive or there were simply no parents at all-but in each case their fragile lives started with the worse of luck. From there, our society took the most vulnerable of our people, sometimes simply because their family was poor, and placed them in large institutions where their vulnerability was placed on show. In doing so, we denied these Australians their most fundamental right to a childhood and the innocence of it. Many who worked in these institutions were truly angels of mercy, and I note, from talking to those who grew up in orphanages, that despite all of their ordeals the recognition of these people is a constant refrain. But there were some who worked in these institutions who were predators. Each and every one of those who were condemned to this childhood was guaranteed a youth absent of familial love, but for many their stories were far worse. MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Adjournment
333,Mr Marles (Corio) (11.18 Am),"This Sunday we celebrate Father’s Day, a day whenAmidst the 537 submissions that were made to the Senate inquiry into children in institutionalised care was that of Mr Marcus Paul Greenhalghl, aged 62 when he wrote his submission. He says that the abuse he suffered as a child in care facilities has affected his whole life and it has taken him 50 years to be able to talk about it. Mr Greenhalghl was made a ward of the state at age seven, having been termed a neglected child in need of proper care. He remained in the care of the state until just before his 18th birthday. His submission recalls stories of public humiliation and starvation, of being flogged with a heavy leather belt while kneeling naked before the feet of his punisher, of verbal abuse, of the withholding of appropriate medical care and of sexual abuse. Mr Greenhalghl writes that, following his time in institutionalised care, he was able to later find a measure of peace. But in achieving this, a sense of normality in his later life, he is in a sense one of the more fortunate cases you will find amongst the pages of the Senate inquiry submissions; some never have. There are people like Ms Georgina Fraser, who was a state ward in New South Wales from age three until age 18 and whose submission was not one of violent recollection but rather one of neglect. Now in her 50s, Ms Fraser’s story recounts the lasting effect upon her life of having been denied appropriate access to an education. While most children of her age were studying at their desks, Ms Fraser’s childhood years were spent doing domestic duties, 12 hours a day, six days a week. Ms Fraser has the soul of an artist and she says: I feel the words inside me, I hear the poetry in my heart, I feel inside me the beautiful art ... [but] I find it hard to express myself or to write so [as] to be understood. Afforded a proper education who knows what future may have beckoned for Ms Fraser, but sadly her potential was not nurtured because, as she says, ‘The child that I never was died a brutal, violent death years ago in orphanages, institutions and state homes.’ Last Saturday was the fourth anniversary of the report Forgotten Australians: a report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children, the Senate report which arose out of the inquiry where both Marcus Greenhalghl and Georgina Fraser told their stories. This report was groundbreaking for forgotten Australians. For the first time at a national level, it provided them with an acknowledgement. In the 39 recommendations it described a path for our nation to right this wrong and for these Australians to gain some long sought-after peace. So August 30 has become a significant day for the forgotten Australians. While Father’s Day for them will be a painful day, August 30 must become a day on our calendar of recognition and hope for these Australians. In championing this issue, I follow in the footsteps of many, most significantly Senator Andrew Murray, himself a migrant child, whose work in this area has been nothing short of heroic. I also have the great honour of working with and knowing Leonie Sheedy and Joanna Penglase, who run CLAN and are themselves ‘clannies’ and who have made our country aware of forgotten Australians. In this parliament I do not walk alone, as Jason Clare, my colleague and friend, the member for Blaxland, has also decided to champion this cause with great energy and eloquence, as he did here last Monday night. (Time expired) Zimbabwe this morning. As you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the confronting nature of the huMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
334,Mr Pearce (Aston) (11.23 Am),"I rise in the parliament to raise a very important issuemanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe has gripped the soul of every decent-natured observer. Considering the horrific genocides that have plagued the African continent over the last century, I believe those of us who care for human rights must be the first not only to speak up but to provide, if you like, a helping hand to those peoples who are most in need. Australians, of course, have a very proud history of providing aid and succour to those peoples whose hardship transcends what can be dismissed as simply ‘a time of need’. As the President of Indonesia observed when Australia provided $1 billion in funds after the devastating tsunami that swept the Indonesian coast in 2004, Australians punch above our weight when giving humanitarian aid to other nations. There is no partisan or ideological divide when it comes to the generosity of the Australian people. Perhaps, as a nation of people who have done it tough in the past, we are quick to offer a helping hand to states in their moments of crisis. It was in that vein that I wrote months ago to the Prime Minister regarding the humanitarian crisis currently taking place in Zimbabwe and the devastating erosion of democracy in that country. It is widely accepted in the international community that the situation has now reached crisis point and that no stone can be left unturned to help alleviate the suffering of the people and to provide the hope of real democracy in Zimbabwe. Given the seriousness of the situation, I wrote to the Prime Minister saying that Australia must do more than we have done to help the people of Zimbabwe. To this end, in the letter I requested that the Prime Minister appoint or consider appointing Malcolm Fraser as a special envoy to travel to Zimbabwe to work with like-minded people to convince Robert Mugabe to embrace real democracy. The outcome would be to enable a free and fair election to take place. As those in this place would be well aware, Mr Fraser has had a long-standing relationship with Robert Mugabe and was crucial in both Zimbabwe gaining independence and Robert Mugabe becoming its president. It is a matter of public record that Robert Mugabe has held Mr Fraser in high regard. I believe it is the shared history between Mr Fraser and Robert Mugabe that may provide fellow concerned nations with a unique avenue for meaningful dialogue. Given this shared history over many years, Mr Fraser’s words could carry significant weight with Robert Mugabe. In finishing my letter, I asked the Prime Minister to pursue lateral approaches in order to help the people of Zimbabwe, as international actions to date have not been successful. The action that I pursued in my letter was with all due respect for the Prime Minister’s high office and with the best interests of the Zimbabwean people uppermost in my mind. The letter was dated 24 June this year and I had it hand-delivered on the same day to the Prime Minister’s office here in Parliament House. The following day a journalist asked our Minister for Foreign Affairs about my suggestion. While the minister considered it a long shot, he did note that he was aware of my proposal. It has now been 73 days since Prime Minister Rudd received my letter. Over two months have passed and I have yet to receive an acknowledgement of receipt of my letter, let alone a considered response. The only response I have had from the Rudd government has been the answer given by the foreign affairs minister to a journalist’s question. SoI want to thank the minister and Sky News for delivering a response, of sorts, to my sincere communication with the Prime Minister. I am not going to take this opportunity to rake over the stories of inefficiency within the Prime Minister’s office. Those matters of fact are already on the public record. WhatI do MAIN COMMITTEE wish to add to the public record is this concern: when a federal member of parliament writes to the Prime Minister on a matter of high principle and does not receive so much as an acknowledgement of said communication, one may ask what hope the so-called working families have of ever being heard or considered by Prime Minister Rudd. So today I ask the Prime Minister to please respond to my letter. I conclude with the hope that the current Prime Minister’s successor displays a greater interest in the views and charitable intent of the Australian people. Franklin Electorate: Ministerial Visit Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (11.28 am)-I rise today to talk about a recent visit to my electorate of Franklin by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services. The member for Maribyrnong visited southern Tasmania early last month and accompanied me to Oakdale Services Tasmania in the suburb of Mornington. Oakdale Services Tasmania has been operating since 1970, but it has its origins in a family based, state-wide organisation established in the 1950s. Oakdale delivers services to people with a disability in the greater Hobart area. Currently, it employs nearly 100 staff, providing both residential support for clients and day support services. The services provided by Oakdale include hostel style accommodation, independent living units, acquired brain injury accommodation, community access, as well as a community living program, youth services and an ageing-in-place program. The ageing-in-place program was originally set up as part of a national pilot project in June 2003. It supports seven people with an intellectual disability who are ageing, so that they can remain within their home at Oakdale Lodge with their friends and their support network. The member for Maribyrnong visited Oakdale with me in December last year. He got talking with one of the local residents and discovered a shared love for the great game of Aussie Rules. We were invited by a local resident, Lindsay Appledorf, to visit his unit, and it was here that it became apparent that Lindsay was a very passionate AFL supporter and, more particularly, a Carlton supporter. The generous member for Maribyrnong offered to talk to his contacts to get Lindsay some AFL memorabilia-and then one thing led to another and it quickly became clear that AFL was a shared passion amongst many of the residents at Oakdale. The result of the conversation was that the member for Maribyrnong contacted all the AFL clubs around the country and put together a range of memorabilia for all of Oakdale’s footy fans. So on a chilly Monday morning in Hobart, the member arrived at Oakdale with me to make good on his promise. He presented a variety of memorabilia, including two signed Hawthorn posters, a framed Brisbane Lions poster, signed jumpers, footballs and caps-and of course some Carlton gear for his great friend Lindsay. I was delighted to be part of the visit to Oakdale and to see the smiles on the residents’ faces when they received their gifts. It was truly inspiring. The residents were so keen that we spent quite some time fitting the signed team jerseys, scarves and hats on the local residents. When the residents received their gifts at that packed morning tea they also presented a gift of their own to the parliamentary secretary-a handmade autographed card and some of their artwork. The artwork is now on display in the parliamentary secretary’s office in this building. It was clear that a great love of AFL was a universal thing amongst the supporters. It showed that sport can and does bring together people from all walks of life. MAIN COMMITTEE I wish to place on the record my appreciation to all those AFL clubs the member for Maribyrnong contacted. They were all really happy to get on board and provide all the supporters memorabilia for the Oakdale team. I am sure those clubs appreciate the support of all their fans, and they are obviously keen to foster even more interest in the great game of AFL. As members of the House would know, many Tasmanians are loyal AFL supporters. Many great champions from Tasmania have played in the AFL, such as Peter Hudson, from the Hawthorn Football Club, of which I am a member. Later that day we also co-hosted, with Senator Catryna Bilyk, a forum for disability service providers in southern Tasmania. This was an opportunity for providers to speak first hand with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services and to raise their ideas, issues and concerns. The attendees appreciated this opportunity and the parliamentary secretary was able to update the group on the government’s policy plans for the sector. This was the member for Maribyrnong’s third visit to southern Tasmania since taking up his new role. This shows that the government is serious about listening to local stakeholders and people with disabilities about the issues they face and serious about giving people direct access to government decision makers. It also shows that the government is serious about ensuring that Australians with disabilities are treated as equal and active citizens in our local communities. Education ment’s commitment to an education revolution. We have heard much about how only Labor makes a connection between education and the future of the nation-what a stunning discovery! This great commitment seems to have become a pledge to supply computers for senior secondary students. In a sort of Orwellian oversimplification, we are hearing: computer pledge good, everything else bad. As a result, the government has slashed the highly popular and flexible Investing in Our Schools Program, through which local school communities could decide their own priorities. Let us remember that the Prime Minister committed to ‘a computer for every secondary school student’. But the ground has moved and now it is ‘one computer for every two students’. Schools are telling me they are thankful for computers but they do not know how they will fund them. There is no money for installation, training and ongoing servicing. Even more disturbingly, replacement of these computers has not been discussed. One school has told me that, as the computers reach their use-by date, they will have to pull them out if no new funding comes along. But today I specifically want to question the government’s commitment to its selfproclaimed ‘education revolution’ at Woomera, in the north of my electorate. Woomera is a world-famous facility, owned and controlled by the Department of Defence. It has a spectacular past and it promises to play an important part in the future of the development of our defence capability. After all, there are not many places in the world where you can fire a rocket and then pick it up 2,500 kilometres later and still be in the same country. All land and buildings in Woomera are owned and maintained by Defence. In Woomera there is a Commonwealth owned school facility. This school should be leased by the South Australian Department of Education and Children’s Services, or DECS, who MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Adjournment
335,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (11.32 Am),"TodayI would like to speak about the Rudd governwould then provide the education service to the residents, but DECS and Defence cannot agree on terms. So much for the end to the blame game this government is so fond of talking about! The Woomera school is in a deplorable and dangerous state. Defence has engineering reports on the remedial action required and called for tenders to complete the work. It was all ready to happen. Now the school has been informed that the proposed work, worth around $350,000, has been pulled to meet efficiency gains within the department. I recently visited the school to see just how bad things were. The school was built for an enrolment of 1,400; it is currently down to 70. However, it is far from the smallest school in Australia, particularly in our more remote areas. These kids and their families deserve educational facilities equal to those of the rest of the population, and certainly they deserve to go to school in a safe environment. On inspection, I found that the Woomera school is falling apart. Its walls are leaning outwards so far that the ceiling has collapsed. Furniture and plant such as photocopiers are leaning at strange angles all over the place, many of them with chocks under corners to try and level them enough so the units can function. Heavy doors in the corridors have been removed because the doorframes have twisted so much that they have fallen off their hinges. There are props in the doorframes to prevent the lintels falling. The school is in a deplorable condition. In some rooms you can see into the next through cracks in the walls. The floors are cracked and uneven to such an extent that they are an OH&S issue and almost certainly will lead to an accident. Even more disturbingly, the Woomera school has a disabled child in a wheelchair and no wheelchair access. Can you believe that in 2008? At a time when every DECS and privately owned and controlled school in South Australia is compelled to have wheelchair access, we have a facility owned and controlled by the Commonwealth which has not made the grade. As a result, this child cannot navigate the school on their own and requires a full-time carer at a time when DECS believe that for the child’s development it is very important they be encouraged to become more independent. The government talk big-in big, sweeping statements-about grand visions, but when it comes to putting meat on the bones they go missing. In Woomera we have children and staff operating in a dangerous environment and the government has pulled the funding. Is this a commitment to an education revolution or is it more about image and style? Whatever it is, it is certainly not delivering the goods in Woomera. Mobile Phone Services very strongly about: premium SMSs and their impact on the Australian community and our Australian youth. SMS messaging is a great service-if you call for it and you want it. But what we are finding more and more is that many people are subscribing to these SMSs without even realising what the costs are and how they are getting hooked into them. This is an issue that I have been campaigning on for a long time. I have called for provisions to be put in place to educate the public, and especially our youth, about the costs associated with premium SMSs. I took this up on behalf of residents in my electorate who had accrued enormous costs through their children’s mobile phones. I met with my colleague the Assistant Treasurer, Chris Bowen, earlier in the year to discuss the issue with him, and I am very pleased to say that an awareness campaign was launched last month. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
336,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.37 Am),"I rise today to speak of an issue that I feelMobile premium SMSs include downloading ringtones and music, chatting, votes, horoscopes and competition entries-you name it and you can get it on your mobile. According to the ACCC, these services are often from numbers starting with 191, 193 to 197 and 199. Concerns have been raised about the way that premium SMSs are marketed, especially to children and teenagers, who are sometimes unaware of the huge weekly subscription charges associated with the service. With mobile phones now being a common accessory for youths, I am sad to say that the premium SMS industry is preying on the young to make profits. This is not on. An astronomical number of mobile phones are in circulation-according to the ACCC, approximately 20 million. Costs vary greatly but can be as high as $6 for a message and ringtone to be sent and received-that is, $12 per message. This is a high price for a service which often appears in very deceptive advertising and where the costs are often not clearly displayed. Families have written to us, stating they owe hundreds of dollars to the premium SMS providers, after children have subscribed without understanding what those costs are and what they involve. I have heard stories of children as young as 14 who are subscribing to these premium SMSs and, as a result, are unknowingly falling into substantial debt, which is often then passed on to the parents. Earlier on this year, when I raised this matter in the media, I was inundated with examples of people from across Australia who had been caught by these gimmicks of premium SMSs. Some individuals who spoke to me owed over $4,000 for the use of premium messaging services. In most cases, as I said, they were young teenagers who were unwittingly, unknowingly subscribing to premium SMSs and were then continually charged, even at times when they would ask them not to send them any more messages. A bit of investigating showed that some of these companies in Australia were very hard to trace because they operate through overseas third companies. I am pleased to see that the ACCC currently has a couple of cases before it and it is investigating them. As I said, many of these services are also owned by offshore corporations. They are profiting from the youth and disadvantaged members of our society who perhaps do not understand the intricacies and the costs involved. Some examples of the scams involved were brought to my attention by the Youth and Enterprise Legal Centre, which alerted me to companies holding competitions that result in a monthly or daily fee being charged to a person’s phone bill and providing services that claim the ability to detect your compatibility with a partner for $10 per week. It sounds pretty good! I was pleased, though, that the ACCC and the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Chris Bowen, listened when I raised the concerns with them and, more importantly, that they listened to those concerns of the Australian public and launched a fact sheet to raise the awareness and increase the public’s knowledge of this issue. The fact sheet, released by the ACCC in August, refers to all the dangers. The ACCC states that, by law, ‘Advertisements for premium services must be upfront, clear, accurate and cannot be contradicted by disclaimers or fine print’(Time expired) Age Pension slanders who are struggling to make ends meet on the single age pension. I also seek to highMAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
337,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11.42 Am),"I rise today to speak on behalf of older Gipplight my concern that the federal government is paralysed by a mentality of reviews and inquiries and is failing to take action to help older Gippslanders, carers and people with disabilities to enjoy a decent standard of living. I ask the question, somewhat rhetorically: is there is a statute of limitations on the blame game? When does a new government stop looking backwards and blaming its predecessors and get on with the job of governing the nation? Judging by the behaviour of the Victorian parliament the Labor blame game goes on forever. The Brumby and Bracks governments have been in power for nine years and they are still looking backwards and blaming the previous Kennett government, which left office in 1999. I urge government ministers to end the blame game in relation to pensioners and carers and to get on with the job they are elected to do. We all know that the single age pension is inadequate. We have already had reports and inquiries which have highlighted the problem. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs titled A decent quality of life was tabled in parliament in March this year, and I quote from the executive summary: Australians have endured cost of living increases over recent years. In many cases, incomes have generally risen commensurately and compensate for these cost pressures. However, many older people, especially those on low, fixed incomes with little discretionary spending capacity, are vulnerable to these rises. In particular, they are disproportionately affected by cost increases in essential goods and services-food, rent, petrol, household utilities and healthcare. The report further stated that, although the real value of the age pension had increased over the past decade: … evidence suggests that for those on a full pension this level may be insufficient to maintain a basic, decent standard of living. The pension review background paper, released last month, revealed that the single rate of pension, which is set at 60 per cent, is lower than the average of 63 per cent for major OECD countries. We are clearly falling behind world standards and the Prime Minister knows it is a problem. In response to a question on 27 August, the Prime Minister conceded that cost-ofliving expenses ‘have certainly spiked in recent times because of factors like petrol and groceries’. Indeed the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is reported in today’s Australian newspaper as saying: There’s no question that all of these people, particularly people who are wholly dependent on the single rate of either the aged pension or the disability support pension, are finding it very hard to make ends meet. There is a recognition at the highest level of the federal government that cost-of-living pressures have spiked, and these increases have a greater impact on our pensioners and carers. The government’s thus far response has been to order another review. Why not act now? Why wait until next February for the review findings, when there will then be further delays while the review is considered? It could be another 12 months before this government does anything to help our pensioners and carers. If the government wants to buy some time until the review is released, I would support an immediate catch-up payment of $300 to pensioners and carers, including people with a disability who were discriminated against in the May budget. Help give them a chance to have a decent Christmas. We can afford to do better now. MAIN COMMITTEE I agree with National Seniors Australia that we need to investigate ways to better prepare the nation for pensioners and an ageing generation into the future. We must better support those people who are currently relying on the age pension. The current single age pension is not enough to provide a decent standard of living and must be urgently increased by at least $30 per week to two-thirds of the rate for a couple, as proposed by National Seniors Australia. We cannot afford to condemn our pensioners to another 12 months of struggling to find the money to eat healthily, pay their bills, cover their medical expenses, get around to visit friends and attend social activities. This is even more of an issue in country areas like Gippsland. Pensioners there do not have the luxury of access to public transport. Instead, they must pay the higher petrol prices or-worse still-they choose to stay at home and miss out on the social life that they richly deserve and on the quality of life opportunities that would add to a healthier lifestyle for them. These are the people who built our great nation. They allowed us to enjoy the privileges we have today. These people deserve better. Most pensioners did not have the opportunity of compulsory superannuation to prepare themselves for their retirement. As for single women receiving the age pension, they are often in a worse situation because they have not necessarily had the opportunity to work outside the family home and have had very limited superannuation opportunities. Also they may have spent many years as a carer for a family member. As I said during my inaugural speech to the House, carers of family members save our nation a king’s ransom but they often live the life of a pauper. We live in a wealthy nation, we can do better and we must do better. We can afford to give our pensioners and carers a decent standard of living. This is a test of the government’s rhetoric. They promised to govern for all Australians, and it is time for action now, not more empty words. Bendigo Electorate: Community Radio potential loss of a valuable radio broadcasting asset in my electorate of Bendigo. The new government has adopted the policy of its predecessor to extend the ABC’s NewsRadio service to all communities with a population of more than 10,000. The Australian Communications and Media Authority has identified an FM frequency that has carried community broadcasting for some 26 years as being the most suitable one for NewsRadio in Bendigo. Community broadcasting is founded on principles of accessibility, diversity, independence and localism. These are an essential part of the sector’s code of practice, which is registered with the ACMA. I am a great admirer of the NewsRadio service. Its news coverage is excellent and, of course, it brings the proceedings of this parliament to many people who would not otherwise be able to hear the words of profound wisdom that are spoken here and in the Senate-well, sometimes. As federal parliament is usually in session for around 18 weeks per year, the other 34 weeks are for broadcasting national and international news. But, despite all that, no-one can claim that NewsRadio carries local content, nor does it offer the accessibility of community radio. The replacement of a community radio station in Bendigo by NewsRadio would mean the loss of a valuable community asset that serves the needs of many of my constituents. Research on behalf of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia in 2006 showed that one-quarter of all Australians aged over 15, or more than four million people, listen to MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
338,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.47 Am),"I would like to draw the House’s attention to the community radio in a typical week. People who listen to community radio do so for an average of 7½ hours each week, and listeners aged over 55 tune in for almost 10½ hours per week. Their main reason for listening to community radio, particularly in non-metropolitan areas, is its local content. Research by Griffith University in 2007 found that listeners also find community radio accessible and approachable. They like the laid-back presentation style by ‘ordinary people’. They like the diversity of programming, particularly as to local news and information, that cannot be found on other broadcast media. Australia has one of the highest concentrations of media ownership in the world, a situation made worse by the changes to the media ownership laws by the previous government. In the commercial radio sector, this has led to a reduction in local content and an increase in syndicated programming in order to cut costs. The ABC has not been immune either, as its funding has been slashed in real terms over the past decade. My local ABC station in central Victoria is only manned during daylight hours Monday to Friday and carries network programs at other times. In contrast, most community radio stations are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making them unique in regional centres. The practical advantage of this was widely demonstrated in 2003, when certain suburbs of Bendigo were struck by a freak storm. In a seven-kilometre trail of destruction, 10 homes were completely destroyed and another 90 suffered damage. Local community stations were broadcasting news of the events soon after it happened, but it was five hours before a commercial broadcaster mentioned it and even the ABC had no ability to report locally and it was two hours before the incident was mentioned on its national news bulletin. Sport is a part of Australian culture and local sport is particularly important in rural and regional communities. Local football and netball clubs are a significant part of a community’s social life. They bring an important benefit during times of adversity, such as the drought that many regions, including my own constituency, have been suffering for a decade or so. Sport not only offers exercise and enjoyment; it also allows some respite from the harsh realities of life on a water starved farm or running a depressed rural business. The community radio frequency in Bendigo that has been earmarked for the ABC’s use is the only one that carries local sport broadcasting. Our commercial stations do not cover local sport, the local ABC does not cover it and NewsRadio certainly will not if it is allocated this frequency. In the light of these considerations, it is vital that there is no reduction of community radio broadcasting in Bendigo. I will continue to work with ACMA and the government to find alternative solutions so that my constituents can also have access to the ABC’s NewsRadio service while retaining their excellent community radio frequency of 89.5. Economy Rudd’s rudderless economy. Another Gold Coast boat builder has fallen victim to the slowing Australian economy, with Coomera based Telwater yesterday revealing it has sacked 100 staff in my electorate of Fadden. This, in combination with the losses out of Riviera Marine, takes the total boat-building losses to well over 357 in one of the biggest industries in Fadden and an important export industry for the nation. The management company of Telwater, which is the parent company of well-known brands that include Quintrex and Stacer, lays the blame squarely at the feet of the struggling economy and high fuel and food costs. It goes to show MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Adjournment
339,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.51 Am),"Another day, another tranche of job losses under Mrthat food and fuel do not just hurt at the checkout and the bowser; they hurt all the way down the economic line, right throughout the purchasing chain. Despite Mr Rudd’s rhetoric during the election campaign, we are yet to see any real, tangible initiatives to solve these problems. A couple of websites-costing millions and millions of dollars each-have never had a major impact on the economy, and I do not see any change with the farcical Fuelwatch or GROCERYchoice websites. On average, petrol has gone up more than 30c per litre since Mr Rudd was elected. Many times during the election campaign he and his politicians indicated to the Australian people that they would bring petrol and grocery costs down. Petrol prices have not come down and it is impacting on the marine industry. The high Australian dollar, which has now dropped by up to 20 per cent, has almost offset any reductions in petrol that may have been received by the Australian people because of the drop in the price of oil. Grocery prices continue to rise, putting further strain on family budgets. Labor’s own budget forecasts that by mid next year 134,000 Australians will be out of work, will have lost their jobs. Treasury indicates perhaps another 100 per cent more. The Bankers Association indicates that unemployment will reach five per cent by mid next year and it will be approaching six per cent by next Christmas. That is almost one million Australians, taking into consideration mum and dad and the kids, who will be impacted by job losses-all of them, each and every one of them, on Mr Rudd’s watch. In Mr Rudd’s own words: We have done as much as we physically can to provide additional help to the family budget … I contend that this is not good enough. These job losses demonstrate that fuel and food are not just about the family budget. I asked the Deputy Prime Minister last week in question time how many job losses we would see in the wake of the losses at Riviera; are 134,000 not bad enough? Boats are a discretionary purchase item, and historically the discretionary market segments are the first to suffer in times of a slowing economy. Whilst this week’s interest rate reduction by the RBA is welcome news for mortgagees, it is an indicator that the RBA believes the economy needs a kick-start, although inflation is still high and heading towards five per cent. In the national accounts released yesterday it is not hard to see why. Growth for the last quarter was 0.3 per cent, compared to 0.7 per cent for the previous quarter. Growth in New South Wales was minus 0.1 per cent. New South Wales is at the start of a recession-a recession technically being two quarters of negative growth. It has just experienced its first quarter of negative growth, and my home state of Queensland is not far behind it. The great question for the people of Fadden is this: is the marine industry the canary down the mine shaft? Is it the flickering candle down where oxygen is thin? Are these job losses in the marine industry an indicator of more to come on the Gold Coast, where one of the most important industries is the tourism industry? Holidays are another discretionary item that is likely to be hit hard as the economy continues to worsen. The more our household essentials continue to rise in price, the less we have in the wallet for the things we do not really need but would otherwise purchase or experience. Luxuries or discretionary items may not seem that important, but they are when you consider where they come from. I firmly believe in protecting jobs. I believe in employment. I believe in the great virtue and dignity that jobs bring and I know we need to fight to continue to see that jobs remain in the electorate of Fadden. MAIN COMMITTEE Mr Patrick ‘Paddy’ Koppman Mrs Trish Spillane community who passed away recently, both of whom I knew very well and respected. They were both champions of my local community. Mr Patrick ‘Paddy’ Koppman, born in 1921, was a life member of the Australian Labor Party and of his trade union, the old Federated Storemen and Packers Union. In 2001 Paddy was awarded a Centenary Medal for his service to the community and to politics. Educated at St Joseph’s College as a boarder, Paddy was driven, from an early age, by a desire to serve his community and his God. He entered the Catholic seminary and began his training as a priest, but after a number of years this training suffered a setback after he contracted a bone infection in his legs and he spent two years in and out of hospital in plaster casts. It was during this time that Paddy met the woman who would become his wife, Josey, and discovered that his true vocation was as a loving husband and father. Paddy’s contribution to his community was guided by his devotion to Mary and his belief in the rosary. As a result, Paddy became a prolific maker of rosary beads, a set of which I was honoured to receive. He would make multiple sets of these rosary beads and distribute them to local schools, community members, members of his parish-to anyone whom he felt might benefit from praying the rosary. Paddy’s other great guiding light in life was his belief in the ideals of the Australian Labor Party, which he joined in 1946. He was a committed member of the trade union movement and committed to equity and social justice. After living in Cabramatta for much of their lives, Paddy and Jo retired to Cambridge Park, in my electorate, in 1983. Whilst living in Cabramatta, Paddy worked tirelessly for the election and re-election of the local Labor Party representatives, which included the former Prime Minister and member for Werriwa the Hon. EG Whitlam. Paddy was a great supporter of mine, and during my first federal election campaign in 2001 he staffed the pre-poll booth on most days. I might add that he was approaching the age of 80 at that point. He broke down in disappointment when neither I nor Labor won that election, but I know that he would have been very proud on 24 November 2007. Elected Labor representatives are carried into office on the shoulders of great men like Paddy Koppman. To PaddyI owe a personal debt and so too does the Australian Labor Party. I pass on my regards to Paddy’s wife, Jo, and his family. He was a great man indeed. I would also like to pay tribute to another great community worker, Mrs Trish Spillane. Trish was a long-time member of the St Marys branch of the Red Cross, tirelessly raising funds for the numerous causes that are generously supported by the Red Cross. In her early days, Trish was a keen swimmer, racing against Australian Olympic great Dawn Fraser at North Narrabeen pools and selected for the train-on squad for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. She could have been among the ranks of Australia’s golden girls of the pool, but her family could not afford to send her to Melbourne. For Trish, this was probably a blessing in disguise. A few years later she met her husband, Joe, and they began their long life together. In fact, they would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary next month. MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Adjournment

I valued my friendship with Trish and, along with my local community, I mourn her passing. Trish was a great local contributor and her absence will be sadly felt by many in the St Marys community. I pass on my condolences to Joe and his family and wish them all the best in the future. Individuals such as Paddy Koppman and Trish Spillane, great community workers and advocates, are the very glue that binds together a community such as that in which I live. TodayI acknowledge their tremendous contributions to our community and wish their families all the best in the future. Drought Research and Development both state and federal government decisions are having on my electorate of Mallee. There are three issues I want to address. The first is water. Over the last five years at least, elderly citizens right across the vast expanse of Mallee, which is a third of the state of Victoria, have been carting their greywater in buckets and have been restricted to one-minute showers. Horticulturalists, who are wealth creators and the centre of the economic activity in my constituency, particularly along the Murray River, have zero allocations. These people grow food. At the same time. I have heard complaints about the rising cost of food, particularly vegetables and fresh fruit. The impact of this lack of water on communities like Swan Hill and Mildura is dire. We have a government that is preoccupied with the needs of the environment, which are very serious-and I accept how serious they are, but that is more popular in big cities. The grim reality is that my constituents are watching their whole lives’ work-in effect, their superannuation-literally die before them. Vines and citrus are dying from a lack of water. It is just tragic. Then you add to that the decision that had to be made by CSIRO in June following the federal government’s slashing of CSIRO’s budget. The Merbein research laboratory, which was principally focused on horticulture and vegetable research, has been closed. That has meant that 30 highly qualified scientists within the Sunraysia community, which Merbein is part of, are leaving the district. The proposal from CSIRO is that they will go to Adelaide. I have to put up with the government’s defence on this. The government says that this is a decision by CSIRO, yet the May budget dramatically slashed the CSIRO budget by $60 million a year. Australians are immensely proud of that organisation. The former government progressively increased its funding because research is the means by which we will meet the challenges of the future, particularly climate change. I have to listen every day in the chamber to the Prime Minister and Labor members boasting about what they do for research, but the grim reality I have confronted is that the very tools with which we arm particularly agriculture to face the challenges of climate change are being removed. Then, in August, we had an announcement by the Victorian state government, through the Department of Primary Industries, of the closure of the Walpeup grain research facility. Walpeup is a small community on the Mallee Highway, an hour south of Mildura. There are MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
341,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (12.01 Pm),"I express my deep concern about the impact that25 scientists working in that facility, developing grain research that gives our growers the capacity to use varieties which can be grown with reduced rainfall outcomes-and the state government is boldly naming the federal government as the cause of the closure, because of cutbacks to research. I find this incredibly difficult to accept because research is funded by grower levies. The Grains Research and Development Corporation collects grain growers levies and invests them, and a lot of that valuable funding is directed to the Walpeup research station. The same thing happens with Merbein in horticulture. There are a whole range of commodities that contribute through levies to fund valuable research. My constituents watch the evening news or listen to the broadcast of parliament and hear the Prime Minister boasting about his commitment to research and to primary production to cope with the challenges of climate change-and I am sorry to say it but they find themselves fairly cynical about the government’s commitment. I am not just concerned about this; I am absolutely alarmed. Those 30 scientists associated with the Merbein CSIRO facilities are valuable to the community and, in a direct sense, probably contribute around $2 million or $3 million into the local economy, but more important is the valuable research they have been providing that has given my growers the opportunity to cope with the challenges they confront. I have to say that the federal government stands condemned for its role in closing down important facilities in my constituency. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Local Infrastructure posite, my glass is half full rather than half empty. I am very pleased today to be able to announce that a future constituent of mine in the Braddon electorate is in the gallery todayTaya Cropper, from St Brendan-Shaw College. I welcome Taya and her colleagues in the Rotary-parliamentary education exchange. Congratulations to you all. I hope you are getting everything you wanted from this and that you are finding it interesting. I will use my time, if I may, to congratulate this government and the community I come from on achieving some important funding grants which are going to make my community even better than it is now. Just to remind you, I come from the north-west coast of Tasmania. It is a beautiful place. My communities are united and yet at the same time my electorate is divided into lots of different little towns, all the way along the coast and all with their individual character. The good news I was able to announce last Friday, particularly through the work of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Minister for Sport and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-and not forgetting the Minister for Health and Ageing-was the resurrection of $1 million that went missing, hidden somewhere in the system since 2004. I give recognition to the former government for dishing out a bit of dough, but the money went missing and we never knew what was going to happen to it. They tried to resurrect it in the last week of the election campaign, but, of course, like everything else it was all form and no substance and we had to find it and use it. So we have used it and we were able to offer $1 million to the Burnie City Council to enhance the programs that they have been progressively introducing since the mid-1990s, when, as members might remember, we had very serious issues with the closure of our pulp mill and the downgrading of the paper mill. In fact, rather than just being depressed as they were used to being depressed, as manufacturing was closing down, Burnie-along with the north-west MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
342,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.06 Pm),"Unlike my friend the member for Forrest opcoast but particularly Burnie-decided to invest in itself, to have faith in itself and to look up and out rather than down. They developed a strategy for rejuvenating their community that involved some fundamental principles that have been applied broadly to the city’s development, which I would like to share with you: valuing Bumie’s unique places, upholding the arts and people’s ability to express their creativity, rebuilding a strong sense of community through events that embrace the whole of the community, engaging youth as the future lifeblood of the region and investing in significant infrastructure to help people feel proud of their city again. To enhance that, to support people who are already helping themselves, the $1 million was used in a way that was determined by that community. It was shared as follows. $450,000 went towards the redevelopment of the Burnie United Soccer and Sporting Club facilities. This is a great soccer club with a great tradition but, let me tell you, its facilities really are second-rate. In actual fact, because they have to share the same change room, the girls team will come and hold the change room door so the girls can change. When they have finished, the blokes will come and hold the door so they can change and then out they trot. That is over 150 club participants in a sport 1,000 strong in that region. I would say they are very much in need of these funds. $350,000 has gone towards the development of an indoor sports facility at West Park. This is the first stage of a long-term development of sporting facilities at the city’s premier sporting arena and it is complemented by the $3 million we have committed to developing the Burnie waterfront precinct and sports area. Finally, $200,000 has gone towards the relocation of the Burnie Bowls Club to Les Clark Oval. This will, again, complement and enhance the sporting facilities of the Burnie region. It is great to be able to announce good news, it is great to have one of our fellow citizens here and it was lovely to meet her earlier today. Hinkler Electorate: Vietnam Veterans Day nam Veterans Day commemorations in my electorate-one at Bundaberg and one at Hervey Bay. I attended the latter. After a march from the RSL, Vietnam veterans, civic officials, families and members of the public assembled at the Hervey Bay cenotaph. The day was of particular relevance because Harry Smith, three of his platoon commanders, Geoff Kendall of 10 platoon, Bob Buick of 11 platoon and Dave Sabben of 12 platoon, along with Bill Roche, Russ Pendaris, Buddy Lea and Max Cameron-eight veterans of the Battle of Long Tanwere present in Hervey Bay. Max Cameron, Buddy Lea and Harry Smith all live in Hervey Bay. It was very moving to have eight of those veterans together. They came because their commander, Harry, had been quite ill and, whilst he was on the mend, they wanted to be with him. I saw an extraordinary thing that day. It followed the normal Vietnam Veterans Day commemorations except that, when these eight guys went up as a group, laid their wreaths and stepped back from the cenotaph, the crowd burst into prolonged applause, which I have never seen at a cenotaph before. It said it all-that these people, many of whom had been deprived of decorations for all that time, were finally being acknowledged.

343,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.11 Pm),"On Monday, 18 August, there were two major Vietpated in. When this whole veterans’ decorations thing is straightened out, we will be much the richer for it. Harry Smith has been awarded the Star of Gallantry-the equivalent of his original recommendation for the DSO, second only to the Victoria Cross-in recognition of his conspicuous leadership and gallantry during the battle. His original citation had been downgraded to a Military Cross. Two of the platoon commanders, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall, were awarded the Medal for Gallantry-the equivalent to the Military Cross-after their original recommendations were downgraded to ‘Mentioned in Despatches’. The strength of D Company 6RAR in Vietnam on 18 August 1966 has been given approval to wear the former Republic of Vietnam’s Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation Emblem. As we know, there is no longer a South Vietnamese government, so these guys have been allowed to wear that decoration which was recommended for them in 1966. Two former officers and 10 soldiers will have their original recommendations for honours re-examined by the independent Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. Harry Smith himself has selflessly promoted this cause. I commend him and support his stance. He is currently in the process of preparing a submission to the tribunal asking that the 12 men who served in the battle of Long Tan have their original gallantry recommendations reinstated and recognised: three medals for gallantry and nine commendations for gallantry, replacing the original military medals and mentions in dispatches. For the record, the causes he is promoting are those of Delta Company’s Gordon Sharp, posthumously because he was killed in action; Bill Roche; Ian Campbell; Geoff Peters; Barry Magnussen; Neil Bextrum; Allan May; Noel Grimes; and Bill Moore; and of the APC Reaction Force’s Adrian Roberts, Frank Alcorta, and the late Ron Brett. Ron, who was wounded in Vietnam, died in a motor vehicle accident in Australia some years ago. I commend Harry Smith. As I stood there that day I thought that justice had finally been done for some of those men and that it needed to be done for the rest of them, the other 12. I will follow this matter in this parliament like a hawk until that honour has been given. The ceremony at Hervey Bay ended with a whole flock of white doves being released, symbolic of the 17 men who laid down their lives in Vietnam and the one man who died later. (Time expired) Adoption tant issue not only for me personally but also for the state of Queensland. FirstlyI will give a little bit of history. In my maiden speech on 19 February this year I spoke about my background, my past and the fact that I am an adoptee. Interestingly enough, in 1960, when I was born, my mother was only 17 years of age and there were no support systems in place and no way for her to be able to care for a child in that situation. She came from a large family and, while they made all possible arrangements, it was decided in the end that I would be adopted. I have had a great upbringing and a great life and I certainly have no regrets. In 1989 I was fortunate enough to be reunited with my birth family. I can say that the journey up to that point was quite an elaborate one, being at a time when legislation, certainly that of Queensland, did not provide support or access for people who were in that situation. In 1990 the then Goss Queensland government, through Minister Anne Warner, introduced what were then revolutionary amendments to the Adoption of Children Act. In fact, the Adoption of MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
344,Mr Raguse (Forde) (12.16 Pm),"I rise today to speak on what I believe is a very imporChildren Act then and to this day is still the most restrictive in Australia. It is still wedged in a period of time when there were so many social differences as to understanding. For me, to be part of the changes to that legislation in 1990 was very important. Unfortunately, the amendments at that time did not go far enough. They certainly went far enough to match a balanced community expectation, but the difficulty is that they created even more of a minority of people who wanted access to their adoption information. Put simply, they essentially disallowed people from getting information about their birth. As I have said, my upbringing was a very good one. While my adoptive parents were very supportive and always wanted me to know as much as I could, that restricted information situation applied to everyone. I was very lucky that they had my original adoption order. Up until 1964 your mother would be named on that particular document. My mother’s name was Denise Mary Smith, and of course with a name like ‘Smith’ it was going to be quite difficult. Given that there were no government processes to allow me to find further information, that was where I sat. At the age of 15 and not knowing of the restrictions of the law-and, as I said, my adoptive parents were very supportive-I attempted to make some contact to find out a little bit more about who I was. The straight answer from government at that stage was no. When I did turn 18 I would be an adult in law and I would get access to a birth certificate-and I did, although it was not my birth certificate but a thing they called a ‘schedule’. Interestingly enough, the comparisons are quite subtle. When you look at them collectively, you do note that one is a birth certificate and one-mine-is a schedule. That aside, on 14 July this year the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, and Minister for Child Safety, Margaret Keech, announced that the Queensland government would be developing new laws to open up access to birth information. These laws are being developed and will go through a long consultation process. I believe that submissions on these changes will be accepted up until September. As I said, that process will take its own path. But I will just give you an example of the very simple changes that we need. Currently, there are vetos on information. Information is released, if there is an agreement. If there is a veto, that information is perpetually locked up. It is locked up even beyond someone becoming deceased. So once parents, siblings or others, who may at some time have decided to put in place a veto on that information, are deceased, it is locked up forever. In Queensland there are about 3,000 people who are affected by these particular laws. That is one concern and one of the major amendments. I am very pleased, though, that the Minister for Child Safety, who has a very difficult portfolio-any child safety minister around this country has a very difficult portfolio-has made this move. I think this shows a glimmer of hope, certainly for the people of Queensland. As I said before, these laws are the most restrictive laws in the country and, while I was involved in 1990 with those first amendments, I am pleased that, in talking here today 18 years later, there are further moves and I hope good moves. To give one last very important example, at age 28, in 1988 I had my first son. I had to talk to a specialist, with my wife, about my medical background. She had all the information; I simply said, ‘I’m adopted.’ Even the specialist did not believe that I had no access to my birth information. I did not know who I was, where I came from or whether I had any problems that may have come through my genetic stream. On a medical front, that is certainly another issue that people have. But my experiences have been very positive. My extended family are all MAIN COMMITTEE together now, including my adoptive mother. My adoptive father died some years ago. Again, I would like to commend the new legislation. Climate Change Murray-Darling system. A number of mixed messages are coming from the current government. I would like to place on record, as I have before, some concerns that I have about the way in which the government is responding to the issue of climate change. I believe climate change is a reality, so I am not approaching this matter from a climate change sceptic’s point of view but from the point of view of looking at some of the practical applications of potential policy on the Murray-Darling within the rhetoric of climate change being used. In the last few days in the parliament the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has used the add-on of drought and climate change-and it is part of a process that many ministers are using-and the fact that the Murray-Darling system is in crisis because of previous policy decisions that were made by governments over many decades. It is this add-on of climate change that I would like to address. The current rhetoric suggests, as I said, that climate change is having an impact on the inflows into the Murray-Darling system. If that logic holds, the government-or the Minister for Climate Change and Water or the minister for the environment-should have a figure that relates to the loss of inflows into the Murray-Darling system which have been caused by climate change. You might have noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the parliament yesterday I kept interjecting, asking the environment minister: how many gigalitres of water are attributable to climate change? Because, if you cannot quantify the gigalitres then the credibility of the argument that the inflows into the Murray-Darling system are due to climate change becomes somewhat dicey. SoI call on the government to quantify how much has climate change, an unnatural event, caused the reduction in the amount of water in the Murray-Darling system? I would like to take that a step further. If it can be shown that half a million megalitres or one million megalitres of inflow has stopped and that has been caused not within the system but outside the system and is due to human global emissions then the government should look at adding some water to the system. That is fairly simple. People will say: ‘Here we go again, bringing water from the coast or down from Queensland.’ If human greenhouse gas emissions outside that valley have had an impact on that valley then that is an option that needs to be looked at. In the past when people have talked about bringing water into the Murray-Darling system the argument has been that that would be unnatural and would have an impact on salinity and a whole range of other things. If the government is going to run this line that climate change has caused part of the reduction in the inflow and that most of those causes are outside that valley, then surely one of the options should be to bring water into the system. I would also like to address briefly these other arguments about the barrages at the end of the Murray mouth, Lake Alexandrina and the crisis that is occurring in South Australia at the moment. I have been to that area on a number of occasions. It is an absolute disgrace what the South Australians have done at the end of the Murray. Most people do not know that there is a dam. A lot of people condemn Cubbie Station, and I do too-I think the government should purchase that piece of land-but exactly the same thing has happened at the end of the Murray. The Murray is dammed with a series of barrages. I agree with the government on MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Adjournment

(Time expired) United States of America Australia-US Parliamentary Friendship Group. I want to reflect on our relationship with the great country of the United States as it moves towards its presidential election. In the last few weeks we have had the visit of the US JohnS McCain in Sydney and Melbourne. Many ship visits happen in Australia. Isn’t it interesting that the great American admiral after whom that ship is named was the grandfather of John McCain? The ship was here to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Great White Fleet, the first visit of an American fleet to Australia. In some senses, the visit of the Great White Fleet recognised that Australia was and is an independent country. Despite the concerns of the British embassy at the time, the American fleet visited this country. The US-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group had breakfast at the American embassy this morning. The US ambassador was the gracious host. There were about 50 members of parliament there. He and Mimi McCallum treated us with their usual great kindness and hospitality. We all reflected on the fact that there are so many connections between Australians and Americans at many different levels, not just at the expected security level through the My relationship with the United States goes back to 1979 when I was a participant in the East Asia South Pacific Youth Leader Project. Never will I forget the kindness shown to me by the farmers in Illinois who I stayed with for a few days-they drove me to Chicago for one night to celebrate Passover-or the Marine pilots who worked with Pan Am who I celebrated thanksgiving with in upstate New England. We continue to see that kind of profound relationship with our political leaders now. For instance, it was fascinating to see Julia Gillard talk to Paul Bongiorno on Channel 10’s Meet the Press program. She said, in discussing plans for Australian education: I think we all know from our television screens as much as anything else that New York is a city with pockets of very great wealth and pockets of very great poverty and disadvantage. And Joel Klein’s model has made a difference to those pockets of poverty and disadvantage. And when you see a model that is working in some of those tough suburbs in New York, then I think you’ve got to take notice of it. Similarly, it is very interesting to see our great Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, take his concerns about supplying uranium to India to the United States to make people there understand that it is very important to get India to participate in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. So it is a two-way relationship, not just a one-way relationship. It is very interesting to see the maturing of the Australian media. Unlike Mr Pilger, with his turgid America-phobic presentation on Q&A, we have serious people like Leigh Sales, the former Washington correspondent for the ABC, Barry Cassidy and Tony Jones, host of Lateline, with access to equally serious players right across the political spectrum in this period before the US presidential election. Even the conservative Wall Street Journal Asia said that Julia Gillard’s recent presentation in Washington was very impressive.

No matter where they meet-whether in a law firm in New York, on a movie shoot in Hollywood, backpacking in the Greek islands or serving alongside each other in Afghanistan-Australians and Americans just seem to click. I would not underestimate the role of popular culture in cementing this. Australians have been the beneficiaries of our successful involvement in US popular culture, as we have seen with Heath Ledger in the great box office success The Dark Knight. It is a great tragedy that his life was taken away. But isn’t it fascinating to see Australian actors, people in music and people from all kinds of cultures so successful in this globalised world because of our intimate understanding of things American. Some time ago I was at a gay festival in Melbourne, which had a Doris Day festival at the end of it. The singer had won New York Cabaret Artist of the Year. A friend of mine, Robbie Weil, won ‘best imitation of an orthodox rabbi’ at the New York Comedy Festival. A war of aggression threatened both Australia and the US. This is what Julia Gillard meant when she said: The bedrock of that relationship is the US-Australia alliance, which was signed 57 years ago, but which reflected the judgments-clear, accurate, brutally frank judgments-of an Australian Labor Prime Minister a decade earlier. That is, ‘Look to America.’ At this point, may I welcome our visitors. Aboriginal Suicide Rate ing the Rotary sponsored students who are here in Parliament House for the week. I hope they are enjoying this experience. row in an apology to the stolen generation. It was very important symbolically, but now Indigenous people need to be empowered to manage the pressing social and economic issues in their communities. One issue that has come to my attention in recent weeks is the rate of suicide in Aboriginal communities. It is truly tragic. Six males have committed suicide in the wheat belt town of Narrogin, in my electorate of Pearce, since January this year. Four of these were local Aboriginal community members aged between 21 and 30 years. I understand that a further four Aboriginal men in Narrogin attempted suicide over the past month. Indeed, since I have been here this week I have had a report of another attempted suicide. Fortunately, they were not successful, but it is obvious that there is a most serious problem needing urgent attention. It is having a shocking impact on the whole community. On hearing of this tragedy I contacted the state and federal ministers for health to ask for assistance and for some action to be taken. The first reply was from the state Minister for Health, the Hon. Jim McGinty, saying several meetings had been arranged. I visited Narrogin soon after making that approach and, during the visit, the Narrogin Aboriginal Community Reference Group, whom I met with, said that there had been very few practical outcomes MAIN COMMITTEE",173,ANZUS Treaty But At All Levels Of Politics Culture And The Economy

350,Mrs Moylan,"Earlier this year parliament witnessed an incredible outpouring of sorfrom those meetings. That group is working extremely hard to try to make sure that culturally appropriate services are brought to the town. They have been working with the community to try to establish services to avoid the needless loss of young lives. I find it extraordinary that currently there is no Aboriginal health service in the wheat belt. The reference group have asked the state government to fund an Aboriginal controlled response which is culturally appropriate for the issues faced by young Aboriginal people. Included in this would be a men’s shelter, a medical centre, a youth officer and a community development officer. I pay tribute to Oxfam’s work. It is a non-government organisation and it has taken responsibility for providing emergency responses by funding an Aboriginal psychologist, Darrell Henry, who will work in the town for a week each month seeing patients and training two local people as community support workers. It is a matter of enduring shame that, in a state that is awash with money from the mining boom, practical support to assist Aborigina1 people in the wheat belt to manage their own community issues is simply not available. While the state government coffers overflow with taxes, little finds its way back into the wheat belt for essential services. I think that is very sad indeed. During my visit to Narrogin, I was also shocked while meeting some of the people delivering services in a general sense when I was told that there are only two part-time mental health support workers to cover an area of 48,000 square kilometres from Narrogin to the port city of Bunbury and to the other port city of Albany. It is a massive area and there is only one psychiatrist for that total area. Further, there has been no increase in funding for these services for 12 years. For the past 12 years, there has been no increase in funding. We have been going through a drought as well and many young farmers are also taking their lives, so this is not just an issue that affects Indigenous people-but it is sad that there are not culturally specific services to address some of these issues. I know the rural community is working very hard to try to help both the farming sector and the Indigenous community. The psychologist, Darrell Henry, has also committed to providing Narrogin with telephone and teleconference support during his weeks away from the town. Both state and federal governments need to commit more money to train Aboriginal people to provide appropriate support within their local communities. It is these practical measures that will go a long way to better managing the health of Aboriginal people in the wheat belt. (Time expired) Ms Lois Roberts Ms SAFFIN (Page) (12.37 pm)-I want to talk about a local woman, a friend of mine, who died in 1999. Her name was Lois Martha Roberts. Lois was tragically and brutally murdered. I am going to quote something that I have said before when I was in another parliament when I talked about Lois. I am going to use some of the comments I made about her then. I have given a promise and undertaking to continue to talk about Lois and hopefully one day her murderers will be found. On 22 January 1999 I attended the funeral of Lois Martha Roberts. Lois was a friend, and she was 39 years old. She was the daughter of Muriel Roberts and Pastor Frank Roberts, deceased. Lois was a mother to Charles and Emily, a sister to Philip, Rhoda and Mark, an aunty, a granddaughter, a friend to MAIN COMMITTEE many and a local identity. At Lois’ funeral we were given a script which said ‘A Celebration of the life of Lois Martha Roberts’. That is how Lois’s funeral was conducted, as a celebration of her life. Lois lived her life as a free spirit. I have known Lois for approximately 21 or 22 yearsit is a bit longer nowShe was a young woman when I first met her. She was beautiful, vivacious, glamorous and intelligent. A local hairdresser, she had the world at her feet. Even then she had a free and joyous spirit. Lois came from a family that had contributed enormously to family life. Her father, Pastor Frank Roberts, was an icon in Aboriginal affairs. Known for his passion and commitment to social justice at all levels of public life, national, State and local, he had a wonderful presence and a wonderful voice. Indeed, the whole family contributed to the betterment of community life. It was into this family that Lois was born. Lois then, as a young woman, tragically suffered severe injuries in a car accident and sustained permanent head injuries. This event changed her life. I always thought about Lois’s life as before and after the accident. Lois was in hospital for a time and then returned home, where she carved out her place in the community. She was known to alland loved by allShe frequently travelled around our area by hitchhiking, often to Nimbin and back. Lois loved Nimbin and its community embraced her. I often saw Lois hitchhiking and would pick her up. I would go a long way out of my way to make sure that she got to her destination safely. Lois was respected by many and in turn she respected many, including her elders. Her uncle Fletcher talked about this at her funeral. Before Lois’s accident she called me Janelle… When I became active in public life I became Miss Saffin. I used to say to her, “Come on Lois, I am still Janelle. She would say, “Yes, but you are now Miss Saffin.” She continued to call me Miss Saffin until she died. Everyone knew Lois, she was totally trusting. She had opinions on all manner of things including politics and would commend or chide me as was her wish. She would often say to me, “Miss Saffin, I haven’t seen you in the media lately. It is time to get in there again.” She watched everything that we did. She was courageous in expressing her views, many of which she shared with me. The last time. I saw Lois before she died she had fallen from her pushbike at the roundabout in Lismore. I was driving by in a truck and managed to pick up Lois and her bike, put Lois in the truck, take her home and care for her. We had a nice time that afternoon. Lois was tragically and brutally murdered. She was last seen hitchhiking in Nimbin’s main street, near the police station. Lois would have trusted those who offered her a lift and who ultimately betrayed herShe was later found in Whian Whian State ForestHer murderers are still unknown. As her mother, Muriel, said at the funeral, she wanted people to think about Lois’s tragic murder with forgiveness. She could find it in her heart to forgive. I will read from the script that was given to us at the funeral: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” saith the Lord. That was the spirit of Lois’s funeral. I go for morning walks, and I walk past the house where Lois lived, which is around the corner from me. When I am at home in LismoreI am frequently reminded about Lois when I pass by her house. My undertaking was to continue to talk about her. I hope that we can get a stronger investigation into her death. MAIN COMMITTEE Green Corps heart-a program that I have been a strong advocate of, and extremely proud of, throughout my time in parliament-Green Corps. Green Corps is a popular and innovative scheme which allows young people aged between 17 and 20 to demonstrate their commitment to preserving and restoring Australia’s environment and heritage. The coalition government introduced the program, honouring its 1996 election commitment. Since that time the program has had great success not only in my electorate of Canning but throughout the country. More than 18,000 participants have planted more than 14 million trees, erected 8,000 kilometres of fencing, removed 50,000 hectares of weeds and conducted more than 5,000 surveys encouraging community groups into environmental projects. It is one of Labor’s worse-kept secrets that it plans to axe this program. Following the government’s earlier announcement that it would abolish the $291 per week allowance for participants and extend eligibility to all age groups, this week the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations confirmed that Green Corps would not continue as a separate program. The government has been trying to keep its plans off the radar, but Labor cannot continue to spout its ‘green credentials’ while it slashes environmental funding and axes programs which so clearly make a difference. Actions speak louder than words, Mr Rudd. Considering that around 75 per cent of Green Corps projects have been based in rural and regional areas, this is just another slap in the face to country Australia from a city-centric government. One of the major success factors for Green Corps is the involvement of the local community in activities. Projects are community based and involve multiple partners from the community as well as state, territory and local governments. Only a month ago I attended the graduation ceremony of participants in what was called the Youth, Riffles, Rapids and Riparian Planting in the Peel Inlet Green Corps project. This team completed a wide range of activities to help develop and improve the biodiversity of the Peel Inlet. Pinjarra’s growth has had a direct impact on the Murray River and, with input from local environmental groups and the support of the Shire of Murray, rehabilitation strategies including weed control, baffle boarding and planting of local species were implemented by this team. Congratulations to the team leader, Emma, and to Greening Australia for their great work. Participants gain accreditation in conservation and land management-they get to certificate I level and they can go on from there-horticulture, first aid and occupational health and safety. But the program provides far greater skills to young Australians then practical horticultural skills. Green Corps is not just about planting trees; in many cases the experience helps shape a direction for these young people and gives them the confidence they need to get ahead in life and their future careers. In Canning, Green Corps participants have completed some outstanding environmental projects, such as the Fairbridge heritage and South Dandalup River restoration project, which involved the conservation of declared rare flora and the refurbishment of Newton Cottage, which had unique shingling. Another was the Peel Harvey rehabilitation project, where local native species were planted, and the team constructed pathways, boardwalks and a viewing platform at Lake Geogorup. In another project, a team working at South Yunderup helped reMAIN COMMITTEE",174,ANZUS Treaty But At All Levels Of Politics Culture And The Economy
351,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.42 Pm),"I rise to speak on a matter that is close to myhabilitate South Yunderup’s Centenary Park and address the degradation of riverbanks caused by boating. Another project, the Serpentine-Jarrahdale Heritage Park project, involved trail construction to facilitate access to Gooralong Brook and improvements to Jarrahdale’s heritage-listed Mill Managers House. I have met most of the graduates from the projects I mentioned, and an increasing number of Indigenous people are now involved. I know many of them have gone on to further training and some have taken employment in the horticulture field. I have heard nothing but good stories and outcomes from this program and I believe that it is an absolute travesty that this highly successful program will be trashed under the Rudd Labor government. Fremantle Electorate: Rottnest Island Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (12.47 pm)-Every member of this house has an electorate rich in history and in character, and I would like to draw members’ attention to a unique part of the Fremantle electorate, Rottnest Island. Located 19 kilometres off the coast of Fremantle, Rottnest Island is 11 kilometres long and 4½ kilometres wide, and was named by the Dutch explorer de Vlamingh, who landed there in 1696 and thought the native marsupial quokkas were rats, hence ‘rat’s nest’. Rottnest Island has many important heritage aspects. It was notoriously used as a prison for Aboriginal people. It was a military base during World War II. More recently, Rottnest has been made an A-class environmental reserve and is a popular tourist destination: over 500,000 tourists visit the island each year. I would like to speak, firstly, of Rottnest Island’s Indigenous heritage in a little more detail. Seven thousand years ago, Rottnest was connected to the Western Australian mainland. Over the millennia, moving seas turned it into an island. Tools that have been found on Rottnest Island indicate that Aboriginal people were there many thousands of years ago. In our more recent history, Rottnest was used as a prison for Aboriginal people for almost a century, starting in 1838. The island has some very sad stories to tell about the treatment of Aboriginal people in WA. The heritage officers at Rottnest informed me that many of the Aboriginal men who were prisoners on Rottnest Island were leaders and lawmen in their own communities. They were in some cases transported many thousands of kilometres to be put on an island with other Aboriginal men from all over Western Australia, many of them not even speaking the same language. Not only would this have been a terrifying and bewildering experience for the men but also, almost certainly, it would have devastated the Aboriginal communities that had been deprived of their leaders. Over 3,700 Aboriginal men and boys were sent to the island over the course of its use as a prison. While there, the men were required to construct buildings and perform other work that was completely alien to their own culture and experience. Three hundred and sixty nine men are recorded as having died on Rottnest Island and it is believed that many more died when they were released to the mainland and had to find their way back to their lands hundreds or even thousands of kilometres from the Fremantle port. The buildings and structures that many of the Aboriginal men built are still used on the island today, including the quod, which had been the prison and is now part of the Rottnest Lodge Resort, and the lighthouses on the island. More recently, steps have been taken to include Aboriginal people in the decision making processes on the island, to reclaim the Aboriginal burial grounds, which were formerly used as tourist camping facilities, and to rebuild and celebrate the spiritual connection of the Aboriginal people with this place. MAIN COMMITTEE In relation to Rottnest Island’s military heritage, I was pleased to have been able to invite the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to visit the island recently. It was an eye-opening experience for him, as it was for me the first time. I went there, to see what a significant role the island played during Australia’s wartime history. The island was first used for military purposes during World War I, when it was used as an internment camp for 1,300 Germans and Croatians. During World War II, the island became a key defence post. By 1942, 2,500 military personnel were stationed there. Rottnest Island had two extremely large, nine-inch guns for the purpose of defending Fremantle port and the south-west coastline. These guns are in their original locations atop two hills overlooking the sea and they are the largest in-situ guns in the country. One of these guns has been fully restored and is open for inspection to the public. Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, the other gun has not been restored. There is also an elaborate system of tunnels and underground rooms or battle stations, including mapping rooms, where many women were stationed during the war. These facilities, which are not currently open to the public due to safety concerns, are also deteriorating and in serious need of repair. I hope that funds will become available for this purpose in order to preserve this important part of our history. In relation to Rottnest Island’s natural heritage, Rottnest is a great model for sustainable tourism. Many people come to the island to enjoy the beaches, snorkelling, scuba diving and fishing. The Rottnest Island Authority has done a wonderful job in ensuring their operations are sustainable and do not damage the island. In the near future, work will begin on an eco resort which will have a five-star green rating. As the member for Fremantle, I encourage members to visit Rottnest Island to gain an appreciation of its rich Indigenous, military and environmental heritage, and also to stay and enjoy its relaxed atmosphere and beautiful nature. Diabetes a few words. I would like to talk about diabetes. Well before this century reaches its halfway mark, the global affliction of diabetes will have seriously challenged the health and the budgets of all nations. Diabetes is not just a matter of concern to health professionals; it will have brought incalculable harm to the quality of life for individuals, with consequences for the social fabric of nations. The dilemma for richer nations will be drastic, but for poorer nations it will be catastrophic. All over the globe, diabetes is an insidious blight to income production, to creativity and, indeed, to life expectancy. The conflict we are waging is fast becoming too late for too many, particularly in the small Pacific nations. The number of people affected is in the millions and the process from decision making to action is a challenge of considerable magnitude. On Tuesday in this place the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, which I chair, cohosted a summit with Diabetes Australia. Some of the best clinicians in the country came to this place to deliberate on how we might move forward with policies that will help us to stem the diabetes pandemic in Australia. We had notable people such as Professor Martin Silink, the President of the International Diabetes Federation; Dr Gary Deed, the President of Diabetes Australia; Professor Ruth Colagiuri and her husband; and Professor George Rubin, who facilitated the event-amongst others. We also work closely with the Juvenile Diabetes ReMAIN COMMITTEE",177,ANZUS Treaty But At All Levels Of Politics Culture And The Economy
352,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.52 Pm),"It is a privilege to have a second opportunity to saysearch Foundation, and they were represented by their Chief Executive Officer, Mike Wilson, and Sarah Harrison. I would like to pay tribute to the work of our peak organisations in trying to manage this terrible disease of diabetes in this country. They do a marvellous job. Diabetes Australia manages the national scheme. I also look forward to getting a summary of the deliberations from the summit on Tuesday because it will help us to know what direction we have to move in as legislators in this place to stem the tide of diabetes. Finally, I would also like to pay tribute to the work of my many colleagues in this place, some 60-plus in number, who are members of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group who continue to support this important work. Newcastle City Council: Elections Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.55 pm)-I want to draw attention to the fact that before we return to parliament, in just over a week, local government elections will be held in New South Wales. The election in Newcastle is very important because our city faces several important challenges. Our CBD is facing the challenges of revitalisation, continuing the wonderful work started by the Building Better Cities program, and of ensuring it has a diverse heart that reflects retail, residential, commercial, creative and recreational activities. We also have to overcome significant infrastructure neglect across the whole city, which is delaying our progress. Another challenge for our city is providing effective and efficient management as we bring in a new general manager, who I wish well and I welcome to our city. We also need a council and councillors who will best serve the basic needs of our people and our residents. We need to know that essential services are delivered in the best, most timely and most efficient ways that represent value for money. The other great challenge for the city of Newcastle is as a leader: as the regional capital that helps to lead the development of the Hunter region. Given those challenges, I wish to say that I think it is time for new leadership, a new set of councillors and a new approach in our city. We need leadership that is genuinely collaborative, consultative and inclusive of all the stakeholders of our city, without fear or favour. We also need leadership that assists our city to have a strong and united voice that reflects the vision of the people of Newcastle for the city’s future. We need councillors with a more modern focus. From working with younger people, I do know that they have new ways of looking at engagement and of communicating. They also understand best practice in management and efficiencies. They understand that it takes some particular modern practices to build a strong, effective and efficient city and to give people confidence in the probity and accountability of the city council. We need councillors in our city who are willing to commit to the young people of our city, to value them and to understand that they make an important contribution. Regrettably, in our city they have become the focus of negative attention because of the emphasis on binge drinking and those sorts of minority antisocial events. It is time for our young people to be given more encouragement. Certainly there should be more encouragement for the creative side of our city that enriches their lives and allows them to remain in our cities and become great citizens of the future. That is the sort of harmony that I think our new councillors could build. I want to commend to the city of Newcastle the Labor team. They are young. They are vibrant. They are committed. They are the youngest team we have ever put up, with an average age of less than 40, and they are standing for council at the peak of their careers and family life. It is unusual because city councillors are often people who have retired and are coming MAIN COMMITTEE back to contribute something, but I think it is important in this century that we take on new and younger people who are willing to make a real investment. SoI commend Sharon Claydon, Tim Crakanthorp, Nuatali Nelmes and Michael Jackson, who are all in lead positions in their wards. I also commend to the people of Newcastle our lord mayoral candidate, Marilyn Eade, an experienced and effective councillor who has stood aside from a council position to put herself before the people solely as a lord mayoral candidate willing to lead a young and vibrant team who share her ambitions for our city: that it can truly take its place as a regional capital and live up to the reputation it has earnt-but perhaps does not communicate to the rest of Australia as strongly as it could-as the seventh largest city, by population, in Australia. tions.
