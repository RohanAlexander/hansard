Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I urged the Government last night to consent to the adjournment of the debate because the hour was late, and one or two matters had cropped up during the discussion to which I wished to address myself. The adjournment was all the more desirable because it was only yesterday that with the very voluminous amendments which the Government have put before us. I regret that they have not introduced a reprinted Bill, embodying these amendments in their proper places, so that we might judge of their exact effect. At the present time it is a work of great labour to take each amendment separately, and see how one affects another or is affected by the provisions of the Bill. For instance, before coming to a final conclusion upon the amendment now before the Chair, one would wish to know how it is likely to be affected by the other amendments of which notice has been given. The effect of one provision in the original Bill upon another is very easily seen by merely reading the clauses j but it is a very difficult matter to know exactly what the effect of the proposed amendments would be without going to the trouble of annotating a copy of the measure as originally introduced. No doubt the Government felt compelled to propose these amendments in order to get the measure into a shape which would harmonize with their policy. I regret that the Bill, and particularly the clause with which we are now dealing, has been to a large extent the sport of party strife. Under these",12,Public Service Increments

Under present conditions, we are likely to obtain a measure which will not be consistent with itself, and may not operate in the direction which all the advocates of the great reform which we are endeavouring to achieve desire. The clause before us is largely the crux of the whole position. But, notwithstanding my wish to see a strong and capable Government, having behind it a considerable majority, administering' Federal affairs, I cannot recede from my original position that, in any measure providing for compulsory conciliation and arbitration, the railway employees of Australia must be included. It seems to me that such a measure is not called for at all if it is not to be applied to railway' employees, because disputes extending beyond the boundaries of any one State are likely to arise chiefly in connection with railway management. It is only quite recently that we had in Victoria a strike of railway employees, which manv persons engaged in commerce and industry feared would extend to New South Wales. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes. It nearly extended, fon two reasons. The proof is very difficult to. give, but the facts are not so difficult to point out. In one direction the men on strike were appealing for the active sympathy of their fellowworkmen in a neighbouring State; and on the other hand some politicians in this State, who sympathized with the strikers, were appealing to kindred politicians in the neighbouring State to take some action that would show a practical sympathy. If that strike, which was so prejudicial and so dangerous to the interests of Victoria, had extended to the neighbouring State of New South Wales-and probably also to a State on the other side of Victoria-w e should have had a condition of circumstances with which no mere State legislation or action could have coped successfully. What has happened before might happen again; and such' an occurrence is more likely to extend and occupy the theatre of Commonwealth activities in the future than in the past. The railway operatives have now a Federal organization. Consequently, it is much more likely than has been the case in the past that a difficulty originating in any one State will be carried to another. I cannot see, for the life of me, if we wish to have legislation dealing with disputes which extend beyond one State into another, why we should not include, at any rate, the railway operatives. If we do not there is very little demand for such legislation at all, because outside employees of the States Governments we have to anticipate strikes extending beyond the limits of a State only amongst the pastoralists' workmen and shearers, and perhaps amongst seamen. There is already on the notioe-paper an amendment to exclude agricultural and pastoral labourers from the scope of the measure. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There are also some politicians who think that the seamen should be dealt with exclusively in the Navigation Bill. Remove these three classes of labour-the greatest number of operatives or workmen to which we can apply such legislation-awa y from the operation of the measure, and we have scarcely any left except those engaged in ordinary private industries, to which I think this measure will very seldom require to be applied. I think that there is even a greater danger of an invasion of States rights, in attempting to produce an overflowing of disputes in mere private industries from one State to another than by the inclusion of railway operatives. Those honourable members who oppose the inclusion' of railway operatives on the ground that to do so would be an invasion of States rights, must, on their own reasoning, go further, and admit that the whole Bill is an invasion of States rights. While we should be very careful-and I do not think any one is more careful than I am-abou t invading States rights, and should act cautiously in malting this Federation what, I regret to say, it has not been up to the present, a success approved of by the voters throughout Australia, yet it seems to me that there is great force in the argument used by the Attorney General which argument I myself used previously-that we should not sleep upon the constitutional rights which we possess. The sub-section of the Constitution which gives us the power to deal with industrial disputes was inserted for some purpose. That purpose, it seems to me, is plainly expressed ; and, if it has any limitations, as I have before argued, those limitations should be imposed on us by the High Court of Australia. I rather approve of the wording. of the amendment which Ministers have brought down",13,Conciliation And Arbitration

Therefore, and to the extent that Governments indulge, in these industrial enterprises, further point out that, since the elections, those Governments and their employees should come under the operation of a measure like this. right to assume that the application of the measure to such enterprises may be unconstitutional.

In fact, I did not open his communication until after the election. member for Wentworth is in error-and I know a good deal about the matter, as I have in .my constituency a very large number of railway operatives-in thinking that the view of Mr Robert Hollis, that these railway employees should be brought under the operation of such legislation as we are I certainly think it now considering, is not the opinion of the great body of railway employee's throughout Australia^ Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The force of the honourable member's argument was that this view was not adopted by the railway operatives themselves. men would hardly want to be brought under an Arbitration Court, and, at the same time, One of these cerhave some other arrangement made whereby their wages could not be lowered. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I quite believe that. I believe that the railway operatives If the Government are not inclined to go so far as their political leaders ate endeavouring to drag them. But at the same time. I am f u l l y assured that the majority of the railway employees are in favour of being brought under such a measure as this, whether their wages are raised or reduced by its operation.

They simply desired to know whether we were personally in favour of bringing the railway employees under the The honourable member Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I had not the slightest hesitation in replying to these gentlemen that I was pledged from the time of my first election onwards to support the inclusion of railway servants in any arbitration legislation which might be devised. It seemed to me, for reasons already given, that to leave out the railway employees would be, as ' I have said before, like producing the play of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. If we are 'not to deal with railway employees the measure will I did not sign the pledge be practically useless, and consequently if the majority of the Committee are opposed to the Government proposal I shall be But I think that the honourable quite prepared to vote against the third reading of the Bill.",14,Conciliation And Arbitration

EDWARDS -The seamen may hope to be protected by the provisions of the Navigation Bill, and I am not so certain that I should like to place seamen and railway'servants upon the same footing, because there is a vast difference between the two classes of employees. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in the course of his remarks yesterday, referred to the great mining dispute in Colorado, which we are told affects no less than 300,000 employees, and has already involved a loss of ^10,000,000. The honourable and learned member was asked whether he did not think that serious strife such as has occurred in that case was very nearly brought about by the Victorian railway strike. then dealing with the Colorado strike. I would point out, however, that we cannot view such a great strike as that in Colorado without having it borne in upon our minds that we shall be liable to have a similar state of affairs brought about here in connection with our railways, sooner or later, unless we adopt some means for settling disputes. The railway servants are willing that their disputes shall be settled by some such tribunal as we are now about to create, and I contend that in order to protect the States, the capital of the States, and the well-being of the community, we must make some provision for including our great railway systems in our scheme for conciliation and arbitration, so that we may be able to depend upon the wheels continuing to go round. For this reason, I shall support the Government in their present proposal, and I hope that we shall make an honest attempt to settle any great disputes which may extend from one State into another. accept the arguments of the honourable member for South Sydney. us to consider is as to whether there is any likelihood of railway, strikes extending beyond any one State. the railway servants of New South Wales are brought within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of that State, and there is nothing to prevent other States from adopting some form of conciliation and arbitration which will apply to all the public servants, as well as to those who are in private employment. If this were brought about, it would be absolutely impossible for JOHN FORREST -What about the a railway strike to extend beyond the borders of any one State. We may fairly assume that the conciliation and arbitration legislation of any one State would serve to prevent a strike from taking place among its railway servants, and if so, no such strike could occur as would come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. pute, although not a strike. pute which occurred in any one of the States, could be referred to the State Court of Arbitration, and if it were settled by that tribunal-as it ought to be, if this kind of legislation is to be effective-it could not extend beyond the borders of that State.

I am simply saying that each State has the power to legislate in that direction if it so wishes, and doubtless as the years roll on, each State will provide machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes. If not, it is no business of ours, as we have no right to dictate to sovereign States. I consider that the question of bringing railway servants within the scope of this measure, is one of the most important that has been dealt with by this Parliament, because if the Government proposal is carried it will be so far-reaching in its effects upon the stability of the Federation. Last evening I referred to the d if ferences of opinion that existed amongst honourable members of the legal profession with regard to the constitutional aspect of this question. These differences are so grave that we ought to consider whether it is wise for us to proceed any further, until the question now in The question for dispute has been settled. I should like to ask, further, if it is expedient for us, during the first few years of our Federal life, to I understand that embark upon legislation which so directly and distinctly throws down the gage of battle to the States Parliaments.

That strike was very much to be regretted, and I feel quite certain that almost all the men who were directly concerned in it have been sorry they ever had anything to do with it. I cannot say the same for those outside who were urging the men on to strike. will wait, I think I shall be able to show him that the railway men, although not, perhaps, directly urged on by word of mouth, were induced to strike by the dissension which was sown amongst them by men who ought to have known better. has a good imagination. imagination, but I am speaking of facts, as the Prime Minister will see, if he refers to the files of the daily newspapers of twelve or eighteen months ago. source of information. that they are, when I find in themas I sometimes do-tw o articles treating questions of the day in two different ways. At the same time, all must recognise that there are certain matters which are fairly reported by those journals, and the truth of which cannot be denied. The Victorian railway strike, I assert, had its origin in the retrenchment which was rendered necessary in the Public Service of this State some twelve months previously. The Labour Party saw their opportunity and seized it, without hesitation. They sowed the seeds of dissension broadcast throughout Victoria, particularly amongst the railway servants. Delegates were brought from New South Wales to assist in that work. They came here, not with the intention of This right has been acpouring oil upon the troubled waters, but for the express purpose of widening me breach. Labour members of Parliament took part in both public and private discusPerhaps, it would be' appropriate sions of the matter at issue, until it looked as if . the whole of the Victorian railway system was to be handed over to the professional agitators of Lygon-street. Then came a final ultimatum from the Railway Commissioner. The directors of the railways-that is, the Government-wh o wers I think that we are chosen by and represented the people of this State, demanded that all unions of their employees should withdraw from The idea had its affiliation with the TradesH a l l . Labour members and agitators resented this keenly, and by their speeches, and actions added fuel to the flame, and added the combustibles so rapidly that at last an explosion occurred in the form of a strike. Then, like childrein playing with gunpowder, they declared-whethe r they believed their statement or not is quite another matterthat they did not think it would go off. They thought, I presume, that the Government would back down, and professed as I f the Prime Minister tonishment at the effect of their own bombs. Then, for a time, they lay very low. Why?

But they lay low for another reason, viz., that their masters-the working men and the peoph? of Victoria generally-were entirely opposed to the railway employees and to the strike. Consequently, it was deemed discreet to conceal the fact that they had been I am bound to admit instrumental in fomenting the trouble, and in keeping it alive so long as they thought that they had any chance of success. In this connection, I ask honourable members to note the position which was taken up by the Labour Party, as indicated by its leader in the State Parliament. That gentlemen was a member of the deputation which met the leaders of the railway strike, and which counselled them to abandon it. At the time it was generally thought, and is still urged by those leaders, that he agreed with the other members of the deputation in tendering that counsel, although he as stoutly denies the truth of that statement.

The whole trouble constituted a direct attack upon the right of the people to control their own servants through their own representatives in Parliament in.their own way. It was a brazen attempt on the part of all who were connected with it to interfere with the Appropriation Bill in the State Legislature. For some time previously the railways of Victoria had involved the State in an immense loss annually. Its finances were in a very depressed condition, and it was necessary to impose further burdens on the people. Accordingly that was done. The capitalists, who are so much despised by honourable members opposite, manfully bore their share of the increased taxation. The position was put clearly before the civil servants, and a majority of them cheerfully agreed to shoulder their share of responsibility.

If the honourable and learned member thinks that there is any class of public servants that will not be covered by the amendment now before us,. I shall be prepared to support any further proposition that he may make to remove any doubt as to' the intention of the Government proposal to provide for every one who can , be dealt with in this measure. As I remarked last night, there has been a good deal of by-play on the part of honourable members opposite, with reference to the assertion that there has been a change of front on the part of the Government. I deny that there has been any change. ' The amendment before us covers everything which the Labour Party ever asked for or desired; but if any honourable member wishes to amplify it, so that all doubts shall be removed, I a proposal in that direction, if reasonable grounds for it can be given. sire is that no one who can be properly and lawfully included within the provisions of this Bill shall be shut out. We'have been told that, in seeking to provide for public servants in this measure, we are attempting to deprive the States of the management of their own affairs. That is only a repetition of the old Tory cry that has been raised in every State Parliament in which an Arbitration Bill has been under consideration. As soon as a Government has proposed that industrial disputes should be referred to Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, the Opposition cry has always been-and more particularly in regard to Arbitration Courts-that an attempt is being made to take the management of business affairs out of the hands of those directly concerned. Doleful pictures have been drawn in the States Parliaments of what would be the result of State interference with large industries within their borders, and we have to-day a repetition of that cry in this Parliament. It is one which may be raised against an Arbitration Bill of any kind; but I contend that not one of the State Conciliation and Arbitration Acts has taken the management of business undertakings out of the hands of those directly concerned, and that it is not sought by this measure to deprive the States of the management of their railways or any industry in which they may be engaged. So much has been said with reference to Federal and States powers, and the possibility of a conflict between the two as the result of the passing of this Bill, that it is unnecessary for me to refer at length to that aspect of the question. I have only to say that whilst I am with those who advocate the exercise of caution, more particularly in the early years of the Federation, by this Parliament, I at the same time advocate courage in facing any question in reference to which we think there might be a conflict between Federal and States powers, or that the Federal power might have to wrongly give way to that of the States. There is a number of gentlemen prominent in State politics who make no secret of their antagonism to this Parliament, and who would go to almost any length in their desire to decry our powers and make this Parliament unpopular. The Parliament is being held up to the people as one that is going to almost ruin Australia by extravagant proposals to establish' shallsupport institutions that will have the .effect of increasing the cost of government.

It is a sacred trust, and it lies with us to see that justice is done to both sides. are not here to conserve' States rights, has a very unfair and untrue idea of what his duties are as a member of the Federal Parliament. We are here just as much to conserve the rights which the States have retained as to exercise the rights that we believe to have been transferred to us. not here to conserve States rights as against Federal rights. also said that, "" By passing this Bill, and bringing the employees of the States Governments under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court, we shall not be depriving the States of any control over their servants."" the honourable member comes to -that conclusion. In the introductory portion of the Bill, we are told that one of the objects of the measure isTo enable States to refer industrial disputes to the Court, and to permit the working of the Court and of State industrial authorities in aid of each other. Then, in clause 4, we are told that"" Industrial matters"" includes all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms, and conditions of employment or non-employment j and in particular, but without limiting the general"" scope of this definition, includes all matters pertaining wealth. He would think that we are to the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal, or non-employment of any particular persons, or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of any organization, association, or body. How any honourable member can say that we do not interfere with the control by the States of their railways employees, in the face of provisions of that kind, passes my conrprehension. We interfere with them in every direction, as the Bill actually says. I join with two of the previous speakers in regretting that the Government have not seen their way to issue the amendments which they propose to make in the Bill in the convenient form in which I have always seen such propositions put before Parliament in a case of this kind. The custom usually is to insert in the old Bill the changes made, representing the words proposed to be omitted by printing them with a line drawn through them, and printing words proposed to be inserted in raised type; so that anyone taking up the Bill can see at once the changes which it is proposed to make, and how they will affect the drafting of the measure. Even at this late hour Any one who says that we I would ask the Government to have the Bill printed in that style. ber should know that the last Government discontinued that practice. a very good practice. practice. that what I recommended will save honourable members in trouble fifty times the expense of printing copies of the Bill in that manner. I do not propose to speak at length, but I do not desire that the clause should pass without voicing my objection to it. I regret that so much valuI cannot understand how able time has been lost upon this subject, which I conceive to be of very small importance. It practically broke up the work of the last session, and it has occupied the greater part of the last three months. . It has caused changes, which are only beginning, and of which one cannot see the endand all over a matter, the ultimate legality and utility of which are very much in doubt! Any stranger coming here, studying our work closely, and seeing the enormous amount of time we have devoted to .this proposal, would have a very poor idea of our wisdom, and of the care we exercise in regard to the affairs of this great Commondoing our work in a careless and wasteful fashion. This appears to be a matter of playing at politics, because the provision which it is now sought to make may never come into force. It is intended to ward pff a danger which has never threatened us in the past,which does not at present menace us, and which members themselves admit will probably never overtake us. The waste of time that is now involved in the discussion of a matter of no immediate importance is really intolerable. I am strongly opposed to any intermeddling with the States. They ought to be left to manage their own affairs in their own way, and we have no right to encroach upon them in the manner proposed.

76,Mr Mccoll,"I venture to saysimilar to those now enjoyed by the railway employee's in New South Wales under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of that State, how is it that that wish has never been expressed during the whole of the electoral campaign which is oeing brought to a close to-day Honourable members who are supporting this Bill in the main, but opposing this provision, are not opposed to legislation by the State in the direction of conciliation and arbitration. They say that that is a State business, and that the State should manage its own affairs. I have not seen any demand made that a Bill should be introduced into the Victorian Parliament to provide conciliation and arbitration for the benefit of the employees of the State,, yet this Parliament is being asked now to pass with that object a measure which may not become operative for years and years. The position is anomalous, and the desire of those who are seeking to push ' this measure through is not based upon solid ground. If they had desired to do justice to the State employees of Victoria, and give them the benefit of provisions such as those in force in New South Wales, they would have brought pressure to bear upon the State Parliament. I cannot believe in the sincerity of honourable members who are endeavouring to push the authority of the Commonwealth to an extreme in this matter. The real object of the Bill appears to be the glorification of trades unions. We have had one or two indications recently that the trades unions are becoming a menace to the State. I have always been a trades unionist, and I have always supported the unionists in their endeavours to secure proper conditions from their employers. But when the unions attempt to take command of the politics of the Statewhen they dictate to the permanent heads of the States Departments, and bring influence to bear upon Ministers, and when Ministers tamely succumb to that influence, and visit reproach and disgrace upon good servants of the State, I can no longer support them. I am opposed to that development of trades unionism, because such influence is exerted in the interests"" of only a few people, the great mass of the taxpayers, who have to find bread and butter for such persons, and who have to contribute the funds which keep them in employment, being entirely ignored. The Government proposal is in the nature of merely sentimental legislation, and to my mind it borders very closely upon the ridiculous. When we remember the high hopes that were entertained with regard to Federation at the outset, and when, as the honourable member for South Sydney has stated, we see that those hopes have not been fulfilled, we are entitled to ask why ? The answer is to be found in the fact that we are wasting our time in the consideration of wretched subjects, such as that now before us, instead of attending to the more pressing requirements of this great country. No regard is paid in the labour platforms to the interests of the community as a whole. The Prime Minister told us that the employees of the States could obtain no redress from the States Parliaments. My experience, however, which extends over a good many years, is that, in no place do the grievances of,public servants obtain such a ready hearing as in the States Parliaments. I have known honourable members to fill the business-paper, day. after day, and week after week, with questions and motions relating to the petty grievances of some post-office officials or other Government servants. These honourable members seemed to live for nothing else, and they allowed the interests of the country to suffer whilst their attention was absorbed by trivialities. The Attorney-General said that the Ministry did not wish to rob the States Governments or the RailwayCommissioners, of the benefits that would be conferred by the Bill. I do not, however, think that the States Governments or the Railway Commissioners desire to be brought under its provisions. All the Parliaments of Australia have taken special care, by means of special Acts, to place the Commissioners and their employees beyond the reach of an arbitrary demand by Parliament, at the instance of a chance majority, and have safeguarded the interests of the railway and other Government servants in every possible way against the operation of injustice and unfairness. Why, then, should we devote valuable time to the discussion of a measure which is so little needed at the present time ? Honourable members opposite have said that there has been no change of front on the part of the Government, but I think there has been a decided change. The Prime Minister, when he announced the formation of his Government, stated that he had never deemed it necessary that the clerical branches of the Public Services of the States should be brought within the scope of the B ill ; but other honourable members said that the Prime Minister himself did not know how much the word "" industrial "" would cover. They said""Wait until the High Court deals with the subject, and then you will see what is meant by 'industrial.'"" Is that the way to legislate? My feeling is that we should say what we mean. Tf we are to bring the whole of the States public servants within the scope of this Bill, let us say so in so many words. The present method of legislation-by which we imply something but do not say what we meanis nothing more nor less than political thimInstead of a straightforward alternative, ble-rigging. When we ask what thimble the pea is under, no one can tell us; but vv are enjoined to wait until the High Court decides the question. I am glad to say that the chances are that before this Bill is passed there will be many surprises. My experience of Government Departments is that, fifteen years ago, before agitators came to the front, the public servants were much better off than they are to-day. They had better pay, shorter hours, and fairer conditions in every way. Legislation of this kind does not provide a royal way' of improving the position of the public servants. The States, by their own enactment, can render our legislation nugatory. improve the conditions for the public servants is by lifting up the country-by developing our resources, and making more work for the railways and 'for all classes of the community. If we wander away amongst legislative mazes, where no light can be thrown upon our proceedings, we shall only proceed from one folly to another, and disaster will ultimately overtake us. The great industries of the country require to be developed before we can bring about that general prosperity which we all desire, and in which the public servants will participate in common with the rest of the community . not propose to detain the Committee at any length. Observations upon certain matters in order to clearly define my attitude upon this question. The late Government proposed, under clause 4, that this Bill should not be applicable to a dispute relating to "" employmonwealth and the States, if the public servants ment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth or of a State, or to employment by any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State."" The present Minister of Trade and Customs thereupon moved that the words "" does not include"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" and includes."" At that time, therefore, the desire of honourable prior to their accession to office. members opposite was that the measure should apply to disputes relating to employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth or of a State, or to employment by any public authority constituted under either of them. The late Government thoroughly understood what would be the result of the adoption of that amendment. It was exactly the reverse of what we ourselves desired. Now, however, what do we find ? we are asked to affirm that the Bill shall be applicable only to disputes in which employees upon the States railways are involved, and to disputes in industries which are carried On by the Commonwealth or by a State, or by any authority constituted under them. In such circumstances, a question naturally arises as to the precise meaning of the term ""industry."" That will have to be decided by the High Court. Apart from the railway employees, we are left in a state of doubt as to the persons to whom the Government intend the Bill to be applicable. Should the High Court decide that the Public Service of the Commonwealth or The only way in which .we can of a State is an "" industry,"" the public servants will come within the scope of the Bill, but not otherwise. The Ministry have only courage enough to say that the States railways constitute an industry. "" industry "" contained in the Bill. that that fact lessens the force of the argument which I am advancing. In speaking upon this measure upon the 19th April last, the Minister of Trade and Customs saidWe should endeavour to place the public servants upon such a footing that they will have no cause to fear vindictive or unfair treatment. Their rates of pay and conditions of labour should be determined not by Parliaments, which may be called upon to act in a time of political I merely wish to offer a few panic, but by a judicial body. He also said at a later stageI appeal-to honourable members to say whether it would not be more dignified from a parliamentary point of view, and better for the Comwere brought within the scope of this B ill . Of course it is open to honourable members opposite to urge that some, if not all, public servants will be covered by the interpretation which will be placed upon the word "" industry.""

99,Sir John Forrest,"I have alreadymember is now supporting a proposal which does not clearly set forth what sections of the public servants of the States shall be included, but leaves it to the High Court to determine the extent of its application. My only object in speaking at this stage is to show that, at all events, from my point of view, honourable members opposite have acted inconsistently, and not in accordance with their previous speeches and pledges at the general election, or more recently in this House. lowed, with some interest, the discussion that has again taken place on the position in regard to States railway servants and public servants generally, and it appears to me that time has brought about some slight change in the views of honourable members opposite. A t one stage they made out what was apparently a very strong case in support of the .contention that a proposal to include all public servants within the provisions of this Bill was unconstitutional, but their arguments in that respect appear to have considerably weakened. Listening to the debate, as a juror might listen to evidence, it seems to me that the arguments in support of the position taken up by the Government are very much stronger than are those put forward by the opponents of our proposal. The question of States rights is altogether beside the issue. The Constitution clearly sets forth that the Federation shall not take any action that would restrict the rights of the States, and, therefore, it is absurd for any one to suggest that we propose to invade States rights. No one will be able to say where the line is to be drawn between the powers of the Commonwealth and those reserved to the States until a case arises that will enable the matter to be clearly dealt with by the High Cotirt. That tribunal was established as a necessary part of the Constitution. powers of the Commonwealth and of the States, it occupies the position of an Arbitration Court, and all questions relating to such matters must inevitably be referred to it. We may rest assured that the Court will take care that there is no invasion of States rights. It will be careful to draw a clear line of demarcation between the powers of the Commonwealth and of the States, and, therefore, all the discussion that has taken place in regard to an assumed invasion of States rights has really been to no purpose. If we look at the objection raised by those who ask what would happen if the Conciliation and Arbitration Court were called upon to deal with the railway employees of a State, what do we find? We learn, that they, view the question from the most miserable of all stand-points. They consider it from a purely commercial point of view. Is there any honourable member who would consider a mere question of money in relation to the elements of justice? ' If has been the aim of all Governments to mete out justice to every individual member of the community j but we find the honourable member for Echuca, the honourable member for Corangamite, and the honourable member for Wannon, dealing with this question solely from a monetary point of view. It is said by them that if the Court were called upon to deal with the railway employees of a State, it might give a decision that would lead to an increase in State taxation, and that such a position would be outrageous. But surely they would not barter away justice for money ? I am surprised to find the honourable member for Corangamite supporting the action taken by the Victorian Government in regard to retrenchment, and regret that whilst he was reading some newspaper extracts bearing on the question, he did not set before us the true position. When he spoke of professional agitators who provoked the railway strike, I understood him to be referring to the present Premier of Victoria. Mr Bent was the professional agitator who brought about that trouble. surmise is not correct. ber's constituents are producers, and if the wages of railway employees were cut down the income of his constituents would be reduced.

It is well known that an unprofitable business may be made to pay by securing good management and increasing the wages of the employees; and surely it is not -suggested that we should barter away justice for the sake of mere profit. If the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is called upon to deal with a dispute among railway employees, he will give a just award. The honourable member would object to that, if there were an interference in the direction of raising wages. to interfere with the administration of the railways by the States, by preventing the imposition and continuance of preferential rates, and compelling the States authorities to make fair charges for the freights which they carry, thus increasing their revenue. I wish honourable members to think rather of doing justice to all men than of the technical constitutional question which has been raised. The argument used by some honourable gentlemen, and especially by the honourable member for Echuca, is that we can safely trust the Parliaments of the States to deal with all these matters. He told us that the question paper of the Victorian Assembly was covered with notices affecting the grievances of public servants. I am not surprised at that. What did the Commonwealth discover when it took over the administration of the Postal Departments of the States? We found that, in the Postal Departments of the States of New South Wales and Victoria, there were 1,146 persons employed, whose length of service in every case exceeded three years, .and in many cases was as much as twentythree years, who were receiving less than ; £ i i o a year, which we have decided shall be the minimum for any official employed by the Commonwealth. We also found that over 400 officials in the Postal Departments of the StatesI have mentioned were, after in some cases sixteen, eighteen, and twentythree years' service, receiving less than £ 9 0 a year. Corangamite think that £ 9 0 a year is a sufficient salary to enable its recipient to live decently, and to bring up a family, whose members will be creditable to the State? This Parliament, fortunately, is determined that justice shall be dona to all employees or the Commonwealth. I shall not go into the history of the unfortunate strike which recently occurred in Victoria, but the present position of the Victorian railway employees also refutes the argument that we can trust the Parliaments of the States. In this State there are engine-drivers whs; are at present working fifteen and a half hours a day, or seventy-six hours a week. Men leave their engines at 3 o'clock in the morning, and commence work again at 11 o'clock. Perhaps the honourable member for Corangamite believes in low wages? cracy, and I think that the people of Victoria should be left to manage their own affairs. We propose every person within Our purview has justice meted out to him. That, if I understand it aright, is the first principle of government. I have within the last fortnight seen a time-table which shows the hours worked by the Victorian engine-drivers and firemen. Their hours have been increased by the Victorian Government, which some honourable members represent as an ideal one. It is physically impossible for the railway officials of Victoria to satisfactorily perform the work which is imposed upon them. If a loss of life caused by a collision or some other accident occurs, no doubt the people of the State will awake to the fact that something has been wrong in their railway management. But at the present time they are content to allow the Government to save money by working the. engine-drivers for longer periods than they should work. No country, however, can be prosperous whose workers are oppressed and are given low wages. I have no patience with this talk about States rights. If any conflict arises as to the limitation of powers, a calm and peaceable method of settling it is at hand. It appears to me that an attempt is being made to separate the people into groups rather than to bring them together as a whole.

They acted, not to save their own interests, but in defiance of them. I want now to shatter for ever the fond delusion of the labour unions of Australia, that if they could only get their own men into office, they would inaugurate a grand new era in which the men who were in the high places would show an almost suicidal disregard for their own interests in carrying out those noble principles which were to lead to the universal happiness of mankind. But, the universal happiness of mankind has been converted into a phrase with another meaning, namely, the immediate well-being of the seven or eight gentlemen who used to live on their principles. Now, I say that if ever there was a point upon which a Government ought to have ' stuck upon which the present Ministry achieved their present highand elevated position. The Prime Minister laughs.

I cannot understand under what sort of malign influence the Prime Minister acted when he missed that glorious chance. I need not quote the Minister of Trade and Customs in this matter, because it is well known that when he moved the amendment to which I have referred, he spoke, as he always does, in a perfectly clear and manlyfashion, and made no attempt to disguise the position which he took up. He mentioned no constitutional difficulties, but said-' ' We believe that what we are doing is right; if it is contrary to the Constitution we can be set right by an authority in another place."" That position was quite intelligible. But now that the Ministry are in office they begin to play the part of the High Court themselves. They bring their own principles into a little High Court of their own, and they suddenly discover that this proposal, which they incubated 'so laboriously, is not only rotten to the core, but is unconstitutional. The voice of authoritythe voice of the learned Attorney-General, and the voice of the honourable and more learned Minister of External Affairsspeaks now. These two voices speak now; they have their due weight with the Cabinet; and we now find that the party which looked upon mankind as one family, regards "" industry "" as a term which divides humanity. There are some human beings whose occupations come under the to its principles, it is that head of "" industrial,'""'' and others whose callings cannot be so described. This is in accordance with the aristocratic proclivities of my honourable and unlearned friend the Prime Minister, who is anxious to bring farmers within the scope of this Bill, but who He never used to looks askance at the farm labourer's.

I ask honourable members to remember that this very question was dealt with by the Prime Minister. He went into these differences, and admitted thab the construction to be placed upon the word "" industry "" might be the subject of some disputation. He faced all these difficulties when the Bill introduced by the late Government was before the House, and, having looked at them, said in a straightforward way, that, in his opinion, we had it within our powers to include public servants within the scope of the B ill ; and that if we were wrong we could be set right by the That was the position taken up by the Prime Minister, and it was a perfectly logical one. with it or not, we could at least understand it. The Labour Party, having taken up that position, and having brought about universal confusion through their absolute adherence to it, surely the principle which was strong enough to impel them to shipwreck their political friends who had been doing theirwork for them for three years should also have been strong enough to induce them to stake 'the life of the Ministry upon it. now put forward would have shipwrecked the Deakin Government in precisely the same way. knows that. member must have become suddenly ignorant, because every one else knows it. posal of the Government, and also the Bill, in its original form, so that I am in a position to compare the two.

But, in the case of the civil servants and railway employees their avocations hmit them strictly to one State.

145,"Each Is In A Different State, Mr Hughes (West Sydney","Ministe rahis Bill. To-day it is alleged that we -claim something short of that, though how far short our critics are not quite agreed. .Some urge that we have fallen very farshort, and others a little short, but all are agreed that we have fallen something short. I propose to show that we have not fallen short at all. The right honourable member -for East Sydney had a good deal to say .about our abandonment of principle. Unfortunately he is not present now, and, therefore, the reply which naturally springs to one's lips must remain unspoken. When, however, the time comes for him to firenot these little crackers, but his big gunwe shall be ready enough to give him a fitting reply. Just now I propose to deal with his arguments, because all that he had to say in reference to our abandonment of principle, and. 0111 .assumption of a virtue that is rather anfloying to persons who occupy a less elevated position, is entirely beside the question. This Bill is introduced by virtue of sub-section xxxv. of section 51: of the Constitution, -which empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate upon matters affectingConciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending Uieyond the limits of any one State. It is under powers which are derived from that sub-section that we are enabled to submit this measure. . So far, so good. This Bill is introduced in accordance with that power, and its title recites that it is "" A Bill for an Act relating to Conciliation and Arbitration for the prevention and settlement of Industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" That is to say, it repeats the identical words of the sub-section in question. I now come to paragraph b of clause 4, and to the amendment which is proposed by the Government. We -desire to insert after the word "" State"" the words, "" including disputes in relation to -employment upon State railways, or to employment in industries carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State."" Let us deal with the matter fairly. Under the 'Constitution it cannot be denied that we are expressly and severely limited by the terms of sub-section xxxv. of section 51. Secondly, under the Bill we are limited to the order of leave. It is not our Bill, but that of a previous Government. The order of leave goes as far as sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution will allow, because it repeat's word for word the terms of that provision. It will thus be seen that the order of leave and our powers under the Constitution coincide. The question is-D o we stop short only at the obvious restrictions imposed by the Constitution, or do we not set up further barriers? Do we exclude even one individual, who under any interpretation of the sub-section could' be brought under the Bill? If we do, we have fallen far short of that which we urged should be done; if we do not, then all this criticism, and the accusations which have been made against us, fall to the ground. But what do we say ? We set forth that the Bill shall apply to Commonwealth and States servants employed in any industry. Apart from his personal criticism, which may be passed by for the time being, the right honourable member was not singular in his remarks. I shall be ready enough to replv to them when the time comes, and I think that no one would accuse me of hesitancy in that respect. But the right honourable member said what other honourable members had urged. Let us see if we have excluded one human being from this Bill. If we have not, I should like to know what all this pother is about. We propose to confine this provision to persons engaged in an "" industry,"" and what is the meaning of industry as defined in the .Bill? It means anyBusiness, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, service, or employment, on land or water, in which persons are employed for pay, hire, advantage, or reward, excepting only persons engaged in domestic service. So far as I am aware, only one honourable member has ventured to suggest that we have forgotten that exceedingly deserving section of the community-the domestic servants. Mr O'MALLEY -We must provide for them in the Bill. have forgotten them; but we never proposed either on the 19th April last, or any day prior to that date, to include them in this measure. Therefore, while we have fallen short of the ideal, we have not fallen short of our pledges. Can. any honourable member point to any individual in the Public Services of the States or the Commonwealth, or in the railway services of the States, who does not come within this definition? If no 1 such case can be brought forward, all this pother falls to the ground. Is a clerk outside the definition.?

The honourable member for Wannon assumes a wisdom which his years will not permit him rightly to affect.

We have been listening for two days-it seems two years-to the onslaught made upon us by honourable members opposite, on the ground that we have departed from the line which Providence had hewn out for us, and now we are told that we are prematurely replying to their attack. After listening to his onslaught, which was limited only by your ruling, sir, we are told by the honourable member, that we are premature in our reply. He accuses us of being false to our pledges. The honourable member for Wannon and others have made the same charge, and now this latest recruit asserts that our reply is premature. I do not think that it is. Those who are familiar with the facts will say that in view of the patience with which this Government, consisting, as it does, of honourable members for the most part new to Ministerial work, have listened .to this torrent of abandoned criticism -abandone d in its freedom, not from the restraint that a sense of decency should impose, but from that which a sense of what is applicable to a new GoFailing the right vernment should impose-honorabl e members opposite should have dealt tenderly with us.

Had we stood many times in the pillory of public opinion instead of on this occasion only, they could not have accused us more harshly than they have done. The honourable member for Wentworth last night commenced an harangue which was happily frustrated I will not say by your ingenuity, Mr Chairman, but by your very convenient This shaking of would-he decision that the honourable member could not proceed on the lines adopted. For that I am sure we were all very thankful; but the honourable member for Wannon started with a tremendous philippic. Then the honourable member for Franklin said, in effect, that the position taken up by us was terrible, while other honourable members attacked us in a remarkable way. I quesI repeat, once more: "" Let us hear of the men who will be omitted from the Bill under the terms of this amendment. Let us hear of a public servant who can.say, ' You have omitted me from the B ill . ' "" What is his name? Is he a postman or a man in the clerical or general branch of the service? Is he employed in the service of one of the States? Is he a draftsman? What is he that he does not come within the terms of the definition to which I have referred ? If no such man can be pointed out, why should honourable members waste an enormous degree of energy in attacking us because we have altered the phraseology of the amendment in order to keep it in harmony with the whole scope of this measure?

He said that he was very. sorry to see that we had abandoned our principles; that, for his part, he was. opposed to the inclusion of either Commonwealth or State servants, but that he was sorry that we proposed to exclude some of these officials for the benefit of the measure itself. Many honourable members have expressed the same opinion, while others agree that the public servants of the Commonwealth and of the States should be included, but disagree with the form of the amendment. I can deal with the latter section, but I cannot deal with those who say that we do not agree that the public servants of the States should be included, and then accuse us of excluding a few of them. The honourable member for Wannon stands up as the champion of State rights he is a T h a t is not the reaself-constituted champion, but nevertheless remains firm in his support of that principle.

Wherever-possible it ought to be done, and* has been done, and we have merely done it in this particular connection. Further, as to what constitutes an industry there can be no doubt. We do not propose to amend the definition of "" industry"" in the interpretation clause, in so far as it concerns business, trade, undertaking, calling, service, or employment. It will be wide enough to include everybody. Therefore, I ask honourable members to be a little more careful before they again accuse the GoInstead of that, they are vernment of having abandoned our principles.

'The Minister of External Affairs dealt .at great length with the meaning of the -word "" industry."" I am not a lawyer, as is the honourable and learned member for Wannon, but it seems to me that we can obtain the meaning of the word better from an ordinary dictionary than from an Act of Parliament. Mr O'MALLEY -What does Webster say ? able members. Webster's definition will be as unwelcome to the Ministry as most other American precedents have been. Webster's -definition of "" industrial "" is thisConsisting in industry ; pertaining to industry, or the acts or products of industry; concerning those employed in labour, especially in manual labour-thei r wages, duties, and rights. Labour"" is defined as "" physical toil, or ""bodily exertion,"" as "" intellectual exertion, mental effort."" ""Industry"" isAny department or branch of art, occupation, or business; especially one which employs much labour and capital. According to that authority, the term "" in-dustry "" can be applied to any department -or branch of .art, occupation, or business. Surely that is wide enough to include all the public servants of the States. I do not think that the Minister of External Affairs acted fairly in asking us to accept a definition contained in a clause with which we have not dealt, and which he may subsequently move to amend. It . seems to me -rather dangerous to pass one clause on the .assumption that another clause will remain -unaltered. -.sidered as a whole. :ask us to accept their assurance that the amendment has been framed to include all -public servants, and in support of that -statement they refer to the definition of '"" industry"" in another and later clause. Furthermore, the Minister of External Affairs seems to be at variance with his colleagues. The Prime Minister, in defining the policy of the Government, stated -thatGuided by the opinion of our learned Attorney-General, we take the view that this Parliament is empowered by the Constitution to in-clude within the scope of the Bill all industrial -servants of the Commonwealth or of a State. Beyond that we feel, according to our reading Every honourable member opposite of the Constitution, that we are not entitled to goand learned member contend that that qualification means? We propose to bring within the scope of the B ill , first the railway servants of the States and, secondly, all other servants of the Commonwealth, or of the States, who are engaged in industrial enterprises carried on by those Governments. .« A distinction is drawn between clerical and so-called industrial -employees. ' I am about to tell honordrawn in the Constitution. powers us to legislate for the "" prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" I have quoted Webster to show that the word "" industrial "" practically covers all employment, so that the Government cannot shelter themselves behind the provision in the Constitution. I think that they should admit that they feel that they could not get the Committee to pas's their original proposal, and do not wish to be placed in a humiliating position. again pass the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay. rate the Government fear that a few honourable members, in addition to their own followers, may have discovered an equal aptitude for changing their position. The Minister of External Affairs said that he first proposed to include railway servants within the scope of the B ill . He said that railway servants were especially mentioned, but that the same measure would apply to all the public servants of the States. If so, why should any distinction be made between two classes of servants ? Why should Yes ; but the Government one class receive special mention? Why should a blue ticket be given to the railway servants, and a white ticket to other public servants? Surely this differentiation was not. necessary. If the amendment must be passed I disagree with it, and hope that it will not find a place in our statute-bookI trust that the Government will be consistent, and introduce a provision in the same form as that which was put forward by them prior to their accession to office.

I hope that the Committee will be afforded an opportunity of definitely expressing its opinion. altogether upset by the words which have recently fallen from the Minister of External Affairs. I had made up my mind as to how I should vote, and I had what I conceived to be the best of reasons for giving my support to the Government. I have always been in favour of the principle of the Bill, and I conscientiously voted in support of the Labour Party upon the division which resulted in the ejection of the Deakin Ministry from office. I should like to be able to vote in the same direction to» ebullition of the Minister of External Affairs, I am entirely at a loss to know what to do. I should like to have the matter clearly defined. I am not a member of the Labour Party, but I consider that I represent the labouring men of Australia. In this case the questions to be considered are-Firstly, whether it is good for employees of the States to be brought within the-scope of the ArbitrationB ill ; secondly, whether it is good for . the States; and thirdly, whether the action contemplated by us is constitutional? I do not propose to express any opinion upon the constitutional aspect, because I think that those, who made the Constitution have to take the responsibility. If the laws which we pass prove to be ultra vires we shall soon be placed in our proper position by the High Court. It has been stated that we should take care to conserve the interests of the States, but I believe that it is our duty to j)rotect the weak against the strong -the citizen against the State. Therefore, if it is to the advantage of the worker to be brought within the scope of this measure, I shall give the Government proposal my support. listened to the Minister of External Affairs, I confess that I do not quite know what to do. I think we are gradually reducing this debate to a farce, and I regret that the discussion of a vital matter of this kind has not been carried on in a more orderly fashiom The Government have shown themselves very wary; they are able to say one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and although I am anxious to give them every support I possibly can, in the interests of the constituents who sent me here, I recognise that I must be very caref u l in following them. Ministers talk of themselves as babes and sucklings, and as inexperienced, so far as the discharge of Ministerial duties are concerned, but I think that they have old heads on their young shoulders, and that I must be „ very careful how I proceed. I do not think that they really represent the working man. In the first place they represent themselves, and in the second place they represent certain associations outside of this House. There are brilliant, clever, able, shrewd, and honest men at the head of the party, but they have a very dangerous socialistic wing. honourable member is allowing his prejudices to run away with him. ing the results of my own observations. The Government and their supporters representonly a small minority, and the Treasury bench is not the proper place for the present Ministry. I feel that I must .act .honestly towards those whom I represent, and I shall vote with the Government if I consider the»are right, no matter what I may think of Ministers themselves. I must confess, however, that from. the want of a definite interpretation of the amendment now before us, I do not know exactly where I stand. prised that the Government have introduced the amendment now before us. Thev accepted office on a test question, and now they are seeking to make an apparent alteration in substance, which is really nothing more than a verbal alteration. What is the object ? not to whittle down the provision. making a purely verbal amendment? Is there such a conflict of authorities in the Cabinet that the Ministry really do not know the meaning of the amendment as But, after having drafted?

182,Mr Batchelor,The object is certainly,38,Conciliation And Arbitration
183,Mr Glynn,"What is the object ofit. One of substance, it must be granted that the principle upon which they took office was one upon which the late Government ought not to have resigned, and also one upon which the present Ministry should not have replaced them, because the only reason for their taking the control of the administration was that the amendment which they carried was a good one, and that without their paternal care it would probably not be carried into effect. Why is it considered necessary to qualify the provision of the Bill by stating that it shall include within its scope the railway servants of the States? Surely the Constitution provides in effect that the Bill cannot apply unless the employees are engaged in some farm of industryI do not see what object is to be served by the amendment, unless some futile attempt is being'made by the Ministry to back down. It is a case of divided counsels, and bad advice, and for the sake of appearances of standing by an amendment which is futile. try is as I assume, their position is rather humiliating than one of which they can be proud. , Dealing with the substance of the matter now before us, I am disappointed to find men of experience like Ministers attempting to imperil the Bill by overloading it with provisions of this kind. Surely this is not a time for us to interfere with the autonomy of the States, especially whilst there is a doubt as to our constitutional position. authorities, or to enter into an elaborate argument upon this aspect of the question; but I would simply remark that, according to my view, the balance of authority leans against the constitutionality of our exercising authority over the States as States. According to the views of all the leading American authorities, the object of the Constitution is not to give the Federal authority jurisdiction over the States as units, but only over the individuals in those Slates. The States, as units, are not represented in the Federation, and it follows that, as they cannot control the policy of the Federation, they should not be controlled by it. except as provided in express words In the Constitution. In this particular case there are no express words in the Constitution which would enable us to exercise control over the States. The reason for taking this view is that the subjection of the States to control by the Federal authorities should be accompanied by representation of the If the alteration now made is States, .so that the control could be checked in its operation. . In the interests of the Federation, and upon the broader ground of expediency, I would ask honourable members to reject the amendment. Surely it is not contemplated that the provisions of the States Railway Acts shall be modified at the whim of an Arbitration Court, not constituted, as originally intended, of a Judge and two permanent members, but of a Judge and two other members selected to arbitrate in regard to each particular dispute. How should we proceed to select experts to constitute a Court to deal with matters affecting the internal management of the railways of any one State or of all' the States? If the members of the Arbitration Court sat regularly for six or seven years they might, by special study of the accumulated reports; and of the evidence which would be open to them, arrive at some understanding of the railway systems. An Honorable MEMBER -Ho w could penalties be recovered from the 'States serI f the object of the Minisvants ? The principle upon which it is proposed to constitute the Arbitration Court is a bad one. Whom could we select to adjudicate in regard to a dispute as to the rates of wages to be paid to the railway servants of a State? If that question were referred to the members of the Inter-State Commission-if such a body is ever created-w e might secure the services of an expert triI do not wish to quote bunal, or one that would become thoroughly familiar with the charges made upon the railways and other circumstances. But, under the provisions of the Bill as proposed by the Government, these disputes are to be referred to a Supreme Court Judge-no t necessarily the same Judge on all occasions, and not necessarily an expert in relation to this matter-and to two other persons who are .to be selected for the occasion. By whom would these two other arbitrators be chosen? If one were chosen by the Railway Commissioners, he would probably be one of the Commissioners, who would thus be sitting as an expert to adjudicate upon, a dispute to which he was a party. If this were not done we should have to call in outsiders, who would probably not know anything whatever about the conditions under which the railways have to be managed. We have railway experts, who are paid annually salaries which, in the aggregate, represent a very large sum. The late Mr Eddy, for example, was paid ,£7,000 a",38,Conciliation And Arbitration
184,Mr Glynn,"That is another point.year, and the salaries of other Commissioners range from about ,£2,000 to ,£5,000. The services of these gentlemen, who possess the highest. qualifications, would readily command several thousands of pounds a year in England. Yet, after they have been appointed to their present positions, and after they have acquired all the information which is available to them concerning the properties which they control, it is proposed to set aside their judgments in favour of those of the tribunal the creation of which this Bill contemplates. in New South Wales. At the present time a case in which railway employees are interested is engaging the attention of the Arbitration Court there. distinction between the provisions of the New South Wales Arbitration Act and those of this Bill, which purports to give absolute jurisdiction to the extent to which the Constitution justifies it.

But I would point out that if a State chose to enforce a certain principle in relation to its own public servants, and a mistake occurred, it would have power to rectify that error by Act of Parliament. bodied that principle in Commonwealth legislation as affecting State public servants, the States Legislatures would have no power to alter it. Statute passed by a body over which the States themselves can have no control might land them in the position that a huge mistake might be made which could not be remedied. pediency, I say that the constitution of this tribunal is not one which justifies us in deWe know 'the source of all the. anxiety that parting from the discretion of the Railway Commissioners to that of the Arbitration Court. But I would further ask-Ho w are we to enforce Commonwealth awards against a State? We really have no power to do so. I know that the question has been asked"" Do not the States pay up when judgments are given against them?""' My reply is that they do pav as a matter of morality, but that they cannot be compelled to do so as a matter of law. In point of fact, both Queensland and Western Australia absolutely refused to satisfy judgments, because,they disagreed with the principles of the decisions which were given against them. It was only then that the provision was introduced into the Queensland .net, declaring that when a judgment was given against the State the necessary funds to satisfy it must be provided by the Executive of the day. No provision of that sort, however, can be embodied in a Commonwealth Act, because it would not be operative in the case of the States. It therefore remains for the latter to say whether an Act which interferes with their internal administration shall have their co-operation. If a dispute occurred beI know that there is a tween, say, Messrs. H ill and Co. and their carriers as to the rate of wages which should' be paid to drivers employed upon contracts: between New South Wales and Queensland, and if an award were given in favour of the men, and the common rule of that award were applied to the railways of Australia, should we be likely to receive the aid of a State Act of Parliament to enable us to enforce that award? The idea is repugnant to common-sense, and as a matter I accept the honourable of expediency is unsound. I ask the Government whether it would not be better toagree to the tremendous concession which is -1 involved in the acceptance of the Bill itself, and to abstain from over-loading it with these provisions? I opposed the second reading of the measure, but it was carried. It has» now reached; the Committee stage. Surely, fromOn the-other hand, if we emthe stand-point of those who support the Bill, we ought not so to interfere with the internal economy of the States as tobreak down their administration?

188,Mr Glynn,"units. pediency as applied by the advocates of the B ill , I ask that the limitation proposed shall not be made a part of this clause. After the amendment which' emanated from the Labour Party had been recognised as a vital one, as was manifested first by the resignation of the Deakin Government, and, secondly, by its corollary, the acceptance of office by those who tabled it. I say that the present proposal is humiliating inasmuch as it is an attempt to modify that amendment by words which have been introduced for that specific purpose. inserted as verb'a'l quibbles; but, because they offer a way out of the difficulty. In other words, the Government wish to cut down the principle which they affirmed by accepting office. It may be urged that the proposed words were futile. That, however, was not in the minds of the Government when they assumed Ministerial responsibilitySuch conflicting opinions have been given expression to by the Government that I am justified in assuming that they started with the idea that this clause meant something, and now find that it means nothing. As the whole provision has yet to be put, if the amendment is incorporated in it, I ask the Committee to reject it if for no other reason than to make the Bill an effective one. The reference to industrial disputes is not necessary. The Constitution contemplates only such disputes as are industrial, and therefore the inclusion of those words would only harass the High Court in its interpretation of this provision. As the clause was originally drafted, it was much clearer. It covered everything that was desired unless it is to be limited to. some particular body. But we are now invited to insert words which will have the effect of forestalling the judgment of the High Court. We are asked to prevent that tribunal from holding, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, that this Bill applies not only to industries, but to State and Commonwealth emplovment, which are not industries. We were told previously that we ought to trust the High Court in this matter. Why, then, should we be asked to place a limitation upon its wisdom ? We were formerly told that we should allow the provision to pass -irrespectiv e of whether it was good or ill -and let the High Court impose any limitation upon its operation that might be required by the Constitution. Now the Government declare that they do not wish the High Court to interpret the provision, and On the grounds of common extherefore they specifically affirm that the employment referred to is industrial employment. That implies a withdrawal of that trust in the wisdom of the High Court which was formerly expressed by the advocates of this proposal. When superfluous words are embodied in a provision, the Court always seeks to discover the reason for their inclusion, and, in doing so, very frequently big mistakes are made, even by the most influential tribunals. On the grounds of policy, expediency, and clear draftsmanship, I ask honourable members to reject the amendment, and not to cumber the meaEvidently these have not Been sure with unnecessary provisions. Whilst the honourable member for Darling was addressing the Committee, I interjected -""What is justice?"" It appears to me that very frequently the justice of which we hear so much, means giving everything to one man, and nothing to another. I am opposed to the inclusion of railway servants in this Bill as I am opposed to the measure in its entirety. voted for the inclusion of railway servants on a.previous occasion. nobody can possibly misunderstand my position.

A union r f railway servants in my district wrote 10 me some time ago asking me to support this proposal. I replied that, in their interests, I did not think it wise for them to be brought under the provisions of the measure, and that, in the interests of the country, I could not support such a proposal.

Instead of boldly standing out for that which led to their occupancy of the Treasury benches, they have thrown it overboard. When this matter was before us prior to the defeat of the late Government, I spoke in terms similar to those to which I have just given utterance, and honourable members of tha Labour Party severely criticised my statement, that, notwithstanding that I held these opinions, I intended to vote against the Government. The honourable member for Gwydir, who represents a constituency which adjoins my own, was especially severe in his criticism, and whilst he was speaking, I interjected''Is this amendment a sham? Do you not want it carried ? Why do you object to my voting with you?"" We have now proof that it was a sham-that the Labour Party did not want it to be carried. It was their desire to pose as a party anxious to do something for these men, but they wished the House to defeat the amendment, and would have accepted their defeat. they bring gifts. proposal, and I have informed a number of railway men in my electorate that I oppose the B ill because I do not think it would improve their conditions. It is because of ' principle. this belief that I am going to vote against the amendment. for Darling has said that some honourable members favour low wages. I do not think that there is any occasion for me to reply to that statement, save to say that I pay as high wages to men in my employ as does any member of the Labour Party. I have always paid high wages, and believe in the principle. I admit that if men who are worthy of them are paid high wages they will do better work, and prove more profitable to their employers, than if they were paid low wages. I am not in favour of paying low wages. The taunt is always hurled against men like myself that we favour the paying of starvation wages. I have always believed in high wages, and I shall do what I can to keep up rates of payment. If I believed that the provision now before the Committee would do no injury to the community, and. especially to the working classes, I should vote for it, and do all I could to secure its adoption; but, as I hold that it would have the contrary effect,I should be recreant to the trust imposed upon me if I supported it. siderable reluctance, because I desire to see this question settled; but some of the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter have shown me that a prolongation of the debate may be serviceable. If one thing has been made clearer than another, it is the conviction held by all who desire to look things straight in the face that the Government have, for some reason known only to themselves, changed their attitude in regard to the question at issue. The wording of the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay seems to me clear, incisive, and unmistakable, while that of the amendment now before us indicates, as previous speakers have remarked, that the Government are arrogating, not only the power to coerce the States, but also the power to interpret the Constitution. I have a very high esteem for the members of the Labour Party personally, and I believe that many of their efforts are directed, and tend, towards the improvement of the condition of the workers of Australia, by increasing their share in the profits of their labours. I shall be found supporting those efforts, and I have declared myself in favour of them, both in this I am against this Chamber and outside. But what is the present position? The Labour Party has hitherto displayed one commendable characteristic-that of consistency and devotion to But it has been shown during the debate that they have departed from The honourable member that characteristic in regard to other matters besides that now under discussion. They would have occupied a much stronger position in the minds of honourable members generally, and of the public, if they had maintained the position of absolute independence which they held in the past. It is true that they may now be influenced to some extent by the fact that certain of their members are holding office. I am of opinion that the high and honourable positions which Ministers fill were not sought by them, but forced upon them, and that they are justified in retaining them until the existence of a solid majority opposed to their programme-is demonstrated. I have already indicated my fundamental objections to the Bill, based upon the belief that it is too comprehensive and far-reaching for the interests involved. In my opinion, there are only three classes of employments in regard to which interference is at ail necessary-that of the waterside workers, the shearers, and the seamen.

The measure has indeed been tragic in its results. stance, at the end of last session, the death of the prospects of the Labour Party, and it only recently caused the death of the Deakin Administration. sed I hope still more tragic consequences will follow from it. with a correspondingly beneficial result to the community. I hold that it is undesirable that this Bill should ""be forced upon the public. I feel, as I have frequently said, that the line of division between parties in this Chamber must show itself more clearly every day, and separate those who wish to respect the rights of the States from those who favour unification. No honourable member -can have any doubt as to my individual position. I trust that a majority of honourable members will always be found ready to Tespect.the rights of the States. Quite apart from the constitutional aspect of the question at issue, I think that the trend of the legislation which has been introduced, and -of the amendments of which notice has been given, will be to solidify the party which is composed of those who desire to -maintain States rights, and to oppose them to those who are ready to ignore the rights -of the States. I hope that day by day, and month by month, as each piece of legislation is brought before us, those who support the integrity of the States will become more and more clearly distinguishable from those who are in favour of unification. The Labour Party, as a whole, have clearly indicated that they favour unification, and they are endeavouring to use the Constitution to secure advantages which they have ""been unable to obtain under the Constitutions of the States. One of my strong objections to the Bill is that it is an attempt to use the Federal Parliament as an instrument for the easier accomplishment of their ends. I base my objection to the inclusion of the railway employees on the ground -that we have no right to interfere with the -administration of the States in regard to a matter of such serious consequence. If the Bill, as it is proposed to amend it, became law, there would, undoubtedly, be great.and continuous friction and irritation in the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. In the first session of last Parliament, the present Attorney-General moved the following motion, which will Be found in HansardThat in the opinion of this House it is expedient for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to acquire, if the State Parliaments see fit to grant it, under section 51, sub-section x x x v i i, of the Constitution Act, f u l l power to make It brought about, in the firs't inlaws for Australia as to wages, hours, and conditions of labour. The Prime Minister of that day, the present Mr Justice Barton, was inclined to agree Before it is pasto that motion, but he suggested the substitution of the expression "" accept"" for the word ""acquire,"" because he was anxious that there should be no friction between the Commonwealth and the States. He saidThis will make it clear to the States, that we are simply declaring our willingness to accept this power, if they grant it-no t that we set about acquiring it in any sense that we wish to wrest the power away from them It is absolutely necessary in our early dealingsand, in fadt, in all our dealings with the States of the Union-that , whatever treatment we may experience ourselves, we shall behave in the most conciliatory way to the States. In agreeing to the amendment suggested by the then Prime Minister, the present Attorney-General saidI am quite sure that the Prime Minister knows' exactly how the matter stands, and that it needs tact and care and cautious approaches, but our efforts would be perfectly useless if we approached the State Legislatures with a whip in our hands. The resolution was transmitted to the various States Governments, and the replies sent by the Premiers show that their feeling was opposed to any interference with the control exercised by the States over their own interests. The Tasmanian Premier saidIt is undesirable for the Parliament in this State to surrender its rights to make its own laws upon the important subjects named in the resolution. Sir John See wroteIn my judgment this is a question that should be left to each State to determine. Mr Jenkins, the Premier of South Australia, wroteThat his Government did not consider it expedient to take action in the matter. The Premier of Victoria appears to have merely acknowledged the receipt of the Prime Minister's communication. The late Mr Leake, who was then Premier of Western Australia, said thatWhile not favorable to the transfer from the Slates of powers to deal with industrial legislation, he would not oppose the transfer, if the other States agree. If the Government had desired to approach this matter in a conciliatory spirit, they might have endeavoured to secure the concurrence of the States Governments, or, at at any rate, an expression of their views with regard to the proposal. I know that in many of the States the interference with States rights, which is contemplated by the amendment, will probably give rise to very serious friction. I do not wish to express any opinion upon the constitutional aspect of this question; but, so far as I can, merits, it appears to me that the law is clearly and distinctly against any interference on our part with the control exercised by the Stales Governments over their servants. ground, but because it is desirable to preserve intact-the rights of the States, that I have decided to vote' against the amernjment. take any part in this debate until I heard the remarks which fell from the honourable member for Kooyong. He considered that if we brought the railway servants of the States within the scope of this measure, we should infringe States rights, and that was his sole reason for opposing the amendment. AnI understand the position, we shall not in any way invade the sphere of the States by bringing railway servants under the control of the proposed Arbitration Court, because it is only when disputes extend beyond the control of the States that any authority can be exercised under the B ill . I he would utter. I intimated to him that think it is highly desirable that some tribunal should be created to deal with disputes affecting the great railway services of the Commonwealth. If a horse gets beyond the control of its owner, and runs away, and some one else comes forward to stop it, the owner cannot justly say to the person who comes to his assistance"" You are interfering with my properly."" The intervention in that case is with the object of preventing injury or loss of life, and in the same way we should interfere in disputes extending beyond any one State for the purpose of averting national disaster. member wishes to interfere with Statesrights. Personally I have no desire in that direction: that the States will take good care that we do not trespass upon their domain. The States railways are the great highways of commerce, and if a,strike were to occur'in. connection with them, the whole of our trade operations would be utterly disorganized. I believe.that the application of this measure to the railway servants will prove its one redeeming feature. I am opposed to the Bill upon general grounds, because I do. not believe in handing over the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth to the control of a Court consisting of a Judge and two assessors. At the same time, in view of the probability that the Bill will be passed into law, I consider it my duty to do my best to make it a workable and beneficial measure. I shall therefore supas a layman, judge of its port the Government proposal to bring railway servants within its scope. I do not see that we shall in any way interfere witii the States, because the tribunal which we propose to create will not step in until the It is not, however, upon that, States Governments are no longer able to exercise control. AlthoughI hold that the present Government have, owing to their change of attitude, absolved all those who previously supported them from any further obligation to vote in .their support, I shall cast my vote in favour of the amendment. ney) I desire to say only a few -words, and I should not have risen but for the appeal made to me by the Minister of External Affairs in connection with some remarks of his which were referred to by an honourable member on this side of the chamber. The honourable and learned member was reported as having, at a meeting in Sydney, made certain -remarks which, from my knowledge of him, I scarcely thought if these remarks were accurately reported, I should take action in this Chamber with regard to them. I am glad to say, however, that the honourable and learned gentleman (old me 1 that, although he had made use of some of the expressions attributed to him, the press report did not accurately convey his meaning.

The Minister having appealed to me, I feel bound to express my opinion that an entirely wrong impression was conveyed by the report. meeting in question, and I can testify to the correctness of what the honourable member has just stated. only one or two additional words to say. A number of entirely different opinions have been placed before us by Ministers. The Prime Minister statedPersonally, I have never asserted that we are bound to include the clerical employees of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States other than those who may be incidentally connected w4th industrial concerns carried on by those Governments. He expressed his opinion that they could not be included, owing to our limited power under the Constitution. The Attorney General supported that view, but the Minister of Trade and Customs differed from it to the extent of stating that, in his view, most of the employees of the States Governments would be brought under the provisions of the Bill as proposed by the Government. Then the Minister of External Affairs defied any one to name any employee"" of the States who would not be brought within the scope of the measure. We are entitled to expect corporate opinions in the same way as we look for corporate decisions from the Ministry, and it is rather unfortunate that several Ministers should have presented to us different interpretations of their own measure. related only to a law point. Ministers have expressed varying desires. The Prime Minister himself saidI have never asserted that we are bound to include the clerical employees of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. should bring within the scope of the Bill all the employees we could, consistently with our powers under the Constitution. the Minister at the same time expressed the opinion that, Under the restricted power given by the Constitution, we could not include public servants, except such as were engaged in industrial undertakings. Ministers must not complain if , owing to the varying expressions of opinion given by Ministers, honourable members should express doubt as to the meaning of the amendment which they propose. to make a second speech, but I desire to add a few remarks to those which I was induced to shorten in order to allow the right honourable and learned member for was present at the East Sydney to speak prior to his departure by this afternoon's express for Sydney. I have been very much struck by the divergent views expressed by honourable members belonging to what may be termed the third party. correctly described as the fourth party? fourth party, but they fill the seats formerly occupied by the members of the Government and their supporters, and I think they may be appropriately referred to as the third party. Some honourable members have complained that the Government, in their proposal, have not included the whole of the public servants of the Commonwealth and of the States. They affirm that State employees, who are engaged in a purely clerical capacity will be exempt from the operation of the Bill. Others, again, complain that the amendment will include all public servants. In this connection the honourable member for Wentworth gave some interesting definitions from Webster's Dictionary-definition s which appear to be wide enough to cover every person who is engaged in the performance of any kind of manual or intellectual work.' It has been said that the Government have abandoned the views which they previously held upon this matter, as if its members were an entity prior to assuming office. That sort of criticism is unfair because the Ministry is a new one. view prior to the defeat of the late Government. The honourable and learned member for Wannon declared that the members of the Labour Party at the last election advocated the inclusion of all public servants. That, however, is not a fact. I would further point out that the position of an individual member of the Committee, and that of a member of the Ministry, is widely different. When a private member submits an amendment, as the present Minister of Trade and Customs did upon this clause, he drafts it in the way that suggests itself to him at the time as being the most applicable to the Bill of which the Government have charge, and in the framing of which he has had no hand.

To my mind, the Ministry, instead of being blamed for having drafted an amendment which gives effect to the same idea, should be commended for so doing. The Government have adhered to 'the wording of the Constitution. I hold that where our Constitution is vague, the wisest course to follow is to adhere to its wording, and allow that Constitution to be interpreted by the tribunal which has been created for that purpose. Do we not know that honourable members of this House who were delegates to the Federal Convention are unable to explain what was intended to be conveyed by some of the provisions of our Constitution? right honourable member for Swan asserting that had he known that sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution couldi have been applied in this way he would have opposed it? the amendment proposed is an excellent one, and probably that is the ground for much of the objection which has been urged against it. some length upon the remarks which were recently made by the Chief Justice of New South Wales upon the working of the Arbitration Act in that State, because a great deal is being made of them outside of t h ij House. I hold that when they are analyzed specifically they will apply to any Act of Parliament. that statute interferes with the liberty of the subject. every law which is passed. every law is to prevent some person or persons from committing unjust acts. The Chief Justice then affirms that the operation of the statute creates new crimes. But I would point out that a breach of any law is a crime. breakers at the present time are to be found amongst those individuals who a few years ago clamoured for la'w and order, all the time desiring in reality that license should be extended to them. Then the Chief Justice says that the Court fixes the terms and conditions of employment. But r'nState acts in a similar wav in regard to everything. The object of our factory laws is to determine the limits to which employers and employees may proceed. So it is ills regard to the Mines Regulation and Inspection Act. This judicial authority also declares that the Arbitration Act deprives employers of the conduct of their own businesses, except upon the terms laid down by the Court. Is not that the main object of"" I s it the same idea ? all Statutes of the kind? Is not the idea, underlying such legislation that some impartial person, after hearing the evidenceupon both sides, shall give a fair award between the parties ? The Act, he declares, is productive of litigation and ill-will. W it h regard to that, I admit that the New South. Wales Statute is faulty, in that it permits of lawyers appearing in Court on behalf of the parties concerned. The Chief Justicealso urges that it divides people into two> camps, altogether forgetting that such a division existed prior to the passing of theHave we not heard the Act. I venture to say that the experience of New South Wales shows that many thousands of persons have been benefited by the operation of the Act, and are working peacefully and without friction. Indeed, I doPersonally I think that not know of any case in which the wagesnow being paid to employees have been increased beyond the level of those previously paid by fair employers. Further, a great I had intended to dwell at many cases have been settled without any appeal whatever to the Court. Any one who will take the trouble to peruse the actual records will see that the Act has been productive of peace, and that it has conduced to a better understanding between I have read those comments, and masters and men.

I said last night that I was astounded at the failure of the Government to vote for the inclusion of public servants of the Commonwealth. vants is employed in the Post and Telegraph and Customs Departments, which are under our control, and it appeared to me that if the Government could not consent to the extension of the Bill to these Commonwealth servants, they were placed in a very invidious position. I subsequently had an opportunity to express my regret at the failure of the Government to propose the inclusion of all public servants, but. this evening I find the Minister of External Affairs sheltering himself behind the definition clause, which, he points out, includes persons engaged in all classes of employment. pressed by the Minister, the honourable and learned member for Wentworth has presented the Committee with the definition of the word "" industry "" given in a well-known dictionary, and in these circumstances I desire to know from those who are versed in the procedure of the Courts, whether the High Court will give to the word "" industry "" the meaning ordinarily applied to it, or whether some particular definition is to be given as regards its application to the wage-earning classes. The honourable and learned member for Angas asserts that if we carry this measure-and it must be borne in mind that he is opposed to it-the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will not be able to enforce an award against a State. But in which The honourable and learned member supported the creation of that Court, believing that it would provide for the mercantile, commercial, and capitalistic classes of Australia a means of fighting out their differences ; but we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has no power to enforce its decisions against a State. It has no power of execution. It can simply present its certificate to the Treasurer of the State against which the decision has been given. That is my view of the position,and I have never heard anything to the contrary in this Chamber. When the High Court Procedure B ill was before the House, many honourable members who belonged to the legal profession pointed out that there, was no provision for execution, and the honourable and learned member for Angas now points to what he regards as a similar weakness in relation to the Court proposed to be created under this Bill. If an honourable member fails to say that he believes in States' rights it is at once asserted that he is a unificationist. The average elector will imagine that there A great army of public sermust be something radically wrong with the representative to whom that term is applicable. You, Mr Chairman, would not like to be described as a unificationist before a mixed audience that did not fully understand the meaning of the word. Many persons would imagine that to be a unificationist approached being a rebel; but young as I am, I shall not be prevented by any such bogy from doing my duty. The Minister of External Affairs has informed the Committee that, under the definition clause, men engaged in occupations of all k'nds throughout the Commonwealth will be covered by the word ""industry."" That being so, I In opposition to the opinion exwish to know what object the Prime Minister has in view in submitting this amendment Why should the Government propose that the clause shall specifically refer to railway employees? I am in favour of the inclusionof railway servants, but I fai l to understand why the Prime Minister should desire to» insert the amendment if the clause itself isgoverned by the definition of the word "" industry."" The definition is a very wide one r and to the lay mind, appears to cover every occupation. That being so, why is this: amendment necessary ? ference of opinion as to what the word does mean. simply submits the amendment in order to that is exactly the position overcome some little difficulty, so far as. the High Court stands. this Chamber is concerned, as to the definition, I can understand the position that he takes up. more than that. the two Ministerial statements. The Prime Minister, for some reason or other, believes that the amendment must be inserted, whilst' the Minister of External Affairs has said in effect that there is really no necessity to particularize railway servants, inasmuch as they are covered by the definition of the word "" industry."" With the exception of myself and one or two others, the Government have no supporters of their proposal on this side of the House. For the most part those with whom I am associated have taunted the Prime Minister with a desire to--",48,Conciliation And Arbitration

But I cannot believe that those with whom I have been so long associated' would be guilty of resorting to, such tactics. mere party purposes they would level such charges at a new Ministry. denial of the suggestion. stand that those who are opposed to the principle of conciliation and arbitration are merely attacking the Ministry as "" part of the game""? If that be so. the public will readily recognise such tactics. honourable member for New England, in referring to the position of the railway employees of Western Australia, mentioned that they are receiving higher wages than are paid to operatives doing similar work in other States, and urged that their remuneration would be reduced by the Court. In other words, he held that a dead low level would be fixed. There are fewer railway men in my electorate than there are in anv'of the suburban divisions of Sydney; but rav knowledge of them convinces me that they would not support a proposal that was calculated to make their position worse than it is. The honourable member asserts that manv trades unionists have not -the mor-il courage to withstand any agitation in their ranks, although they may really be opposed to it. unionist, has been intimately acquainted with members of trades unions from his boyhood, I have no hesitation in -Saying that this is not the case, and that the majoritynever attempt to tyrannize over the minority The Prime Minister, as the representativs of the Typographical Society, was a member of the' Svdney Trades Hal l Council. He was for years one of a very marked minority in the organization, and is a living proof of the fact that trades unionists do not allow their individual opinions to be submerged by a tyrannical majority. fallacy which is very generally accepted is that, in 'the trades unions, at all events, of the Court, they will satisfy themselves that New South Wales, those who are in a minority give way to numerical strength-that , because of moral cowardice, they do not stand by the views they hold. That is not the case. quite right. railway employees are supporting a proposal which, if carried, would lead to a reduction in wages. Can it be imagined, even for one moment, that all the employees in Australia will rush the Conciliation and Arbitration If they are, that fact Co-irt as soon as it is created. I think not; and, although I approve of the establishment of the Court, I hold that the fewer the cases in which it is resorted to the better it I cannot believe that for will be. The position which it will occupy will be very much like that I hear no of the police who patrol our streets. AmI to underI f the residents of Melbourne were seized with a sudden desire to become disorderly, the police who patrol the streets of the city could not control them. It is not the police who keep order; it is the moral force of the The community. We may expect this moral force to continue to work in respect to the ordinary affairs of trade and commerce, and that both employers and employees will continue to obey the law. But are we to assume that the Arbitration Court will be biased in favour of one side or the other? Business men and other members of the community are not afraid to trust the decision of their disputes to the ordinary Courts. If ' they fail before one Court, they will sometimes appeal to another-especiall y if they think their opponents are without money-unti l they get to the Privy Council. But it is not generally held that the decisions of the Courts are unfair or prejudiced. Are we to believe that the A r b i tration Court will act differently from the other Courts, that its judgments will be opAs one who, while not_ a trades posed to justice and wisdom, and that it will favour either the employers or the employees? Then it is not to be forgotten that there must be always two parties to a dispute. If a dispute arose between the Railways Commissioners of any State, or States, and their employees, which would ultimately bring both parties before the Court, the employees would have to show that their claim was a good one, and the employers that they had good reason for resisting it. The object of the Bill is to prevent resort to the rough and rude methods of settling disputes which A have hitherto obtained. Before employers will take the risk of being brought before they have good reasons for opposing the demands of their employees, while, on the other hand, the employees will know that they will be called upon to show good reasons for the demands which they make. Both sides will be bound by the decisions of the Court, which will be supported by the moral force of .he community at large. I have heard it said that the",49,Conciliation And Arbitration

266,Mr Wilks,"Then it is said that the proposal rights. be an invasion of States rights to bring private employers and employees within the scope of the Bill, it is said that to make it apply to public servants of the States, such as railway officials, is to invade States rights. I would like to hear a State right denned, so that I might know one when I met it. At the present time. I should not know one from a barber's pole I am conv stantly being told"" Don't you touch that. If you do, you invade a State right."" In the pre-federal days, you, Mr Chairman, are said to have stated that the only State right you knew was the Peacock laugh in VictoriaApparently, if we legislate in respect to the employees of a State Government, we are invading a State right, but if we legislate only in respect to the private citizens of a State, w.e are not invading a State right. Surely the public servants, including the railway employees, of a State, are as much citizens of the Commonwealth as are the private employees living within that State, and, similarly, the Railways Commissioners of a State are as much citizens of the Commonwealth as are the private employers within it. Therefore, the contention seems to me anomalous. Furthermore, I am told that if I support the application of the provisions of the measure to the public servants of the States, I am a unificationist. the logic of some honourable members, if I were admiring the Melbourne Post Office, which is a Commonwealth building, and saying to myself, ""' I , as a citizen of the Commonwealth, have an interest in that building. One brick of it, perhaps, belongs to me ""-anothe r man could come along and say, "" You have no right to admire that building. It is a Victorian building, and only the citizens of Victoria have an interest in it."" The people of the States are not distinct nationalities. The legal argument is that the provisions of the Bill must not be applied to the public servants of a State, not because it would be inexpedient, unjust, or dangerous to so apply them, but because it would be unconstitutional. Many legal members, however, tell us that it would not be unconstitutional. I desire to bring everv individual in the Commonwealth under the Bill. and I would neither particularize nor exempt any class of the community in regard to its' application. It is only when a dispute extends beyond the limits of a State that the measure will operate. Some people is an invasion of States seem to fear that we are providing machiAlthough it is not held to nery which will be an addition'to the machinery already in operation in some of the States. In New South Wales, for instance, they have an Arbitration Court. That Court has power ro deal with all disputes occurring within New South Wales. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court will not interfere in the settlement of those disputes. But the New South Wales Court cannot deal with disputes extending beyond the limits . f the State, and, to supply that' want of power, the Commonwealth Court will be given jurisdiction. I cannot understand, however, why the Ministry propose to limit the scope of the Bill practically to railway employees. Do they propose to make a distinction between the wage-earner and the man who is paid a salary? Surely that, as the leader of the Opposition put it, would be the height of snobbishness. The reply of the Minister of External Affairs, which, I take it, was endorsed by the Prime Minister, was that the Ministry do not wish to exempt salaried employee's. whole ground, so far as we think it can he covered. It admits of the exercise of all our powers under the Constitution. the application of the Bill to railway servants, though I am sorry that the Government have moved the particular amendment Apparently, according to now before the Committee. surance doubly sure."" ment on the present occasion surprises me., in view of their support of the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay. Was that amendment carried contrary to their expectations? How it was carried is no concern of mine. I voted for it, believing in the principle it embodied. Apparently, however, the members of the Labour Pariy expected to come into office on the carrying of an amendment including only railwayservants. At any rate, they are not prepared now to ""make assurance doubly sure,"" so far as the position of other Commonwealth and States public servants is concerned. I cannot refuse to vote for the present amendment, but I should like to have seenboth I believe in arbitration, Commonwealth and States officials brought within the scope of the Bill.

That is an inelegant but expressive term to define for a moment contend that the Bill would my position as that of one who wishes to include all classes of public servants. should like to see this Labour Ministry ""whole hoggers."" I suggest to them, not as a Greek bringing presents, but as one who wishes them well, and desires to assist them, that it is not too late to change their attitude on this matter. I have been with them in many of their proposals for years past, although not officially associated with ceedings. In New Zealand, the unions are them. If the interpretation clause, with its definition of an industrial dispute, covers the whole ground, well and good, .but if it does not we shall have what mav be termed an emasculated measure. I am afraid that unless the Government stand to their guns in connection with their original proposal to bring the public servants of the States within the scope of this measure they will not they have hitherto enjoyed. they will not attempt to run around the hurdle which the Deakin Ministry refused to jump, and that they will not expose their friends to any reproaches on their account. I believe that the Minister of External Affairs is perfectly honest in his opinion that the amendment will embrace all public servants of the States, and, although I -should like to have some further assurance upon that point, I shall vote for the amendment under the impression that it will confer the benefits of the measure upon all classes of employees. desire to say a few words in reply to the emploved looking after luggage the same honourable member for Dallev.

I argued, therefore, that whilst some of the railway employees would probably gain, others would sustain an injury. I do not operate to reduce wages, but that it would I probably average them by reducing them in one State and raising them in another. pel the Court to make the wages identical in all the States. do so, and we know that that has been done in connection with other arbitration pronow agitating to have the decisions given by the Arbitration Courts in one part of New Zealand applied all over the Colony, and the chances are that if a dispute arose upon the railways and extended beyond any one State, the Arbitration Court would place the wages in the States concerned upon the same level. The honourable member for Dalley said that the railway men would be foolish to submit to an authority unless they command the same respect as had some expectation that their wages would 1 hope that be raised, and he thus gave away the whole case. He apparently believes that the effect of this legislation will be to raise the wages of the men, but Ministers tell us that the men will have to accept a reduction if the Court so decides. One of the railway men, speaking at a meeting recently helcl in Sydney, complained that the Railway Commissioners adopted the practice of giving comparatively unimportant work, and a correspondingly smaller rate of salary, to men who had become incapacitated for employment in the higher branches of the service, and I submit' that no Arbitration Court I",51,Conciliation And Arbitration

273,Mr Lonsdale,"No ; but they couldadvantages on the other. The honourable member challenged my statement that, in many cases unionists had not the moral courage to take an independent course. I am in a position to prove the absolute correctness of my statement. I was informed that the last big strike at Mort's-Dock would not have occurred if the married men had ' had the power to prevent it. The single men brought about that strike, and the married men could not resist them. We all know that that strike was a fiasco from be-ginning to ""end, and .was brought about by only a section of the employees. The same ' remarks would apply to many of the strikes which have occurred at Newcastle from time to time. Then, again, when the Australian Workers' Union demanded 25s. per 100 for shearing, a number of shearers would not go out on strike. I was told by some of the unionists, who live in my own constituency, that the demand should never have been made. I asked them why they did not oppose it, and they said it would be utterly'useless for them to attempt to do so. I then asked"" Why do you not go to work for the squatters?"" and they replied, "" We are not going to shear at a l l ; we do not believe in this demand, but we cannot blackleg.""' I think that these instances are sufficient to abundantly prove my assertion. The honourable member for Dalley also told us that in his view every Court was a Court of Justice, but my experience is that although there may be plenty of law in our Courts there is extremely little justice. I have always advised others to adopt the same course that I follow, and on no account to go to law, or have anything *to do with lawyers. The honourable member did not apparently understand what constituted a State right. I would point way and not to private individual's, and, therefore, that the right to control the railways is a State right. Even though a railway strike might extend from one State into another, it could not be said to have passed beyond the control of the States authorities, because it could be dealt with by over which the dispute extended. do not believe that even in such a case the Commonwealth should interfere. If it had been clearly provided -that the Commonwealth should exercise control by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Court over the railway services of the States, none of the States would have accepted the Constitution, and it would beabsolutely wrong for us to seek by a sidewind to exercise power-which was never in-, tended to be granted to us. those who on a former occasion Supported, the proposal to bring railway servants within the scope of the Bill, I desire to say that I intend to vote for the amendment. When I voted previously, there was no crisis, and! no question as to whether the Ministryshould remain in office, or be rejected from: it. I voted for what I believed to be an' important principle, and I shall act similarly this evening It was rather amusing to listen to the wordy conflict between the honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Dalley. The former honourable member has laid it down that lawyers are persons to be avoided, and he evidently regards them as robbers. I do not greatly care whether the proposal of the Government is constitutional or otherwise, notwithstanding that, upon numerous occasions we have heard the leading members of this House discussing that question. The chief reason why I voted in favour of the early establishment of the High Court, was that it might be able to decide questionsaffecting the interpretation of the Constitution. That was one of the principal reasons advanced for the creation of that tribunals I have every confidence in the ability of theJustices of the High Court to decide whether this proposal is constitutional or otherwise. We have been told by some honourable members that it involves an interference with States rights. To my mind, however, a dispute affecting the railway employees of the States is one of the most important that could occupy the attention of out to him that the railany Arbitration Court. Honourable memservices belong to the States bers should recollect that the States railways carry our mails as well as our produce. Some opposition has been urged to the B ill, upon the. ground that it will interfere with the producers of the country. But I ask, "" Could anything worse happen to the producing classes than the sudden stoppage of our railway system ? "" Why, such an occurthe authorities in those States rence would be nothing short of a national' I disaster. I take it that the chief object of this measure is to prevent strikes. If , by including the railway servants of the States within the scope of this measure, we canprevent the possibility of a great railwaystrike, we are making a wise provision against a calamity which may, at any time, ' befall our producers and people generally.",52,Conciliation And Arbitration

279,Mr Kennedy,"I venture to say that the jurisdiction of the proposed Arbitration Court. The present attitude of the Government forcibly recalls to my mind that human beings, irrespective of their station in life, are to a great extent governed by their environment. The present action of the Prime Minister and his colleagues is governed by the circumstances which confront them. The Deakin Ministry frankly asked the House to exclude from the operation of this Bill the public servants of the States and of the Commonwealth. The present Prime Minister and his supporters most strenuously objected to the adoption of that course. The result was the defeat of the late Government. Yet the present Ministry now turn a complete political somersault. I presume that the Prime Minister had some hand in drafting this amendment, which proposes to include only States railway servants, or those employed in industries which are carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth, or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. It leaves in doubt the class of person intended to be brought within the operation of the Bill. In the amendment originally formulated by the present Minister of Trade and Customs, the language employed was-beyond question. A perusal of it showed at once that the intention was that every member of the Public Services of the Commonwealth and of the States should be brought within the provisions of the Bill. But without any explanation, the Government have departed from the phraseology employed in that amendment. I did not have the privilege of hearing the explanation made this evening by the Minister of External Affairs, but it seems to me that the members of the Government are themselves in doubt as to the extent of our constitutional power in this direction. Before they took office, however, they entertained no doubt whatever in regard to the matter. It is for the High Court to determine whether the Constitution enables all the public servants of the States to be brought within the scope of this measure, and there should be no room to say thaU the language employed in the Statute does not show the clear intention of the Parliament. It may be that the Ministry now realize the responsibility of their attitude, but it is well that the Committee and the country generally should know what is the true position. It is unnecessary for me to explain my attitude. I put my views clearry and distinctly before my constituents at the last elections, and was returned as one wholly opposed to the inclusion either of public servants or railway employees. As a member of the State Parliament of VictoriaI supported the application of compulsory arbitration to the larger concerns of industrial life, in which there is competition among private employers, and as one familiar with the results of a resort to a strike I have from the firsb advocated that application. It has always been open to parties to resort to voluntary arbitration, but as the voluntary principle has never been successful I favour compulsory arbitration. I am emphatically opposed, however, to the proposal to bring the public servants or railway employees of the States within the scope of this Bill, for, in my opinion, it would be an infringement of States rights lo do so. I may not have any definite opinion of what really constitutes States rights. I know that prior to the Federation the States had sovereign powers, and that under the Constitution of the Commonwealth they transferred certain of their powers to ihis Parliament ; but I am convinced that the States have never transferred to the Federal Parliament -power to deal with the public servants of the States.' It is for this reason that I have pledged myself to oppose the extension of the Bill to States employees, and it appears to me that those who profess to see no distinction between the position of a State employee and the employ! of a private individual are really burking the issues with which we are at present confronted.

It purports to embrace the whole of the public servants of the States, and of the Commonwealth.

I recognise that questions of expediency are involved, and that perhaps on the whole it would have been wiser if we had not endeavoured to go so far as is proposed by this amendment. However, our constitutional power will have to be decided by the High Court in any case, and it is just as well to get a final decision as to the actual extent of our powers.

MrM c WILLIAMS any States servants being included in the Bill, but I contend that, if we include any of the States servants, we should not discriminate between those who work with their hands, and who bunch their votes, and those who work with their pen, and do not exercise such great political power. With all deference to those honourable and learned members who have given us their opinions upon the constitutional aspect of this question, I hold the view that the Commonweal tn Has no power to enforce an award against any State which declines to carry out its wishes. In reading an interesting history of America, I came across a paragraph which, I think, is particularly applicable to the present case. It reads as follows: When an individual defies the law you can lock him up in gaol, or levy an execution upon his property. The immense force of the communitv is arrayed against him, and he is helpless as a straw on the billows of the ocean. He cannot raise a militia to protect himself. But when the law is defied by a State, it is quite otherwise. You cannot put the State into gaol, nor seize its goods; you can only make war on it, and if you try that expedient you will find that the State is not quite helpless. local pride and prejudices are aroused against you, and its militia will turn out in f u l l force tn uphold the infringement of the law. I 'would ask honourable members what would be the position of the Commonwealth if a State refused to comply with an award of the Arbitration Court? We all know that the railway trouble which recently occurred in Victoria, and which has not been entirely disposed of, is at the bottom of the provision which it is now sought to insert in the Bill. State Government refused to comply with the judgment of any Federal Court ?'

We have a railway trouble right upon us. .and there is I am opposed to no use blinking the fact. Three different rates of wages are paid in the States of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales respectively. The wages paid in New South Wales are higher-considerabl y higher-tha n those ruling in the other States referred to. Suppose that a question, arose with regard to wages, and the Arbitration Court decided, as they probably would do, that the same wages should be paid in New South Wales and Victoria, where the conditions are somewhat similar. Would the Court have the power to compel the New South Wales railway authorities to reduce their wages to the rates paid in Victoria? pelled to reduce wages under any award; they could give as much more as they liked.

I do not see that we are imposing any greater task on the Court in this relation than we are in any other part of the B ill . Court has cast on it the duty of first registering an organization; and I may point out that the definition of "" organization "" in the Bill is that, in the case of employees, it shall consist of not less than 100 members. Therefore, the Court would not have before it any case of Government employees unless at least 100 persons were concerned.

As to the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, I may sav that all through this sitting-althoug h I have not previously referred to the matterI have been somewhat touched .by the anxiety exhibited by all our opponents to load us up with gifts in this connection. Those who are determined that by no vote, so far as they are concerned, shall the Bill provide for Government employees, are anxious to load the measure with provisions, which, if adopted, will make it unworkable. Minister's own proposal. 3R the proposal might have been accepted with some degree of confidence, because, to begin with, we are admittedly in favour of the measure, and of extending its benefits to as many public servants as is practicable under the Constitution. But coming from the other side, who are admittedly out of sympathy with the proposal-wh o are bitterly The opposed to including any Of the public servants within the provisions of the Bill-the suggestion has to be regarded with some degree of suspicion. So far as I am concerned, I plead guilty to no alteration of policy or attitude on this point. Right through I have expressed a doubt as to whether we have the power to include all public servants within the scope of the measure. Minister not advocate including all public servant's, and allowing the High Court to I mean one or two men decide the constitutional question? pared to vote for such a proposal, because I did not want, at that stage, any misconception to arise as to what my own desires were. But now we, who are in favour of the measure, have the advantage of a definition of the constitutional position by the learned Attorney-General, who is, as we know, in sympathy with our desires; and I am willing to defer to him as to the actual language the clause should contain. After all, it is-very difficult to say how far I the term ""industrial "" carries us. The right honourable member for East Sydney speaking just after my statement of the Government policy a fortnight ask. ago, said that in his opinionI suppose he put the opinion forward hurriedly-ther e was no limit to the number of persons who might be covered by the term ""industrial,"" so long as they were in employment forward by the Minister of External Affairs this afternoon. only a fortnight ago by the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney. This shows how difficult it is to define clearly and distinctly what the meaning of the Constitution is. We are assured, at any rate, by the Attorney-Gensral that the provision follows as nearly as practicable the language of the Constitution; and it does not seem to me that we can carry the matter any further.

The honourable and learned member for Ballarat will remember that when he, as Prime Minister, first introduced the Bill six. amendment honourable members opposite or seven months ago,i I asked that the language of the Constitution should be employed in regard to the provisions affecting shipping. The honourable and learned member had included in the first Bill a provision which excluded all foreign shipping from the operation of the measure, and I then asked that the terms of the Constitution should be inserted in lieu of that provision, so that, at any rate, we would be taken at least so far as the Constitution itself takes us. That is the contention I have followed out in other regards also-for instance, in regard to the actual terms of sub-section xxxv. There, again, I think that we should rely on the words of the Constitution theminclude every public servant. Now, however, selves, so that we may not even inadvertently do less than the Constitution will permit us to do. That is the consistent ground which I have 'taken up right through, and as my present amendment is practically a paraphrase of the Constitution, I think we are going quite as far as we can go, and that our action is consistent with the attitude we assumed some time ago. Prime Minister has tried to explain how it is that he and his party have changed their front on this matter. But so far as I can see there has been no real explanation. They themselves, on a former occasion, forced this matter to an issue. Prime Minister refused to accept the amendment which honourable members opposite desired that he should make in the Bill. Prime Minister would accept no proposal to include any State Government employed statement. several times. amendment before us, and that was the amendment of the present Minister of Trade and Customs, which included the public servants of the States without any reference to industrial pursuits. Prime Minister that his Government would not accept the inclusion of any public servants. what they said they would accept; my point is what they didi In forcing that defeated the late Government. I fully take my share of the responsibility for what occurred. If honourable members opposite do not know where they are, I know where I am. They got into power by defeating the late Government upon that point. helped us. am not going to help the honourable gentleman and his Government now. I have made it perfectly clear that I am against their proposal. If they desire to show their devotion to principle they should stick to the amendment on which they won their present position. They were determined to they want to include only a very few ; because they fear that any Court would decide that very few industrial occupations are being carried on by the States. leader thinks otherwise. I do not allow any one else to think for me. I have some admiration for honourable members opposite, but I should have a larger admiration for them if they stood to their principles. The Prime Minister regards the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin as coming from an enemy, and, therefore, he says he intends to oppose it. The amendment puts the Government to The exthe test once more. The honourable member for Franklin urges that if one State public servant is included all should be included. The Prime Minister gives the whole case away when he says that if some friend of the Ministry had proposed the amendment he would have accepted it. Because it is proposed from this side of the Chamber he will not do so. Apparently, it is a good thing to accept an amendment from a friend, but a bad thing to accept the same"" amendment from an 'opponent. I am against including any State public servant, but once more, to show my devotion to principle, I am prepared to call for a division, on the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin. I wish to make it clear that I do not believe in seeking to take from the States their right to control their servants.
