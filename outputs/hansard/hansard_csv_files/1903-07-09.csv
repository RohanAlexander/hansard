Furthermore, is it a fact that the reporter said to him"" I suppose the measure will not be circulated until Tuesday or Wednesday ?"" and he replied"" Oh, no; you will be well ahead."" referred to, and it in no way induces me to qualify the statement. I have already made. I was asked to supply a copy of the Bill, and I said that I could not do it, because, I added, the details were not yet settled, and it was to be considered by the Cabinet next day. The conversation alluded to took place, on Thursday afternoon, about six 39o use of ifceprescntatibes, Thursday, 9 . July, 1903. o'clock.

3,Mr Kingston,"I have read the letterand under those circumstances I commenced to discuss the measure with him. I told him that I should be obliged if he could make any confidential suggestions to me on the subject, and as he promised to do so, I handed him the Bill. I discussed the' whole matter with him in the same manner as I would discuss it with any honourable member with whom I believed myself to be in confidential communication, because this is a matter in regard to which I have not hesitated to avail myself of all the suggestions which I could collect. As to talking of getting in front of the other newspapers, there was nothing of the sort said. Some doubt was expressed as to when he could see me and when I could see him, and I pointed out that the Bill would not in the natural order of things be circulated untill tlie following Tuesday or Wednesday. I expected to see him on the following Saturday, or to receive from him any suggestions that he had to make. Instead of that, I knew no more of the matter until I saw what appeared in Saturday's Age, and, to show my appreciation of the position, I will read to honourable members the letter which I then wrote to him as soon as I could after reading the Age report:Dear Mr Biggs, Be Conciliation Bill. The references to this measure which appear in this morning's Age are nothing more nor less bhan a gross breach of the understanding pursuant to which I let you have an incomplete draft of the Bill. Ib is simply sickening thab my confidence should be thus abused. Mr Robinson, I am happy to be able to say, has always been able to respect it, but once bitten .twice shy, and you will have no opportunity of repeating this trick. able gentleman received any reply to that letter? House hear it ? have just read crossed the following letter from Mr Biggs :Dear Mr Kingston, Will you be so good, if you have your copy of your 1894 Jteview of Reviews article, to send it to meat bhe Age office. In my humble judgment your Bill is magnificent. That statement was made, I take it , in compliance with my wish that he should send me any suggestions he had to make. The only thing wanting is a clause making it clear thab the employees in certain State workshops, .like, the railways, are under the Bill. They and free discussion of its provisions, which are by implication, bub not specifically. I cabled 100 words about the Bill bo the Daily Chronicle. Whenever you want to send anything to the London papers, please tell me, the Daily Chronicle will see to it. Thanking you very much for your kind help. receive another letter ? letterI had your letter this morning, and can only express extreme surprise and regret that there should have been any misunderstanding. You will remember, when I saw you on Thursday, thab you asked me who was going to write about the Bill, and I told you I was. You then said-""When is the article to appear?"" I answered-""On Saturday."" Moreover, in my original letter I made it quibe clear, I fancy, bhat we wanted bhe advance copy for use. So certain am I of these facts thab I would be very glad if you woidd let me see you, so that the position may be made clear. Ib is the firsb bime I have been accused of being guilty of a trick, so should be obliged if \'Ou will see your way to grant the interview. Had there been the faintest doubt in my mind bhat the Bill was given me for anything bub use, not a line would have appeared. I am placing the matter before my principals. I refused the interview because I felt that I had been very badly treated, and my surprise and annoyance were very great.. I ' never dreamt of authorizing the anticipation of the ordinary means of communicating . the contents of the Bill to Parliament. I have had much experience with the press during my political life, but I have never done anything like that, and never will. I say again that no authority was given by me for what happened. I should be worse than a fool to do such a thing. My desire, above all things, is to preserve the ver}' best relations with the members of the Legislature to which I have the honour to belong.

11,Mr Kingston,"All I can say is this :I entered upon in order to fortif y myself by the assistance which I ventured to think, from what he said to me, he would be able to afford. I regret the incident very much. I have always believed the gentleman with whom I conversed to be a man of the highest honour, and I am content to accept the assurance that the whole thing was a misunderstanding. I do not care to press any point home. I did nothing, however, which would justify a misunderstanding. All I said was what was right, proper, and fair under the circumstances. What1 did was what is not infrequently done by politicians similarly situated in communication with the press and with the public upon a measure with which they are intimately concerned. for Defence read the following paragraphs in this morning's newspaper :Speaking at the opening of the town-hall at North Fremantle to-day, His Excellency the Governor( Sir Frederick Bedford) said that as an old sailor he felt justified in expressing the opinion that there was a great necessity for Fremantle being defended as soon as possible against foreign war vessels. It was a matter in which they should keep the Federal Government up to the mark. He was aware that the -fortification of Fremantle had been mentioned by the Federal authorities, but people should keep pegging away at them, so that the work would he carried out without delay. At the presenb time all nations appeared to be embracing each other, and there seemed to be no indication of war, but they knew from"" history that nations mighb embrace each obher to-day and be flying at each other's throats to-morrow. The Premier( Mr James) said that he thought the Governor was a brave man to speak as he had done in face of the recent attitude of the Federal Parliament in connection with Sir George Sydenham Clarke's speech on naval defence. Personally, he was glad the Governor had the courage to give expression to his opinion regarding the defence of Fremantle, and he hoped that the time would never come bhab he or an}' other Sbate take the steps necessary to .introduce this Governor would be prevented from voicing his views on such matters. Those ab bhe head of bhe Federal Government ab the present time had not shown such abounding statesmanship that they should be free from criticism. If the right honourable gentleman has read these paragraphs, will he tell the House what is likely to be done, and whether there will be as little delay as possible in carrying out the works t able member to give notice of the question, though I do not think I can tell him what is proposed to be done until the Estimates have been settled. The important town which he represents is now undefended, and I am sure that the Government, and every member of tbe House, wil l be glad if that state of things can be altered. Prime Minister whether, in view of the recent outbreak of small-pox in Tasmania, it is the intention of the Government to introduce, during this session, the necessary machinery B ill to enable the Commonwealth to administer quarantine laws, as provided for in sub-section (9) of section 51 of the Constitution. measure is necessary to enable the Commonwealth Government to administer the quarantine laws of the various States, inasmuch as provision is made in the Constitution for the transfer of the States Departments to the Commonwealth on a proclamation being issued by the Governor General in Council. I take it that the honourable member desires to know whether it is the intention of the Government to at once issue the necessary proclamation for the transfer of these Departments. I do not see anything in the present state of affairs which shows that the taking over of the Quarantine Department is, any more than before the outbreak of small-pox at Launceston, a question of urgency, and I think the matter demands a little more consideration before anything is done. Minister whether, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory state of the Weights and Measures Acts of the various States, he will session legislation dealing with a uniform system ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON It will be within the recollection of honourable members that not long ago a series of resolutions was passed, at the instance of the honourable member for South Sydney, embracing proposals relating to the metric system of weights and measures which I had been about to submit.

I must askask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he regards that system of circumlocution as satisfactory, and whether the Government will take some steps to put an end to it as promptly as possible ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE stated that I have applied to the Post and Telegraph Department on several occasions to consent to such an alteration of the present system as would enable instructions to go direct from the Department of Home Affairs to the Public Works Department in the various States, but that the Post and Telegraph Department object. I did not wish to do anything contrary to their wishes, but the fact that instructions filter through this channel causes undue and unnecessary delay. is, who is the officer responsible for the delay, and whether the work is likely to be carried out ? If seven months must elapse after tlie money has been set apart for a particular work, before a beginning can be made to carry it out member must not debate the question. Minister for Home Affairs whether it takes seven months, after the money is set apart for a work, before that work can be commenced? I should like to know, also, ""to whom I am to apply for information as to whether the work is to be carried out or not ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON must take it upon myself to answer tlie honourable member. who among the Government officers is responsible for the delay is one that cannot be settled in this manner, but it will have to be leftfcothe Cabinet to determine whether the Postal Department is justified in requiring that all these TaatteuB sbould pass through its hands. I shall have that matter considered in Cabinet, and afterwards we shall know where the responsibility lies. In the meantime,T do not think ifc would be just to mention any officer in the Department as responsible for the delay. Prime Minister whether, when the matter just mentioned is being dealt w it h in Cabinet, the Government will also consider the advisability of evolving some system of reducing the time taken up i u the various States Works Departments in carrying out the instructions of the Eederal authorities? I may explain that on one occasion the Eederal officer in Sydney authorized certain I have just works to be carried out, and it took twelve days before the instructions reached the Government Architect, the red-tape system having monopolized the whole of the intervening time. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am quite sure that the Minister for Home Affairs will be at one with me when I say that if there have been delays of this kind-and as to the extent to which they have proceeded, I shall inquire-it will be our duty to consider tlie whole question with a view to expediting the carrying out of the works in W h a t I wish to know future. representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice1.

I would also quote from the handbook of the Navy League, dated 2nd December, 1902, in which Mr HerbertW . Wilson draws attention to the following extract from the report of the Committee on Naval Manoeuvres:There should always be an effective reserve squadron, absolutely confined to home waters, sufficient to hold the Channel and protect the coasts and commerce of the United Kingdom, in addition to the coast-defence ships which would be required for active local defence. Mr Wilson says furtherThe experience of the Spanish-American war has shown that public opinion will always clamour be allowed to remain in any haphazard state, for a home squadron. We had a squadron in the Channel all through the Trafalgar campaign. Later on, he urges the provision of a North Sea fleet always cruising in British waters. Recently the three historical stations in which the home fleet has hitherto been concentrated was increased by the addition of a new base at the Firth of Forth. a further source of defence for the British Isles, and its ' establishment shows that the Admiralty recognise that there are certain positions which require to be permanently watched, and which should not be interfered with by any demand for concentration of fleets in any other part of the globe. Th'e French, too, have recognised the same principle in connection with their newly organized arrangements for the defence of their possessions in Cochin China. The late Minister of Marine, M . Lanessan, has organized two highly powerful squadrons for the defence of French possessions in eastern seas, and has made provision for their concentration and operation in time of war. But whilst providing for these enormous squadrons he has also taken the precaution to arrange for a special local defence, a number of powerfully-armed sliips of war, as well as submarine and torpedo boats, having been set aside for theI am quoting the defence of the coast of Cochin China. Thisindicates that the French also recognise that there are special positions -demanding special local defence. Sir JOHNQUIC K Absolutely. I am merely showing, however, that theprinciple of local defence in certain circumstances is fully recognised. Captain Mahan, one of the greatest authorities on the development of naval power, points out that there are special points, such as San Francisco Harbor and Puget Sound, which can be properly defended only by telling off certain naval forces to permanently watch over them and to guard against sudden attacks or raids. Therefore, the contention that there should be a naval force specially designed to defend Australia is not inconsistent with the views of the foremost naval authorities of the time. Those of us who contend that Australia should not be left unguarded, and that its defence should not are fully justified by strong naval authority in advancing that' view.. I should like again to remind honourable members that the naval subsidy agreement of 18S7 was drawn up on the lines that the Auxiliary Squadron provided under it should be specially assigned the duty of protecting Australia in time of war, and should not be removed That additional station will be from Australasian waters except by the consent of the local authorities. Every argument that has been put forward in support Of the proposal for an Australian naval force has been met with tlie hackneyed expression"" Oh! the expense would render it impossible."" That reply is thrown in our teeth at every stage, of the discussion. I think, however, that it is often made without a proper consideration of what are the proposals in the direction of the creation of a properly organized Austrar lian force. It is said that such a force would cost upwards of one million sterling. That is a statement which is freely made, and I think it was repeated last night by the Prime Minister. I believe that he said that the provision of a force that would be likely to be of any service would involve an annual expenditure of upwards of £1,000,000.",19,Barton

48,Mr Ewing,"Are all these ships underforce equal to the squadron to be provided under this agreement would probably cost us more than £500,000 a year. large. one thinks of Kyabram. that the cost would be at least £1,000,000 per annum. I would point out that even the estimate of. £500,000 per annum is based upon the assumption that we should have to provide a squadron of the extent referred to in the proposed agreement. The squadron that would be provided under that agreement would consist of first class, second-class, and third-class cruisers of a most expensive type, which would be capable of sailing probably to any part of the world. But vessels of the type which are suggested as being applicable to the special defence of Australia would not be so expensive. There can be no doubt about the strength of the vessels proposed to be provided under the new agreement; but ifc is believed by competent naval authorities that vessels involving only half the expense would serve our .purpose. necessaiy to provide them with the same world-wide steaming capacity, and what could be saved by the curtailment of the steam power necessary for long voyages might be utilized for the increase of gun power. It is a well-known fact that the closer vessels are to a base, the more provision can be made for the increase of their gun power and effectiveness in actual warfare. The farther afield they have to go, thegreater is the sailing capacity with which they have to be provided, and the greater is the loss in gun power. Although the naval agreement of which we are now askedfcoapprove would involve, I believe, an annual expenditure of some £4S0,000, that expenditure is much in advance of the estimated cost .of the reasonably equipped squadron which was first submitted by the Admiralty to the Conference of Colonial Premiers in London. I find it stated in the Spectator that the first scheme which was submitted by the Admiralty to the Premiers' Conference involved a total charge of only £367,000 per annum. In a letter signed by Senator Matheson, and published in the Spectator, the following passage occurs :The confidential report of the Premiers' Coninterest is calculated on the same basis as ference, 1902, proves that this is not the caseI said that a naval This is to say, that the expense would not amount to £1,000,000 per annumably supplied the figures. The Admiralty suggested to the Conference a fleet of three secondclass cruisers (5,600 tons) in commission, and two second-class cruisers (5, COO tons) in reserve ; they It is nothing when estimated the interest on construction and armament at £.125,000, and maintenance at .t'242,000, a total annual charge of £367,000. Thus the scheme first submitted by the Admiralty was not so ambitious or so extensive as the one ultimately adopted, and according to the view then taken by the Admiralty, an adequate fleet could have been provided for an expenditure of £367,000 per annum. How then is £500,000 per annum to be absorbed as suggested by the Prime Minister1 What becomes of the suggestion that an Australian naval force would cost £1,000,000 per annum? When honourable members are disposed to be influenced by the suggestions as to the expense that an Australian naval force would involve, they should carefully consider these figures. It was originally suggested that tlie cost of providing an adequate Australian naval force would be £1,000,000 per annum. It would not be Then the estimate rose to £2,000,000, and it has gone on swelling until it has assumed appalling proportions. ' It is no wonder that even Kyabram is alarmed at the expense which it is suggested will be involved in the defence of Australia. Those figures, however, are really worthless they are wild calculations-whe n compared with the Admiralty estimate included in the confidential report, and, no doubt, to be found in the White Book, that an adequate force could be provided at an annual cost of £367,000. include interest 1' shows that that estimate includes £125,000 for interest on construction and armament, and £242,000 for maintenance, making a total of £367,000.

We shall be more successful by directly and continuously participating in naval defence than by handing over the whole matter to the Admiralty for a period of ten years. I u my opinion, it would be a mistake to commit ourselves to a cast-iron system for so long a period. I deplore the fact that the proposed agreement involves the absolute effacement and annihilation of the naval forces of Australia which have been organized under State administration during a period of 40 years. While nothing is proposed in the direction of increasing our local naval forces, the Protector and the Queensland warships will, under the agreement, be sold up within a year or two, and their men disbanded, the only local vessel to be retained being the Cerberus. What is to be done with those men 1 It is said that the Admiralty will absorb them. I , for one, object to that. In my opinion, the Australian Government could as effectually control these naval brigades as could the Admiralty. If the Commonwealth does not retain its control over them, and the men are allowed, if they'choose, to join' a naval reserve under the Admiralty, we shall have Imperial officers parading our streets for recruiting purposes. Is that a thing which should happen when we possess the necessary authority and organization to establish here branches of the Royal Naval Reserve as successfully as they could be established under the Admiralty ? All we want is a vessel in which to give our men sea training, and all we ask is that we shall be allowed to retain our naval forces as they are, with the right to go on improving them. stop us from doing that. Sir JOHN QUICK for a naval reserve we cannot retain the present naval brigade. We must abandon one or the other. Sir'JOH NQUICK tend to make a strong effort for the retention of the existing naval forces, and, in Committee, I shall move an amendment to give effect to a clause in the agreement of 1S87, under which, notwithstanding the 6 B subsidy, nothing shall be allowed to interfere with the existing organization of thanaval forces of the Commonwealth. learned member intend to vote agiiinst thesecond reading ?

I hope that the House will, not be led astray by wildly exaggerated statements as to the cost of an Australian naval force, and will insist that the Commonwealth shall retain control of its naval forces, and thus show tlie world that we are not ignorant or neglectful of our duties as a part of the Empire.

Another reason for condensing m y remarks is that a number of honourable members wish soon to leave for their distanthomes. The measure, however, is oneof great interest, more especially because of: the profound sensation caused throughout the Empire by certain new departures from the line of Imperial policy, traces of whicb can be found in the proposed arrangement.

71,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"Afte r thea military or a naval spirit iu the various outlying parts of the Empire. much happier phase has now come over the relations between the British Government and the other governing in the Empire upon this and many other important questions, and we now find the Imperial authorities profoundly eager to draw us all into partnership, whilst on the part of of the Empire disinclination to adopt that course. So far as the loyal and patriotic utterances of the Prime Minister are concerned, I think that honourable members, whatever view they may take of this particular Bill, will heartily endorse them, and will not find it necessary to repeat them. Patriotic sentiment is a grand thing, even when it leads us along the flowery paths of rhetoric ; but a grander thing about it is that it inspires us to noble deeds. I always draw a sharp distinction between verbal expressions of loyalty and such a grand manifestation of that spirit as was given by our Australian sons when they went to South Africa to fight, and risk their lives and shed their blood for the Empire. in verbal manifestations of our loyalty the better, and I do not propose to take up the time of the House in asserting a fact which ought to have been obvious enough to anyone many years ago. But there is a great deal to justify the observations of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. some acquaintance with the history of this question, and it is a most interesting one. I wish to give the House tlie benefit of my information in a very brief compass. I should like first to remind honourable members that something like a compact was entered into between the Imperial Government and the self-governing States, on this matter of defence, about 30 years ago. As we all know, about that time we had not only British ships on our coasts, but Imperial troops quartered in our towns. In 1S70 an understanding the Imperial and the Australian Governments, and probably also with other Governments, to the effect that the colonies would be looked to to provide their own coast defences, whilst the Imperial Government wou,ld be responsible for the safety of the Empire's interests on the seas. 1 was a clear understanding arrived at, in virtue of which the troops were removed from Australia, and in virtue of which also If r . Beid. we inaugurated an elaborate and very exA pensive system of coastal defence. In 1881, at a conference of very able Premiers of Australia, this step was taken : Following bodies upon the lines of that understanding, the Premiers passed a resolution affirming the necessity of making our coastal defences more efficient, and impressing upon the Imperial Government the necessity of making the self governing States the naval defences more efficient. The there is a profound British Government received with satisfaction the assurance that' the Australian Governments were prepared to develop their coastal defences, but they did not regard with the same feeling the request for the strengthening of the British Navy in these seas, maintained wholly at the cost of the Imperial Government. It was in that year, 1881, that this question first took the shape of a joint contribution by the Imperial and the Australian Governments to the navy in these waters. As time went on, Commodore Tryon, who was commissioned by the British Government to move the various Australian Governments, so far prevailed upon them that a conference was assembled in London in the year 1S87. The less we indulge I think a number of matters were dealt with, but the principal question was that of naval defence. the Queen's first jubilee. brations were held in the same year, but I have the conference had really nothing to do with them. The representatives of the colonies did not go home in connection with that event, and I do not know that they were in England at the time it occurred. cept,' perhaps, one or two of them. member of that conference, and, therefore, his memory is probably correct. I know that the conference was held quite apart from the event referred to.

75,Mr Beid,"My honourable friend was aproposed that there should be a limit within which the first Auxiliary Squadron should work. So that this theory of the limit did not, so far as the documents show, emanate from colonial selfishness, but from the Admiralty memorandum. tioned that last evening. I have referred is to be found in the volume of Parliamentary Papers on the subject, and is dated the 25th February, 1887. The Admiralty authorized the representative of the British Government to propose certain vessels for the Auxiliary Squadron, and, further, it was suggested that the limits of employment of these vessels should be fixed. inserted at the instance of the Premierst friend must understand that I am speaking of the memorandum read by the president of the Conference before there was a clause of any kind in any agreement. The president of the Conference delivered an opening address, and the memorandum which was read formed the basis of the deliberations of the Conference. For all I know, some colonial Minister may have suggested the limit, but it was not a matter of controversy. The Admiralty accepted the view-if ifc was pressed upon them-and it was accepted all through the discussions as the basis of this agreement. the surface, at all events. to the draft of the agreement which is embodied in the various statutes of the different States. The agreement was settled, and afterwards submitted to and passed by the various colonies, and it is important to notice the statement made in the preamble to this agreementof 1887. Itissupported by the language of the Conference, because throughout the proceedings the object of the naval agreement was denned to be ""the necessity of increasing the naval force for the protection of the floating trade in Australasian waters at their joint charge."" So that we have clearly brought out in the existing agreement the idea, first of an Imperial squadron in the ordinary sense, such as they have on the China or East Indian, or Northern Pacific stations, and then an Australian squadron. affairs, one being vessels, as other ships of the larly in one which was delivered by the 6 13 2 King are, the other consisting of vessels for a definite purpose, and for the protection of Imperial trade within a definite area. There were further considerations embraced in this agreement which are worthy of notice. They were very important. There was the condition that, if the Auxiliary Squadron were established, there should be no diminution of the force of the Imperial Squadron in these seas. Ifc is obvious that if the establishment of the Auxiliary Squadron were to lead to the removal of Imperial vessels, we should, after the agreement, be in exactly the same position, or in an even worse one than before; and therefore one of the terms of the agreement was that no reduction should be made in the Imperial Squadron. It is providedThat notwithstanding the establishment of these joint naval forces, no reduction is to take My honourable and learned place in the normal strength of Her Majesty's naval forces empioj'ed on the Australian station, exclusive of survey vessels. The object of the agreement was perfectly clear. The Imperial Squadron was to remain continually ab its previous strength, and the Auxiliary Squadron was to be an additional defence-for the purposes of protecting bhe brade in Australian waters. The limibs of employment were also well defined. To carry out tliat portion of the agreement there was a proviso thab bhe ships mighb be employed beyond cerbain limibs only wibh bhe consenb of the colonial Governments. So that we see that in 1SS7, whether rightly or wrongly, there was none of this overwhelming earnestness as to the matter of naval tactics which have been so ably and technically elaborated in the speech of the Prime Minisber. The Admiralby and bhe Imperial Government then had no objection to the limitation of the operations of the Auxiliary Squadron, because the object of that Squadron was not so much to add to the mobile strength of the British Navy as to perform a special service in one particular parb of the British Empire. I am simply mentioning bhese mabfcers as worthy of consideration. We come now bo a later date, namely, the year 1S97. Honourable members will recollect that at that time the Premiers of the different States were deputed to visit London, to be present at a certain great celebration in connection with bhe labe Monarch's reign, and also bo attend a conference.

""this speech was delivered, I ventured to make observations, the echo of -which I 'heard in some very sensible remarks by the Prime Minister the other night. A day or two afterwards, the First Lord of the Admiralty attended the Conference, and told us that the Imperial Government had no desire to alter the terms of the agreement, and intended to send us a better Hug-ship. Ifc is, however, only fair to state that the motive i o r that action may have been oue of the -most refined and generous character. hably the motive was this : We were guests of the Imperial Government at the time, and it might have been felt to be rather an incongruous proceeding to force claims of .such a character-involving , as they did, .pecuniary obligations upon gentlemen, . however responsible, occupying such a delicate posibion. I wish to make bhab observation , as bhab may have been bhe motive which inspired the sudden change of attitude adopted by the, First Lord of the Admiralty. by the Secretary of Stabe for bhe Colonies at bhe beginning of bhab conference, which I shall presently quote from the authorized -official report of its proceedings. It is worth -quoting, because ib is only by reading bhe lines which I am about to read that the true impulse of the recent departure of bhe -Secretary of State for the Colonies can be 'Understood. He speaks with perfect frankness, and the House will, perhaps, pardon me if I read a short extract from his address on that occasion. I ask honourable members to note that these observations were inade in reference bo a project to create a sort -of Imperial Council. They readThere is only one point in reference to this which it is absolutely necessary we all should bear in mind. It may be that the time has come, aind, if not, I believe that it will come, when the colonies will desire to substitute for the slight relationship which at present exists, a true partnership, and in that case they will want their share in the management of the Empire, which -we like to think is as much theirs as it is ours. But, of course, with the privilege of management and of control, will also come the obligation and the responsibility. There will come some form -of contribution towards the expense for objects « which we will have in common. That, I say, is self evident, but it is to be borne in mind even in these early stages of the consideration of the subject. Now, the Secretary of State for the Colonies The right honourable was perfectly plain and straightforward in that declaration. He puts it as if the A t the banquet at which colonies were anxious to have a share in the management and control of Imperial affairs. But in that respect I think he failed to express the true inwardness of the situation, which was not that we should have a share in the management and control of Imperial affairs, because I have never yet encounbered in history any anxiety that any one should have a share in management and control, unless it was accompanied by a desire that they should render some substantial assistance. That really is the question which those who Protalk so lightly about Imperial federation have to face. If we are to ask for a share in the management and control of the affairs of the Emp'ire we must be partners, at least in the sense of making our substantial contribution towards the expense of maintaining the Empire. honourable and learned member says. It is necessary to make these observations because this agreement makes us partners in But there was a remark made bhe sense of bhe Secrebary of Stabe's remarks. The Auxiliary Squadron agreemenb made us parbners wibh bhe Imperial Government inan Australian squadron which was to be used in Australian seas. The agreement which we are now asked to adopt makes us partners in the Imperial Navy of the Empire, apart from Australian seas. I am not going to adhere to matters of form in reference to this agreement, but it is really right that this change should be pointed out. TheA c t under which our present agreement came into force plainly sets out a partnership in Australian defence, whereas the Bill under discussion sets out a partnership in Imperial defence. Practically, from one poinb of view bhe two tilings are identical. So long as we remain a parb of bhe Empire bhe bwo things are practically bhe same.

The subject of a change in these relations is oneof vast importance. I have always preferred to defer serious investigation of these matters til l such time as some definite proposal is made. But, in the first place, I would point out that, in my opinion, the Government have absolutely misrepresented the feelings and views of a majority of the people of Australia in a minute which was submitted to the recent conference in London by the Prime Minister, and which was signed by the Minister for Defence. I wish it to be understood that it is a thoroughlv .able minute, and I am in no sense disparaging the ability which is evident in its composition ; but I must take serious objection to the light in which it puts the Commonwealth before the British Government.

Sir JOH N FORREST -Why not? responsibility has not yet reached that stage when the Prime Minister will submit a State document to the Imperial Government, upon the understanding that if it comes out all right it belongs to the family, while if it does not it may be regarded as containing only some wild notions on the part of the Minister for Defence.

He asked, number of things in connection with the "" What about the Imperial squadron. W ill management of the British Navy. But, that be continued ?"" That is a very important being unable to be present, he put his ideas in writing, as many other great reformers have done before him. His ideas upon naval defence are so admirably expressed in that minute that Lord Selborne's memorandum seems like a feeble imitation of the paper of my right honourable friend. It is true that this minute was dated the 24th of April, 1902. My point is that it was placed upon the official records of the British Parliament as a .State document from the Commonwealth Government. HereI may be allowed to mention one matter which is referred to in that minute which is not quite satisfactory to me. The Minister embodied in that document a scheme for a naval agreement submitted to him by Rear-Admiral Beaumont, and when I look at the scheme which that distinguished naval officer thought necessary for the adequate defence of these seas, I am rather concerned to find that whilst the force which is to be supplied under the new agreement is estimated by the Prime Minister to involve a capital cost of £2,500,000, the Rear-Admiral pointed out that a force the capital cost of which involved £3,500,000 was' necessary. His proposal, which was adopted by the Minister for Defence in the minute to which I have referred, is that there should be two first class cruisers and six second-class cruisers, two of the latter to be in reserve and four in commission. Now, that is a vastly stronger force than is the force provided for in this agreement. Sir JOH N FORREST -But it would cost more. more, but the point is that it is the force It seems to me that there which the naval authority whom I have there is a much more serious matter than want of knowledge displayed by the PrimeN o ; but the right honorMinister after all these negotiations and",26,Barton

92,Mr Reid,"It is true that it would costquestion. In the agreement of 1887 there was an express stipulation that the Imperial squadron should not be reduced in consequence of the naval agreementa very important stipulation. There is no such stipulation in the present agreement. So far from there being any stipulation of that sort, the present agreement substitutes these vessels for those of the Imperial Squadron. It is not merely a question of the chance of retaining the Imperial vessels in addition to the Auxiliary Squadron, but the deliberate agreement is that these vessels are absolutely to take the place of the Imperial Squadron. That is the important difference between the two agreements, and surely it is one that the Prime Minister should be clear upon. Surely the vital point in the agreement is one of which the Prime Minister should have some knowledge. I shall refer to the agreement itself, in order to show that what I say is correct. If honourable members will turn to article 2 they will find, not the distinct condition contained in the agreement of 18S7, that there shall be no reduction of the Imperial Squadron in consequence of this naval agreement; but the statement thatnothing in the agreement shall be taken to mean that the naval force herein named shall be information. the only force used in Australasian waters, should the necessity arise for a larger force.

Will that be continued ? The Prime Minister's reply wasThe Imperial squadron, the Royal Arthur, and the other ships of that squadron, were always, kept on the station independently of the Auxiliary Squadron furnished under the naval agreement. That was an entirely voluntary contribution It was nothing of the kind. There was an express stipulation in the first agreement * that they should not be reduced, and, therefore, that they should not be removed. Itwill thus be seen that on that most important point the Prime Minister was absolutely at sea. But what followed is more important still, because ifc shows that the Prime. Minister absolutely does not know the nature of the agreement into which he has now entered. In answer to this question by the honourable member for Robertson, he continuedI t is a matter upon which I cannot give definite We have definite information in the agreement.

It is I m perial language which befits the Imperial personage from whom it emanates. I desire now to show how the Minister for Defence's rough-and-ready methods of solving the most profound problems of politics led him into expressions which, I contend, with great respect to him, will scarcely stand the test of reason. In the minute which was adopted by the Government, and put before the bright intellects of the Empire, the Minister referred to a naval plan suited to Imperial needs, and made use of this expressionIf such a plan can be brought about, it would be necessary for the "" British dominions beyond able friend would undertake that duty. the Seas"" Rhetorical patriotism againto be adequately representedWhere do honourable members think-at the Admiralty.'

It is another proof of the someEmpire. what dissimilar views upon naval tactics which have been expressed by the Minister in charge of the Defence Department and here. It is onty fair to my right honourable the Prime Minister that, while the Prime friend to say that he recognised some of the Minister occupied much time aud used a obstacles in the way. considerable number of quotations from Admiralty documents in order to give us a division of responsibility, and until a more exfew elementary lessons which I suppose tended federation of the Empire is established, were obvious, pointing out that when a war that responsibility would have to rest upon the is going on it is necessary to be vigorous Imperial Government. and to have your ships at points where tbey In other words, we were to be partners will be able to do the greatest damage to when there was nothing of importance going the enemy, and protect most efficiently your own commerce whilst he was at great pains to show that for such purposes we must have one brain to think and one arm to strike, the Minister for Defence considers that the British Navy cannot be efficiently managed even in times of war Sir JOH N FORREST I was referring to the management of the navy in times of peace. times of war. If most reasoning men still consider that it is absurd to suggest the creation of an Imperial Council to deal with political problems for the solution of which even colonial politicians may be supposed to have some aptitude, how inexpressibly absurd it is to suggest that a body of men selected from Canada, Australia, Natal, the Cape of Good Hope, and Hong Kong should deal with the tremendous machinery of a great Empire in time of war. represent all the colonies.

AVhen people speak of the British Empire, do they forget that 34.0,000,000 of His Majesty's subjects, out of the total of 400,000,000, are to be found in one part of Asia-in India. representative from Australia undertake the control and management of problems affecting those races ? Then let us turn to Africa and tlie marvellous dotted all over that vast continent. mere protectorates alone, we have between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 square miles of country there, and 35,000,000 of African races.. How inexpressibly ridiculous then is the theory that we should call upon the brightest intellect of Australia to go to London to manage tlie affairs of South Africa and India! I wish to say that my right honourable friend in these gushing expressions, which point to a partnership of that kind, in no way represented the feeling or the common sense of the people. Let us think of the matter for a moment. 51,000,000 of white subjects of the Crown gathered together upon a comparatively small spot on the earth's surface. what a marvellous concentration of mental and physical power exists upon that little spot of earth where those 41,000,000 of the British race live. If those people were scattered throughout the Empire, where would the Empire be? Where would its centre of gravity be ? Where would be the possibility Mr SeUl. independent thought and action which alone can maintain the marvellous burdens of the That sort of great series of British possessions? It is because there is that marvellous heart that Whilst the currents of life and power circulate so mities of this vast fabric. To indulge in these silly attempts to spread over this vast surface of 11,000,000 square miles a controlling and directing power amounts to distinguished that sort of pretence which you can see any that that necessity, wherever day in the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. There they have representatives from A l That is giers. What a grand idea it seems ! The French are so liberal in their forms of parliamentary government that you see two or three dubious-looking persons in shawls, huddled together in a corner of that greatChamber, and when you ask who they are, you are told that they are the representatives of Algiers. Different as Australians are, and different as our circumstances, are, any attempt on our part to exercise a real living share in the management of this mighty Empire of 11,000,000 square miles, spreading all over the surface of the globe, would be profoundly absurd. I can underIn what sort of manner could a stand statesmen who are passing into an hysterical condition, whose nerves are not equal to the giant burden which their ancestors maintained-thoug h the population was range of protectorates then less-tryin g to think out some means In for gaining additional power to face the future. But you may depend upon it that the Empire is not to be maintained by methods of that sort. If the heart fails the whole system falls to pieces. One of the saddest thoughts in my mind, when I read Mr Chamberlain's speeches in South Africa and in England about the mother country staggering under the burdens of Empire, is that, whilst I saw there hundreds of thousands of bright young people who gave an assurance of a greater and stronger Australian England in the days to come, I find in the circles of statesmanship an attitude of fear, We have 41,000,000 out of the and a desire to seek fresh methods of strength which has never been characteristic of the race in its hours of trial. If it could Think be done it would be a grand thing, but the idea is almost as extravagant as that of The Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. It is impossible. This new policy is only 50 years old. When people speak of the British Empire and the fortunes of of that clear, decisive, the British race, do they remember that only 50 or 60 years ago British statesmen looked upon the great self-governing colonies as powers to be dreaded and kept in subjection ? Do not we know that the theory of tying up these scattered energies by a multitude of minute ligaments has already been tried, and failed ? This new style was the old style. Sixty years ago, Downingstreet controlled the appointment of the humblest clerk in Australia. Then you had a thorough Imperial Federation, because one brain in Downing-street ruled the whole Empire. No doubt it seemed to the statesmen of 50 years ago, as each of these great stretches of .territory, ful l of the rising and restless spirit of the race, was allowed to separate from that intimate subjection, that the last days of the Empire had come. But we find that so long as in those matters of life and death, such as defence, which are essential to the maintenance of the Empire, we maintain the principle of one brain and one array, the more we leave, in matters of civil and political liberty, the common sense of the Anglo-Saxon race to fight its own way, the grander will be the life of those who belong to it . A t this very time, when we, are practically independent, there has been the grandest exhibition of loyalty from one end of the Empire to the other. When you have these marvellous constellations each pursuing its majestic orbit without friction, he is indeed a bold man who seeks to improve the position by legislative contrivance. I feel that the minute of the Minister for Defence gave the keynote to the proceedings right through this last Conference. When Mr Chamberlain speaks of sharing the control and management of the British Empire, I ask what share had. Australia in adding 4,000,000 of square miles of territory to the Empire during the last fifteen years ? What share have we had in increasing the .burden of taxation in the mother country to such a marvellous extent ? I may, perhaps, be allowed to show where the real seat of this terrible strain upon the British people is ; where the desperate urgency is for obtaining pecuniary offerings from the various members of the Empire. Let us turn to the eloquent history which a few figures give us of the enormous development in expenditure and taxation in the mother country during the last few years. In 1886 the taxation of the British people had increased in about 30 years by £16,000,000--fro m £60,000,000 per annum to £76,000,000 per annum ; and in 1896 the increase was proceeding at very much the same rate. But during the last six years it has increased by many millions. In England revenue, if you except the Post-office receipts, is mainly taxation, and the revenue and expenditure of England in 1870 was £124,000,000; in 1896, £180,000,000; and, in 1903, £300,000,000 ; an increase of £56,000,000 in the 26 years between 1870 and 1896, and an increase of £120,000,000 in the last six years. that war expenditure ? 1 sion of the expenditure of this great mother land of ours for defence is one of my reasons for notpushinga number of serious objections which I have to the Bill. In 1870 the navy cost Great Britain £9,500,000 a year : in 1897, £22,000,000 a year; and in 1903, £35,000,000 a year; so that, within a period of 33 years, it rose from £9,500,000 to £35,000,000. year is £39,000,000. Mr R.EID I am not taking the very latest figures, because I wish to be as moderate in my statements as ' I can. The expenditure upon the army was £14,500,000 in 1870; and about £35,000,000 in 1903. Therefore, the expenditure upon army and navy increased from £24,000,000 in 1870 to £70,000,000 in 1903. When I remember, as I never fail to do, the substantial benefits which we derive from our connection with the Empire, and when we see the devious paths taken by great military and naval powers in their frenzied anxiety to establish themselves in new territories, I am profoundly impressed by a sense of great obligation to the mother country in the matter of defence. I cannot quibble over the terms of this agreement. I may criticise it ; I may show that I see what is being done, and what it is attempted to do ; but I cannot hesitate for an instant in regard to*the proposal to pay out of the Treasury of Australia the sum of £200,000 per annum for the maintenance of a squadron in the Australian seas. I have always endeavoured to pursue a line of fidelity to the interests of the people of Australia, because I cannot help feeling that we are performing a great service to the Empire. If our obligations to the mother country are to be measured by a money standard it will be impossible to fulfil them. Buti t seems to me a new sort of British statesmanship which takes",29,Barton

If that be true as applied to the people inhabiting the British Islands, surely it is equally true of the Anglo-Saxon race inhabiting this vast island in the southern seas. His Excellency quotes the observation of Voltaire with reference to the continued success of the British Navy in all its engagements against all the Great Powers of the world. He says""Voltaire asking himself "" What can be the reason of this continued superiority ?"" replies"" Is it not that the sea, which the French can live well enough without, is essentially neoessiuy to the English, and that nations succeed best in those things for which they have absolute occasion ?"" Only inherited instincts of the sea developed and intensified by necessit\', constantly enforced upon the British people during many centuries, could have enabled us to win our Empire. Only by -maritime strength can we hope to hold it. NowI say that these grand instincts are in the Australian race. They have come down to us through centuries of achievements on the oceans of the world, and there are men who, perhaps, mistaken in the terms of their suggestion, seek to have this grand instinct of our race cultivated and encouraged. Wouldi t be any disloyalty to the great mercantile marine of England to look forward to a time when there will be a mercantile marine of Australia? Would that be disloyalty 1 Are we to avoid building ships and manning them, and carrying the flag of the Commonwealth over the seas, because there is a great fleet of Imperial ships ready to do all we require ? We have the same instiuct which has urged the people of the old country to ' expand upon the seas in time of war and ,in times of peace, and it is this capacity for expansion and triumph on the seas at all times that has not only made the Empire what it is, but has made the British people what they are as a great commercial nation. Therefore, I sympathize intensely with those who wish to see the beginnings of an Australian Navy. A t the same time. I quite see-jus t as I see that we cannot give our millions to the Imperial Government for defence purposes-that we cannot incur any very large expense just now, even for that. There is, however, one direction in which I think we could cultivate this instinct. When the Defence Bil l was before this House some time ago, I expressed my regret at the absolutely lamentable state of affairs under which we had sons of this grand old sea-going race growing up here, and ready to put on uniforms, who had never been offered an opportunity of becoming efficient sailors by serving on the ships of the Australian squadron. Surely, whilst the ships are lying lazily in our harbors in times of peace, the old genius of the race can be encouraged by training men to swell the ranks of our naval brigades-ou r citizen sailors. If it is a grand thing to have citizen soldiers, it is surely an equally grand thing to have our citizen sailors. There need be no jealousy about that. We have never, I believe, heard a word from the great War Department of England to discourage the development of our militia or volunteer forces all round Australia. Now, I say that the naval brigades of Australia have neyer been encouraged as they ought to have been. Between our 35,000 men in the laud forces, and our 2,000 men in the naval brigade, there is a discrepancy I do not like. I have no hesitation in saying that if I thought this agreement was to be made use of to interfere ,in any sense with the vigorous development of our naval brigades, I should vote against it. I should think myself absolutely disloyal to this country if I did not do so; but I think it is possible to vote for this agreement and to pay this money. In point of fact we owe a great deal more. We are not giving away the money of the people of Australia'iu paying this amount. We spend hundreds of thousands of pqunds on our militia and volunteers, .and instead of the few beggarly thousands we spend upon our naval forces, we might advantageously devote a good deal more of our money to the cultivation of the grand instincts of our race for the sea. One of the best features about these ships to my mind is the fact that three of them are to be drill-ships; but, drill-ships for what ?-for the British Navy1 The British Navy can be very well left to look after its own drill ships, and those belonging to the Australian squadron should be available for the training of Australian sailors for our own Naval Beserves. I do not objectI have never objected-to the British Navy recruiting here in Australia. Any Australian who enters the ranks of the British Navy takes a step which I have no word to say against. There are, however, tens of thousands of Australians who cannot and do not want to do that, but who, at the same time, are willing to swell the. ranks of our naval brigade, and to be properly drilled on modern vessels of war. Therefore, I strongly support those who would give our naval brigades more prominence the past, and I shall also strongly advocate the use of the war-ships for drilling them, as well as the reserve men of the British Navy. to detain honourable members at such length, but I should like to mention a matter which has been one of some surprise to me. I do not for a moment profess to be competent to say that all the naval expenditure of England has been absolutely necessary. The Minister foiDefence might express himself authoritatively matter, subject, but I do not profess to know whether this vast expenditure has been necessary or not. The presumption is that it was. When people talk, as so many do, in alarmist tones about the overwhelming advances made, say, by Germany in the strengthening of her navy, we should remember thatthesame thingisbeing parts of the world. The statesmen of the world, whether in Germany or the United seize hold of every little phase of jealousy, dislike, or distrust in order to commit their unfortunate peoples to. huge expenditures. This has become a fine art in Germany and the United States, and would be far more excusable enormous possessions and with its trade of £1,500,000,000 hag been said as to the German Navy and the immense advances it has made, houorable members will scarcely be prepared for the figures which I propose to read as to the relative strengths of the British and Germany navies, in regard not only to the shipsin existencebutto those which are building. Of battle-ships Great Britain has 42 against Germany's 12. Of armoured cruisers Great Britain has 14 as against Germany's 2 ; and of protected cruisers 109 against 17, making a total of 165 first-class fighting ships belonging to Great Britain as against 31 belonging to Germany. is building Germany's six. Germany is building three armoured cruisers; Great Britain is constructing ing six protected cruisers, and England eight; Great Britain has 40 vessels as against Germany's fifteen. Honourable members will. therefore see that much of this alarmist talk is either folly, or there is a reason behind it. Mr lieir*. than they have had in lain talks about Britain staggering under the burdens of Empire, the people of England, might well inquire how it is that their burdens have been increased to these marvelI had scarcely intended lous extremes during the past six or seven years. No man has a clearer view or a. greater appreciation than I have of the immense responsibilities devolving upon those who govern the British Empire. But I think that one of the grandest characteristics of the British race, which has been faithfully maintained without ruin to the on such a Empire, without destruction to the State, in from his knowledge of the the dark da}'s of the past, has been this conviction: that the'truest strength of a. country consists, not so much in the amount of its expenditure, as in the prudence and economy with which its affairs are controlled. On no grounds do I need to justify the vote which I shall give upon this Bill. Underi t , Australia's contribution is doneinall infinitely less than we should like to make it if this country were more populous and States, richer.

118,Distinguished Statesman Like Mr Chamber,"heartily congratulate the leader of the Opposition upon the speech which he has just made. It was a most remarkable deliverance, seeing that though he has advanced the most powerful arguments that could possibly have been urged against the acceptance of the agreement, he has concluded with an intimation that he intends to vote for it . I do not know of any arguments that could have been advanced that would tell more strongly against the wisdom of adopting this agreement than those contained in the very admirable speech of the right honourable gentleman. Yet he takes up the remarkable position that, although the adoption of this agreement is the first step towards a kind of Imperialism which he discounts, he is willing to support it . To my mind, his attitude is simply inexplicable. It seems to me to be thoroughly consonant with' the action which he has taken in connection with a great many other matters which have come before this Chamber. He deprecates certain aspects of Imperial development, but the moment it comes to be a question of Australia paying a very considerable subsidy for its naval defence, he forgets all about the dangers appertaining to Imperialism, and announces his intention of voting for the agreement. I am fully seized of the many difficulties which surround this question, and it is with considerable diffidence that I rise to speak upon the subject. I feel under a special disability in having to follow the admirable speech of my right honourable frienda speech which was marred by its illogical character and gross inconsistency. The right honourable gentleman has not said a single word in defence of the agreement. On the contrary he has pointed out that it is fraught with all sorts of clanger and difficulty. He says that the gentleman who represented this Parliament at the Imperial Conference almost gave Australia away, and yet, forsooth, he intends to support his action. He has entirely overlooked the fact that Australiaisof considerable help to Great Britain. Honourable members are well aware that we have always been prepared to render assistance to the Empire in time'of war, thus indicating that in her hour of trial and difficulty, we are quite willing to bear our share of her burdens. In this agreement, however, it is urged that we should do a great deal more, and the leader of the Opposition has gone so far as to declare that the annual contribution of £200,000 by Australia towards naval defence is a mere bagatelle. His regret is that the amount is notmuch larger. In this connection I wish toquote the authority of no less a person than Captain Mahan as to the value of the dependencies of Great Britain in regard tonaval defence. He saysI t may with much more certainty be now alleged, and the assertion can be supported to thepoint of demonstration, that the acquisitions of recent years, despite the additional requirements of their defence imposed upon us, have not necessitated any increase of our naval force beyond, that which would have been imperatively demanded at the present time, had they never passed into our hands. American possessions 1 argument is equally applicable to the British possessions. He also points out that the increase of naval expenditure by £25,000,000 within the past ten years is not attributable to the fact that Great Britain has to protect her dependencies. Indeed, Great Britain's dependencies are a tower of strength to her, rather than a source of weakness. If honourable members will note the remarks of Captain Mahan, they willobserve how they bear out that contention. He says. Even more, thej' have lessened the burden of purely naval development, which but for them would have been necessaiy : for by the tenure of them, and due development of theirresources, the navj' itself receives an accession of strength, an increased facility of movement, by resting upon. Strong positions of equipment and fepair-upo n bases, to use the military term-in several parts of the-world where our interests demand naval protection of the kind already mentioned namely, readiness to take the offensive instantlyI n other words these dependencies provide abase for naval operations in time either of war or of peace, the} offer coal supplies and 7 facilities which are of infinitely more importance than any subsidy which we can pay to Great Britain. Captain Mahan proceedsFacilities of this character add a percentage of value to a given mobile force, military or naval, for they by so much increase its power and its mobility. This percentage may be difficult of precise definition as to amount, but it none the less exists. That coal can be obtained near at hand, plentifully, and with certainty ; that ships can remain in readiness, and in security, near the possible scene of operations; that they can be repaired there, instead of returning to the United States, all' these conditions, which our new possessions will afford, enable the work on the spot to be done by fewer ships, and diminish",34,Barton

I contend that in affording similar facilities the Commonwealth is giving a handsome endowment to the British Navy. If we develop our own naval brigades, for which the leaderof the Opposition has so eloquently pleaded, man our own ships, and conduct our own affairs, we shall be doing quite as much for Great Britain as we are by contributing a paltry subsidy of £200,000. This question I would remind honourable members has been f reely discussed, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain, and many authorities in the latter country favour the idea of establishing an Australian Navy. I am about to quote from a number of essays which were prepared and read before the Royal United Service Institute. In this connection I may mention that each year that institute offers a gold medal for the essay which is considered the best on a naval or military subject, the text of which is supplied by the committee. These essays are judged by a committee of admirals and other senior officers in the case of naval essays, and by corresponding army officers in the case of military essays.

The writer goes on to sayThe local naval force should be encouraged in every waj', both officers and men. and made to feel that thej' had a definite part allotted to them in bhe naval defence of the Empire. This force on ordinary occasions is separabed from the navy, and is under their own rules; but bhey should be required to amalgamate for periodical training with the navy under naval regulations. Local conditions must, however, be taken into consideration. Local rates of paj', local ideas of discipline, local ideas of dress even, should be given due thought where such exist, and must nob be allowed to prevent the thorough amalgamation of the service into one efticienb whole. The essayist goes on to say that he believes we have the material and the men, and that every consideration should be ' given to colonial condition, colonial rates of pay, and colonial aspirations. That view is supported by other authorities, whose opinions have already been quoted. The views advanced by the Spectator and several other English newspapers have been brought under the notice of honourable members; but there are one or two quotations which, I think, may well be given. The Speaker of September, 1S95, wroteWe desire to see local supplementary navies owned bj' the colonies and manned and officered bj' the colonists.

Like him, I do not care for the agreement, but, unlike him, I am going to vote .against it . I hope it will not be accepted. for Defence) -""We have listened with attention and pleasure to some of the speeches which have been delivered this afternoon, and more particularly to the patriotic utterance of my right honourable friend, the leader of the Opposition. I cannot say that I agree with all that he has said, but I presume it is scarcely reasonable for me to expect that I should be able to do so. We have heard some other important utterances in regard to this measure-on e from the Prime Minister, in which I think he exhausted the whole of the facts concerning the agreement; another from the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who was opposed to the B ill ; and a third from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who seemed to be also altogether opposed to the agreement. It is gratifying that all the spea kers, although they disagree in regard to soine of the provisions of the Bill, have dealt Northern Melbourne, besides others: with it in a manner to which I , and those who think with me, can take little exception. They recognise the obligations which rest upon us in regard to the great Empire to which we belong, and if their views are not altogether in accord with the provisions of the Bill, it is as to the manner in which assistance should be given to the mother country rather than as to the giving of'that assistance. I could, if I desired, attempt to make some patriotic utterances upon such a splendid subject as the British Navy, and it would not be disagreeable to me to try to do so; but I think with the leader of the OpposiI should like to point out in reference to the ' tion that we have heard a good deal in regard to that side of the question, and therefore I propose, in the remarks which I shall ask honourable members to listen to, to deal with the matter, not so much on sentimental or patriotic grounds, but as a pure matter of business. I should be very glad to import patriotic sentiment into the discussion if I thought it necessary to do so, but it seems to me that the proposals to which we are asked to assent are so advantageous from a business point of view that it is not necessary, at this stage at any rate, to deal with them from any other. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in a long and I am going to follow the carefully prepared speech, exhaustively placed his objections to the proposals before us, but to my mind the attitude he assumed towards the measure would have been more appropriate and to the point if we were an independent country rather than part of the great Empire to which we are all proud to belong. I think he forgot that if we were not part of the British Empire we should not beable to maintain any effective navaldefence for so small a sum as £200,000 per annum. So far as I am able to judge from what is going on in other places, if we were an independent country we should have to spend at least from £750,000 to £1,000,000 a year upon naval defence alone, and even then would be in a humiliating position in regard to the great naval powers of the world. Upon a notable occasion a year ago; in an after-dinner speech, I said, speaking of this Government, that we were a curious Government, as there were too many captains in it . I might say to-day that this Parliament seems to me to also have too many captains in it. In addition t» the Government captains we have our friend the captain from Bendigo, our friend the captain from Gippsland, and ouifriend the captain from son 1 captains at times fire shrapnels into us, and sometimes are not sufficiently careful lest they do us injury, and that if they go on as thej' have been doing it is just possible they may inflict a mortal wound. But we have this satisfaction : that whenever we are in dire distress through their attacks, our friends opposite take compassion upon us, and come to our rescue, and if we are not grateful for their assistance we ought to be. agreement, which is a schedule to the Bill, that it has not perhaps been sufficiently pointed out that we are being asked to approve of not an altogether new agreement, but rather the continuance of an existing agreement, which is being enlarged and improved in some particulars.

It is generally acknowledged that these ships are becoming old and insufficient for the defence of Ausbralia, but up to the present time no notice has been given to the Imperial Government-and two years' notice is necessary-of our desire to discontinue the existing agreemenb. The Bill provides for a new agreemenb, based to some extent, but not altogether, upon the old one. Underi t the Admiralty undertake to keep a certain number of ships here. One of the ships is to be manned by Australians and New Zealanders, who will receive Australian rabes of pay; and. bhere will be bhree drill-ships, two for Australia and one for New Zealand, officered by the Royal Navy, but manned by Australians and New Zealauders. Employment will be found at local rates of pay for 925 Australians and New Zealanders on bhese ships, and 725 naval reserve men will also be trained on them in the same way as the reserves are trained in England, although the pay will be based on local naval militia rabes. Albogebher we shall have 1,625 officers and men instead of the 1,000 we have now in our local Naval Forces. Eor bhe maintenance of bhese vessels we are being asked bo conbribube £200,000 a year, insbead of £106,000 which we pay ab the present time. In addition to the naval defence under this agreement, the Government intend to provide for the harbour defence of the principal porbs of Australia, immediately wherever possible, and at some later date in other cases. I was glad bo hear my righb honourable friend bhe leader of the Opposition say that he considers it a very small sum. I agree with him in wondering why the Imperial Government, which spends £35,000,000 a year upon the navy, should care at all whether we provide such a small sum or not. The amount is so insignificant in comparison with the immense cost of maintaining the Empire's navy that one would thiuk bhab bhe Imperial authorities would be indifferenb aboub bhe matter albogebher.

Although ibis claimed bhab will receive so much, it would be impossible for me, whatever position I occupied in this House, to do otherwise than support the proposal. I could not help thinking, when listening to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, that the views he utbered were intended more for historical record, than for immediate use. I do not think it advisable that we should have an Australian Navy, and although it may come in the future, I do not desire that it should come in my time. But should ibs esbablishmenb be ever proposed, in bime bo come, the honourable and learned member's speech will be looked up, and the sentiments he hasexpressed will find ready acquiescence from those who then put forward the proposal. I could not help thinking, however, that, as applied to our present conditions, his speech was in many respects not to the point. It mUsb not be forgotben thab in contributing £200,000 towards the Empire's navy we are, as my right honourable friend theleader of the Opposition said, becoming a junior partner in ib, and bhab we have bhe probection of bhe navy which cosbs bhe people of bhe mobher counbry £35,000,000 per annum.

I think bhab a greab deal boo much has been, made of bhe question of our nob having conbrol over the movements of the vessels forming the Australian squadron.

But there was no provision that the ships of tlie Auxiliary Squadron should be replaced, and, as a matter-of fact, they are becoming obsolete at the present time. Of course, we should all like to have a word to -say with regard to the movements of the ships of the squadron in time of war. We at this question in a reasonable way. We contribute to only a small exour wishes disregarded, and, I think, we are still less likely to have them ignored in the The Admiralty make a I personally think but little of the pronecessary to deal with the question of our abstaining altogether from contributing toward the. navy of the Empire. No one in this House would, I feel sure, suggest that we should take up that attitude, and honourable members who have already spoken differ only as to the best way of assisting the mother country in her great obligations inconnexion with the defence of the Empire. There are only two methods open to us, namely, the establishment of an Australian Navy or that proposed, viz., a modification or re-adjustment of the existing agreement system. Upon the question of establishing an Australian Navy, I desire to point out that provision is made under the new agreement",40,Gboom I B Is The Principle Mosb Effectively Acb Againsb Hostile Vessels
158,Mr Henry,"for a squadron which will cost £2,500,000 ; and although that expenditure may suffice, in view of the surrounding circumstances, it would not be sufficient if we were to set up a navy of our own. The maintenance of this squadron will cost, in round figures, £500,000 a year, towards which Australia would contribute £200,000, and New Zealand £40,000, the remainder being provided by the Imperial Government. My right honourable friend the leader of the Opposition has referred to my minute on Naval Defence of 15th of March, 1902, which I wrote for the consideration of the Prime Minister and my colleagues, and which afterwards formed one of the confidential papers presented to the Conference in London. copy to every one of my colleagues at the same time that I handed the original to the Prime Minister, the minute never came up for discussion, and was, therefore, never adopted by the Cabinet. It represented my views at that time, and I have seen no reason for departing from them. I am glad to say that the views expressed in the piinute are mine to-day, and I hope I shall be able to adhere to them for many years to come. Not only do I hold those views as strongly as ever, but it is satisfactory to know that my opinions are shared by many eminent men who have a large and life-long experience of the subject. minute : it is splendid. I dealt.with the proposal for the establishment of an Australian Navy, and I think I put the case very fairly. I said that "" the small squadron proposed by Admiral Beaumont, of two first class and six second class cruisers, together with depdts and stores, would probably cost £3,600,000,"" and that if this squadron "" were fully manned and equipped in a way that would enable it to engage successfully the first-class cruisers of theeneray,"" its maintenance ""would probably amount to £1,000,000 a year, including interest at 5 per cent, on the capital cost."" I went on to sayIt has been proposed, and the plan is much favoured by some, that during time of peace a squadron thus organized should only be manned with sufficient men to maintain the .ships in working efficiency, and should be wholly employed in training the naval militia, and that in time of war ifc should be folly manned by such naval militia collected from the several parts of the Commonwealth. To this I appended .Admiral Beaumont's opinion thatA squadron thus mobilized and manned would not be able to meet on equal terms the powerful cruisers, with hiehly trained crews, that would be certain to be used against us, and that "" for the present the safety and welfare of the Commonwealth require that the naval force in Australian waters should be a sea-going fleet of modern ships, fully equipped, fully manned with trained crews, homogeneous asfcotype and personnel, and under one command."" I then proceeded in my minute to sayI am not prepared to recommend, under existing conditions,fcheestablishment of an Australian Navy. Even if it were established, I am afraid it would not be very efficient, for besides the enormous cost of replacing thefleetfrom time to time with more modern ships, there would be I desire to say that although I sent a no change for the officers and crews, who would go on, year after j'ear, in the same ships, subject to the same influences, and. I fear, with deteriorating effects. That is the opinion which I formed then, and which I still hold. I am very slow to arrive*at a conclusion, but, when once I have formed an opinion, I am glad to say, I do not very readily alter it . In regard to this agreement I desire to point out that I am nob the spendthrift which I have recently been represented to be. I have been held up to the public of Australia by a section of the Press as one who says-""AVhat is £1,000,000, and what ""are£5,000,000? They arenothing ab all."" Of course, such reflections constitute an absolute libel upon me, because the very nature of my early training could not fail to teach me to be the reverse of thriftless, at any rate, nob bo be wasteful of money. Exbravagant desires are albogebher foreign to my natural instincts. Upon this occasion I am not opposed to the ""Kyabram movement."" It is rather the honourable and learned member for Bendigo who is opposed bo bhabmovemenb and ibs mobbo ""economy."" 1 If I can save bhe Commonwealbh from £300,000 bo £800,000 a year by making bhis arrangement with the Imperial authorities for an adequabe naval defenceof Ausbralia, I cannob surely be regarded,, on bhis occasion ab any rabe, as a spend-' thrift. It is the honourable and learned member for Bendigo who has deserted "" K y a b r a m "" and ""economy."" He is desirous of having a local Australian Navy,, which will cost at least £500,000 annually,, instead of entering into this agreement,, and receive a more efficient service for£200,000 a year.

159,Mr Reid,It sounds like an Admiralty,42,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A
160,Sir John Forrest,"In that minutean expenditure of £500,000 per annum for this purpose? I claim that the maintenance of a small Australian Navy, such as is contemplated in the minute, to which reference has been made, would cost £1,000,000 a year at least. I desire to have the service of a navy which will be efficient. I wish to effect a saving of £300,000 a year for certain, equal to £3,000,000 in the ten years, and possibly of £800,000 a year, or of £8,000,000 in the ten years; double the amount that would be involved in constructing a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. Isi t wiser for us to accept this agreement and spend £200,000 a year, or to establish a navy of our own, and annually expend upon it from £500,000 to £1,000,000 a year? We should have no hesitation in adopting the former course, thereby effecting the saving of an amount in ten years sufficient to pay for the construction of a railthe party with whom he is doing business way to Western Australia. Under this Bill, I claim that we shall secure greater efficiency than we have yet obtained for all the money which has been spent upon Australian naval defence. But because I confess that our local naval force is inefficient, I cannot allow the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to declare that I have reflected in any way upon the personnel of that ser.vice. We have as good men in Australia as can be obtained anywhere, but we have no ships upon which they can be either trained or on which they can face the enemy. By adopting the new agreement, we shall insure a sound training for all our Australian reserves. We shall provide good employment for about 900 men on the second-class cruisers and training ships at Australian rates of pay, and 725 officers and men will be trained as reserves, and be paid local naval militia rates. These men will be recruited from the naval brigades, and if sufficient are not forthcoming from that source, they will be obtained from volunteers. The honourable aud learned member for Bendigo stated that, under this agreement, we shall part with £2,000,000 of ""good Australian money."" That expression leads me to wonder whether our money is better than that of anybody else. It reminds me of the man who says "" golden sovereigns "" when he wishes to enhance the apparent value of those coins. The houorable and learned member declared that under the agreement, we would part with £2,000,000 of "" good Australian money "" within the next ten years, and that we should at the end of that period have nothing to show for it. My answer to that objection is that we cannot have our cake and eat it, too. In deed such an argument is one of the most foolish that I have ever heard addressed to a deliberative body. those words. did. I took them down at the time. I repeat that the argument is not a fair one. When I look round this ChamberI see some gentlemen who have probably spent many thousands of pounds upon insurance. What have they to show for that expenditure? Thej' have had their goods, and they have enjoyed a certain amount of security. When an individual has received for his outlay everything that he expected to obtain, and everything which contracted to give him, I hold that he should be satisfied. To complain that he has nothing to show for his expenditure is absolutely childish. would use such an argument. ways which are all over this country as an illustration. Those works have been built by borrowed monej , and have cost a couple T of hundred million pounds, and we have to paj' a large sum annually for interest. If we travel to Bendigo and back we have to pay for the use of the railway. What do we get for our expenditure? When we have safely returned, we have nothing to show for it. Indeed we have to pay toll upon the railwaj's, in the nature of interest, and afterwards to repay the principal. Even after the money absorbed in such public undertakings has been repaid, the works themselves wear out and require to be renewed. They become in time absolutely worthless. When a railway has become worn out, what have the people to show for the expenditure ? The honourable and learned 'member for Bendigo ought not to make use of such arguments. It is the business of life to make a bargain, to obtain consideration, and to pay for that consideration. I have seen the same argument used b j ' a leading journal of this country, altogether oblivious of the experience of our daily lives both in our private and public capacities. Surely if there were any wisdom underlying such an argument,, the taxpayers of England who",42,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A

164,Sir John Forrest,"Tak e the railannually have to provide £35,000,000 for naval purposes, might more fitly ask, ""What have we to show for our enormous expenditure?"" I am afraid that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and many other Australians who enjoy the many blessings and advantages of peace and -security, and who are happy in their immunity from attack, are too apt in dealing with this great national question to. . . take the rustic murmur of their bourg For the great wave that echoes round the world. I should like to emphasize the exception which I take to the views of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in his references to the British Navy. it as if it were something altogether apart from us; as if , because our fathers years ago crossed the seas and founded this country, we were no longer British people, and had no pride or interest in the British Navy. seemed to disregard the fact that we have had the protection of the British Navy from the day Australia became a British country. AVe have, I believe, always viewed the British Navy as our own. We have, I believe, always considered that we have as much right to its protection and to the force of its authority when we require it, as has any man who lives within the sound of Bow Bells; and this, strange to say, although we have not been a contributor to its maintenance. a very small contribution towards its upkeep, we receive as much from the British Navy as do the taxpayers home. It. gives ussecurity; our lives and our property. does it do for those who pay for it? It is as much the navy of the people of Australia as it is the navy of the British taxpayer. secure all the benefits to be derived from it for next to nothing, while those who pay for it obtain no additional advantage. When we consider these matters fairly, I am sure that we shall take a wider view of our responsibilities, and advantages, and will willingly consent to do something to show that we fully recognise our obligations. When we have given these considerations the attention they deserve, I am sure that we shall feel proud to share-even to a limited extent-the which falls upon our countrymen at home. We shall be glad to share that burden, and to feel that we are not receiving everything and giving nothing in return. Sir John Forrest. was quite refreshing to listen to the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who showed to-day a total disregard of monetary considerations. he is not present. As one who has found so many honourable members anxious to prevent the Commonwealth from spending anything however necessary or useful, and inclined to look upon a five-pound note as if it were £5,000a disposition which has been bearing me down ever since I entered this HouseI felt that it was quite refreshing to listen to the remarks made by the honourable He referred to and learned member. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo said that he did not regard this question from a monetary point of view ; but viewed it from a patriotic stand-point. I think, however, that He this matter may well receive the benefit of being dealt with from a purely monetary point of view. What do we find % We find that New Zealand, Cape Colony, and Natal are all united in this matter, and that, subject to the approval of this Parliament, the Prime Minister has agreed that the Commonwealth shall join with them in assisting, in a small degree, in tlie naval defence of the Empire. The amount proposed to be expended in this way, however, will not be lost to us. As the result of the adoption of this agreement, Although we now make only a sum considerably in excess of £200,000 a year will be expended in Australia. Not one shilling of the amount proposed at to be contributed under this agreement it guards will be carried beyond the bounds of AusWhat more tralia. Out of the total sum of £500,000 to be expended upon the fleet, quite £300,000 per annum w ill be expended in Australia. Thus, it will be seen that, The only difference is that we even from a business point of view, the arrangement will not be an undesirable one. Some people refer to this proposed contribution as if the money were to be thrown into the sea. On the contrary, however, it will be expended in the employment of our own people, and the producers of the country will have the advantage of it . Thus, even from a monetary point of view, it will be a good investment. The honourable and learned member also said .that this although proposal disclosed a reversal of the policy great burden which the Admiralty had pursued for 40 years. If it does it serves to show that changes are going on, and it may be that we are becoming wiser as we grow older. It It indicates, also, that what was good enough",43,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A

166,Sir John Forrest,"I am sorry that40 years ago is not considered to be so advantageous now. Other nations are coming into prominence, and although the statement made by my right honourable, friend the leader of the Opposition is very encouraging, we have still to remember that combinations on the part of other Powers may take place. The great countries of Europe-Russia, Germany, and Prance-d o not always look with a kindly eye upon the aspirations of our race, and we do not know what combinations may be brought about. Thusi t does not seem to me that there is much in the argument put forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I should like to ask him whether he would be prepared to advocate in this House a policy which would cost this country at the present time £500,000 a year ? In carrying out his proposal for an Australian naval force, he would begin with one ship, and I believe he would borrow that one. have to borrow the money for it . quest the loan of a ship from the British Government, and we should really go on as we have been doing in the past. What have we done in regard to the naval defence of Australia? A t present we have 169 permanent officers and men in the naval defence force of Australia, and 1,079 naval militia. That represents the whole strength of our forces. cut down. Minister for Defence did so. -wealth does not own a ship that could meet a foe at sea.

A t the present time we are spending some £43,000 on the local naval defence forces of Australia. was £65,000 until it was cut down by the Minister. case. What was the state of tbe naval forces of Victoria when we took them over in March, 1901 ? Their numbers had dwindled down to next to nothing. The reason for that reduction was the cry of economy. Public men in Victoria have said to me, "" If I had my way I should remove these local forces altogether."" Honourable members of this House did not have much hesitation in cutting down either the naval or military votes last year and the year before, and the forces found but few to say a good word for them. A t present we have in Victoria the Cerberus and two good torpedo boats, in addition to two others that are useless. The Cerberus is armed with old obsolete guns, and in her present condition is next to useless. She would be of no value for defence purposes, unless some small vessel happened to enter Hobson's Bay. The Victorian contribution to the local naval forces amounted to about £19,000 a year, and the force consists of 119 naval militia and 105 permanent men, or a total of 224; but,, as I said before, we have not a vessel with which to meet a foe outside Port Phillip Heads. This is the position in which Victoria finds itself after many years, and after spending hundreds of thousands on naval defence. A t one time Victoria owned two gun-boats. They were sold, however, and I believe their guns are stored away.. This shows that prior to the establishmentof the Commonwealth the people of A icr toria had given up any idea of having an. efficient local naval force in this State. As a matter of fact, I purchased one of the gunboats in question for the purposes of the Western Australian Government. For some reason of their own, the people of Victoria were content that there should be an annual expenditure of over £20,000 on their naval forces, knowing at the same timethat there was no real efficiency. Why did. the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, as a member of the State Parliament, agree to this expenditure when he knew there was no efficiency ? could not prevent it . I desired that there should be a larger expenditure and greater efficiency. talk on the part of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo about what we ought to do ? He has been a public man in Victoria for years, but all that Victoria has to show for an immense expenditure on its naval forces is a ruin, or something akin to it. There is certainly no real efficiency.",44,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A

All that we can do is to carry on the present system. The honourable member for Dalley saidI do not agree with the honourable member for Bendigo, that the Commonwealth can establish a navy. My vote will be in the direction of extending and enlarging the arrangement with the Imperial Government to provide an auxiliary squadron. The honourable member for Wannon saidI cannot help considering that it is a shame for us to contribute so little as we do to the defence of the Empire. The honourable member for Bland saidAll tliis emphasizes the fact we cannot have anything like an Australian Navy without incurring an expenditure that we dare not face, and it is, therefore, of no use for us to discuss a question of this kind at the present stage. I am quite prepared to admit that as far as outside defence, and the protection of our commerce is concerned, we ought to be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of something like an efficient British fleet. We make a contribution now, but I am afraid that the vessels that are here under the auxiliary squadron agreement are fast becoming obsolete, and that even the guns with which they are armed, .are not of sufficiently new design to be effective on active service. The honourable member for Tasmania, SirE d w a r d Braddon, saidI quite agree with those honourable members who point out the impossibility of our having a fleet. . . . Nor do I think we can do what the honourable member for Bendigo suggested, if I understand him aright-namely , establish naval Stations or bases at different points. The honourable member for Gippsland saidI fear that the great cost of a navy is beyond our resources at the present time. But I think that we might make a satisfactory arrangement with the mother country by giving a larger subsidy, or, perhaps, by providing a portion of the men. The honourable, learned, and gallant member for Corinella saidI agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that it would probably be money well spent if we were to increase our contribution towards the maintenance of the Australian squadron. The honourable member for Kooyong saidI t has been stated that the Bill makes no prous to leave ourselves in the hands of Great vision for naval defence. I am perfectly satisfied that the more honourable members consider the enormous expense which would be necessary to create a fleet at all adequate to our requirements of coastal defence, the more thej' will be inclined to agree that the Minister has acted wisely in deciding that for many a long j'ear to come we must depend upon the mother country to assist us. I think, however, that the time is not far distant when it will be necessary for us to contribute more than we are now paying for the protection which we receive from the mother countiy. The honourable member for Corangamite saidWe have in the. past contributed a certain amount of money to the British Government towards the maintenance of certain war vessels on the Australian station, but I believe we shall, in a short time, have to increase bhat subsidy. The honourable member for N e w England saidThe idea is abroad that we should construct a navy, and if we are to construct it , we should certainly control it . However, what I wish to saj' is that, whilst I am opposed to the construction of a purelj' Australian Navy, at Australian expense and to be under Australian control, I trust the Government will ask tbe Parliament to rise to a proper conception of its responsibility and vote an adequate sum towards the support of the British Navy. The honourable member for Parramatta saidWe may. take it that the B ill does not contemplate the immediate establishment of a naval force of any description, and I do not go with those honourable members who think that we ought not to have any navy at all, unless we can set up one of our own. It seems ridiculous to argue that, because we cannot run ships of our own, we should not have any at all. I believe that the ships provided for us b j ' the Home Goverumeut are furnished at a ridiculously cheap rate, and that we ought to be grateful for them. The honourable member for Flinders saidI t seems to me that a navy is our natural means of defence. . . . We cannot attempt, at least for many j'ears to come, to either build or buy a navy. . . . Therefore, our proper course would be, if possible, to continue some such arrangement as we now have with Great Britain. I think we might very easily arrange with the mother country to provide us with better ships, more heavily armed, and swifter, without having to pay a yearly sum in excess of what it would cost us to maintain a navy of our own. The honourable member for Fremantle saidW i th regard to the establishment of a CommonwealthNavy, I think that anj' proposal of the kind would be absurd. . . . The present arrangements for naval defence are very good. The honourable member for Oxley saidFor some j-ears to come it would be wise for Britain, so far as naval defence is concerned, instead of plunging the country into an outlay of man\' millions of money. We are at present contributing £.126,000 per year towards the Australian auxiliary squadron, and it would be butter, even if we doubled this amount, to continue under the protection of the British Navj'. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, saidSo far as naval defence is concerned, I consider that it is beyond us altogether to raise a fleet. One honourable member suggested that we should start hy building one man-of-war, which would probably run us into an expenditure of -£1,250,000, but if we were to adopt that course our first ship would probably be obsolete before we could construct a second one. Those were the sentiments expressed by honourable members, and those were the words that my right honourable colleague, the Prime Minister, carried in his mind to England, and I think that he was fully justified in corning to the conclusion that a proposal which contains far better conditions than those embodied in the existing would prove acceptable to Parliament and to the Australian people. He had, I think, good reason for thinking that he could with .a light heart conclude such an economical arrangement, and to feel that he had done well for Australia. with regard to the way in which the Imperial Government would viewthecreation of a local Australian fleet. I do not speak with any authority, but, after having had something to do with public men in the old countiy, I do not think there would be the slightest objection to our having a fleet of our own, and I never heard one word of objection urged against it. We are endeavouring to enter into a partnership with the Imperial Government, under which we are to contribute a small amount which will represent about one-half of the direct burden, and but a very small part of the indirect burden which the British taxpayer has to bear on our behalf. The Australian squadron will cost about £500,000 a year; towards which we shall contribute £200,000; but the total cost of the British fleet, which is available for our protection as well as for that of all other parts of the Empire, involves an annual outlay of £35,000,000. are not in a position, or, at any rate, are not desirous of, providing a fleet of our own at present, and therefore we cannot do better than enter into an arrangement which offers us such great advantages as that which is now submitted. tion of control, I may point out that we are small partners in the Empire's Navy, and I do not think that it would be fair for us to expect to have sole control over the Australian portion of it. That would be unreasonable, and I feel sure that honourable members will come to the conclusion that we should be content with the conditions set forth in the agreement. people, under a free form of government, and there is no hoop binding us to the Sir John Forrest. Empire except the crimson thread of kinship. We are united to the Empire only by good-will and the ties of blood, and I do not see that there is any reason to cavil at the terms of the agreement in this Bill. I desire to say a few words with regard to what I may call the contemptuous sneers of my right honourable and learned friend the leader of the Opposition in reference to a part of my minute to the Prime Minister on Naval Defence' of the 15th March, 1902. My right honourable friend agreement seems to think that my ideas as to the "" dominions bej'ond the seas "" being in the future adequately represented at the Admiralty, were not practical; in fact, he said that they were absolutely silly. I may tell him, however, that I am perfectly satisfied with A great deal has been said what I wrote in that minute. I pointed out in paragraph 18 thatOur aim and object should be to make the Koyal Navy the Empire's navy, supported by the whole of the self-governing portions of the Empire, and not solely supported by the people of the British Isles, as is practically the case at the present time. It is, I think, our plain duty to take a part in the additional obligations cast upon the mother countiy by the expansion of the Empire, and the extra burdens cast upon her in maintaining our naval supremacy. ""Our"" naval supremacy, remember, not ""theirs"" only ! ForI hold that the naval supremacy of the Empire is as absolutely necessary to us as it is to the people of the mother land. I then went on to sayIf a proposal were adopted that the Empire should have one fleet maintained hy the whole nation, every part contributing to its support on some plan to be mutually arranged, probably on that of the comparative trade of each country, and not necessarily on an uniform basis of contribution, what a splendid idea would be consumWe mated, and what a bulwark for peace throughout the world would be established. Besides which, we should be doing our duty to the mother countiy, which has been so generous to us during all our early years. If the Federations of Canada and Australia and bhe colonies of South Africa and New Zealand werefcoagreefcothis great principle of one fleet Coming back to the quesfor the Empire's naval defence, then the question of contributions and all other matters connected with it could be afterwards arranged by mutual agreement. I . cannot think that for Canada and Australia to each have a few war-ships, and the Cape and New Zealand a few also, each independent of the other, is a plan suited to Empire; such a plan would seemfcobe in accord with the actions and sentiments of a number of petty States, rather than in accord with the necessities and aspirations of a great, free, united people. We are a free If such a plan can be brought about, it would be necessarj' for the "" British Dominions beyond the seas"" to be adequately represented at the Admiralty, and I feel sure this could be arranged on a mutually satisfactory basis. In time of war there could not be any division of responsibility, and, until n more extended federation of the Empire is established, that responsibility would have different from what it is now. We shall to rest upon the Imperial Government. I do' not believe that in the future the people inhabiting the ""dominions beyond the seas"" would be likely to be for long content to contribute largely towards the naval power of the Empire unless they had some voice in its administration. I do not consider the small contribution we are now proposing to make comes within the category, but as the British people beyond the seas increase in numbers, and as their population more closely approaches that of the motherland, is it reasonable to suppose that they will be content to entrust to the people of the United Kingdom the sole control of the Empire, and to place their destinies without demur in their hands 1 My idea is that, as we grow in power and in numbers, the time will come, although perhaps not in my day, when some plan will have to be devised under which the people of the ""dominions beyond the seas"" will be required to bear a portion of the burden of empire, and will have representation in the councils of the nation. Otherwise we might find our ports blockaded and our homes made desolate as the result of quarrels in which we had taken no part. my right honourable friend the leader of the Opposition, the day must come when we shall increase in numbers and in power and influence, and when it will be impossible for the Empire to hold together unless some steps are taken in the direction I have indicated. I have spoken about adequate representation at the Admiralty, and I do not see any reason why we should not in the future have some representation on that body, in time of peace at any rate. We should not exercise any dominating influence, and our representation might be even limited to matters in which we were specially interested. I do not speak with any authority, but I do not think any objection could be raised to our being represented, or at any rate consulted, in regard to matters affecting Australian interests. When we consider that the Commonwealth has only recently been inaugurated, I hold that, in regard to large schemes for local naval defence, we can well afford to hasten slowly. If we adopt the agreement which forms the subject of this Bill, we shall at least obtain some breathing time. A t the end of the currency of that agreement I have no doubt that the condition of affairs will be very have settled down to our Eederal work, and the legislative machine will be running smoothly. The experience of Canada will probably have been repeated. In the Dominion to-day the people are proud of their federation, and the idea that it might have been better for the provinces not to have entered into federal union has passed away. History will, doubtless, repeat itself here. Further, the Braddon clause, which some people do not like, but which, I think, is an excellent provision -a t any rate, for the StateI representwill have ceased to be operative. We shall thus be in a position to consider what is the wisest course to adopt. If Parliament, in its wisdom, then thinks that we ought to establish an Australian Navy there will be nothing to prevent it from adopting that course. Personally, I am opposed to such a scheme, because I think we shall be able to do better by making fresh arrangements -perhap s upon different terms from those contained in this agreement-altlioug h still continuing a partnership which, I think, is good, and can be enlarged. My idea is that by so doing we shall secure a more efficient and more economical service. The agreeNotwithstanding the sneers of ment contained in this Bill is merely intended to meet existing conditions, and at the end of its currency the House will have f u l l control over the whole matter. A t the expiration of that period we shall have as a. result of this agreement at least 2,000 thoroughly trained naval men in Australia. The movement in favour of economy known as the ""Kyabram movement,"" will then have finished its labours, and honourable members will be able to deal with the question without fear of being branded as either wasteful or extravagant. I have previously pointed out that the agreement does not interfere with local defences. If it is deemed desirable to have an extended system of naval militia there is nothing to prevent its being adopted. vide such a system 1 continue and improve our local harbour defences. We expect that under this agreement a good many of our local naval militia will be absorbed, and that the rest will be available for harbour defences.",46,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A

I am a great admirer of the Minister for Defence. I like to hear him when he is right, and when he is wrong; but on the whole I prefer to hear him when he is wrong, because then he speaks from the pure heart absolutely, and his heart is very good. I sympathize strongly with him in his desire to show thab we are grateful for the protection and liberty which are accorded to us by the old country. I yield to no one in acknowledging that we obtain invaluable privileges from that connection. Upon bhis occasion I am very sorry bhab I am again in opposition bo a Ministry which I support. On this particular question, however, I speak with diffidence, because I possess no knowledge and no experience, and what can I do under the circumstances? I suppose the only course open to me is to lean upon experts. and learned member sympathize wibh us in dealing wibh legal matters ? needs no sympathy. He is quite competent to deal equally well with law or illegality. After all, what is bhe subsbanee of bhe agreemenb bhab we are asked to affirm? It is an agreemenb which recites very excellent things about the importance of the sea and the navy, together, with bhe advanbage which will be derived by developing bhe sea power of Ausbralia and New Zealand. I confess bhab I cannob see how it is bo develop that power. Theni t is proposed that, in place of having an Imperial Squadron confined to Australian waters unless removed with the consent of the Australian Governments, there shall be a squadron whose sphere of operations shall extend from the Mauritius and Madagascar on the west, to beyond New Caledonia on the east, and from Calcutta on the north to the Antartic regions on the south. As the Minister for In conDefence has spoken so strongly about the necessity for providing an effective defence, I desire bo know from him whab greater security is conferred by this agreement than is conferred by the existing one? In time of war this squadron is to be ab liberby bo go wherever it desires, and the Commonwealbh Governmenb cannob say ib ""nay."" Ib may go to any spot where it bhinks bhe enemy is likely bo be found, for bhe purpose of crushing him if ib can. Thus, in bime of war, we shall nob have any distinctive protection for our floating trade upon tlie narrow route which vessels follow round our coast by Cape Leuwin, and inside the Coral reefs northward. There is nothing to insure that in our big cities, which are coastal cities, we shall not be thrown into bhe mosb horrid panics, bhab business will not be interrupted and confidence destroyed at the very time when it is mosb needed. In times of peace we shall have bhe advanbage of a number of pleasant young fellows who, in good uniforms, will adorn bhe ball-rooms. Bub we want something more than that for our contribution of £200,000, which we can ill spare. WhatI chiefly desire to ascertain is where the Minister for Defence expects us bo derive superior efficiency under bhis agreemenb. In looking through the papers relating to bhe conference of last year, I find bhab bhe First Lord of bhe Admiralty and othersand the Minister for Defence himselfsneered at the idea of a local defence. I find that the First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Selborne, puts his posibion in as plain language as one can desire. He saidTo-day I will merely endeavour to lay emphasis on two points which are contained within this memorandum. The first on which I would lay the greatest possible stress is, the reason whj' we have eliminated from this memorandum any allusion to the word "" defence.""

186,Mr Higgins,"The honourable membermainly from the point of view of defence. That, I submit, is altogether heretical. The real problem which this Empire has to face in the case of a naval war is simply and absolutely to find out where tbe ships of the enemy are, to concentrate the greatest possible force where those ships are, within the powers of the Australian Parliaand to destroy those ships. He scorns the idea of a navy for defence purposes, and lie is nob alone in that respect. I find that in the Admiralty memorandum, submitted to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, the following words occur :In the foregoing remarks the word defence does not appear, it is omitted advisedly, because the primary object of the British Navy is not to defend anything, but to attack the fleets of the enemy, and, by defeating them, to afford protection to British Dominions, shipping, and commerce. This is the ultimate aim. To use bhe word defence would be misleading, because the word carries with ifc the idea of a thing to be defended, which would divert attention to local defence instead of fixing it on the force from which attack is to be expected. The traditional rdle of the British Navy is not ment? _ to act on the defensive, but to prepare co attack the force which threatens-in other words, to assume the offensive. AVe have heard and read many platitudes wibh regard to the importance of concentration, and as to offensive tactics being the best to crush an enemy. No one impeaches the judgment and experience of those who have said that offensive tactics are the best to pursue, especially in relation to the operations of the navy. vantage of superiority in vessels and guns at the critical point in time of war. But the point is that under the Constitution the only purpose to which this Parliament can allow money to be used in this direction is that of ""defence.""

But that does not come ment. Section 119 of the Constitution provides thatThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of a State, against domestic violence. So far, so good. But if honourable members will turn to section 51, they will see that we have power to make laws, not even for the laudable purpose of assisting the Empire in a just war, but for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth.

A t the same time, I think he will have to face more gravely the point that has been raised in several quarters, and which will be discussed if there is any appropriation for this purpose. If he succeeds in establishing a High Court of any calibre, in all probability one of the first questions which it will be called upon to determine will be whether this proposed appropriation is right or wrong. very easy job for the Judges. jobs. member's argument implies that the power to make appropriations is limited by the legislative powers conferred by section 51. Constitutions, very much wider powers are conferred. There are powers to make laws in and for Victoria or New South Walesi n the very widest terms. Thusi t was impossible to impugn any appropriation for Victoria or New South Wales. I was speaking, however, of an appropriation which is not for one of the objects in respect of which we can make laws. Every appropriation is by law. It is by making a law that we make an appropriation. What right have we to make a law for an appropriation of this kind, which is not for the purposes Of the defence of the Commonwealth or the defence of the States? I submit that the whole discussion in England has been carried on from the point of view of the British taxpayer rather than from that of Australian interests. I can well understand it . The British taxpayer has burdens beyond precedent-burden s that were never dreamt of. Last year the Article2 provides navy alone involved an expenditure of £35,000,000, while the expenditure for the year an army and navy expenditure of some ' £62,000,000 apart from the cost of the Indianarmy,representingabout£20,000,000, which falls upon the Indian revenue. These are burdens which are beyond precedent, and very naturally the Imperial Government feel that they may have incurred the wrath of their constituents by their policy of I m perialism. I say nothing against Imperialism of the right kind ; but as honourable members are aware, I have always objected to the Imperialism which has characterized the Empire for the last few years. I know that I am in disagreement with most honourable members in regard to that matter ; but, even although they disagree with me as to particular facts that have recently occurred, and as to the aspect of those facts, I believe that I agree with many of them as to the inexpediency of taking on our shoulders the burden of the navy and army of the Empire, unless we have to an equalextenttheprivilege and right of controlling them and their operations. It is the Imperialism of the last few years-the rampant, jingoisticImperialism -whic h has now to be faced in its consequences. It is when it comes to "" pay, pay,, pay,"" that the men who were loudest in their vociferations for an Imperalistic policy, are the first to cry out for others to share the burden. If there is one thing which is of importance to this country, it is that,, as far as we can do so consistently with honour, we should avoid joining in any policy of aggression. Sir JOH N FORREST -We cannot help it . able gentleman admits that by this agreement we shall be committed to a policy of aggression. learned member's argument is that, if a. man is lying in wait for you with a gun, you should not try to get the first shot. Canadian Ministers took a much more statesmanlike attitude in regard to this matter. They saw how this proposal would bear upon responsible government, upon therelations of the Empire, and upon the different colonies. They saw that there was nothing so likely to create friction within the Empire, which is at present sympathetic and in accord in all its parts, as a demand for the payment",51,Willis Is Not That Provision And Its Principal Use Is That I T Is A

It h in k t h a t t he f o l l o w i ng is a statesmanlik e view to take : Local corps can be formed on a system which withdraws those who join them but little from those occupations which increase the wealth of the country. Local corps_are subject to the keenest local criticism-to a criticism that is perfectly well understood by them, but which would probably ruin a more regular force. The system of local corps tends to identify the population with the defence. It is less likely to languish. It gives experience to many in the supply and in the use of warlike stores. It does not continuously separate the men from their wives aud families. It habituates the people to feel that possibly some day they may be required to make personal sacrifices. It gives a sense of security. It tends to allay panic. It accustoms the G overnment of the country to study the questions involved, and the responsibility that belongs to it on this subject is kept perpetually before their eyes If the reasoning contained in what I have already written is accepted as right, and assuming that the local defence is satisfactory, ifc follows that what are wanted in the first place are cruisercatchers. Sir written a long time ago 1 t h a t the same policy has been advocated by more recent naval experts. A t t h a t time ifc was in contemplation to have, in addition to the local defences, a squadron for service in Australasian waters, and there would also have been the I m p e r i al fleet provided by the English taxpayer. W it h regard to the A u s t r a l i a n squadron, A d m i r a l T r y o n saidA t no dime will these vessels be removed without the waters of Australasia without the sanction of the Governments of the colonies.

He says:During a time of peace, the officers and others of such ships as are not in active commission could be well employed to instruct the reserve forces and volunteers. No t h in g has been done d u r in g a l l the fifteen years covered by the existing agreement in the way of t r a in in g a single man for the purposes of A u s t r a l i a n naval defence. The idea of A d m i r a l T r y o n was to have men trained by the officers of t h e permanent forces d u r in g time of peace. Sir to do t h a t now. A d m i r a l T r y on concludes his proposal in a summary as follows : . Sea-going colonial fleet, if all joined, including New Zealand-si x cruiser catchers, eight torpedo boats, sea-going, say of 150 tons. 6 c The abovefcobe furnished, manned, and maintained by the Admiralty at the cost of the colonies (a portion of this force only to remain in commission during a time of peace). Local defencesfcobe officered and manned by local forces, namely, harbour defence vessels and Whitehead torpedo boats ; small class generally speaking. Batteries and mines to be intrusted to local corps. That local corps should have a good nucleus of highly trained men is an essential condition. ' The Whibehead system to enter largely into the sj'stem of defence, and dropping gear to be provided in readiness to be fitted to local boats to supplement the regular torpedo boats. He d i d not stop there. On the 2 4 t h A p r i l , 1886, he wrote f u r t h e r as follows : It will be found, however, that some colonies and Rome places of special importance will require special treatment, and that thej' call into existence a naval force that does not primarily enter into or belong tofchcsystem on the lines on which for strategic reasons the main fleet of the country moves.

But he said there were special places to be specially treated, and pointed o u t t h a t A u s t r a l ia had a narrow line for vessels up to Prince of Wales Sound, and then across from the east of A u s t r a l i a over to Cape Leuwin.

Admira l Tryon continuesHowever superior our force may be; however skilled may be the strategic arrangement; however vigilant our admirals, history may repeat it self. An enemy may escape touch, he may escape notice, and it may be some time before his destination is known and his designs penetrated. We may feel confident he will be quickly followed, but his power for mischief, for a time at all events, would be great ; and the difficulties attending a pursuing squadron are great compared to those experienced by one thab is carrying into effect a well-devised, pre-arranged scheme.

Admiral Tryon continues> There are ports that require a considerable amount of naval force for their defence-Melbourne, for instance ; Port Phillip cannot be denied to an enemy by bacteries and minefields alone. There a local naval force of very considerable strength is already called into existence. I admit that that local force has been seriously diminished-, docked, and handicapped, and that the retrenchment was in its case applied in the wrong direction. I do not care to express my own opinion in this matter, and, therefore, I rely upon the judgment of experts. Admiral Tryon remarks furtherSome ports only require a few torpedo boats. Queensland possesses gun vessels well suited for service off her coral-girt shores. South Australia has a vessel of another type altogether-that is, specially well-adapted for the service she was designed to render; and of the efficiency and reliability of these forces I am glad to bear personal testimony. That seems to speak of an effective incipient naval force. Sir changed since then. Those ships are not efficient now. which I have been quoting proceedsThere is no difference of opinion as to the necessity .for protecting the most distant parts of the Empire. The question, is, how is this best effected ? It cannot be better done than by destroying an enemy before he has time or opportunity to act to our disadvantage, but it is certainly wise to take every precaution lest, as in days gone by, a squadron should escape notice, aud suddenly appear off a distant shore. That carries us as far as 1886. The right honourable Minister for Defence referred to more recent events: In 1899 there was a meeting of the chiefs of the colonial naval forces, and on the 5 th August they furnished their report, which repeats the same recommendations in a very much more emphatic way. Three resolutions were passed as follow :(1) That whilst a Royal Naval Reserve cannot, in our opinion, be raised in Australia on conditions required by the Admiralty, yet we consider that a naval force that would be efficient and available for service in vessels of war can be raised on rates of pay and conditions of service suitable to the colonies. (2) That such force should be formed by the amalgamation of existing naval permanent establishments, who would be the instructional staff 1 and required nucleus for maintenance of the vessels in reserve, the complement of the vessels being made up by the officers and men not perI hope it will not end manently employed, but maintained in efficiency by courses of manual training. This force would be maintained and controlled by the Federal Government, and would be governed by a Federal Disci plane Act, and regulations which would provide for their emploj'ment in general naval service. (3) The Admiralty to provide ships of a type effective for service in time of war, which, in peace time, would be stationed at the principal ports for the drilling and training of the local naval force These ships to be maintained by the Federal Government, and be subject to periodical inspection by the Naval Commander-in-Chief. I am not aware that any answer has been made to these resolutions. force that will be capable of fighting. utterly useless for us to attempt to maintain a fleet that would be likely, in time of war, to go to distant parts. We might have a few cruisers for the purpose of following an enemy for a short distance, but beyond that we could not go. I find that in 1897 Mr Kingston brought before the Conference of Premiers a recommendation that we should JOHN FORREST -But things have apply the money contributed towards the support of the Auxiliary Squadron to the training of a local force.

The report proceedsThe Conference are of opinion that this expenditure, controlled by the Federal Govermnent, would be suthcient to provide for the maintenance of five second-class"" cruisers stationed in peace time, as proposed, in the principal ports and exercised from them, and for the raising and maintenance of a reserve of sufficient strength to provide not only for the manning of these vessels in time of war, but also to furnish a source from which men would be available to meet Imperial naval requirements and to make up waste.

240,Mr Higgins,"Yes ; but at the samestores, and initial cost to a modern service he sets down at £47,000 annually, and he would meet that sum by reducing Australia's contribution to the auxiliary squadron by one-third, or £35,000, and by effecting a reduction in the cost of our local defences of £12,000. He further saysAn Appropriation Act, extending over ten years, setting aside £300,000 to £350,000 annually for naval defence, would be a more satisfactory arrangement. It would suffice to provide afleetoffivecruisers suitable for our defence, and leave no debt. If continued, even at a reduced amount, it would provide for all renewals as required. The total vote lor defence is £850,000. The naval vote of £350,000 is a moderate proportion in a country only liable to a naval attack. He continuesThefleetsof Powers that have little or no commerce to defend, and maintained for purely aggressive purposes, are rapidly increasing. Absolute and complete dependence by Australia upon the British Navy, situated as we are, at the extremity of the Empire, will add to that strain. . . . The spectacle of some 5,000,000 AngloAustralians, with an army splendidly equipped, unable to prevent the burning of a cargo of wool in sight of Sydney Heads, is only the ordinary consequence of a policy of naval impotence. The main artery of trade in Queensland, that which connects the sea terminals of the several lines of railway, is the coast route. It carries all her commerce, and is exposed. . . .

The time""when we shall need help and protection will be the time of war, and that will be the very juncture at which the vessels of this squadron will most likely be removed from here. A t page 28 of his paper, Senator Matheson has stated his suggestions as to the alternative. There may be a fallacy in them, but at the present I cannot see that there is. He points out that the additional £94,000 per annum, which will be paid under this agreement, together with the £46,000 which is at present expended upon our naval forces, would be sufficient to maintain even now three cruisers, leavingabout £34,000 available for interest on the cost of their armament, for the payment of further naval reserves at an average of £10 per man per annum. Of course, the naval reserves would be only for a limited time. and for the support of naval dep6ts in each State. In three years' time, on the expiration by notice of the present subsidj', £106,000 would, become available for the rental by Australia, and commission with Australian crews, of three more cruisers hired from the British Government.

I consider that that agreement was a mistake. I have glanced through tlie report of the discussion which took place upon the subject in the Victorian Parliament in 1887, and I find that the late Honourable John Woods, who spoke rather in opposition to the proposal, did so in a way that showed that 'he could see far ahead. He spoke of the danger of drawing Australia into the ring of belligerent nations. We are certainly standing at a critical turn of the road. Hitherto, all our efforts, in the way of military and naval preparations, have been made distinctly for defensive purposes. effort is being made to draw us into the ring of offensive operations. any kind of defensive operations that the Admiralty may be called upon to adopt. That is an important step beyond the agreement of 1887, and we shall do well to think over it before we go any further. Do we wish Australia to enter this ring of pugilists, ready to fall upon. one another with the direst hatred, and with the utmost efforts of warfare? we should be in it. able to relieve the mother country as far as we can of the burden and necessity of looking after us here. We can not do more. The question is : Shall we spend what little we can afford in developing our resources, in protecting our shores, in making our men able to defend their families and homes when the time comes, or shall we throw this money into the bottomless pool of the Admiralty ? sarily make the same apology as that which was offered by the honourable and learned 1 member for Northern Melbourne, that I am not an expert' in these matters.

Under this agreement, however, and this is one of the most favorable aspects of it, the British Admiralty would be required to keep us supplied with up-to-date ships during the continuance of the arrangement; from the British Government, would theynot be equally up to date. should secure an equally good service. I am satisfied, however, that whatever arrangements were entered into, the British Admiralty would go rather beyond the letter of the agreement. It would be to their advantage to send us the very best ships that could be obtained. I read some little time ago an article in the new magazine, The World's Work, which told of an American who went to England to see if he could not obtain better work from English workmen. He was able to do so, and one of the reasons that he subsequently gave for his belief that the Americans were superior in every way to the British, was that the latter had not yet come to realize the value of the ""scrap heap."" He said that all their machinery and buildings were too long lived, and that they were not prepared to keep them up to date. It seems to me that that contention has some application to this matter. If we were to attempt to keep cruisers here to defend our coasts, we should soon have ah enormous scrap heap. That scrap heap, the British Government undertake under this agreement to take ff our hands, and they can do so without any great loss, because throughout the wide area of Empire they have use for vessels which would be unsuitable for the one purpose for which they are required here. I had made a note to deal with the contention that at the expiration of this agreement we shall have nothing to show for what we have paid. That contention, however, has been ably dealt with by the Minister for Defence, and I shall only say that it applies to all classes of leases. There is an old adage that ""fools build houses for wise men to live in . "" It would be a matter of no difficulty to point out to a man who had been paying rent for 30 or 40 years that he has nothing to show for it . I think the argument was well demolished by the Minister for Defence. W it h regard to the area over which the fleet may be supposed to roam, I would point out that large issues are likely to arise in the Easti n which we may be concerned. The battle-ground of the naval forces of Europe, in all probability, will be transferred from the Mediterranean to the East, and it is there that the trouble is likely to arise. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne spoke If we were to lease ships about vessels of the squadron sailing away to Antarctic regions. That is a very good catch argument to use; but there is another I do not know that we aspect to be considered. We have to remember that if the vessels of the squadron are removed from our shores, it will be because of complications and heavy fighting on the borders of China, or perhaps India. to Eastern Asia, to Japan, and China, and so forth bordering on the Northern Pacific. The Prime Minister told us last night that, whilst we should have only. 15 per 'cent, of the.fighting power of the Empire to send to them from these southern seas, tbey would have 85 per cent, of that fighting power to send to us. I think we could very well afford to have our 15 per cent, sent to fight in the waters of Eastern Asia, and have tlie battle-ground removed from our own shores. The position in the East has attracted the attention of Captain Mahan, who has written an article on the subject, which I shall presently quote. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne referred to an article by the same authority on the defence of San Erancisco. My recollection of that article is that Captain Mahan suggested cruisers for the defence of the Californian coast because the Americans must keep the bulk of their fleet on the Atlantic, and the journey round the Horn to the Pacific is a very long one. I will show presently, however, that Captain Mahan does not generally consider cruisers necessary for coastal and harbour defence. I have here a quotation which is so closely on the lines of the proposed agreement that one might almost be the outcome of the other. Captain Mahan, in an article on the disposition of navies in the July, 1902, number of the",60,Bakton Ca N The Honor

253,Mr Skene,"I am referring, of course,National Bevieio, draws a vivid mind-picture of the naval power of Great Britain, with its root in the English Channel, its trunk in the Mediterranean, its branches extending through the Suez Canal and down the Red Sea, and bifurcating in two long arms at India, one extremity reaching to China, and the other to Australia. Speaking of the needs of Australia, he saysWhat Australia needs is not her petty fraction of the Imperial Navy, a squadron assigned to her in perpetual presence, but an organization of naval force which constitutes a firm grasp of the universal situation. Thus danger is kept remote, but if it should approach, there is insured, within reaching distance, an adequate force to repel it betimes. The essence of the matter is that local security does not necessarily, nor usually, depend upon the constant local presence of a protectorship or squadron, bub on general disposition. . . . . Local safety is not always found in local precaution. That passage might have been written as a report upon our position. But while Captain Mahan, dealing with general principles, writes in that way of the needs of Australia, he also says, in an article on "" Preparedness for War,"" that coastal defence, to make it complete, must have an element of offence in it . Coast defence implies gun power and torpedo lines, . . . but coast defence, though essentially passive, should have an element of offensive force local in character offensive force is to be found in the torpedo boat in its various developments. There should be a local flotilla of small torpedo vessels which, hy their activity, should make life a burden bo an outside enemy. The honourable and learned members for Bendigo and for Northern Melbourne quoted Sir William Jervois and Sir Peter Scratchley as experts who recommended the employment of cruisers! detract from the reputation experts, I should like to point out that a good many years have elapsed since they reported on the question. that time would not have recommended electrical traction, nor was wireless telegraphy thought of, though it is likely to play an important like operations of the future. fore I do hot think that the opinions which have been quoted can be compared with those of a present day It has been said that if a powerful foreign fleet were approaching our shores the vessels of tire present Auxiliary Squadron would be afraid to go outside the Heads. I can understand that they may not be in a position to contend on anything like equal Mr Skene. terms with the newer vessels that are now afloat. Buti t must be remembered that there is alsvays a possibility of the enemy's vessels entering our harbors. be made effective to prevent that. that that was intended. Honourable members are aware that during the SpanishAmerican war Admiral Dewey took his fleet right up to Manilla, and the mines which were laid to prevent such a thing were only exjyloded after he had passed. A few years ago a French fleet entered Foochow Harbor before notice was given that pressure was likely to be brought to bear upon the Chinese Emperor, while three or four years agp the Vulcan was able to enter Port Phillip, and pass under the forts of Queenscliff, without being discovered by those on shore, although they knew that she would attempt to come in. Those instances show that there is a risk of an enemy's vessels entering our harbors, and, that being so, we should have at hand some force which would be able to meet them. I am glad that the Cabinet have decided not to do away with the old vessels, though I hope that in getting new ones we shall have the very latest appliances and improveThat ments. In a list published by The Times a few days ago, it is shown that Great Britain, which recently had only five submarine boats, is now building fourteen, and that France has fifteen, and is building more. A matter which has been exercising my mind to some extent is the difficulty which I think will be caused by the different rates of pay which will prevail on the three drillWithout wishing to ships which will be manned by Australian of tbose and New Zealand seamen, and the vessels which will be manned by British seamen. I understand that there is a feeling amongst Electricians at naval men that this difference will create difficulties, and, to my mind, it will be better if the drill-ships -can be placed under the control of the local authorities, going out to part in the warsea with the Imperial squadron for practice Therewhen necessary. In connection with the pay of the men, I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister a matter which I authority. thought of speaking upon when the Defence Bill is before the House, but which it may be as well to introduce now. We are offering facilities and encouragement to young men to embark upon a precarious life f u l l of risks, in which they are unlikely to make provision for their old age. There is, moreover,",61,Bakton Ca N The Honor
254,Sir John Fokkest,The Cerberus is to,62,Bakton Ca N The Honor
255,Mr Skene,"I was very glad to heara growing dislike to the pension system. I have, therefore, given some thought to the possibilities of life insurance. Of course, without knowing exactly what the rates of pay will be, and what' the pensions usually given are, I have not been able to make very exact calculations, but I have ascertained that a man entering the service at the age of 21 could, for a yearly premium of £ 2 1 14s. 7d., or Is. 2^d. per day, insure his life for £500, the policy to mature when he reached the age of 42. I have fixed that age because the British sailor is entitled to a pension after he has served 21 years. A t the end of that time, the cash value of tlie poliey and its bonus additions would be about £680, a sum which would purchase an immediate annuity of £ 4 0 15s. 4d. Those figures were obtained from an actuary of one of the best institutions in Melbourne. How, there is in the Savings Banks here a system under which the employees are compelled to insure their lives, the bank paying half the premium and the employees themselves the other. If that system were adopted in connection with our naval forces, the State would be called upon to pay 7-Jd. and the sailor 7£d. per diem. In this way an investment might be provided for him, which, perhaps, would not be too expensive for the Government, and which would make provision for his old age, or benefit his relatives in the event of his premature death. British seaman likes to invest his own money. a little of the money out of the hands of the seamen, to provide for their own benefit. If something of the kind suggested by me could be done, the men entering the service would know that they had something to fall back upon, and there would be no difficulty in connection wibh the question of pensions. Anobher mabber referred bo by my honourable and learned friend for Northern Melbourne was the attitude of Canada. He stated, in the first place, bhat Sir Wilfred Laurier was afraid of militarism. I have a distinct recollection of reading a 'speech delivered by that eminent statesman at a banquet in London, in the course of which he said that, of all the nations, England was exposed to the least danger from an excess of militarism. I also recollect reading a statement by Professor Eiske that, whilst' there had been one 6D instance in which a kingdom had been pub up bo auction and sold by bhe milibary bo bhe highest bidder, there had never been any danger to be apprehended on that score from the naval forces. Tbe real trouble with Canada was one which had reference to her trade relations. In an article, by Lt -Col. George T. Denison, in the Nineteenth Century, of June, 1902, the writer first speaks of the reciprocity treaty which exisbed bebween bhe United Sbabes and Canada in 1854, and explains how bhe federation of Canada was one of bhe results of bhe notice which was given for the cancellation of the treaty. Leading up through other matters which helped to create a strong Imperial senbimenb in Canada, he saysEvery great nation in the world, except our own, seems to have become united and consolidated for trade and defence. Germany, France, Italy, Austria, and Russia have organized their forces to an enormous extent. They are increasing their navies with great rapidity. Tlie United States have become consolidated as the outcome of the Civil War, and are largely increasing their navy. No one can tell when the British Empire may be involved in a great war. Lord Salisbury', Lord Dufferin, and other able leaders have expressed their opinion of the possibility of war, and alarm on that account has caused immense increases to. be made in our navy. All this has had its weight ou the Canadian mind, and has led to the general opinion that the Empire should be organized for defence, and that large additions should be made to the military and naval forces of it in every part. While the view is held that large sums should be expended in warlike preparations to enable us to hold our own in the face of the gigantic war power of other civilized nations, yet the Canadian people can see that no military or naval preparation can be of uny use. unless in addition the food supply is sufficient and secure, and unless our trade is preserved so that our Empire may have the financial strength to maintain \he defence expenses. The Canadians are a practical people, and naturally cannot see the wisdom of entering upon a great and costly scheme of defence unless the system is to be complete in every respect, and have no weak links. Therefore, they feel that the question of the food supply of the mother country is the first defensive step to be taken, and that arms, munitions of war, battle-ships, cruisers, and millions of armed men are all worthless unless food for the nation is secured. I have also seen another article written by Colonel Denison upon the same point, in which he argues that the Imperial Government may be influenced by the electors, that seven millions of the population would very soon be at bhe starvation point in the event of an interruption of food supplies, whilst another seven millions would be quickly reduced bo similar straits, and",62,Bakton Ca N The Honor
256,Mr Page,My experience is that the,63,Bakton Ca N The Honor
257,Mr Skene,"Yes, but I wish to taketo accept terms for peace which would be unsatisfactory to obher parts of the Empire. Some of bhose who are engaged in bhe grain trade in Great Britain have stated that grain would very soon be worth fromi 70s. to 100s. per quarter in bhe evenb of an inberrupbion of food supplies; and quibe recenbly a large associabion was formed, including many men in the highesb posibion in bhe old country, with a view to inquire into this matter. All through, the Canadian attitude has been influenced by trade considerations. some little piqne felt in connection with the preferential Tariff from which Canada derives no benefit. They were disappointed with the action of the British Governmenb in connection wibh bhe sugar duty, although it did not affect them very much, and afterAmericans, were in. a tone seldom heard till wards they were disappointed ab bhe removal of bhe corn duby. I believe bhab bhe recenb new departure of Mr Chamberlain in the direction of preferential trade within the Empire was forced upon him by the attitude of the Canadian people in this respect In a speech which he recenbly delivered in bhe House of' Commons, he spoke of bhe possible dismembermenb of bhe Empire, unless some arrangement could be made for reciprocal trade relations. W it h regard to the question as to whether we should be mainly dependent upon Greab Bribain for the protection of our trade routes and our coasts, we must not forget bhab bhis is an age of big combinations, and bhab bhe babble-ground of the world is approaching us very closely. If we started with a navy of our own, the chances are that we should not be quite so closely in bouch with' bhe mobher counbry and ibs defensive organizations, as if our squadron were acting under bhe guidance of bhe British Admiralby. We mighb be lefb bo find our own way through a trouble which would be altogether too gigantic for us to cope with. Either we shall have.to fall into line with and adhere closely to the old country, or else take our own part aud sink into insignificance. If we attempt to paddle our own canoe we shall not share in the glory of the British Empire, bub we shall sink inbo a position of no importance among bhe nations of the world. American republics manage ? fight among themselves, but they hold no posibion amongsb bhe nations of bhe world. I look forward bo a greaber combination bhan bhab between the Commonwealth of Australia and Great Bribain. Everybhing seems bo be bending now bowards bhe establishment of bhe mosb friendly relations between ourselves and the United States, and I hope that some day we shall be able to realize the aspirations of leading statesmen who look forward to a union of all the English-speaking nations. In this connection, I should like bo read a shorb exbract from the Times weekly edition of bhe There seems to have been lsb May. A reporb from New York, under date 24bh April, saysThere was a wonderful expression of AngloAmerican good feeling at the 117th anniversary dinner last evening of the St. George's Society of New York. The speeches, both by English and lately, and met with the warmest responses from the company of 300. President Roosevelt's health, proposed before the King's, was drunk standing and cheering, as was the King's, "" the toast of the evening."" Mr Woodford, who was American Minister at Madrid before the Spanish war, putting morals above force, declared, eloquently that England's best strength lay in her sense of justice and right wherever her flag floats. Stillmoresignificantwasthecritical,almost hostile tone, towards not Germany, but recent German pretensions. The three nations, said Mr Woodford, dispute with each other for the primacy of the world. ""Germany competes directly with England and America. Let the men of one language and one race go in, and let the best man win ; but God keep and draw to§ether the men of tlie English-speaking race."" till straighter was the challenge by Captain Stayton, one of Admiral Dewey's officers at Manilla"" When the German fleet threatened us the English fleet silently changed its anchorage into line with the American, and we did not need to ask which side thej' were going to take.

I fear bhab if we atbempt bo adopb bhe suggestion made by bhe honourable and learned member for Norbbern Melbourne, to look after ourselves and let Great Biitain look after herself, we shall make a great mistake. I think that that is hardly the spirit in which a true-born Briton should view this question, and I certainly do not regard it in thab way. If Great Bribain should ever be threatened, as she was some libtle bime ago, wibh a combined abtack by some of bhe greatest nations of the world, and we had a fleet which we could send to her assistance, I should not hesitate to place ib at her disposal.
