Minister for Repatriation promised to give sympathetic consideration to makingavailable free of charge speciallyequipped motor cars -for limbless and paraplegic ex-servicemen on a basissimilar to that which has been approved by the British Government for British ex-servicemen. Many Australian limbless ex-servicemen are now in doubt whether they should seek loans to obtain motor vehicles of the kind mentioned or wait for the Government to solve their problem. Can the Minister say whether the Government is prepared tofollow the example of the British Government by providing specially equipped motor cars for ex-servicemen such as 1 have indicated? honourable member for Wentworth raised this matter some time ago, as also did the honourable members for Griffith, Swan and Bendigo. Since then I have investigated the suggestion, and I have had the advantage of examining detailed information from the United Kingdom of the provision made for limbless ex-servicemen in that country. However, I am afraid that there is not much prospect of the Australian Government followingthe example of tbe British Government.. In the first place there isgreat difficulty in obtaining motor cars, and, in any event, in view of the assistance that is already being provided for ex-servicemen iu the circumstances mentioned it is considered that the Government would not be justified in incurring the expenditure of providing motor cars, even if they were available. statement made by the Minister for Repatriation that the great shortage of doctors in Australia has led to delays in dealing with repatriation cases, will iS. the Minister state whether it is a fact that there are a number of doctors in Australia who have qualified in medicine at leading medical schools in Europe cause of regulations governing the registration of medical practitioners in this country?

The disclosure that Jews were not mentioned in the conversation, and the fact that an allegation was made in this House that my officers advised the secretary of the honourable member for Richmond that only Jews were being admitted, proves that the honourable member's statement in this instance was f.a.q. of his allegations I am about to ask is based on an advergenerally. personal explanation. the honourable member claim that he has been misrepresented? represented in the answer which the Minister has just given. Last week, I asked a question about the migration to Australia of persons of German nationality. I had made personal inquiries into a specific case. The Minister asked me to make out a factual case, rather than state a hypothetical case, and he would deal with it. I then explained that this was a factual case that referred to a man named Gerhard Bear, and I pointed out to the House that my secretary, under my instructions, had made inquiries at the Department of Immigration in Sydney, and had been given certain information. I read that information to the House in the exact form in which it was transmitted to me. The information allegedly given to my secretary by the department in Sydney was that only certain persons were being admitted. I use the word "" allegedly "", because they denied honourable member is not entitled to debate this matter. He is only entitled to say how he has been misrepresented. the matter. I am merely explaining how the Minister misrepresented the situation. The information given to my secretary was typed for me and I read it to the House in the exact form in which it was sent to me. It was that the only perof a mink coat of this description. sons entitled to come to Australia from Germany were the femalefianceesof persons already in this country, and that persons of Jewish faith-the word "" Jewish"" was specifically mentionedwere given special treatment. orable member should leave it at that. for my asking the question. MINK COAT. tisement that appeared in the week-end newspapers relating to a Labrador mink coat which was offered for sale in Australia at £2,175. Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether such mink coats are imported, and if so, from which country? Would such items be classed as luxury items, and, if so, would they involve an allocation of dollars ? Will the right honourable gentleman reconsider any such allocation with a view to making those dollars available for the importation of spare parts for tractors, so that, despite the laughs and sneers of metropolitan members, the Government's production drive can be further advanced ? thing about a fur coat being offered for sale in Sydney at £2,175. I assure honourable members that no dollars will be made available for the importation of mink coats from hard currency areas. AlthoughI do not know from where this coatcame, it may be one that has been held by a retailer or a wholesaler in one of the continental countries and sent to Australia for sale. honourable gentleman's reply. orable members would cease interrupting they would be able to hear what the Prime Minister is saying.

25,Mr Chifley,"I shall cause inmade available for this purpose. I shall inform the honourable member of the result of those inquiries. the Prime Minister. I point out that in the press to-day there appears a report that Brigadier-General Travis, General Officer Commanding the United States Pacific Air Command, has given an .assurance that in the event of another war America will immediately send strong military aid to Australia. The press report also states that Brigadier-General Travis is in Australia on a goodwill mission, and has brought with him a staff of fourteen officers and men. What is the honourable member's question ? Minister give to the House any information about the nature of this goodwill mishave the right to do that, because sion? Is this distinguished American -officer here at the invitation of the Australian Government? If he is not here at the invitation of the Government, will -the Government, in view of the statements -that he is here on a goodwill mission, .afford him every facility to disouss with Australian representatives the subject of Australian-American co-operation in resoect of problems in the Pacific area? Is the right honourable gentleman able to give ;to the House any information on this important subject? Travis occupies a post in the American Intelligence Service and it is not usual for public statements to be made about the work of such organizations. AllI can -say in answer to the honourable member's -question is that the fullest facilities have the Pacific, would obviously be necessary; already been provided for the discussion -of matters of common interest between Australia and the United States of America and also the United Kingdom -and other Pacific countries. Later: of the Prime Minister to the statement in this morning's press attributed to Brigadier-General Officer Commanding the United States Pacific Air Command, that there is no 1 danger of the United States ""pulling out"" of the Pacific area, and that there was no doubt that the United States would come to the military assistance of Australia if required. Can the right honourable gentleman say whether the American Government has given any assurance that it will not withdraw from the Pacific area, and that it will come to Australia's assistance in the event of a future ""show""? discussions which are going on with various countries, a question of the kind just asked by the honourable gentleman is quite improper. It is quite certain that no officer of the United States of America Government, as an individual, can give any assurance on behalf of the President or of the legislature of that country as to what the United States of America is likely to do now or in the future. No army officer and, indeed, no American congressman, as an individual, would that right lies entirely within the province of the American Government. AllI can say is that the relationships existing between the Australian Government and the various American services and leaders of that countryI might go so far as to include the President of the United States of America-ar e excellent, and 1 see no reason why our relation; with America should be adversely affected in any way by the discussions which the Minister for External Affairs has been conducting in respect of a regional basis in the Pacific. The Government is keeping that aspect in the forefront in all its discussions. My own view is that having regard to the need to maintain world peace, American intervention, should trouble arise in and I believe that the American Government would give very serious consideration to such a matter. representing the Postmaster-General state the present position in relation to the Travis, General erection of a new automatic, telephone exchange at Albury, and when it is intended to commence the remodelling of the Albury post office?",11,Dollar Deficits

Labour and National Service aware that wage increases were granted recently in the Postal Department, but that there was some delay in the payment of those increases? Is he also aware that the postal workshop group at Sydenham near Sydney threatened to stop work unless it immediately received the wage increases, and it received them, whereas employees of the mail branch who made no such threat are still waiting for their higher payments? Why does the Government set a premium on indusrrial blackmail in this way, and what steps is the Government prepared to take to meet the just claims of workers who prefer to stay at work rather than to disrupt the community? more within the province of the Prime Minister's Department, which controls the Public Service Board, than that of the Department of Labour and National Service. nothing of the incident to which the honourable member has referred. By consent awards, extensive wage increases have been granted to members of the Public Service. I am speaking of those who are in the lower divisions. On two occasions substantial increases have been granted in the higher ranks by the Public Service Arbitrator, and many millions of pounds have heen expended as a result of those increases. I have no knowledge of any delay that has occurred in the making of payments. There might have been some physical delay connected with the computation of the amounts due. The awards covering the lower divisions were arrived at by consent before an arbitrator; that which deals with the higher ranks was made by the Public Service Arbitrator. the point raised by the honourable member concerning the threatened strike which allegedly led to payment of some employees and the fact that payments were not granted as readily to others who had. not threatened to strike, and I shall inform the honourable member of the result.

Will the Minister for Civil Aviation state the reason for the delay of nearly one year in informing the House of the findings of fhe officials who investigated that crash, which is the worse disaster yet to occur to an aircraft within the jurisdiction of his department? Will he promptly table the findings of those officials in order that they may be discussed by honourable members? Is the delay in releasing the official report as well as the failure to initiate a prosecution due to disclosures in that report which might reflect adversely upon the administration of the Department of Civil Aviation? ceived information from the Attorney General's Department, to which the matter mentioned by the honourable member was referred some timt I have heard ago, and, if I am given leave t.r. do so, I am prepared now to make a statement which will clear the honourable member's mind on t.ht subject No justification whatever exists for the implication contained in his question that the official report on thia disaster reflects in any way upon the administration of the Department of Civil Aviation. for Civil Aviation whether the so called great circle direct route from Perth to Melbourne has been forbidden to passenger aircraft by the Department of Civil Aviation?

However, I shall have inquiries made into the matter, and obtain the fullest possible information for the honourable member. The DC6 aircraft were used between Perth and the eastern part of Australia when they were available, but these aircraft were purchased for use primarily for the Pacific service. There may be occasions when that type of aircraft will be available for flights between Perth and the eastern States, but the Australian National Airlines Commission has not sufficient numbers of DC 6 aircraft to operate a regular trans-continental service with them. Therefore, I am not able to give the honourable member any hope that DC6machines will fly that route regularly. The commission will continue to use DC4 aircraft on that service. New South Wales has granted to the Commonwealth for twenty years, a lease of 6,500 acres on the Beecroft Peninsula, which is required for the Nowra air station. The State had made that area wholly a flora and fauna reserve. Will the Minister for the Navy undertake to continue the absolute protection of flora and fauna in that area, except, of course, in the target area? The State has also prohibited grazing throughout that area since 1945 in an endeavour to reduce the risk of hush fires. Will the Minister favourably consider making a similar prohibition in that area and in adjoining Commonwealth areas? from the Department of the Navy whether the honourable member's representations for the protection of flora and fauna in the area to which he has referred can be acceded to. He may also rest assured that the department will do everything in its power to carry out the wishes of the State Government. When I have discussed the matter with the department, I shall inform the honourable member of the decision. months ago, when 1 was investigating the shortage of tyres for heavy plant and equipment, I was given the extraordinary excuse that the men required to handle them in the process of manufacture in Australia were opposed to making them. Is the Prime Minister aware of the serious shortage of large tyres for replacements? Does he know that this shortage is preventing all classes of heavy machinery, including graders, from being kept in operation in Australia, and that the shortage is becoming an increasing menace to maintenance of operations by local authorities and private users? Will the Prime Minister have the matter investigated in an endeavour to overcome this unfortunate opposition to the manufacture of heavy tyres, and the employees' preference for making only such classes of tyres as they desire, because their attitude is involving authorities and producers in heavy losses ? ber will understand that the control of the distribution of tyres is no longer a Commonwealth responsibility. the labour problem. ber stated that the employees disliked manufacturing heavy tyres, and preferred making light tyres. Whilst the honourable member may be correct in saying that such a dislike exists, I remind him that that information was supplied by the manufacturers themselves. Apparently, the work is heavy, and if the employees can obtain lighter work without making heavy tyres, they prefer to take it. I realize that it is most important that heavy tyres should be available for tractors and agricultural machinery, and I shall confer with those responsible to ascertain whether assistance can be given, or labour provided in order to enable heavy tyres to be made.

I know that twelve or thirteen vehicles were used for that work. I should have thought that it was the duty of a country that is endeavouring to cultivate friendly relations with other countries to ensure that the representatives of those countries should be properly entertained while they were here on official business. I shall ascertain been used by them. The story is a very whether it is possible, without undertaking too much detailed work, to prepare an estimate of the mileage travelled by those motor cars. I shall do my best to secure the information for the honourable member. I want it to be clearly understood that, no matter what cost was involved, I , as the leader of the Government of Australia, consider that it was my duty to ensure that distinguished visitors from other countries were properly cared for while they were here. the Prime Minister whether he has observed that it has been reported to-day that the Chinese cruiser Chungking, formerly the British cruiser Aurora, which was presented to the Chinese Government, has been handed over to the Communists? Has he also observed that the British battleship Royal Sovereign, on returning from Russia, was without its anti-aircraft gunnery equipment? Is lie now prepared to discuss with the Imperial authorities at the next Imperial conference the complete and utter unwisdom of disclosing any information about land, sea and air armaments to questionable international characters? statements that the honourable member has 3a id appear in the newspapers this morning. The only information that I have gleaned from the newspapers to-day is the result of the cricket match in for Information gave an undertaking that Sydney, and that was not of an international character. Very much could be said about the supply of equipment and materials by the United Kingdom and the United States of America to what were regarded as the friendly governments of other countries, and a great deal could also be said about the uses to which some of that equipment has been put. Something could even be said in regard to Unrra relief that was provided for certain friendly countries. There can be no question but that, in some instances, such gifts have been misused or misapplied. I know from my own knowledge of the circumstances in China, that some of the material supplied to the then Government of China has fallen into the hands of the Communists and has long one, and I do not propose to attempt to deal with it now.

How much wheat is still to be shipped to New Zealand at the low price provided for in the 1947 agreement, and what is the total cost to the Treasury up to date of recouping to the growers the difference between the price New Zealand paid under the agreement and the world parity price ? honourable member place his questions on the notice-paper and ask in addition whether the farmers of Australia lost anything at all in respect of the deal.",14,Economic Commission For

Long before the. Legislative Council for the Northern Territory was established, certain ordinances which had been drafted, and were ready for promulgation, were sent by the legal officers in Darwin to the Attorney-General in Canberra. One such ordinance relates to the adoption of children. There are now others dealing with such matters as workers' compensation and the protection of mail men now operating the Royal mail between Alice Springs and Darwin. Will the honourable member now ask his question ? will the Minister confer with the Acting Attorney-General with a view to appointing a legal officer to assist elected members of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory as the nominated members are now assisted, so that ordinances may be drafted and promulgated speedily? promulgation of a number of ordinances, including some relating to the establishment of a land board, and other matters of importance to the Northern Territory was delayed pending the establishment, of the Legislative Council of .the Northern Territory. It was thought that it would be in the best interests of the Northern Territory if all ordinances were submitted to the council for approval.

Clark) I have received from the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely:The urgent necessity of securing the f u l l , vassed in debate. spontaneous co-operation of the medical, dental, pharmaceutical and nursing professions, of State and hospital organizations and of voluntary sickness benefit associations with the Commonwealth Government to ensure a successful and satisfactory national health service. There are several precedents for the disallowance of proposed motions for the adjournment of the House to discuss matters that have already been debated during the same session. In the present instance the matter proposed to be raised was the subject of discussion last December during the second-reading debate on the National Health Service Bill 1948. It will be remembered that on that occasion an amendment was moved by the then Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) which covered almost completely the subject now sought to be raised. I quote the tenth edition of May, at page 241, as follows:The Speaker is bound to apply to thestmotions the established rules of debate and to enforce the principle that subjects excluded by those rules cannot be brought forward thereon; such as a matter under adjudication by a court of law, or matters already discussed during the current session, whether upon a previous motion for adjournment upon a substantive motion, upon an amendment or upon an order of the day. I therefore rule the proposed motion out of order. order. This House is placed in a very difficult position in the conduct of the business of the country because of the Government's failure to comply with the provision of the Constitution which lays down that there shall be a separate session of the Parliament each year. There is no point of order involved. 1 have given my ruling on a matter that has been placed before the Chair.

These are its termsI desire to inform you that to-day I shall move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz.:The urgent necessity of implementing immediately a successful and satisfactory national health scheme. The subject-matter of the proposed motion is such that due notice of it should have been given to the Ohair. that you have given, sir? It is within my knowledge that on several occasions notice of motion for the adjournment of the House has been written hy honourable members in the chamber and has immediately been handed to the Chair.

92,"Already Taken Part In The Debate Were For I N D I ( Mr Mcewen) Pointed Out Last,","great error. During the discussions in the Trusteeship Council, which are reported in the Current Affairs Bulletin of the Department of External Affairs, some delegates criticized the wage rates being paid to native labourers in New Guinea. Superficially, those rates may seem to leave some room for criticism, but it is necessary to examine all the circumstances. Already, there has been dislocation of an unsatisfactory kind because of the sharp increases of wage rates. We were told by delegates to the Trusteeship Council that we should apply the principle of equal pay for the sexes. Such an attempt to apply to jungle tribes doctrinaire notions which are contested hotly even in highly industrialized communities is so fantastically unreal as to raise doubts of the value of an organization where proposals of the kind can be seriously advanced. New Guinea is indispensable to Australia's defence, and to the future prosperity of the white peoples in this part of the world. Any Australian government which does not assert vigorously the right of Australia to administer the Territories of Papua and New Guinea will fail in its duty. I am by no means satisfied that we have in the present Australian Government a body of men who recognize the importance of asserting Australia's case vigorously and strongly in the councils of the world. Reference has been made to the strategic importance of New Guinea, and we still have a vivid recollection of the part which it played in the defence of Australia during the recent war. We view with growing alarm events now taking place in Asia. Day after day, developments in India, Burma, Malaya, China and Indonesia suggest that Communist forces, which for so long worked by infiltration and propaganda, taking advantage of the chaotic conditions arising out of the war, now believe that the time is opportune to establish themselves openly in nower. Only this week, We read a solemn warning on the subject from the Prime Minister of India. In Malaya, at this very moment, there is a race against time between the authorities and the Chinese Communist forces engaged in terrorist activities in that Indeed, observers in Malaya have said that unless the Communist menace can be Mr Bolt. checked quickly, it may well bring about the collapse of the British regime. In Siam and Burma the rapid success of Communist forces is bringing about a consolidation of the Communist position. Not only does the maintenance of our tenure of New Guinea become of even greater importance to Australia, but also the maintenance, for our own security, of ouv close associations with those other governments, representing the white peoples who have interests in the Pacific, becomes a prime necessity. To a degree that has been recognized by the establishment in recent years of the South Pacific Commission. I am glad that Australia took a prominent part in the formation of that commission. However, having regard to the direction in which the Government's foreign policy has turned in recent months, I shall refer to the membership of that commission. It comprises representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Holland, Australia and New Zealand. The commission first met here in May, 1948. It met a.gain in October, 1948, and I understand that a further meeting is planned for May of this year. So we have in being a body which deals with some of the problems which arise in the south Pacific area. In addition to problems of research, it will deal with subjects relating to health, which involves nutrition, and economic and social development. One can imagine that a body representative of those governments, constituted for the purposes that I have mentioned, could in the process of time concern itself with other and even weightier problems, such as the defence of this area.' It has an opportunity to do useful work, and I for one hope that it will sustain its efforts. The significant point is that when our Government alines itself with an organization to deal w.ith problems of economic and social development in this area, it links itself with the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Holland and New Zealand, the governments of which are represented on the South Pacific Commission. It is worthy of comment that those are the governcountry. ments that were linked with us during the war years in the A.B.D.A. Command, that is the American, British, Dutch and Australian foody on which representatives of our services participated. It organized the war strategy in countries in the south-west Pacific areas. That was a recognition of the need for a close link with those peoples, so that probof population has been a rapid increase lems of economic and social development, and defence, could be contrived and organized. But when we come to the application of a foreign policy for this country, in the day-to-day events which have to be dealt with, we find that so far from linking ourselves with the governments of the countries that I have mentioned we are linking ourselves with the governments of countries whose interests may, in the future, run contrary to our own. Last night the right honourable .member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) spoke with the authority of one who a generation ago fought for Australia's right to administer the Territory of New Guinea, and with the ripe wisdom and experience gained from a. life-time spent in the public service of this country. The right honourable gentleman stated that our ""clear choice should be to maintain a determined policy to hold this part of the world for the white peoples of the world, particularly the British race. But we cannot at the same time reject the assistance and co-operation of those who have similar interests to ourselves in this area, in order to seek the tenuous and shadowy co-operation which may be given to us by unstable governments which have only a precarious hold of the administration of their own countries. I speak in particular of the Indonesian people. If we look at the record of the Dutch in theircolonial administration of Java and the islands of the Netherlands East Indies, and compare that with what we ourselves have attempted to do in New Guinea, we cannot stand on very firm ground if we allege that theirs has not been a successful policy of administration. When the Dutch came to the Netherlands East Indies there were about 6,000,000 Indonesians in Java; to-day there are approximately 50,000,000 Indonesians in Java, and the Dutch claim, with a good deal of force, that that spectacular population increase has been due largely to the introduction of orderly government, which instituted health measures for the alleviation of disease, and made provision for inoculation, against disease. Associated with this remarkable growth of prosperity, until to-day we find that Java( Mr Lazzarini) -We are discussing New Guinea, not Java. The honourable member should not dwell at length on the affairs of Java. in linking what I have to say about the Netherlands East Indies with what I regard as a sound policy for our own territories of New Guinea and Papua. As a -result of developments that I have mentioned, the Netherlands East Indies has become one of the richest areas on the surface of the globe. When we turn to the Territories of Papua and New Guinea we cannot point to anything like that spectacular record. AlthoughI do not know where the full answer to this problem lies, it cannot be denied that there has been an amazing increase of population in Indonesia under Dutch administration, and there has been a tremendous growth of the wealth and resources of those islands As I have mentioned earlier, there are less than 10,000 white people altogether in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, whereas the native population totals nearly 1,000,000. AlthoughI have not the latest story, up to a few years ago it was quite seriously questioned by authoritative observers whether the native population was actually diminishing. Of course, that does not mean that Australia has not been able to bring about useful changes in these areas. Fifty years of contact with the' Europeans have wrought many changes. The natives of New Ireland, who were among the most notable cannibals in the south seas as recently as the late 'eighties, are now peaceful traders and gardeners, and along the road that runs down the east coast of the island from the pretty township of Kavieng, prosperous European copra plantations alternate with neat but picturesque native villages.

There is much yet unknown about these territories. All we know is that they have .great potentialities for future development and that the problem of their development is part of the general problem of development which we have in Australia. I wonder whether the Government has given any thought to the possibility of diverting to these islands some of the volume of migrants coming to Australia. Such a proposal may at first glance seem foolish, especially when we need migrants in such great numbers, but at a time when our housing position is so acute, it is worthy of serious thought. Consideration might well be iriven, then, to the diversion to the territories of Papua and New Guinea of some proportion of the migrants coming to this country. apply there? are restrictions on migration to the territories, but I do not know whether they are as stringent as those which apply in this country. policy applies there. ber for Balaclava ( Mr White) assists me by saying that the White Australia policy applies there.

Australia at present imports to say the least, maladroit drafting on some of these products from abroad and the part of the Government and very utilizes valuable exchange for that purpose. So, by diverting some proportion of our migrants to New Guinea we should not merely be strengthening the defence of New Guinea but also encouraging the production of the valuable items which I have mentioned. If we are to maintain our right to hold these territories, we cannot allow to continue indefinitely a policy which results in the number of whites resident there being limited to only 10,000 persons. Whether we divert some of the migrants who are coming here, or encourage Australians ""ow resident in this country to go to New Guinea, or resort to acombination of the two procedures, we must do a great deal more in the future than we have done in the past to develop the resources that are available in these rich islands. A t present gold represents about two-thirds of the total value of the exports from the territories. Only a fraction of the remainder is represented by the valuable items which I have mentioned.

If Australia has never permitted the slave trade to exist in thes* areas why, in 1949, should we solemnly proclaim that the slave trade is to. be abolished ? The"" C "" mandate, the document under which Australia wa.s given control of this territory at the conclusion of World WarI . , contains a provision prohibiting the slave trade. The New Guinea Aet of 1920, which adopted I he mandate, contained a similar j< revision. tained in section 36 of the 1920 act. do not want to misrepresent the position. Tho Minister implies by his'interjection that we are merely repeating in this bili what was stated in the legislation of 1920. 1 accept that. are given in this legislation as were contained in the 1920 act. Government's justification for the inclusion in this legislation of the reference to the slave trade. But the legislation of 1920 adopted, or made specific reference to, a clear prohibition set out in the mandatory document at that time. The mandate power was required to make a prohibition of the slave trade in the mandated area, and that was done in that legislation; but the trusteeship agreement which we are asked to adopt under this legislation, being annexed as a schedule to the bill, contains no reference to any undertaking of this kind because, I assume, those who drafted the trusteeship document knew that the slave trade did not exist in any of these mandated areas. The Government would have acted sensibly in this matter had it omitted any reference whatever to the slave trade. Such a reference is not required of it under the trusteeship document. It is not any answer to say that the position required some mention in 1920 and, therefore, we are mentioning it again in 1949. The situation has changed considerably since those days. . At a time when, as I suggested earlier, this matter will come under review annually by the Trusteeship Council, which is certainly not at a loss for words or slow to probe into these matters, we are unwise, to say the least, to put up as we would raise a flag this reference to the abolition of the slave trade. Honourable members opposite, including some members of the Government itself, exhibit a rather naive approach to the problem of colonial administration. First, the word "" colonial"" has, in their eyes, some sinister significance. They get a mental picture of oppressed native peoples struggling to assert their independence and being held down by an oppressive power which exploits their labour and squeezes the wealth of their resources from them. That is no exaggeration of the view which honourable members opposite take of this matter. It is only on that basis that one can explain a great deal of the comment and propaganda which the Government and its supporters have put out from time to time. But, of course, the fact of the matter is that in most of these areas which come under the administration of a mandate power there is no nation in the sense in which we use the word. Yesterday, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) concluded his speech by saying, "" We can, as white Australians, look after a black nation "". If the word "" nation "" means anything, the term "" black nation"" implies the existence of a body of people who have combined to form a national entity possessing the attributes of nationhood and, presumably, are in a position to undertake the responsibilities of nationhood. How could any man in his senses apply that description to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea? I do not know how any man in his senses could really apply it to the people of Indonesia where there are hosts of different tribes who speak scores of different dialects and languages. To speak of such people as a nation is an utter abuse of language. In respect of the peoples of New Guinea area I shall quote for the benefit of honourable members a passage from the Pacific Islands",23,Second Reading

103,Mr Holt,"I take it that that is theYear-book, for 1944, the latest edition issued. That publication refers to New Guinea aborigines in these termsGenerally aborigine is of a good type, well built, and, when civilized, very amenable to discipline. As a rule he is fairly stolid, though flashes of brilliance are found amongst members of some of the tribes. In every island the different branches or tribes appear to be innumerable, and even at short distances it is found that great physical differences occur in tlie types: while tribes only ten ur twelve miles from each other often speak totally different dialects. The result is that interpretation is very difficult for travellers or lor the natives amongst themselves, but throughout the territory the use of "" pidgin "" English has become so established that even the Germans spoke 'pidgin "" English to their labourers. The point I make there is that of variety. Another passage in that publication readsThe natives of New Guinea and the adjoining Bismarck Archipelago are loosely described as Papuans, or Melanesians; but no generic term would adequately cover them because they present an extraordinary mixture of racial types and languages. There are dark-skinned, hook-nosed people in the Sepik River region; many communities of an apparent Polynesian type, light-skinned and straight-haired; and nn extraordinary range of people of a negroid appearance, with thick lips, crinkly hair and skins ranging from black to light brown. There are some tribes of very big people; and other tribes described as pygmies. In the far interior of the mainland of New Guinea, within :L few hundred miles of each other, there are people (discovered only in the 'thirties) almost as fair us Nordics, and there are the queer little of the Indonesians and in doing Kukukukus, jungle nomads, under four feet in height. The fact that there are scores of different languages, has created a special administrative problem. I quote those statements because, quite obviously, honourable members opposite when they speak not only of the people of New Guinea, but also of the peoples of other islands in the Pacific area, have an utterly unrealistic idea of what goes on in those areas and of the make-up of populations there. When one hears such cries as "" Indonesia for the Indonesians "", or "" Asia for the Asiatics "", and when honourable members like the honourable member for Parkes claimthat a white people can look after a black nation, one gets some notion of how unreal is the whole approach of such people to this matter. That brings me back to the point to Mr Holt. which I referred earlier, namely, the need for closest co-operation in these areas with other white peoples who have speaking, the New* Guinea interests to protect and resources to safeguard similar to our own. Whilst Australia controls approximately 90,000 square miles of Papua and 90,000 square miles of New Guinea, the Dutch hold about 180,000 square miles in what is known as Dutch New Guinea. Surely, our future interests in those areas are linked with those of the Dutch. If a threat to Australia arises in those areas it will be a threat also to the interests of the Dutch. If New Guinea is to be seized the Dutch will lose just as we shall.lose j and just as we have our problems of administration in New Guinea the Dutch have similar problems not only in New Guinea, but also in other parts of the Pacific. When we read the passages I have just quoted from the Pacific Islands Year Book, and realize how different are the native peoples in those areas and how they cannot hope to communicate with each other or hope to develop self-government within any measurable period, at least not in our life-time, why should we assume that conditions are so widely different in the areas controlled by the Dutch? I admit that the Polynesian people are more highly advanced and more readily capable of self-government; but it is suicidal folly for us to adopt the cause so to attack the interests of the Dutch in those areas. The sooner the Australian Government realizes that fact the better. I have made these comments because our present policy can only antagonize those whose interests lie with us. On the administrative level, we are trying to co-operate with them in bodies such as the South Pacific Commission, but on the political level we are giving them rebuff after rebuff. The policy is so clearly suicidal and stupid that I am certain that the people of Australia will not. support it indefinitely. The sooner the Government amends its policy and throws in our lot with those with whom our best interests lie, the sooner is our security likely to be safeguarded, and the development of the islands promoted. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [12.11]. -This bill is concerned with trusteeship, and in considering the legislation it is necessary for us, and for the people of Australia who are listening to the broadcast of the debate, to realize and remember that the purpose for which the nations came together was to maintain international peace, remove threats to peace, suppress acts of aggression or breaches of the peace and develop friendly relations among the nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights. But more than that, the nations came together for the purpose of solving problems of an economic, social and humanitarian character, and promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. In as much as this bill intends to carry out those purposes and principles, I must support it. I am opposed to the annexation of territories and the exploitation of native peoples that has followed annexation in the past. Such exploitation is occurring even now in certain of the Pacific territories. People who leave Australia to settle in the territories boast of the conditions under which they will live. We repeatedly hear such remarks as, "" There will not be much work to do, because there are plenty of servants, and they cost next to nothing "". New Guinea. Mrs. BLACKBURN -It does apply to New Guinea. honourable member should go there. New Guinea. Mrs. BLACKBURN -Yesterday I received a letter, and one extremely interesting paragraph in it has such abearing on the point which we are discussing that I shall read it to the House. It is as follows:She o ire red to lend me her cook, purchased had the opportunity to spend some time when twelve years of age hy a postal official in New Guinea recently, and I believe and "" loaned"" to any friend who promised that the experience which I gained of to return her as arranged, without any wages"" Oh, that would spoil her for us if you paid her the country and the people during that any wages "". [30] When such things happen, is it any wonder that we read of revolts in the islands and other territories of the East? In considering this bill, we should regard as paramount the interests of the inhabitants of the territories, including measures to provide for their just treatment and protection against abuses. At present, our hands are none too clean. We have offended against the native peoples. We still offend against the aboriginals of Australia. Our treatment of them cannot be called just. They are constantly subject to abuses. Perhaps we now have a better plan for Papua and New Guinea, which will come under trusteeship supervision, and the prospects for the people of those territories may be improved. I am not interested in the use or development of the territories as buffers for defence purposes. There is too much talk of defence and prospective wars. There is too much talk of war, too little talk of peace, and too little preparation for living together and learning to respect human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all peoples and all races. There is too much of the attitude of mind that brings about war. In this debate, great emphasis has been laid by Opposition speakers upon what may happen to us. Some attention has been given to the wealth of the territories under discussion, but little regard has does not apply to been paid to the welfare of the native peoples, whom the white people have used as servants and often ruthlessly exploited. If this bill is the means of freeing even some of those native peoples, it will be a step in the right direction, and, therefore, I support the measure. I am convinced that security for such people is necessary to ultimate world peace. In common with the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) who spoke last night, I , through the courtesy of the Minister for the Army{ Mr Chambers), visit entitles me to offer some comment",24,Second Reading

107,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [12.17].,"upon this bill. I shall begin by examining the so-called justification for the introduction of the measure, which provides for handing over the Territory of New Guinea to the trusteeship of the United Nations. If I interpret the remarks of the Minister correctly, it is contended that the justification for this action rests in the principles underlying the formation of the United Nations and the methods which have been decided on to realize them. The principles, briefly, are that all peoples, no matter what their condition may be, should, have the right ultimately to self-determination, and that any dominance of the weaker or undeveloped people by stronger peoples should be only to the extent and for the purpose of the development of those weaker peoples to the point where they will be able to govern themselves. Those principles will be carried out by the allocation of mandates to certain members of the United Nations, which undertake to conform to certain definite standards laid down in the Charter of that organization. As I understand the position, that is the justification for the introduction of this bill. But we should remember that many members of the United Nations are not particularly welldisposed towards Australia, to say the least of it. When we study the bill, we are. immediately impressed with the fact that we propose to place the ultimate determination-no t the immediate determination, certainly-of our own policy in relation to those two territories in the hands of a body on which are represented many nations that have little time for our way of life or our plans for the defence of our country. Those members will have the final voice in deciding certain matters of vital importance to Australia. Therefore I feel that, howevery strong the theoretical arguments put forward in support of this bill may be, the fact remains that it proposes that Australia shall surrender certain rights, which amounted almost to sovereign rights, in the territories before World War II . at the demand of a body which, however magnificent it may be in theoretical conception, nevertheless, up till now, has shown itself to be most innocuous and certainly not capable of standing as a bulwark to Australia. The question that if r . Davifl-ftnv. must arise in the minds of people who apply themselves to the problem is: Are we to support to the limit the theoretical conception behind the United Nations at the possible expense of the safety of Australia ? Obviously a very serious risk to Australia is entailed. I believe that honourable members on both sides of the House will concede that the territories of Papua and New Guinea represent the forward defence lines of Australia, commonly known in military parlance as FDL's. Is it not a fact that within recent weeks the Government has defended its attitude towards Manus Island on the ground that that base is essential to the defence of Australia? Did not the Government reply to certain critics who said that some arrangement should have been made with the United States by saying that it was the task of this country to develop that area for itself because it was essential to the defence of Australia? Has it not even referred to Manus from time to time as ""the Scapa Plow of Australia""? We must ask ourselves how far we can go in the development of defence bases such as that in our forward defence lines if our decisions are to be subject to the final approval of a body on which there are representatives of nations holding views very much at variance with our views on fundamental matters. In dealing with that question the Minister for Defence contended that we were protected by Article4 of the Fourth Schedule to the bill. That article statesThe Administering Authority will be responsible for the peace, order, good government and defence of the Territory. . . . The article has been carefully phrased to state "" defence of the territory"", not "" defence of Australia "". Article1 of the Fourth Schedule also statesThe Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considersdesirable to provide for the defence of the Territory aud for maintenance of international peace and security. Are our measures for the development of those forward defence lines of Australia to stop short at the measures that are necessary simply for the defence of the territory itself? As I envisage the defence cf Australia and the use of our territories for defence, I envisage something much more than would be necessary simply for iocal defence in the territories. I cannot imagine that certain members of the United Nationsi f they are to have the final decision in the matter will sit idly by and allow Australia to build up forward bases and develop the area as it should be developed. In commenting on the Opposition's attitude to the trusteeship, certain supporters of the Government have introduced the question of annexation. I reply to them by stating that the Opposition's attitude does not necessarily involve annexation. I believe that the policy which should be pursued can well be carried out under a system similar to rhat which previously existed in Papua and New Guinea. The Minister for Defence stated bluntly last night in this House that he would not agree to the annexation of any territory. That may appear to be a very fine concept, particularly when it is thundered out within the security of the walls of this chamber. But it would be an entirely different matter if, as the result of the pursuance of that policy in years to come, Australians, including women and children, were forced to die on our own soil. Then it might be realized that the question of annexation is only a minor matter in relation to the greater question of Australian security. I state clearly that I am prepared to take any step that U consider to be necessary to ensure the security of Australia, for that places upon can be aimed at us. That capacity arises us a greater obligation than does any wider and more indefinite concept. The Opposition's attitude has been criticized by some honourable members as being, in some indefinable way, in opposition to the White Australia policy. I dismiss that criticism briefly by stating that I cannot see how the application of our policy to those territories would be any greater infringement of the White Australia policy than is the operation of that policy in Australia itself, where we have an aboriginal population. Certain honourable members contend that various provisions of the hill are very desirable from the point of view of the development bf the territories as they should be developed and that therein lies a second justification for the measure. But is there anything in the bill that is desirable for the development of the territories that could not be carried out without Australia handing over the ultimate control of the territories to some outside body? Let us examine the situation. Provision is made in the bill for the establishment of a legislative council, an executive council, advisory councils for native affairs, native village councils, a public service and a judicial system. There is nothing in the world to prevent us from going ahead with those proposals if we consider that they are all necessary -and I do not agree that they are-unde r the existing system. We could implement those proposals for the benefit of the territories generally without placing ourselves in a position in which we must report to an outside body every year and seek approval of our actions. I refer now to the defence value of New Guinea to Australia. It is particularly important that there should be a full realization of that value. Prom time to time, we are told that the territories are essential to the defence of Australia, but I doubt whether the full importance of their defence value is generally appreciated. The right honourable member fo>North Sydney( Mr Hughes) last night referred to New Guinea as a "" buffer"" for Australia. I cannot think of a more fitting term than that. World War II . provided us with a striking example of the capacity of the areas that we are discussing to absorb the strongest blows that from the fact that the terrain of New Guinea generally provides the finest type of defence that any country could wish for. It provides an infinitely better type of defence than anything that we could develop by our own work. The type of the terrain in New Guinea and Papua, the complete lack of communications, the diseases that are rampant there, and the almost total absence of local food supplies contributed, in my opinion, at least equally with our own feats of arms to the early Japanese defeats. That remark is not intended in any way to belittle the magnificent efforts made by our own men early in the New Guinea campaign. Anybody who has been in the territory knows that the factors that 3 have enumerated had a very material bearing upon the early Japanese defeats and afforded us a breathing space in which to marshal our full forces to throw the enemy hack. In many instances, the mountains and the jungles defeated the Japanese. The enemy was unable to stand up to conditions in the territory, whereas our men were not beaten by those conditions. That fact, in conjunction with the far superior fighting qualities of our men, enabled us to win the struggle. The fact that in the early stages of the New Guinea campaign thi9 buffer was sufficient to take all of the sting from the initial Japanese attacks shows clearly the great importance to us from the defence viewpoint of the terrain of the country. If that fact of itself is not sufficient to justify the retention hy Australia of complete control of the development of the area, I do not know what is. There are other lessons to be learned from the experiences of the la9t war which emphasize the need to retain our control of New Guinea. The Japanese made many mistakes in their campaigns hut perhaps the greatest of them was their action in committing their troops to the jungles, swamps and mountains of New Guinea by their landings at Rabaul, Buna, Salamaua and Lae with the intention to force a passage across New Guinea to Port Moresby. By so doing they committed themselves to the task of overcoming a great obstacle to the success of their plans. It was one which they would have by-passed if they had known the true position. Milne Bay lies at the south-eastern end of New Guinea. It has a magnificent harbour and is an ideal site for a base. At the time when the Japanese made their first landings on New Guinea they could have walked into Milne Bay without a shot being fired, because we had neither men nor rifles with which to defend it. It was only later, when the Japanese tactics became apparent, that, just in time, we stationed men there to defend it. Had the Japanese not made the mistake of committing their troops to the difficulties of the mountains and jungles of New Guinea and they had established themselves immediately in Milne Bay, their next step would have been a landing at Townsville, because it would have been possible for them completely to by-pass Port Moresby, in which event our troops and fortifications there would have been Mr Davidson. of no value to us. Had the Japanese followed that course, there would have heen no names in the history of the war such as the Kokoda Trail, Buna, Salamaua, Lae and Rabaul. Instead, Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane and Sydney would have appeared in it. Using Milne Bay as a base, the Japanese would have heen able to attack the eastern coast of Australia with bomber aircraft and to launch ""a major attack upon it. Because of the Japanese tactics, New Guinea acted as a buffer. The enemy spent his force in its jungles and mountains. The territory could, however, have been an advanced enemy base from which the eastern cost of Australia could have been attacked. I believe that that will be the role assigned to New Guinea in any future conflict in which we are engaged, if an attack upon us comes from the north, as it is likely to do. That mistake, having been made once, will not be made again. Never again shall we have the advantage of the jungles and mountains of New Guinea acting as a buffer. On the contrary, the territory will be used by an enemy as a jumping-off place for attack on this continent unless we retain our right to prepare !N ew Guinea for the defence of Australia, not only for the defence of the territory itself, to a degree that will enable us completely to deny the whole of the territory to an enemy. In spite of specious arguments to the effect thai the bill does not deny us our rights in New Guinea, that we may still proceed with defence preparations there, with work on Manus Island and so on, it cannot be denied that, under the terms of the bill, we shall not be permitted to develop the territory to the stage that is essential for our defence. I regard the measure as the final act of madness of the Government in its attitude towards our northern neighbours. Our policy in Indonesia has alienated a most powerful friend, and there is a likelihood that in the near future a potential. enemy will be substituted for that powerful friend. In Japan we have recently thrown away the right, earned by our soldiers' feats of arms, to have an effective voice in the decisions that have yet to be made regarding the future of Japan. The Korean situation is becoming worse every day. It threatens to boil over very shortly and possibly to involve tbe whole of the Far East. Communism is growing in Japan. Recently the startling information was published that at the recent elections in Japan one in every ten Japanese voted for communism. That is the situation that is developing to the north of us, but the Government has reduced our forces in that area to a negligible quantity. I suppose that the reason for so doing was that it was believed that we could always rely upon the United States of America, but that country, for good reasons of its own, is reducing the strength of its armed forces in Japan and thereby creating grave difficulties for Australia. Recently a senior officer of the United States of America occupation forces in Japan saidYou Aussies have not been much help, but you will probably kick about the fall in American occupation strength. We have always believed that we could rely on at least one Australian Division in the zone of 20,000 square miles you technically control. Now we learn there are only 2,000 Australians here, plus one air squadron. That is the position which has developed, as a consequence of the Government's policy, in an area to the north of Australia which is of vital importance to us. Acting as though its policy in regard to Indonesia and Japan had not done sufficient damage, the Government has brought down a measure which must, in my opinion, seriously undermine our capacity to develop our forward defence lines, as represented by the territories of Papua and New Guinea. I condemn the bill completely. -This bill cannot be considered apart from strategic considerations and the foreign policy of this country. The measure first makes provision for approval to be given to the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system. It then provides for the establishment of an administrative union of the territories of Papua and New Guinea. Provision is then made for the establishment of administrative machinery and for the vesting of substantial executive and administrative power in the administrator. Then there are clauses dealing with the establishment of an Executive Council, advisory councils for native matters and native village councils. Provision is also made for the establishment of a public service and, by means of a Legislative Council, for the law-making body of the joint territory. I do not think that there can be much argument against the general provisions of this bill, Most of them are already incorporated in legislation. For example, the terms of the measure relating to administration,, the Executive Council and the Legislative Council, are to be found in principle, although in different form, in preceding legislation. The only two new matters with which the bill deals-apar t from placing New Guinea under the trusteeship -ar e the establishment of the Advisory Councils for Native Matters and the Native Village Councils, which will deal with local affairs, but only in the sense that they will advise the administration upon matters affecting the welfare of the natives. That, if I may say so, is a good provision in itself, but it is only a minor matter in the complete picture that this bill presents. Similarly, the establishment of a special school to aid the administration of that area is praiseworthy, but none the less of minor importance. The attack on this bill, therefore, must he within a small compass namely, whether the Government should ever have permitted the placing of New Guinea under international trusteeship. That is the real gist of the attack, and upon it much has been said by previous speakers which I do not wish to repeat. I shall satisfy myself with a few preliminary observations on the matter. First, it is my conviction that the map of the world is now being re-drawn and that the strategic considerations affecting the world must now be recast. To-day, we are confronted by a march of events in Asia which will condition the affairs of the world for at least 50 years. At one time, it was said that the affairs of the world were determined in Europe, and that in truth was so even up to the outbreak of World War II . ; but now the centre of gravity of world affairs has shifted to the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and what will take place in the world to-morrow is being determined by events in those areas to-day. It is not sufficiently realized that the tremendous upsurge that has taken place.",26,Second Reading

So, in this bill, we are directing our attention, quiteproperly, to the provisions which place New Guinea under the control-becaus e that ultimately is what it means-of the United Nations. I have stated, on more than one occasion, my approach to the United Nations, and I need not recapitulate it now. I have charged the Government, and I charge it again now, that, in its approach to strategicmatters and to international affairs generally, it loses all sense of what it should do by being carried away by ideology. The truth is that we have given the Territory of New Guinea away for all time, and in dealing with a subject-matter so intimately connected with our foreign policy, we should realize that the principal obligation of a. parliament is to provide for the foreseeable future. Sitting suspended from 12-43 to 2.15 p.m. engage in philosophical thinking, but sequences for Australia. whilst our approach to this matter cannot be divorced from such thinking, none the less our primary aim should be, by honourable members on this side of the our collective wisdom as a parliament House spoke about the dangers to our and by the utilization of all our resources, White Australia policy that are inherent so to direct policy as to ensure that in in the countries to the north of us, of the foreseeable future this country shall which New Guinea is one. I cite, as an be kept free from aggression. That example of the complete lack of reality seems to me hardly to require stating, but of the Minister for External Affairs, the apparently it has to be stated and reoccasion when he quoted an alleged stated, particularly as far as the Minister statement by the Prime Minister of India. for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) is conPandit Nehru, as being, in effect, _ in cerned, for the great tragedy is that support of the White Australia policy. the foreign policy of this country Less than 4S hours had elapsed before has been over-weighted by one man that statement by the Minister was contrawhose feet are not on the ground of dicted by the Prime Minister of India. reality and who, in the pursuit of his goal Either the Minister had misunderstood of internationalism, appears to forget Pandit Nehru's statement or, for the completely the vital interests of Auspurposes of argument in this House, had tralia. The fact that our foreign policy pretended to misunderstand it. Only iu is a one-man policy was evidenced only the light of events in Asia can we see yesterday when the Prime Minister( Mr the true significance of the Trusteeship Chifley) was asked whether a statement Agreement which is a part of the schedule would be made to this House dealing with a subject-matter to which the Minister for External Affairs, apart from a reference to Indonesia, had given no attention whatever in his speech. The subject-matter to which I refer is what is taking place in Asia now and its tremendous significance to this country. In reply to that question the Prime Minister said that no statement would be made at the moment and that he would make one when he thought fit. That means that the Prime Minister will make no statement at all. It is quite obvious that, apart from one or two honourable members, nobody on the Government side takes any real interest in foreign affairs. It is significant indeed that in this debate only a few Ministers and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) have made speeches from the Government side. One member after another on the Opposition side of the chamber has spoken during the debate but they have induced no further contribution to the debate from the Government side. It is a very serious reflection on the Government that the conduct of the foreign policy of this country should be left entirely in the hands of one man, and that because of his solitary actions the Government should have committed the country to a trusteeship that, I venture to say, will During the course of a recent debate,",30,Second Reading
109,Mr Spender,"It is one thing to in the end prove to have serious conio this bill. When the trusteeship system was first considered at the San Francisco conference, Australia took a leading part in the discussion. The view then advanced by Australia was that trusteeship should go even beyond what is at present contained in the Charter which, as the briefest examination will show, goes far enough. But when the Charter was finally approved there was no obligation upon this country to enter into a deed of trusteeship concerning New Guinea, and if, in fact, it did propose to enter into such a deed, there was no fixed form of deed; it was to be a matter for negotiation. Therefore, I hold the Minister for External Affairs personally responsible for the Government's having entered into this agreement, for which there was no justification whatever, as an examination will reveal. I do not desire to be misunderstood, but 1 am not one who does not believe that we owe a very distinct and wide obligation to the natives of Papua and New Guinea. None of us who remember the days of the last war will deny that we have a moral obligation to promote the welfare of these people and, in a wide sense, to act as trustees on their behalf. But under the terms of this deed of trusteeship we no longer exercise any sovereign power over this territory. We are merely administering it, drawing our authority from the United Nations. I should have thought that there was a distinct conflict of interest between the Charter and Australia's vital interest in New Guinea. Papua and New Guinea are quite distinct from any other trust territories concerning which similar agreements have been made. New Guinea, we should remember here and now, is of vital significance to the future maintenance of the security of this country. It was only when the Japanese, through sacrifice and a great expenditure of blood, had been driven back from the vicinity of Port Moresby that any relief was felt about the safety of this country in the last war. What appeared then to be a very imminent danger, and one that we faced for the first time in our history, can threaten us again. Is there any one in this House who will deny that? While such a possibility exists, and while we have not sovereign control over this vital strategic area of New Guinea, the Government, by having entered into this agreement, has been guilty not only of foolishness but also of grave dereliction of duty. Under the Charter, there was no moral obligation to enter into the agreement. Article 77 of the Charter provides that the trusteeship system shall apply tb territories that are within certain categories and in respect of which agreements were subsequently made. We all know that an agreement was made and was brought before this Parliament for what was in effect ""rubber stamp"" approval. The Minister for External Affairs, together with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), who seem to have been aiding and abetting him in this matter, made these arrangements without any prior consultation with the Parliament. We should not have entered into this trusteeship agreement until the whole matter had been debated in this House. The House was presented with an agreement merely for formal acceptance. It seems to me important to draw attention to the different approach that was made to this problem by the United States of America. Under this trusteeship agreement we have surrendered ail sovereign control of the Territory of New Guinea. We have said that it is now a trusteeship territory, which means that we are merely the trustee for it. Trustee on behalf of whom? Not on behalf of ourselves, although we have vital strategic interests there, but on behalf of the United Nations, and obligated to carry out the objectives set forth in the Charter. I should have thought that it was axiomatic that, whilst we have a distinct obligation that we must perform to the indigenous population of New Guinea, we have nonetheless, as a white people, an overriding interest to ensure that our stragetic interests shall be maintained in that territory. We have delivered these interests to the United Nations because, under Article2 of the agreement, we are merely the designated authority to exercise the administration of the territory. True, we have powers of legislation and administrative ""jurisdiction over it, as if it were "" an integral part of our t e r r it o r y "" ; but these words were introduced -just as a matter of form following attacks that were made upon the agreement by the Russian representatives at the United Nations.

111,Mr Spender,"Unquestionabl y it lesson that we learned during the recentconsider the matters that I have stressed against the background of current events in Asia, the possible consequences to this country become self-evident. As I pointed out before the suspension of the sitting, the centre of gravity in world affairs has diifted from Europe to South-East Asia, and the catastrophic events that have occurred in that area in recent times have a very direct bearing upon the security of this country. To-morrow, or ten years hence, New Guinea may well become of vital consequence to the people of Australia. Every action taken by the present Government along the road of ""internationalism "", as the Government chooses to term its policy, has carried us farther from security. Western influence is diminishing in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It has been withdrawn from India and Burma, and it remains in Malaya only in a truncated form. in the Netherlands East Indies has been reduced to a minimum, and in the South Pacific region we are the only remaining white race. By its policy the present Government has virtually conferred on certain peoples, including some who have never fought for liberty and others who, even to-day, are destroying liberty, the ultimate direction and control of an area that is vital to our security. the policy of the present Government with the realistic policy adopted by the United States of America. Of course, I realize that the word "" realistic "" agreement, with the terms of which we is disregarded by supporters of the Government, who adopt the view that the application of a ""realistic"" policy is not -' quite cricket"". In their view we should never be quite realistic about anything. However, I was about to point out that the Americans, who to-day, have the prime responsibility for maintaining peace, at least in this part of the world, were not prepared to enter into international agreements of the kind to which we have become a party. They stated that rhey were prepared to place enemy territories which had come into their possession during the war under international trusteeship, but only on the condition that they retained control of strategic areas and could decide who would be permitted to inspect those territories. They realized the importance to the security of the western coast of their country of the Pacific islands which they had occupied during the war. By contrast, the Australian Government appears utterly to have failed to realize the importance of New Guinea to the security of this country. It is quite clear that Australia need not have entered into a trusteeship agreement in respect of New Guinea. We could have declined to do so because the area is of special significance to Australia; and no one could have denied our right to hold that view. Of course, the present Government did not adopt that attitude. We could have discharged our obligations to the natives of the territory just as effectively as similar obligations are discharged in other British dominions, and ultimately we could have The authority of Holland given the self-government. However, [ stress the fact that the purpose of the trusteeship agreement was not to provide for the defence of New Guinea or of Australia, but to have the subject territory administered in such a fashion that it could ultimately be handed over to the natives to govern. I should have thought that the implementation of any such plan was primarily a matter for Australia, the Compare nation that is most competent to decide when and how such a process ought to be accomplished. However, the pass has been completely sold by the trusteeship all are now acquainted. Nevertheless, I point out that even had we decided to enter into a trusteeship agreement we need not have entered into such an agreement as that which Ave actually made; we could have made an agreement similar in form to that made by the United States of America. I repeat that we have sold the pass, and have handed over to an international body the Territory of New Guinea, for which Australian men and women died only a few years ago. Even if supporters of the Government regard the agreement into which the Government entered as a discharge of its paramount obligation to defend this country, I cannot imagine that the people of Australia take such a view. Undoubtedly the Government made the agreement in pursuance of the international objective of the United Nations and on the assumption that that organization was quite capable of maintaining the peace of the world. Of course, if that hypothesis be correct, all by experience. that has beeu said by honourable members on this side of the House is beside the point. I agree that if the United Nations can maintain the peace of the world no purpose can be gained by criticizing the present arrangement: on the contrary, it should be supported. But until it has been shown that the United Nations can preserve peace we should not surrender any of our sovereignty in this part of the world. The question then arises, what could the Government have done as an alternative? to establish in the Pacific and Indian Oceans a counterpart of the North Atlantic Pact. Such nations as India, Pakistan, the Netherlands East Indies, Burma, and the United States of America have a common interest in the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Why did not the Minister for External Affairs, and the Minister for Defence-wh o has a peculiar obligation in this matter-direc t more of their energies to serving the vital interests of Australia by seeking to develop such a nebulous pact instead of trying to pursue their ideologies? I believe that the interests of Australia can was an Asiatic power, Japan, which poshe best served by the making of a Pacificsessed the third most powerful navy in Indian Ocean pact consisting of nations * with a common interest and bound together to ensure peace. opposite attacked the ANZAC Pact.

One of the most fascinating things about the present members of His Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament is that one can never tell from their actions while, they compose the Government what they will advocate when they are the Opposition. From 1919 to 1941, except for a brief interval during which the Scullin Government was in power, anti-Labour governments administered New Guinea as a mandated territory under an arrangement which deprived Australia of the righj; to fortify it. shall have something to say about that later. At the moment, I am discussing how members of the Opposition behaved when they were the government. They are now pretending that the arrangement agreed to for the administration of New Guinea destroys Australia's sovereignty over that territory. They ignore the fact that in Article 22 of the Mandate it i * made perfectly clear that the League of It could have sought Nations had sovereignty over Ne"" Guinea, and conferred that sovereignty under mandate on His Britannic Majesty. Under the trusteeship, the old mandate system has been greatly strengthened, and I propose to quote sections of the agreement which make this clear. Nevertheless, honourable members opposite protest that something has been done which threatens Australia's sovereignty. Let u> look at the chacarteristics of the period in which honourable members opposite were prepared to accept the mandatisystem that denied them the right to fortify New Guinea. In those days thenthe world. It could concentrate in the Pacific a stronger navy than could either Britain or the United States of America. To-day, there is no Asiatic power with a navy equal to the Australian Navy. The second characteristic is that, when the mandate system was in operation, Japan was in possession of islands as far south as the equator, and it was widely known that it did not observe the mandate requirement which forbade the establishment of naval, military or air bases. Yet honourable members opposite accepted the mandate system then, and condemn the present arrangement now, although, instead of Japan being in possession of the islands stretching down to the equator, those islands are in the possession of the United States of America. Moreover, there is no Asiatic power left with a navy worthy of the name, and the United States of America possesses all the bases between Australia and Janan. In",33,Second Reading

Let us study the nature of the trusteeship which is supposed to endanger our safety and our sovereignty. Article4 of the schedule, which sets out the trusteeship follows:The Administering Authority w ill be responsible for the peace, order, good government and defence of the Territory and for this purpose will have the same powers of legislation, Administration and jurisdiction in and over the Territory as if it were an integral part of Australia, and will be entitled to apply to the Territory, subject to such modifications as it deems desirable, sueli laws of the Commonwealth of Australia as it deems appropriate to the needs and conditions of the Territory. For the life of me I cannot see the difference between such an arrangement and complete sovereignty over a colonial territory except that-and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) became very excited about this last night-w e are obliged to furnish reports to nations some of which might be considered backward. countries which I consider are backward. clude the United States of America, which on other occasions the honourable member seems to regard as forward, so his objections are not very real. Article7 of the agreement emphasizes the defence -system. It statesThe Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory and for maintenance of international peace and security. Thus, the trustee nation may take all measures which it deems desirable for the defence of the territory. Yet we are told that the trusteeship system will permit of endless espionage and the undermining of our sovereignty! As to where real sovereignty will reside, let us consider the oath which the administrator will be required to take. It is in this formI do swear that I will well and truly serve our Sovereign Lord the King in the office of Administrator (or Acting Administrator, or 15eputy Administrator) of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, and I will do right to all manner of people according to law. without fear or favour, affection or ill w ill; So help ine God! It will be seen that the administrator swears allegiance, not to the United Nations, but to the King, which is a clear recognition of the King's sovereignty. The agreement also provides that the administering authority shall take into consideration the customs and agreement, is as usages of the inhabitants of Nen Guinea, and respect the rights and saft guard the interests both present ant future, of the indigenous inhabitants of the territory. It is further provided that the administering authority shall promote, as may be appropriate to the circumstances of the territory, the educational and cultural advancement of the inhabitants. Certain other guarantees are included for the protection of the natives, and no one who is worthy of membership of this Parliament would deny those guarantees. Certainly, the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Spender), to do birn justice, did not attempt to do so. Stress has been laid, upon what honourable members opposite have described as the realism of South Africa, which has been held up for our admiration, in virtually having annexed the former German territory of South-West Africa. Field Marshal Smuts was, more than anybody else, the author of the mandate system, which was a compromise between the Wilsonian idea of peace without annexation and the idea of total annexation which was pressed at Versailles by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The honourable member for Barker admires that plea for total annexation. The right honourable member for North Sydney, however. did not annex the territory and so his verbal frenzies at conferences are of very little importance by comparison with his acceptance of the territory under mandate with all the limitations on our rights to fortify it that were laid down in the mandates system of 1919. What he said amounts to little by comparison with what he did. The compromise in the mandates system was between the Hughesian point of view of annexation and the Wilsonian idea of peace without annexation, and Smuts was its chief author. Yet Smuts was the first statesman to be condemned by the Mandates Commission for the way",35,Second Reading

In the course of a native rising at Bondelsat all to do with defence but everything warts and Bull Hoek many natives were killed. After the rising the Mandates Commission condemned South Africa for the way in which it had administered the mandate. That, of course, was a crucial point in respect of which South Africans of Dutch origin are most sensitive. After all, the whole conflict between the British' and the Dutch in South Africa up to the time of the Boer ""War had to a large degree turned on the Afrikaaner attitude towards the natives. When an Afrikaaner talks about imperialism he does not use the term in the sense that Communists and other people of that kind would. The Afrikaaner has in his mind the central doctrine of Cecil Rhodes'3 thought that there should be equality for all civilized men regardless of their colour. The British hoped that their point of view would triumph in South Africa and that a more liberal attitude towards the natives would result. It never did. Condemnation of the administration of their native affairs policy in South-west Africa is a very sensitive point with South Africans. The reasons why South Africa is annexing, or is taking steps which virtually mean the annexation of, South-west Africa have nothing to do with defence. Is it seriously suggested that any South African to-day fears Germany in any circumstances? Of course not. It would be impossible for South Africa to pursue in its neighbouring territory a more liberal policy than it follows in its own. One of its serious objections is that Great Britain, which administers the protectorates of Bechuanaland and Swaziland, pursues a policy that is better than that of South Africa and is thus provocative of unrest natives. The honest carrying out of the terms of the mandate in South-west Africa would be provocative of unrest among South Africa's own natives. The South African Government could not subscribe to all these declarations about what it would do for the natives and then not carry out the spirit of those declarations in its own territory. Let us have done with all this rubbish about South Africa annexing South-west Africa solely for Mr Beazley. defence reasons. Its action has nothing to do with its internal colour problem. I want to deal with the statement that instead of accepting a mandate or trusteeship, we should annex the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, thus giving us the icomplete right to fortify and to administer it as though it were an integral part of the Commonwealth. In defending their suggestion that the territory should be annexed honourable members opposite have chosen completely to ignore the international repercussions that annexation would entail. We have been told that the United States of America has been far morc realistie than we have, but I point out that the United States has not annexed any territories. It has accepted a trusteeship of the Carolines, the Ladrones, the Marianas and other islands. Our annexation of New Guinea, as advocated by the honourable member for Barker, would cause the most serious embarrassment to all the western powers. It would bt merely playing into the hands of thost who, in trying to win the allegiance of people's minds in Europe, spend their time representing the western powers asimperialistic and devoid of any sincere intention to bring about international co-operation. Annexation would add exactly nothing to our rights in this trusteeship territory because we already have a complete right to fortify it, to take whatever measures we deem fit for its defence and to administer it as though it were an integral part of the Commonwealth of Australia. On the contrary, there is everything to recommend the procedure whereby we are to report to some international body on the native policy we pursue there. In the working of the mandate system during the period among the South African between the two wars it was usual for the powers represented on the Mandates Commission to appoint to the commission the very best colonial administrators at their disposal.

121,Mr Beazley,"Lord Lugard's comits mandate over Samoa, of South Africa's administration of its mandate over South-West Africa, and of the administration of other mandated territories had a most important influence in bringing about reforms in native policy and in improving the methods by which those territories were administered. There is no reason to suppose that the powers represented on the Trusteeship Council will not continue to appoint experts from their own colonial administrations to examine from time to time the reports that are submitted to it. These reports that will deal in the main with the methods by which the trust has heen earned out as far as the people in the trust territories are concerned. There is no difference between placing the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system and colonialism except the obligation to report which throws on the administering power the onus of striving always to carry out a native policy of the highest possible standard. It would have been a very good thing for the Australian aborigines had we been obliged to report from tune to time on our treathad forgotten events that had occurred ment of them to some commission of experts in colonial administration. It might have been a good thing for the States, which are responsible for certain territories, and for the Commonwealth, which is responsible for the Northern Territory, had such an obligation existed. For the last 30 or 40 years, in such circumstances our native affairs .policy might have been vastly better than it is to-day. I do not suggest that such a reform should take place. The aborigines of Australia come within our sole jurisdiction. I merely say that the obligation to report to an international body which we accept under the trusteeship system makes for improvements in native affairs policy. respect of Papua notwithstanding that we do not hold that territory under mandate. was perhaps fortunate in having the -services of one of our most capable administrators, one who would rank with Lord Lugard in colonial administration, hut that is not true of all the territories Charter of the United Nations, the coununder our control. Obligations that arise from the trusteeship system are those which the Australian Government should readily accept. I repeat that nothing in this proposal endangers our safety or derogates from our .sovereignty except the obligation to report. The destruction of that obligation would give rise to the suspicion that we dared not have the searchlight of international opinion and inspection on our native policy, and would play right into the hands of those who are trying to represent us as imperialists, as well as others who are endeavouring to appeal to Asiatic sentiment by representing us as reactionary on colour questions. -The purpose of this bill is to approve the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system, and to provide for the government of the Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), who defended the bill, submitted that members of the Opposition when the political parties which they support governed the country, and the League of Nations assigned New Guinea to Australia under the mandate system. . He pointed out that, under that arrangement, we were forbidden to fortify the mandated islands, and contended that the Government that was responsible for accepting the mandate under those conditions had sacrificed the interests of Australia. What he did not say was that every country that accepted a mandate had to agree to the conditions relating thereto as laid down by the League of Nations. A country either refused a mandate or accepted the conditions accompanying it. Consequently, if Australia desired to take over the Territory of New Guinea, it had to accept the conditions in the Covenant of the League of Nations. That position had entirely altered at the end of World War II . The League of Nations had ceased to exist, and Australian forces had won the Territory of New Guinea from the Japanese army.

The honourable member for Fremantle stated that such an action would have had a bad effect throi ghout the whole of the eastern world. Later in my speech I shall deal more fully with that matter. The second course is the one envisaged in tins bill, and the third is the one that the of America and the British Empire. We Government of the United States of America adopted in respect of the former Japanese mandates to the north of Australia. The honourable member for Fremantle has stated that, in his opinion, the agreement that Australia proposes to adopt entitles us to make provision for the. defence of the islands. Why, then, did the United States of America make another kind of agreement that enabled it to proclaim certain strategic areas, and, to-day is equivalent to Japan's naval for security reasons, prevent the entry of unauthorized persons. We are told that we are entitled to erect fortifications and defence buildings, and construct aerodromes in the territory that we place under the control of the Trusteeship Council; but what the honourable member for Fremantle did not mention was that every member State on the Trusteeship Council definitely would have the right to send its representatives to inspect our defences in the territory. That is the great difference between the agreement that 'the United States of America has made and that which Australia proposes to make. For that reason, we should strongly object to the Government's proposal. member want Manus Island to be taken of Milne Bay, they could have from the control of Australia ? matter in a few moments.

129,Mr Abbott,"No, I do not, but I doare to enter into any arrangement with the United Nations, the agreement should not be one whit weaker than the agreement that the United States of America has made for taking over the former Japanese mandates. It is all very well to say that we have sovereign rights over New Guinea, but Article 75 of the Charter of the United Nations establishes an authority for the administration and supervision of such territories as may be placed thereunder by subsequent individual agreements. instance, that the United Nations will supervise the manner in which we treat the native inhabitants. No one will deny that everything possible must be done to raise the standard of living and cultural level of those people. As the honourable member for Fremantle agrees, the Murray administration in Papua compared favourably with the administration of Lord Lugard in other colonial areas of the British Empire. Consequently there can be no suggestion that Australia would not rule this territory just as well if it as' may be necessary to ensure that the were exercising an unfettered authority as it would if it were tied down by the conditions of a trusteeship agreement. Although, in order not to offend the eastern peoples, it may have been desirable to place New Guinea under a trusteeship agreement, the agreement should not have been less strong than that under which the United States of America is now administering the ex-Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. That agreement was the first trusteeship agreement ro be signed. It was signed because the United States of America was in a position to say to the other nations which were members of the United Nations and which objected to its terms that if they did not like it they could reject it and the United States of America would annex the islands. That agreement was agreed to unanimously. Such a precedent having been established, why did we make the trusteeship agreement in respect of New American agreement? The agreement under which Australia is working provides that we are to be responsible to the General Assembly of the United Nations. But strategic area trusteeship agreements come within the jurisdiction of the Security Council. If a great Power objects to anything that the Security Council proposes to do, it may exercise its power of veto. Under a strategic area trusteeship agreement we should have been in a much stronger position than we are now. The honourable member for Fremantle referred to those who inspected mandates for the League of Nations. He explained how competent they were to do so and what authority their opinions carried throughout the world. The honourable gentleman did not, however, explain That means, for that the composition of the United Nations Trusteeship Council is very different from that of the comparable League of Nations organization. The Trusteeship Council is composed of member countries of the United Nations which are administering trust territories, of such of the members mentioned by name iu Article 23 of the Charter as are not administering trust territories, and of as many other members elected for a three years' term by the General Assembly total number of members of the council shall be equally divided between the member countries which administer trust territories and those which do not. It is composed of representatives of all kinds of nations, irrespective of whether or not those representatives are qualified to perform the important tasks that fall to them. The worse feature of the bill is that the agreement throws open our defence system and strategic bases to the north of Australia to inspection by powers which may eventually be hostile to us. It would be ridiculous to suggest that because the nations which are members of the Trusteeship Council are also members of the United Nations none of them may be enemies of Australia in the future. The representatives of the nations which are members of the Trusteeship Council will have the right to inspect our fortifications and bases in New Guinea. If some of those nations were eventually to become Guinea less strong than the involved in-a war against us, they would know what they were up against and could make the necessary preparations. That would be impossible under the terms of a strategic area trusteeship. The trusteeship agreement in respect of the Japanese mandated islands that were conquered by the United States of America, which was agreed to unanimously, provides that the Americans may specify certain areas as being closed for security reasons. ""While those areas are closed, there is no possibility of an enemy land, as was recommended by a obtaining information about the defences and fortifications which have been constructed in them. The Americans adopted a realistic attitude by insisting that the to the reply to a question that I addressed islands should be strategic assets and not to the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. liabilities. The ""United States of America Evatt), that was when the first formal is much farther away from a potential enemy than is Australia. If it was necesover of Manus Island to the United States sary for the Americans to insist upon such a strict trusteeship agreement in respect of this chain of islands, it was ten times more necessary that Australia should do the same in respect of New Guinea and that we should not have this watery agreement of which the Parliament is now asked to approve. The honourable member for Fremantle talked of the bringing of South-west Africa into the Union of South Africa, but I did not hear him mention the secret clause of the Yalta Agreement, signed in 1945, which gave the Kurile Islands to the Russians. Have the Russians made the Kuriles the subject of a trusteeship agreement and have the representatives of any member nations on the Trusteeship Council been allowed to inspect defences there? Australia mu3t adopt a realistic attitude. The Australian people must understand that we may in the future be fighting against one of the most powerful nations in the world and that, if that occurs, we shall not be able island to the greatest white power, the to fight successfully if all the nations which are members of the Trusteeship Council have been allowed to inspect our fortifications in New Guinea. What of Latvia., Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Roumania? Have we any right to go into those countries to see what is happening in them? Are there any trusteeship agreements in respect of them? Have they not been completely annexed and conquered by Soviet Russia? We must ensure that that shall not happen in respect of the islands to the north of Australia, which must be made as secure as possible. In the course of my speech, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr the building of huge runways for airHaylen) said that I had advocated the Mr Ahholt. transfer of the trusteeship of Manus Island from Australia to the United States of America. That the Americans should take over Manus Iscongressional naval sub-committee, was apparently suggested to the Australian Government in March, 1946. According negotiations commenced for the handing of America. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member must come back to New Guinea. to the bill refers to the north-eastern part of the island of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Admiralty Islands, and the outlying groups. Manus Island is one of the Admiralty Islands. I submit, therefore, that I am in order in referring to it. If the transfer of the trusteeship of Manus Island to the United States of America had been effected, and if the Americans had continued to maintain a great defence base there, adequately equipped with the necessary aircraft and other material for the defence of Australia, not one Australian would have objected to it. The Australian people generally would not have opposed our handing over of an United States of America, thereby interlocking that power into the defence potential of this country. Consequently, I regret, as I am sure the people of Australia will in the future, that the Government did not meet the request of the United States of America or the recommendations of the British chiefs of staffs. There were no military reasons why Manus should not have been handed over to America, and all the talk about what the island was before the last war is nonsense.

Government has accepted a mandate under the Trusteeship Council and also. I suppose as a corollary to the first argument, that the Government did not annex the whole of that mandated territory outright and make it a part of the Commonwealth of Australia. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) If we had allowed the last night spoke at great length. the chamber while I was speaking. ber tried the patience and tempers of other honourable members with long and allowed all the fortifications, tedious extracts from a book that he had recently bought, and the pages of which were turned for him by the party whip.

He even prided himself upon the discovery of a new principle-that the security of the nation was the supreme law, and that because of that law the Australian Government ought to annex the whole of this territory. J desire to make a few remarks upon the rather dangerous doctrine that the honourable member expressed. If it be right that a nation should annex any territory that it considers will be useful to it, or which it requires for its own future defence, where will aggression start and where will it finish ? The same argument of annexation as that advanced by the honourable member for Parramatta last night was advanced by Hitler when he seized Austria. Hitler used the word "" annexation"". The honourable member for Parramatta used it and gave himself an undeserved importance when he said, "" I am not afraid of the word annexation. I think that we ought to annex the territory."" It is wrong in this modern world to advocate such a principle. It is wrong to hold that nations should, because of considerations of their own, annex territories and make them portions of their, own national domain.

After World War I. we received from the League of Nations a mandate over what was then known as German New Guinea, an area which includes not only a part of the mainland of the island of New Guinea but also New Ireland, New Britain, Bougainville and the Admiralty Islands, the latter of which include Manus Island. Under that mandate we were empowered to do certain things, but we were also not permitted to do certain other things concerning the defence of the territory. Perhaps, because of our small population, nothing could have been done effectively to defend that area. Or perhaps more could have heen done had the provisions under which we were given the mandate not existed. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was Prime Minister of Australia at the time when mandates were agreed upon, did splendid work for Australia in acquiring for it the mandate over all the territory, south of the equator, that had 'belonged to Germany.

But the collapse future defence. To the south-east of of the League of Nations would not Bougainville there is a number of British justify our pursuing a policy of annexation. Carrying the argument to its logical conclusion, one could say that Australia ought to have the right to annex Dutch New Guinea because, under the Linggajati agreement and other agreements, the Dutch will eventually set up the Federated States of Indonesia, which will be a portion of the Dutch realm, but it will be the Indonesians and not the Dutch who will govern Dutch New Guinea and the rest of the Federated States. It may be argued, on defence grounds, that Dutch New Guinea in the hands of a republican government in Java, could be a real menace to the security of Australia and that, therefore, we ought to proceed, in the event of the Dutch surrendering their authority to the Indonesian Republic, to annex Dutch New Guinea. There is probably a very good argument, on defence grounds, in favour of Australia continuing to be in possession of places like Merauki, which was of great importance during the war and which, it could be argued, is essential to the defence of Darwin. It could be argued on the same grounds as those on which the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) have argued, that the Portuguese are not able to defend PortuPerhaps the right honourable guese Timor and that that territory ought to he included in the curtain of islands or defence apron in the north-western part of Australia and equally that Dutch Timor should be a part of ship Council of the United Nations might he asked at some stage to make Australia",42,Second Reading

142,Mr Calwell,"I am importingislands entirely undefended because Britain bas no navy in tbe Pacific to-day. They were undefended before the war. They were even less defended than were Eabaul and certain other territories when ""World War II . commenced. So it may be argued, if there is any validity in the contention regarding annexation of the Territory of New Guinea, that Australia should take possession of those British islands in order that Australia may be defended. It could be argued that Fiji, which is completely defenceless and in which Europeans are in a hopeless minority, might be handed over to some '-ountry that could defend it and that its occupation by the United States of America, by purchase, trusteeship or some other form of authority, would contribute to the defence of Australia. It could also be argued that certain other islands belonging to Britain or to some other power, or a part of the mandated territory which America now has north of the Equator, might be included in a defensive belt. If we intend to talk about the defence of Australia we ought to talk about it quite distinct from the provisions of this bill, which, as the acting Minister has said, proposes to -set up a single administrative authority without disturbing the international legal position in regard to the northern part of it. Papua, remains a part of A us tralian territory. The other part is non occupied by Australia under mandate from the Trusteeship Council, but the two territories will be administered as one unit.

The third argument that I advance is this : If we do not act with the United Nations, but depreciate i u authority so early in its history, and other nations follow our bad example in that regard, it will not be long before the United Nations will go out of existence. Whatever faults the United Nations may have, they are the faults and frailities of human nature, and are due to inherent, weaknesses, not in the organization itself, but in the member States. If we do not have the United Nations, if we do not have international co-operative effort in bringing peace and order to the world, we shall surrender ourselves to the inevitability of war. Either the United Nations flourishes or war eventuates. War may eventuate, even with the United Nations in existence, but it will not come because of any weakness of the United Nations. If , unfortunately, war does come, it will be because certain nations will not agree to act in concert with other nations in maintaining peace and unity in the world. If honourable gentlemen opposite scoff at the United Nations, and think that they are uttering statesmenlike phrases, they are merely deceiving themselves. That little daredevil from Parramatta last night threatened war against every one. I am considering entering him as a contender for Joe Louis's title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world. At any rate, the United Nations has to be tried. Bernard Shaw has said that we would have had socialism long ago had it not been for socialists. It has been truthfully said that we would have had Christianity long ago had it not been for certain Christians. There is so much contention and division among those who should be united that the world is a very poor place. It is easy to sneer and scoff at the United Nations. Those who attempt to make the world a better place should be supported. Their efforts will not be helped by the suggestion, that has been made by honourable gentlemen opposite in this debate, not that the authority of the United Nations should be ignored or treated with contempt and that we should go our way and annex the Territory of New Guinea and make it a part of the Australian Commonwealth, regardless of what the United Nations says, or even what it does.

I fwere told last night that a great Empire statesman, Field Marshal Smuts, wanted to annex German South-West Africa, but we were not told also that Dr. Malanwhose name was not even mentionedwanted to take South Africa out of the British Commonwealth. The theory is the same in each instance. Perhaps Dr. Malan wanted to go farther and to act more quickly. Kngland. to annex various things. The honourable member for Parramatta wants to annex the new Bradfield electorate and the honourable member for Warringah, too, has ideas about annexing certain places. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The bill has nothing to do with annexing Bradfield. matter is that Field Marshal Smuts was a very weak reed on which to rely last uight, because, if honourable members accept his dictum, they have to accept what Malan said, and not many honourable members will associate themselves with his sentiments. The bill is a good one. Too many red herrings have been drawn across its trail in regard to what might or might not have been done with German New Guinea and what might be done with it in the future. Let us carry out the authority given to us under the mandate of this international organization that we call the United Nations, and let us remember that we did seek the mandate and did get it. We at least were given this appreciative notation by the Trusteeship Council, that it appreciated the action of the Australian Government in having submitted in advance of its legislative action its proplayed by the Minister for Information posals in detail for the administrative union of the territories of Papua and New Guinea.

At that conference, Australia was represented by a delegation representing all parties in this Parliament, and also of interests outside the Parliament. It was, I believe, the biggest delegation that had ever left Australia. When it returned, I did not hear from those honourable members opposite who were members of it any criticism of the kind that is being so freely expressed at the present time. The organization of the United Nations was formed, and the world wished it well. The world hopes that it will succeed. If it does not, it will be a bad thing for humanity. Whilei t exists, we should respect it and act under its authority. The Parliament should pass this legislation which, whatever may be said on the subject of annexation, will undoubtedly promote tlie well-being of New Guinea and its inhabitants. It will do for New Guinea something which has never before been attempted. I had believed that, in the many years during which I have been a member of this Parliament I had experienced everything in the form of debate, but the role ( Mr Calwell) to-day as an exponent of Australia's foreign policy was something new to me.

157,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [3.38].,"for Information in this debate are a pretty good example of that. The honourable gentleman took the Opposition to task on the subject of annexation. It is always interesting to hear him trying to -develop an argument. At such a time, the rules of debate mean nothing to him. He makes against the Opposition all the charges which he thinks will stick, and if he runs out of matter he is always capable of inventing new charges. He followed the same lines in regard to annexation. He said, in effect, "" If we were to annex New GuineaI do not know where aggression would start and where it would end. Why not advocate the annexation of all the islands which happen to be a part of the defence apron protecting Australia?"". While I listened to the Minister attacking the Opposition for its attitude in regard to the annexation of New Guinea, I could not help recalling that he had never uttered a word of objection to the annexation of Latavia, Lithuania and Estonia by Soviet Russia. He did not say that such action was to be deplored, and that Australia should not follow so bad an example. Ear be it from the Minister, apparently, to criticize Soviet Russia. Indeed, he has done everything in his power to oppose the interests of our former allies in the Pacific, and to quarrel with the coloured peoples as well. ( Mr Lazzarini) -This is not a debate on foreign affairs. has an important bearing on New Guinea, t am discussing a situation in countries contiguous to New Guinea. Eor the Opposition it is not a matter of annexation term? of Nations ceased to exist, those territories which were being administered under mandate from the league automatically became the responsibility of the mandatory powers. Therefore, our position in New Guinea was different from that of those nations which accepted trusteeships over territory taken from the pnemy in the last war. I always enjoy following the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) in debate. When he trief to discuss practical affairs, he wears the somewhat bewildered look of Alice in Wonderland. I propose to correct some of his statements because his information needs to be brought up to date. It is time he stepped out of the primary class and faced the cold realities of practical politics. He chided the Opposition with the fact that a non-Labour government had accepted a mandate over New Guinea that had deprived Australia of the right to fortify that territory. He said that we were now making a great fuss about the defence of New Guinea under the trusteeship, although we had ourselves accepted a mandate thai forbade Australia to establish any defences at all in New Guinea. My answer to him is that the League of Nations laid down the terms and conditions of the mandate. . If Australia had not been prepared to accept those terms it would not have been given the mandate. Moreover, world conditions after the first world war were very different from those that exist at the present time. At that time the world looked to the League of Nations to preserve peace, although subsequently the league turned out to be an ignominious failure. After the first world war, international opinion was Such that the United Kingdom almost completely disarmed. This emasculation of Empire defences was one of the great contributing factors to the second world war. The honourable member for Fremantle has said that Japan was a strong nation after the first world war and held a chain of islands in the Pacific as far south as the equator. But at that time Japan was our ally, having fought with U3 in the war why use the that had just concluded. Japan administered those islands under a mandate from the League of Nations. Contrast tlie world situation then with the situation at the present time when there are wars and rumours of war on all sides. Now, our one-time ally is conspiring to defeat the democratic nations. It is taking control of slice after slice of Europe, and its influence is extending in Asia and the Pacific almost to the very front door of Australia. The honourable member quoted",45,Second Reading

161,Mr Harrison,"When the LeagueArticle3 oi' the Trusteeship Agreement .is follows:The Administering Authority undertakes io administer the Territory in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and in such a manner as to achieve iu the Territory the hasic objectives of the international trusteeship system, which are set forth in Article ""(! of the Charter. Obviously, the honourable member has not read Article 76 of the Charter. He also quoted Article7 of the Trusteeship AgreementThe Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory and for maintenance of international peace and security. He argued that the article gave Australia power to take all steps for the defence of Australia. I suggest that if the honourable member reads Article7 of the agreement in conjunction w it h Article 76 of the Charter he w ill receive a shock. For the honourable member's information I propose to quote from a recent book entitled Trusteeship in the Pacific, which was issued under the authority of the following eminent persons:T. P. McAuley, M.A., Lecturer in Colonial Administration in the Australian School of Pacific Administration. T. Inglis Moore, M.A. (Oxon.),B.A. (Sydn.), Lecturer in Pacific Studies, Canberra Uniwith the terms of the mandate. In the versity College. A. Jean Sogers, B.A., Teaching Fellow in History, University of Sydney, -lohn M. Ward, M.A., LLB., Lecturer in History, University of Sydney; author of British Policy in the South Pacific I. mention those names so that the honourable member for Eremantle, who poses in this chamber as an authority on international affairs, w ill be able to see how much he is out of step with those who are best informed on such subjects. The authors of the book, discussing strategic areas as mentioned in the agreement, state at page 76Apparently the designation is to be made by ''the States directly concerned"" (Article 70) with the approval of the Security Council. This special dispensation means that a Great Power, with its veto rights on the Council, possesses virtual sovereignty in any strategic area of a trusteeship that it administers. The basic objectives of trusteeship, set in Article 7(1, are still applicable, subject to overriding strategic needs, but the practical position of the Administering Power is only just short of that of an annexing Power. ilr. Harrison. So that when the honourable member quotes Article3 of the trusteeship agreement he must remember that Article 7ft of the Charter prescribes that only a strategic area may be virtually annexed. So under the international trusteeship system the Government has no power t<refuse to supervisors appointed by the International Trusteeship Council permission to enter and inspect a trust country. No power lies w it h the Government to prevent such inspection short of the provisions contained in Article 76 of the Charter. The honourable member for Parkes has no argument to advance in that regard. He merely skirts around the perimeter of this subject seeking to cover himself w it h a mantle of shim meting glory which has no substance. It i with a great deal of pleasure that I brine to his notice a volume which will give him some real grounding in the subject on which he has chosen to speak with sue.h little knowledge. 1 propose to dwell for a few moments on the history of the mandate systen, We know that when Japan was given x mandate by the League of Nations ovei the Marianas, the Carolines and the Marshalls it immediately proceeded t< for t if y those islands in direct conflict administration of its mandate over New Guinea, Australia played the game and sought to conform to the obligations imposed upon it by the terms of the mandate. Therein lay our greatest weakness, a weakness which I trust w ill nevei again occur. Subsequently, countless lives were lost and untold treasure was poured into New Guinea simply because that part of New Guinea which we had held under mandate was undefended. Apparently honourable members opposite have failed to learn the lessons which the experiences of World War II . so forcibly brought home to us. They have no regard for the lives that were lost in defending New Guinea as a bastion of Australia. If the Government's defence policy means anything, surely it implies that adequate steps w ill be taken to enable Australian resources to be protected with a minimum loss of life and expenditure of money. The mandates over New_ Guinea, Nauru and West Samoa which were formerly held by the British Commonwealth have now been negotiated trusteeship system, but with a difference. The United States has taken the Marshalls, the Carolines, and the Marianas under a special strategic trusteeship. them. show that the United States has 'established virtual sovereignty over those islands which is as close to annexation as anything could possibly be. Australia, on the other hand, has brought New Guinea, Nauru and other islands under the international trusteeship system. The next important point that appears to me to arise from a consideration of this measure is the proposal for the establishment of an administrative union for the Territory of Papua aud the Territory of Xew Guinea. I propose to deal briefly with that aspect of the bill. The desirability of such an administrative union has exercised the minds of public men in Australia for many years. As far back as the 'twenties a royal commission was established to inquire into the possibilities tion committed the United Nations not to of establishing such an administrative union, but in a majority recommendation it. rejected the proposal and reported in favour of separate administrations. In 1989, when I was Minister administering External Territories, I appointed the Eggleston Committee to investigate the possibilities of such a union. Honourable members will recall that because of the richness of the resources of New Guinea and the large quantity of gold being won there the New Guinea residents were distinctly averse to an administrative union with their poorer relations in Papua. The committee accordingly submitted an adverse report. But the collapse of civil government in New Guinea in 1942 completely altered the whole situation between the two territories. The circumstances that then existed made it possible for Australia to assume complete control of the whole of the island as an integral part of the Australian administration. As honourable members will recall an administrative unit was established under the military government to administer both territories. The very fact that an administrative union was thus established at that juncture made it possible under the international for us to effect a permanent administrative union between the two territories if we desired to do so. The circumstance? that then prevailed made it much easier for us to bring about a permanent union than did the circumstances which made i i possible for the South African Government virtually to annex South-West Africa which it had held under mandate. We shoud then have taken over complete control of the whole of Ne"" Guinea and regarded it as part of the Australian set-up. I am in complete disagreement with the terms of the trusteeship agreement which was approved on the 14th December, 1946. When the League of Nations ceased to exist it wa> natural to expect that the Mandated Territory of New Guinea should revert to the Commonwealth which had administered it up to that time. Because of complications arising from the mandates held by Japan, it was difficult for the victorious allies in World War II . to annex the Marshalls, the Carolines and the Marianas covered by those mandates. The Atlantic Charter and the Cairo declaraengage in territorial aggrandizement and made it impossible for the United Statesof America to annex those islands. The United Nations, as it is constructed to-day. cannot preserve peace in the face of a challenge by a major power. Indeed, outside of ordinary agreements on scraps of paper, which mean little to belligerent and selfish nations, it has no means for preserving peace. It soon became appa rent to those who watched the international situation that the world centre was moving closer to the Pacific. On this aspect of the problem „I place on record the following extract from the London Times:The revolutionary movements in Asia as a whole are changing the world strategic and political map and the destinies of nearly a thousand million people are being shaped. The Communists are either in the leadership or striving towards it . The Times significantly addedOne lesson to be drawn in the face of the present disorders in Asia is that the western and other friendly powers, especially, those of the British Commonwealth, must plan their defensive strategy afresh from Japan to the Indian Ocean.",46,Second Reading

Hwrison. honourable over them. I quote again from the work Trusteeship in the Pacific as follows:The requirement in Article 83 (3), that the before Security Council is to avail itself of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council in relaformerly tion to political, economic, social, and educational matters, is so hedged about with the international trusteeship qualifications as to be almost nugatory. But the Minister for External More important is the somewhat abstruse requirement in Article 84, which probably (Dr. Evatt), who is a great applies to strategic area trusteeships. and is in the forefront It shall be tlie duty of the administering authority to ensure that the trust territory shall play its part in the maintenance of interthat national peace and security. To this, end the administering authority may make use of the volunteer forces, facilities, and assistance from On the contrary, the trust territory in carrying out the obligations towards the Security Council undertaken in this regard by the administering authority, as well as for local defence and Pacific, the maintenance of law and order within thetrust territory. The writer proceedsArticle 84 is to be regarded first as an open over those islands. The invitation to the administering power to use its trust area, whether strategic or not, for the implementing of its own defence policy. I shall cite an example. On the 22nd of February, 1947, the United States of America submitted to the Security Council a proposal relative to the control of value territories formerly held by Japan. Article 13 affirmedThe United States of America has the power We have to close the Islands for security purposes. territory The Security Council accepted that agreeWith ment. I invite the House to compare that arrangement w i th the proposal contained When the United States of in this bill. The United States of trusteeAmerica need not report to the Internamandated tional Trusteeship Council or permit supervisors to visit the islands that it was a party to the holds in trust. Therefore, the United under which the American States of America has virtual sovereignty Therefore, it over such islands. That arrangement is was not infinitely better than annexation, because of that the control of the islands is backed, not The Minister for External by one nation, but by the United Nations,, provided that organization has power. on seeing peace radiating Australia would have been in a similar position had it taken New Guinea under astrategic trusteeship, as it might easily apparent to have done. In those circumstances, we should have held New Guinea not only by virtue of our own strength and the The United States of America support of the British Commonwealth, a. compromise and obtained but also by the assistance of the United control of the islands to Nations. Such an arrangement would be,, in effect, stronger than annexation. Howsovereignty ever, we have sold the pass,, and allowed! 1 the opportunity to slip. The United States of America has effected, not hy annexation, but by agreement, what may be considered complete sovereignty over areas that it considers to be essential to its security. What do we propose to do ? Our intention is to place a vital outpost under the International Trusteeship Council, not as a special strategic trust, but as a trust in the broadest and most general terms. Under such an arrangement, we must submit reports to the Trusteeship Council for examination and discussion, and permit supervisors to investigate the territory. At this juncture I shall read from Current Notes on International Affairs for January, 1949, a summary of the views of other governments on the administrative union of Papua and New Guinea. It is as follows:The Soviet view was that the administrative union as proposed would deprive the United Nations of the power of supervision or at least make it very difficult because of the provisions referred to that portion of the country for common legislation, administration, labour regulations, fiscal arrangements, budget and land utilization. . In his view the bill did not permit native participation in the government and contained no provision to preserve the objectives of Article 76: notably, the plan was not the result of the freely expressed will nf the inhabitants. I like that touch. Soviet Russia objected to the plan which the Australian Government had formulated, and which the Opposition is criticizing to-day for another reason, because it did not express the free will of the inhabitants of New Guinea. all about such a matter. Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Korea and the Kuriles, we wonder. But Russia is one of the members of the Trusteeship Council, to which we must report upon our administration in New Guinea. The extract from Current Notes an International Affairs gives the following additional information about the Soviet's view of the bill:It gave no advantages to the inhabitants of tbe trust territory as compared to those of Papua and would result in the setting up of a common colonial regime. It would be impossible to envisage independence, when all aspects of administration were fused and the plan would in practice inevitably prevent New Guinea attaining separate self-government or independence. I should like to demonstrate to the House the insincerity of some of the members of the Trusteeship Council to whom we must report and to whom we must gram free entry to this vital area in order to investigate the manner in which we are carrying out our trust. It is perfectly true that we shall be permitted to place defences in the territory, but I was always under the impression that the value of defences lay in the preservation of secrecy about them. Secrecy cannot be maintained if we allow, for example, the representatives of Russia to inspect our defences, as they can easily do under the guise of investigating the manner in which we are treating the natives of New Guinea. Another member of the Trusteeship Council which will determine whether we are fulfilling our responsibilities in the territory is China. controlled by Chiang Kai-shek or thai portion controlled by the Communists? ing about that, because I have no doubi that Communist China will be recognized, as Communist Indonesia has been recognized. Other members of the Trusteeship Council are Costa Rica, Iraq and Mexico. Until those countries have put their own houses in order, they cannot make an effective contribution to decisions about the manner in which we are carrying out the terms of our trust. We have an honoured name in respect of the administration of native peoples. The name of Sir Hubert Murray is one to conjure with in colonial administration. We have nothing to be ashamed of in our treatment of native peoples. Although our administration is one of the brightest spots in colonial history, our system is to be subject to criticism by countries such as Costa Rica, Iraq and Mexico and that totalitarian state, Soviet Russia. Could any proposal be more absurd and ridiculous in the eyes of thinking people? The United States of America realizes the absurdity of such a position, and has made a forward move by adopting the system of strategic trusts.

They are prepared to sell the pass in the interests of some ephemeral idea of peace, because that is all it is in the midst of warring factions in the world to-day. New Guinea is vital to Australia. Approximately one-half of the island is Dutch New Guinea, which may possibly come under the control of the Indonesian Republic, the people of which will not be friendly towards Australia. Relations .ire already strained. Communist-conrrolled infiltrators are likely, in a very --hort time, having regard to what has occurred in Burma, to swing the whole of the coloured races in the Eastern Peninsula against Australia. Papua and New Guinea constitute the remainder of the island.

The destiny of New Guinea and Papua is indissolubly linked with that >f Australia.. The territory, which is virtually a part of Australia, is vital to our well-being. In the hands of an unfriendly power, the territory would be like a dagger pointed at our heart. That the two territories are vital to our defence was proved during World War II .

The territory should then have become an integral part of Australia's possessions. We failed on. that occasion, and we failed a second time when we did not take adequate measures for the security of New Guinea. Now, we propose to hand over the territory to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, a body that will have an overriding power, because it will be able to tell us what we must do. The democracies have played the game, but, as the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) has stated, Russia has not done so. The Soviet virtually has a trust in Berlin and in the Balkans. Does it make reports relative to the way in which it is observing its obligations to the peoples of those countries? Doesi t allow supervisors to visit Berlin to see that it is carrying out its obligations under the agreements which give it control of that area? Does it permit investigators and supervisors to visit Korea and the Kurile Islands? Does it permit reports to be prepared and discussed?

It has been pointed out that, under the mandatory system, the construction of fortifications in New Guinea was forbidden. We were, however, permitted to arect civil installations. Between the two wars, with the exception of the period of office of the Scullin Government, the anti-Labour parties formed the Government of Australia. What did they do to provide proper ports in New Guinea? In the early days of World War II . , when we were sending men there, the ships were compelled to anchor in tbe roadsteads, and Royal Australian Air Force men bad to use motor boats to take their supplies ashore. During the period when Australia held a mandate from the League of Nations in respect of New Guinea and the Australian Government of the day had an opportunity to erect civil installations that would have been of military value in time of war, very little was done. We must face realities in regard to the defence of Australia. New Guinea is on the perimeter of our defence system, but it is necessary to provide for the defence of the centre as well as of the perimeter. We have been told that the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was forced to accept a mandate in respect of New Guinea, because the alternative was under the terms of the mandate, it could not fortify New Guinea, what did the Australian Government of that time do to strengthen the defences of Australia? Up to the outbreak of war in 1939 whai of the northern parts of this country? Honourable members opposite have alleged that under this trusteeship agreemeni we cannot institute proper defence measures or take adequate precautions outside of Australia, but when the parties to which they belong were in power and had the opportunity to take some positive action instead of merely talking about what should be done, very little was in fact done to ensure that we were provided with adequate defences. If New Guinea were the subject of a strategic area trusteeship agreement and we could take all the action that we desired to take from the point of view of defence, do honourable members opposite suggest that we should send there all the defence forces that we could raise? Should we not do something to provide for the defence of Australia proper ? One honourable gentleman opposite referred to the possibility of the Navy no longer being able to provide an adequate means of defence and suggested that air power would probably be the dominating factor in future conflicts. I point out to those honourable gentlemen who have been talking of the necessity to keep secret our defence measures in New Guinea and of our beinjj able to take all the steps that are necessary to provide for our defence that, in the event of air attack, we should not get very much assistance from defence preparations in New Guinea. It would be possible to construct strategic airfields there, but we should discover that, in spite of all our activities in New Guinea, even assuming that we had all the powers that honourable members opposite suggest that we should have, unless adequate measures were taken for the protection of Australia they would not be of much use to us. The bogyI use the word deliberately, although honourable members.opposite may possibly accuse me of being unfair in doing so-ha s been raised of the possibility of Russian forces coming down through China, Indo-China, Burma or Malaya to Australia. I am of the opinion that if Russia wished to attack any nation in a future war it would not attack Australia, [f Russia was militarily successful in other spheres and was able to subjugate the forces of the United Kingdom and other nations in Europe, Australia would be merely a pawn in the game. Honourable members opposite have said repeatedly that Australia is not given the say in discussions relating to peace treaties and kindred matters to which it is entitled. Honourable members on this side of the House have pointed out that Australia, having taken a great part in the fighting in the Pacific, is entitled to adequate representation at all conferences in connection with proposed treaties of peace with Japan and other countries, but we have not yet been able to secure such representation. I repeat that if another war occurred Australia would not be regarded by the Russians as vital territory. When discussing this bill we must consider whether we believe in the principle of annexation or in the principle of international co-operation. If we believe in the principle of international co-operation we must be prepared to accept the fact that New Guinea should be administered under the international trusteeship system. I do not think that the honourable member for Wentworth was quite fair in his reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle concerning the fourth schedule of the bill, which set3 out the agreement. The main point made by the honourable member for Fremantle concerned Article4 of the agreement, which was not referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth. Article4 reads as follows:The Administering Authority will be responsible for the peace, order, good Government and defence of the Territory and for this purpose will have the same powers of administration the Territory as if it were an integral part of Australia, to the Territory, subject to such modifications as it deems desirable, such laws of the Commonwealth of Australia as it deems appropriate to the needs and conditions of the Territory. Sir. Thompson. That provision gives great powers to the Australian Government. The honorable member for Wentworth referred to Article 3. That is a separate article and does not override the others. It reads as follows:The Administering Authority undertakes to administer the Territory in accordance w i th the provisions of the Charter and in such manner as? to achieve in the Territory the basic objectives of the international trusteeship system, which are set forth in Article 76 of the Charter. It is clear that, under the trusteeship system, a country to which trusteeship is given is under an obligation to carry out the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. The honourable member for Wentworth compared the trusteeship agreement in respect of the ex-Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific with the agreement in respect of New Guinea. The two agreements are quite different. One is concerned with territories in which there is a large number of native people, and a condition of the agreement is that those native peoples shall be treated in a proper manner and given every opportunityto progress. The strategic area trusteeship agreement, however, is generally concerned with territories which the country administering the agreement wishes to occupy for the purposes of its defence and to use as bases for naval and air force operations. The honourable member for Wentworth was hardly fair to the honourable member for Fremantle in dealing with the matter as he did. Article 7, to which the honourable gentleman referred, reads as follows:The Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory and for maintenance of international peace and security. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) differed from the honourable member for Wentworth in his interpretation. I agree with the honourable member for Parkes that Article3 is subject to Article 76 of the charter. Article 76 refers mainly to the developments in relation to the inhabitants of the trustee territories legislation, and does not refer specifically to powers and jurisdiction in and over affecting defence. The present measure makes full provision for the effective adand will be entitled to apply ministration of the territories, the trusteeship of which has been given to Australia.

186,Mr Gullett (Henty) [4.43],"Thesay that the Government has approached this problem in a way that is typical of its approach to any similar problem whether in Australia or abroad. In the Territory of New Guinea we can see on a small scale everything that is bad in Australia to-day. instance, we see there a. greatly inflated public service that is about three times bigger than it was before the last war. We also see rising costs, just as,in Australia. To a great extent a feature of the economy of New Guinea is that its people are enabled to keep going, just as we are in Australia, because of the very high prices for their exports, for instance, copra. In every direction one looks one sees in New Guinea the same decrease in the volume of production, the same squandering of public moneys, and the same dependence of the population on government hand-outs or on public works. I can speak of the administration of the territory, as distinct from the present state of affairs there, with some knowledge. I have always admired the manner in which Australia has administered its responsibilities in New Guinea. As the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) stated last night, we have, to some extent, been a model for the world in our administration of the native peoples. been any question of great exploitation there nor any need for ""striking the shackles off the slaves' legs"" or whatever the phrase was that the honourable member for Parkes used last night from his journalistic word-book. By and large, our record in New Guinea has been a good one and it is wrong for this Government to destroy the standards that have been built up there over a long period of years. Honourable members opposite have told this House and the people consistently of what they intend to do with exploiters, of the efficiency that they will institute in New Guinea, and of the new deal for the natives and so way as planters, miners, and so on, and on. Under this Government, what honourable gentlemen opposite describe as evil has flourished to a degree never seen before in the history of Australia's administration of New Guinea. It has remained for this Government to permit, in the administration of the territory, rhe greatest public scandal of our generatrade. tion. There is great talk about the attitude of the United Nations, our responsibilities, and so on, but no honourable member of this House needs doubt that i-pcent events in New Guinea will be made the subject of the most damning For indictment of the way in which we have conducted ourselves in New Guinea in member of this House need doubt that the last few years. There has been displayed, indeed-and no one can deny itconsiderable dishonesty, inefficiency and complete ignorance of the problems that confront us there. All those responsible, including Ministers and public officials, talk about the bad old days when we used to exploit native labour and the land in New Guinea and that sort of thing. There has been a sustained attempt by Ministers and others in this House to whip up class consciousness in New Guinea as it has been whipped up in Australia. I need say no mor» about that subject, but the time will come when it will be perfectly clear who have been the exploiters in New Guinea. We have heard a great deal from the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) about a new deal for the natives of New Guinea, and the honourable members opposite who have spoken on the bill have used There has never similar terms. Now it appears that the natives are to have every modern blessing -trad e unions, the 40-hour week and model villages that they do not want. Ward. Ward, too, although it is doubtful whether they will have him for long. that the administration has done on the positive side. On the other side, it has made open war on all those people who are developing New Guinea in a private who were the explorers of it in the first instance. The Government has quite destroyed the possibility of their at present carrying on their living and increasing their standards and numbers in New Guinea. Before the war the territory had a flourishing and increasing Its exports were valued at £3,700,000 and it imported £1,500,000",55,Second Reading

Obviously, during were destroyed and neglected. was unavoidable. But, added to that, great labour difficulties have been created. perhaps to be forwarded here ultiThe Administration has done nothing to make those difficulties easier. result has been, as we see in answers to questions, a constantly diminishing production from the territory, with fewer men employed and every indication that our regime is inefficient compared with what it was. If private industy is at a discount, the same cannot be said of officialdom. I invite honourable members, particularly Government supporters, to get in touch with the private individuals in New Guinea, who opened up country and contributed to the measure of prosperity it enjoyed before the war. They will be told that New Guinea is at present just an officials' paradise. There are, I am informed, about three officials to every private individual and about three times as many as there were in 1939. The result has been such stagnation of that country as has never been seen before. The approach of the Minister has all too often shown complete ignorance of the needs of the situation. It has been impregnated with all that class bitterness and ignorance that he usually brings into this House in connection with affairs in his own country. Not long ago, referring to the natives in New Guinea, he said, "" They have been contented since we have had a Labour government"". they know of the Labour Government? "", and he replied, "" They read about it in the newspapers "". Any one who understands the faintest thing about the territory knows that not .1 per cent, of the natives is literate. To say that they read anything in the newspapers or anywhere else is to show a complete lack of understanding of the problem before the Administration of dealing with them. The accent has heen far too much on the political side and not enough on the agricultural, economical, industrial and medical sides. There are in the hill Sir. Gullett. certain provisions to set up local councilsa form of self-expression or self determination, as it is now popular to call The planters have it. I heard with interest the Minister's statement that minutes are to be the war, many plantations kept of the proceedings in the That village councils and that they are to be forwarded to the local authority, mately. In what language are the The minutes to be kept? Who will keep them ? Who will be able to read in those places? What will they talk about that will justify this utterly ridiculous procedure? This is the kind of red tape that is strangling New Guinea. If we are to get anything better out of the territory we must send to it from this place some men who will return with first-hand knowledge and real appreciation of the problems to be solved there. The first needs are agricultural, economical, industrial and medical. On the agricultural side, I only say that despite all the money that is being expended in New Guinea, I have yet to hear of any great developmental schemes. There has been talk of establishing tea plantations in New Guinea. In my view that would be one of the last things required. Teagrowing would have to be heavily subsidized. It requires highly skilled labour. The training of the labour would be expensive. Before they knew where they were the people in Australia would be paying a higher price for tea hy way of subsidy even than they are paying at present. There is opportunity, as was said by the British Food Mission, for the growing of oil-nuts, maize, potatoes and crops of that sort. There He was asked, "" What do is no sign at all that such enterprises have been put in hand, at any rate on a large scale, and, after all, the figures are there to prove that it has not. On the medical side, we hear a great deal about how much is being done, for the natives. But what is the position medically in New Guinea? At present, in the whole public service, there are only eleven medical men. That was the figure last year. Let us not have any repetition of the nonsense that everything is being subordinated to the interests of the natives, because it is not. The Government is setting up committees and trying to make the natives politically conscious of a desire to govern themselves, which they do not want to do and are uot capable of doing. This is not helping r.hem. 1 now desire to say something about the defence of New Guinea. It is obvious that some one will have to defend it if we are to continue to hold it. threatened, because it i9 the last wealthy unsettled country in the world. We either have to defend it or watch it go from us. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) suggested that one great advantage of putting the Territory of New Guinea into trusteeship, is that we shall be enabled to defend it. Defendi t with what? I want to know that because, when the honourable gentleman was pressed further, be said that he was-, quite sure that the Government could defend New Guinea and was, in fact, taking steps for the defence of its ports, airfields and so on.

I should be surprised to hear that any one can contend, least of all the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers), that in this country we could defend a single port against a second-rate attack or any attack. We have no navy, army or air force. That has no relation to the bill. the defence of New Guinea. Before the Guinea is our territory. war we developed fine native units, first place, we had only a mandate officered by Australians. I am informed over it. that not a single battalion of those troops Australia that mandate was the League is left. I can think of no better way of contributing at least to the land of Nations.

It provided an excuse to many people, some of them traitors and others stupid, to justify the disarmament of the British Empire so as to leave us open to Hitler's attack. Men like Chamberlain and MacDonald, as well as some in this country, were more responsible for the second world war than Hitler himself. Some of them used the League of Nations as a means to propagate their own ideas. The league was started by President Wilson, an idealist with no practical knowledge of affairs. He did not realize the dangers that would face the world if his ideas were adopted. He obviously had no knowledge of human nature when he entertained the belief that the nations of the world would abandon their own interests in order to subscribe to his ideals. People like those who inaugurated and supported the League of Nations are now trying to foist the United Nations on the world.

However, the defence of Australia may not be debated. submit that the defences of Papua and New Guinea, which are indissolubly intertwined, have just as much to do with the defence of Australia as has the defence of Tasmania, and surely the calling up of men to serve in the Australian army is associated with the defence of Tasmania.

The Ministerf or Immigration ( Mr Calwell) said that if it was proposed to annex the Territory of New Guinea on the ground of security, we should also demand possession of Portuguese Timor. In the first place, it should never have been necessary for us to talk about annexing New Guinea. We should not have been foolish enough to offer to hand it over to the United Nations, and accept the administration of the territory on its terms. Asf or Timor, 1 believe that Australia should have made. I have a serious attempt to buy Portuguese Timor, which is vita l to our defence. It is well known that Japan tried to buy it before the war. I do not believe that because Portugal is a weak nation, and half the world away, we should simply take possession of Portuguese Timor, thus creating an international incident, but we should certainly try to buy it . I also believe that we should ask B ritain to hand over to us the small islands which it possesses in the vicinity of New Guinea.

216,Mr Hamilton (Swan) [5.22],"Th eworld, which, constitutes the bastion of Australian defence. Some people believe that the United Nations will not interfere with our administration and control of New Guinea. .Clause7 of the bill provides that Australia shall make an annual report to the United Nations on the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the Territory of New Guinea. That is quite right. We hope to do everything possible to advance the living conditions of the natives there; but we do not believe that other countries, which have no real love for Australia, should be permitted to -jnter New Guinea and examine its defences under the pretext of making an inspection of the political, economic, social and educational advancement of me natives The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) asked what purpose could be served by rejecting this bill and withholding our approval of the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system. If we are big enough to reject the bill and to refuse to ratify the placing of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system, the door will again be opened for further negotiation, with a view to bringing New Guinea solely within the control of Australia. In a sarI liken that provision to an admission castic way, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) referred to what had been said by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr All guardians have an obligation to better Hughes) at the Peace Conference at Versailles, and to how the right honourable gentleman had failed to act upon his words. knows only too well that the right honourable member for North Sydney fought tooth and nail for the handing over of New Guinea to Australia. He was unsuccessful in his efforts because the odds were against him. The right honourable member for North Sydney had no option but to accept the decision of the makers of the peace treaty, who, in their wisdom or otherwise, decided that the mandate system should be adopted. At the conference of Versailles, he waged a wordy battle to the last ditch in an endeavour to make the territory a sovereign possession of Australia. I am sorry to say that the representatives of the present Government did not adopt a similar attitude in the negotiations which gave rise to the proposal in the bill now before us. Instead, when it was suggested that New Guinea should be placed under the international trusteeship system they registered but a feeble protest. When the representatives on the Trusteeship Council refused to agree to the proposal that Australia should have absolute control of New Guinea they knuckled under and dropped the proposal, notwithstanding the example set by the United States in regard to the islands that had been formerly mandated to Japan. When dealing with those islands, the representatives of the United States did not agree to place them under the international trusteeship system, thus allowing a potential enemy to enter them at will under the pretext of examining the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the natives. On the contrary, they applied for, and were granted, sole control of the islands as strategic areas. Article7 of the Trusteeship Agreement providesThe Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Territory and for maintenance of international peace and security. by a guardian with a ward that his obligations are completely fulfilled once the ward is fed and clothed and sent to school. themselves so that their wards may be able to enjoy a higher standard of living. What is the use of planning for the The honourable gentleman defence of the territory if we do not make ourselves strong enough to protect it? Of what use is it to spend millions of pounds on the defence of the territory if at the same time we have to allow the representatives of potentially hostile countries to enter the territory ostensibly to examine the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the natives, although we know that their real purpose is to examine its defences and to make plans for their destruction? It is within the bounds of possibility that such a potentially hostile power may at a subsequent meeting of the United Nations protest vehemently against such defensive preparations as we may commence and so prevent their completion. The honourable member for Hindm&rah also said that our principal task in New Guinea will be to keep others from entering the territory. How are we to keep people out of New Guineai f we do not make adequate preparations for its defence? Eveni f on paper New Guinea is regarded as an integral part of Australia, how does the Government propose to defend it? It can be defended only by force of arms. I recall to mind reports which appeared in the press only a few months ago of the alarming growth of population in countries to the north of Australia and how the governments of those countries were compelled to look elsewhere for the settlement of their surplus populations. I am gravely disturbed about what may happen in New Guinea. It is all very well for the Government to say that it will not permit unwanted people to settle there. How can it stop them, from doing so? How can we carry out our determination not to allow unwelcome people to enter New Guineai f we cannot back that declaration with the necessary power? We have to assess not the present value of New Guinea but the value it might represent to ns say, 50, 100 or 200 years hence. If we hand over the territory to an organization of the United Nations it will no longer belong to us. What then will be our position 50,100 or 200 years hence ? Undoubtedly we shall pay for our folly as time goes by. New Guinea constitutes the most strategic area in our near north. [ am totally opposed to the handing over of control of this territory without a fight to such countries as Mexico, Paraguay, Costa Rica which, like an octopus, has already spread its tentacles down through Malaya and is rapidly approaching closer to New Guinea. The bill also makes provision for the establishment of a legislative council and other legislative and advisory bodies. In my opinion, the time is not yet ripe for the establishment of such forms of administration in the territory. Most of the natives of New Guinea did a magnificent job for Australia during the war years, hut quite a number are diametrically opposed to our way of life. We should not run away with the idea that they all love this country. Far from it. As the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) has said, the only way to educate them to a stage at which they may be granted some semblance of self-administration is to allow white people to settle in New Guinea and instruct them in agricultural and other forms of industry. WhilstI admit that in the past there has been a certain amount of exploitation of the natives by unscrupulous whites and that precautions should be taken to see that that is not repeated, I maintain that the natives have not yet reached a stage at which they can take an intelligent interest in their own political and administrative affairs. It Is the task of the Government to protect them. We should not say to people who desire to go to New Guinea: ""You may not go there; the country belongs to the ' fuzzy wuzzy'; they will administer it themselves "". The time i not yet ripe for the creation of the proposed administrative instruments in the territory, but it is ripe for us so take a real interest in New Guinea affairs. 1 believe it to be the bounden duty of every member of this Parliament to respect the sacrifices made by our fighting forces in two world wars and to reject this bill with a view to re-opening the door for further negotiations and securing for Australia the sole right to administer and control New Guinea.

The most important point was the complaint by members of the Opposition that the Government had not provided an opportunity to enable the House to discuss the Trusteeship Agreement prior to the introduction of this bill. I cannot believe that honourable members opposite are sincere in making such a statement, because the facts contradict them. On the 7th August, 1946, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) made the following statement to the House:On the 17th January, 1940, the Australian Government declared its intention of placing the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system established by the United Nations. Similar declarations were made by the governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand concerning their mandated territories in Africa and Western Samoa respectively.

Consultation w it h other States which may be regarded as directly concerned is now taking place, and as yet there ia no definite text which can be placed before the House. A d r a f t agreement, however, has been prepared as a basis for our discussions with other governments. I shall read the articles of this agreement to honourable members at the conclusion of this statement, thus affording an opportunity for expression of views on the principle which the Government will be following in the negotiation of the agreement. The Territory of New Guinea, in which so many of our men died in battle against the Japanese, is of such importance to the safety of this country that nothing but absolute control could bo accepted by any Australian government.

I cannot understand the reference of the honourable gentleman opposite to giving New Guinea away. We never owned it. We held it under a mandate from the League of Nations.

In the short but very fine speech which the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) delivered she stated that in this, as in many other debates, honourable gentlemen opposite have done little but talk war. Their cry is, "" War, war, war! The United Nations is of no use. The United Nations is finished. Dr. Evatt is a tragedy for Australia"".

They have the same man-power and material problems as other parts of the world. Many of those who had the finest knowledge of the territories are missing, and have not been heard of since the war. Therefore, it is not a matter of continuing from where we left off in 1939 when war broke out in Europe but almost of starting all over again in those territories. This Government has given every assistance to those associated with the territories. As honourable members know, vast sums of money have been spent through the War Damage Commission.

Up to date the Government has been able to provide a certain number of ships, and it is now negotiating with the Australian Shipbuilding Board to see whether it would be possible to build a larger type of vessel, say about 500 tons, for use in the territories. One honourable member opposite said, during the second-reading debate, that there were only eleven medical officers in Papua and New Guinea. That is incorrect. At the present time there are 21 medical officers in Papua and New Guinea, although there were fewer than that at I have a letter here the end of the war.

It was only natural that during the war and immediately after the war, when accommodation and other necessary facilities were lacking, people were prevented from going there. But, since facilities have become available, I know of no instance of any person who has applied to enter New Guinea and is of reputable character having been prevented from going there. and Gore. able member for Balaclava know about New Guinea? the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) keeps quiet he will not remain here. clearly understood that to-day no attempt is made to keep any one out of the territory who has real business to take him there.

Therefore, I am confident that every facility will he given to those anxious to go to the territory and work in it.

Of course, there must he negotiation with the natives. There can be no such thing as merely possessing oneself of land in Papua or New Guinea. There must be the full consent of the natives. WhatI have in mind is that, instead of a person interested in taking up land having to go through all the processes, the Administrator will interview the native councils and indicate that applications have been made for land in certain areas, the making available of which would be in the best interests of the country.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 to 4 agreed to. Clause5 (Definitions). [8.26] I think that in this clause there is one thing that should be attended to by the committee. There should be a clarification of the meaning of the term "" elector "". "" Elector "", according to this clause, meansA person qualified and enrolled as an elector of the territory in accordance with the Ordinance. That is to be read in conjunction with clause 36, which saysI . The Legislative Council shall consist of 20 members, namely:(a) The Administrator; (6) sixteen officers of the territory (who shall be known as official members); (o) three non-official members possessing such qualifications as are provided by Ordinance and elected, as provided by Ordinance, by electors of the territory; We do not know from either clause 36 brought down in July last year, and the or clause 5 just what the Government present bill is almost identical with the has in its mind in regard to the term original bill. Therefore, the Government "" elector "". Particularly as this applies ought to have some idea of how it proto New Guinea, we do not know whether poses to define an elector. I have exthere are certain constructions upon the amined the statistics for the Territory of agreement between the Australian GoNew Guinea, and I find that, according vernment and the United Nations to the latest census figures, there is a Trusteeship Council that would limit, or population of 9,439 non-natives. Of thai perhaps extend, the area of electorship number 8,000 are Europeans, of whom in the Territory of New Guinea and, 160 are Germans and 280 citizens of the consequently, Papua, because it is perUnited States of America.

As clause 36 reads, Gullett, H. B. S. it would appear that the Australian Labour Government proposes to introduce into the territory some qualifications and extensions of qualifications, perhaps, that would be inconsistent with the electoral laws of the Commonwealth of Australia. If the Minister in charge of the hill ( Mr Chambers) can give an assurance that that is not so, we may be satisfied, but that would not get over the fact that if that is the intention of the Government, there is no earthly reason why it should not he stated in the definitions. The second matter upon which I wish to address the committee, and to which I referred in my second-reading speech, is the fact that reference to "" provinces "" is struck out. In the previous bill it was clearly the intention of the Government to divide the territories into provinces for administrative purposes, but in this bill the Government has denied itself the right to do that. I should like to know the Government's reasons for denying itself that right. I also should like to know what the definition of the term "" elector "" is or is likely to be.

303,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [8.30],"three out of 29 members of the Legislative Council are to be elected, so that the elected members will not have much say in the framing of legislation. Even after the council arrives at a majority decision, the Administrator may disregard it. He is to enjoy the power to veto. Nevertheless, the qualification of electors is important, and before this clause is agreed to the Minister should explain the situation. The clause merely states that an elector means a person qualified and enrolled as an elector of the territory in accordance with the ordinance. Thus, in effect, the Government will be empowered to define the qualifications of an elector, and the Minister should now be able to explain what the Government has in mind. desire to make the same point on slightly different ground. The Commonwealth Electoral Act, which governs the election of members to this Parliament, sets out iu detail the qualifications of electors. The qualifications are not defined in any rule or regulation issued under the act, but are contained in the act itself. Indeed, may, in due course, be fully informed on I do not know of any State statute, or any British act which has a provision corresponding to the clause we are now discussing. I do not know of any other piece of legislation which provides that the qualifications of an elector of any legislative body shall be defined in a regulation or rule, rather than in the enabling act itself. It is extraordinary that an elector should be defined, not in a part of the act, but in some out-of-the way regulation. Honourable members are familiar with the way in which regulations or rules are issued. They are promulgated by the Governor General in Council, which means, in effect, that a Cabinet Minister, at the behest of some departmental officer, submits the draft of a regulation. Then, the Governor General, sitting with perhaps only one Minister, puts his stamp on the regulation, and it becomes law. _ Later, in accordance with the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, the regulation is submitted to the Parliament and, in certain circumstances, may be disallowed. However, if it is not disallowed, it autotake time. In the meantime, the qualimatically becomes law. As a matter of fact, it is very difficult to have a regula tion disallowed. It is difficult, under the Standing Orders, to have a regulation even debated. If a very important pari of this legislation is to be embodied, not in the statute, but in regulations issued under the statute, the Parliament will be denied some of its law-making rights. 1 know of no right more important than that of prescribing who or what an elector shall be. Why cannot the qualifications of an elector be set out in this bill as they are in the Commonwealth Electoral Act? Why is the definition of the prospective electors of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea to be postponed until the making of a regulation at some time in the future, will be put through in a hole-and-corner method, and later laid on the table of this House? I ask the Minister to give an assurance that a provision will be inserted in the bill, if not at this stage, then when it is before the Senate, setting oui the qualifications of an elector of the Legislative Council. If he is not able to give an assurance on that point now, lei him consult with his advisers so that we this point. for the Army) [8.37] I wish to correct the honourable member for Parramattfi ( Mr Beale) on one point.

Honourable members need have no doubt that they will be afforded an opportunity to debate the regulation. [8.40] -The Minister for the Army( MrI repeat that there should be no difficulty Chambers) has raised the very question which I expected him to raise. He has said that this legislation will not become effective for about twelve months. We are all familiar with the method by which ordinances are made, and can be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. Once an ordinance is promulgated it has the force of law until it is disallowed. If an ordinance is promulgated fixing the conditions for the election of a legislative council in New Guinea the council could ibe elected before any opportunity occurred for this Parliament to consider the ordinance. Tn the meantime, the political complexion of the Parliament might change as the result of a general election, and the ordinance, when submitted to the Parliament, might be disallowed. For that reason, if for no other, this legislation should define an elector, and it can be done just as easily in the first instance as in the last. Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) answered my objection with a piece of hair-splitting when he reminded me that it was necessary for two Ministers to be present at a meeting of the Executive Council. ing the honourable member. whether one Minister or two must he present. My point was that the process of regulation-making was entirely perfunctory. The Governor General calls :i couple of Ministers together, and the regulation goes through. Usually, as we know, the Ministers themselves are not fully seized of the purport of the regulation. They accept the say-so of departmental officers, one of whom I see sitting behind the Minister now. sure of work is so great that the Ministers must take the say-so of their departmental officers, and, if the officers are trustworthy, there is not much wrong with that. However, it is for that reason all the more important that the Parliament should he vigilant, and zealous to retain its overriding authority. in setting forth in a separate clause tinqualifications of electors. The definition could be taken out of the Commonweal tb Electoral Act, and the necessary alterations made in 30 seconds with the stub of a pencil on a piece of paper. The Government prefers, however, to include the definition in a regulation which will be accepted by the Parliament without proper scrutiny or debate. In any case, during the weeks or months between the promnlgation of the regulation and its acceptance by the Parliament the regulation will be law-goo d or bad. It may be argued that this matter is not important in itself, but the important principle is involved, namely, that substantive matters ought to be included in statutes and not left to regulations. Clause agreed to. Clause 6Approval is given to the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international Trusteeship System by means of, and upon the terms of trusteeship embodied in. the Trusteeship Agreement. This clause is the piece de resistance of the bill. It appears in that section headed ""Part II The Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of New Guinea"" and give3 approval to the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system. The debate ou the second reading of the bill has emphasized the fact that the action of the Government in handing over the territory which we took from Germany in 1914, and over which our troops fought in the last war, was ill advised. It was due to the enthusiasm of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) for the United Nations, which he has put before the Empire, and before hi? own country.

The Minister for Defence -spar e the word "" defence ""-sai d thai no government had ever been appointed in the mandated territory. I invite him to read the Pacific Island Year Book of 1935-36, at page 276, where he w ill find over New the following:An important change in assisting the Government of the territory was brought about in May, 1933, when a new system was introduced, providing for a measure of self-government and also giving the unofficial community a voice in the administration, through the legislative council. . . . The amending New Guinea Act, which was passed by the of the territory, the lack Commonwealth Government in November, 1932. and which made provision for an executive council and a legislative council was brought into operation on May 2, 1933, The Minister for Defence does not even for External know, in 1949, what happened then. The extract continuesUnder this amending Act, the executive The Government has made a council, which is to advise and assist the Administrator, is to consist of nine members bewilderappointed by the Governor General, eight of whom shall be officers of the territory and be known as official members. ( Mr Beazley), who At the top of the list of members of the endeavoured to explain that Executive Council is the name of Mr H. H. Page, Government Secretary. Then follows the names of Mr H. 0. Townsend, Treasurer; Mr E. W. P. Chinnery, Director of Administrative The Minister for Defence Services and Native Affairs; Mr E. T. Brennan, Director of Public Health; The Mr G. H. Murray, Director of Agriculture; Mr G. G. Hogan, Crown Law Officer, and several others. The Pacific Islands Year-book gives details of the membership and activities of the council, yet the Minister for Defence, who is charged with responsibility not only for the Navy, the Army and the A ir Force, but also for the whole strategic concept of our defence, says that in the past, no government has operated in the territory. The Executive Council of New Guinea was abolished when war came and the country was placed under military administration. In this bill the Government proposes to resuscitate this local governing body which we established in the 'thirties. The Minister for the Army who, unhappily, has had this bill thrown into his lap, asks how we can defend New Guinea. Taking a leaf from the book of the honourable member for Fremantle, who said that whereas under the mandate we could not defend it, we can do so under the trusteeship, the Minister asked, "" What is the use of defending it ? "". He added that in these days of atom bomb warfare we could not defend New Guinea against a power using the atomic bomb even if we had 1,000,000 men there. was, of course, a slip of the tongue. At least it was a slight exaggeration. The honourable gentleman then proceeded to say that one atom bomb might wipe out the whole of our force. i said that it would wipe out the major proportion of the force. and say a dozen bombs. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! The honourable member must not depart from the provisions of the clause now before the committee. to the bill relates to the defences of the territory and therefore I am quite within my rights in addressing myself to that subject. The Minister said that a power using the atom bomb might easily annihilate a large defending army. If that is the fatalistic attitude of the Government, and if atomic warfare is to be the deciding factor, why have an army at all? bombs might destroy our defences. I did not refer to numbers of men. gentleman to try to get the Russians to believe that. The Russians believe thai numbers count. If there is danger to Australia to-day we shall need all the man-power we can obtain. Of course, there is a danger as the uprising in Asia, spurred on by the Communists at the Kremlin and assisted by traitors and fifth columnists in Asiatic countries and in Australia, comes nearer to our shores. The danger that faces ut to-day is the result of lack of man-power. If this country had a population of 50,000,000 or 100,000,000 we should not need to look at a territory as remote from us as New Guinea in the same way. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for the Army have told us in effect that the advertisements seeking recruits for the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army are unnecessary because an enemy using the atomic bomb could wipe them all out. Certainly a future war on a global basis would bring about indescribable horrors, but by no means can any one say that there is peace That number in the world to-day. We have some good imitations of warfare in China, Greece Burma and other places. In placing New Guinea under the' international trusteeship system the Government has acted stupidly. The honourable member for Fremantle, who endeavoured to make a good case for the Government's action, said that under the "" C "" class mandate we could not defend New Guinea, but that I shall be generous under the Trusteeship Agreement no such limitation was placed upon us. The Minister in charge of the bill did not know that Opposition members were fully seized of that fact. The honourable gentleman said that no defensive measures had been taken in New Guinea. He and others who served in New Guinea should know that artillery units had been established at Port Moresby before the war. The garrisons at Ambon and Rabaul. which were overwhelmed by the enemy, were sent there by the present Government. Defence consists not merely of guns, coastal defences and garrison troops; it also involves proper preparations for the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, and the making of airports and landing grounds to enable forces to be flown to strategic points without loss of time.",72,Paibs

From which provision do honourable gentlemen clusion that our defence rights are somehow whittled away by the United Nations, and that Australia w ill be compelled to report its defence measures to that organization? The only one that could possibly be misinterpreted as having such a meaning is Article 6, which readsThe Administering Authority further undertakes to apply in the Territory the provisions of such international agreements and such recommendations of the specialized agencies referred to in Article 57 of the Charter as are, in the opinion of the Administering Authority, suited to the needs and conditions of the Territory and conducive to the achievement of the basic objectives of the trusteeship system. Tn other words the agreements of Unesco, the World Health Organization and the other specialized agencies of the United Nations that have a humanitarian taken into serious consideration by the administering authority. B ut even on such a matter as that, we are not bound to apply the authority of the United Nationsi n the territory. Honourable members opposite, who have referred to Soviet Russiai n this connection, may as well admit that the Russian Government found serious objection to the agreement which Australia has made, but on different grounds fro m those which honourable gentlemen opposite have taken to the bill. The Russians regarded this proposal as an old annexation written as a new trusteeship. The agreement, where it does provide for the making of reports to the United Nations under Article& ahd the obligations which the Australian Government has agreed to discharge to the organization, consists almost wholly of guarantees to the native population. The honourable member for Balaclava has stated, quite rightly, that in the two territories, the Australian Government ha* always pursued a very liberal native policy based upon the best colonial traditions of such administrators as Lord Lugard. 1 am not suggesting that there was never anything wrong with Australia's administration in the territory, and I consider that the Australian Government, over many years, should have spent a little more money there instead of endeavouring at many points to make it self-supporting. Nevertheless, Australia opposite draw the constood very well with the League of Nations and other countries, and I do not believe for a moment that if the Opposition parties assume office as the government, they will amend this legislation. The international repercussions of such an action would be extremely serious. Australia would then be the only western power that regarded international law with contempt. The United States of America, whose virtues are frequently quoted in this House by members of the Opposition, has accepted trusteeship under the United Nations. Honourable members opposite say that that for m of trust is very different from that which is proposed in this bill in relation to New Guinea. Of course it is! What is the significance of the native populations in those purely sti'ategic islands that the United States objective are to be of America has taken over ? Some of the islands are not populated, but they possess an important strategic value. Are we to be asked to believe that, if the United States of America had' a mandate in which there were 1,000,000 native people, instead of a number of strategic atolls, it would have emphasized defence to the exclusion of the references that we have made to the need for international supervision of native policy? I am not aware of any action by the United States of America to annex any territories that it has taken over as trust territories. There was a certain point of view in the American War Department, hut it found little support in Congress and no support from the President himself. There is a continual pretence in this Souse, that because the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) happens to be the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Australia is the only country that values that organization. I can agree with members of the Opposition, in their general argument concerning international defence and the maintenance of international peace, that the United Nations should' be regarded realistically as an organization that is not working, but I am amazed when the United States of America and Great Britain are held up to us as virtuous, but that, somehow or other, when they appear on the Security Council, they are not virtuous. The United Nations is taken as an abstract entity, and the countries which compose it, still happening to be those recommended to us by members of the Opposition, are regarded in that capacity as useless. We may have some objection to the United Nations from a defence stand-point, but it passes my understanding that members of the Opposition, who, when they formed the government of this country, faithfully carried out every humanitarian obligation that the League of Nations imposed upon Australia should now criticize this clause. The mandate system of the league was a success. operation in world health under the League of Nations was also a success. Trusteeship is a perpetuation of one of the agencies of the league, carried over into the United Nations, and I think that it justifies itself. Therefore, the Government is on sound ground in continuing the policy that honourable gentlemen opposite previously pursued, with this difference that, whereas under the mandate system we had no defensive rights in the territory, we have defensive rights under the international trusteeship system. expressed those views in his second reading speech. opposite may object to those statements being repeated. any honourable member opposite analyse the sections of the Trusteeship Agreement to which the Opposition has objected. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! Members of the Opposition must not interject. bers opposite and Government supporter* have participated in this debate in the ratio of four to one, and I have noticed the complete paucity of the reference 1 of honourable members opposite to the actual terms of the agreement. We gei the most amazing implications woven into the agreement, but no references have been made to specific words in order to justify such implications. Therefore, 1 contend that except for the modification that confers complete sovereign rights on this country in respect of defence, the proposal is simply iperpetuating the policy that the Opposition parties pursued very successfully for twenty year* from 1921 to 1941.

After Japan entered the war, the Labour Government cringed to America to save us from invasion. When the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) announced that the Government proposed to place New Guinea under the Trusteeship Council, I said that such a policy did not make sense, and the Minister for Defence( Mr with which to hunt them out of the ParDedman) and the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) looked across at me, indicating plainly that they agreed with my view. I shall now tell the other part of the story in order to reveal the hypocrisy of the Government. This will be the first occasion on which I have been guilty of repeating in the chamber a statement that an honourable member has made to me outside of it. In normal circumstances, I do not believe that such conversations should be repeated here. I propose to break my rule in order to prove the hypocrisy not only of the Government, but also of the Minister for External Affairs himself. The occasion was a send-off to the Minister for External Affairs before he went abroad in 1946. The Prime Minister bade him farewell, and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the Australian people ashamed of the Menzies) joined in the felicitations to him. I , in the course of conversation with the Minister, said, in effect, "" This trusteeship does not make sense to me"", and he told me that he did not believe in it himself, but that he was forced into the arrangement by pressure from the smaller countries. It hurts me to repeat a conversation that took place outside the chamber and I hope that circumstances will never again compel me to do so. I should rather cut off my right hand than offend in that way, but I have done so in order to prove that members of the Government are a gang of hypocrites and that the Minister for External Affairs himself is a hypocrite who does not believe in the principles of this bill. I challenge honourable members opposite to rise in their places, consult their consciences and deny that statement. I do not believe that 2 per cent, of them will be prepared to do so. for Griffith( Mr Conelan) knows that 1 despise the wretched things that the Government has done here. I urge the Government to have some consideration foi the feelings of the relatives of Australian servicemen, who lost their dear ones in New Guinea. Have honourable members opposite no shame?

The philosopher Aristophanes, who lived in 400 B.C. and wrote the humorous tale of the frog, defined "" shame "" in the following words:"" Shame is the apprehension of a vision reflected from the surface of opinion-the opinion of the public"". Shame now seems to be the role of the Labour Government or rather the Government is trying to make manner in which this country has treated the natives of New Guinea during the last twenty years. How dare it do such a thing, posing as the representative of the Australian people? Why is this clause included in the bill ? It reads as follows:Approval is given to the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the International Trusteeship System by means of, and upon the terms of trusteeship embodied in, the Trusteeship Agreement. What is the background to that clause? The Minister for External Affairs, in order that he might be elected as president of the General Assembly of the . United Nations, wanted to obtain the votes of the smaller nations. Those nations would not be worth twopennyworth of gin in a war.

They dare not despise them. They know that if they do not obey their masters they will be lost. You may well hang your heads in shame. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . ( Mr Sheehy) -Order! The honourable gentleman must address the Chair. why the clause has been included in this measure, and every honourable gentleman opposite knows it. They dare not go against their masters. Let us see what is really at the bottom of this business of inferior peoples being controlled by superior peoples. For years a pseudo-science has been growing up. [t was started by Professor Elkin in Sydney. I refer to the pseudo-science of anthropology. I do not wish to be too critical, but I say that very few people are fitted to be anthropologists. A gang of men, having failed to obtain university degrees, for which a knowledge of higher mathematics and languages is required, have put themselves forward as anthropologists. They have joined the Department of External Affairs and the Department of External Territories, where they are permitted to indulge in this pseudo-science. They are the people who have been at the elbow of the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) and have forced the issue. They have the ear of the Government. That is the only other reason that I can suggest why this wretched clause is contained in the bill and why we have sold our birth right in New Guinea. I cannot mention anthropologists without referring to Doctor Stanner, who fully understands the effect of the impact of the neolithic man on the white man. Dr. Stanner came to the Northern Territory and did a marvellous job there, but he was not wanted in New Guinea. It is obvious that a man of Dr.. Stanner's outstanding ability was not wanted by the Minister for External Territories, because he knew too much and would not submit to the nonsense of the half-baked anthropologists who are controlling New Guinea. I contend thai missionaries and not anthropologists arewanted there. The sooner these pseudoanthropologists are dismissed and Dr.. Stanner brought back, the better it will be and the sooner we shall be able to have a true anthropological outlook in connection with the natives of New Guinea. When honourable members opposite are in Opposition after the next general election, the new governmenr will need to start almost de novo in New Guinea. It is common knowledge that there I have given the reason are 1,000,000 squatters in Malaya. They are Chinese who came from China and each took up 2 or 3 acres of jungle land there. They have been squatting there for years and living off 3 acres of paw-paws and bananas and a few pigs. They have been living on the country. They have no security of tenure; they are simply squatters. They are now being subjected to blackmail, just as some honourable members of the Parliament have been subjected to blackmail. Some of the Government's senior mad doctors know all about blackmail. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

Not only are they blackmailing these peaceable squatters who befriended Australian prisoners of war in Malaya, but they are also, in order to obtain food or money, blackmailing the Chinese foremen of the great mining companies there and murdering Australians and Englishmen. Needless to say, no action has been taken by this Government to send a force to Malaya, as the United Kingdom Government did quite recently. The honourable member night how the British Government throughout the years had given away its authority in Africa and India. The Attlee Government gave Burma its freedom, which was a grievous mistake. The Attlee Government sent Sir Edward Gent to make peace with the people of Malaya, after giving them their freedom. I propose to speak no ill of the dead. It is unfortunate that Sir Edward Gent, while on his way back * to the United Kingdom to report to the British Government after having made a mess of Malaya, was killed in an aeroplane accident. In Malaya he went around shaking hands with all the inferior people and saying, "" Y o u are fit to govern yourselves. Here is your -country. Carry on"". We know what happened. The gangsters, cut throats and murderers moved in, and British regiments had to be sent back to restore order. This Government looked idly on. The British Government called Sir Edward Gent back in order to ask him what he meant by making such an as of himself. However,.the poor fellow was killed in an aeroplane accident, so we shall never know how he might have been chastised. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order.' The honourable member's time has expired. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) has spoken with great feeling. That is understandable. The honourable gentleman served with the Australian Imperial Force in Malaya.

If the honourable gentleman spoke with some warmth, his reasons for so doing are understood at least by honourable members on this side of the chamber. I now propose to say something regarding the nature of the agreement that ought to have been entered into by any Australian government, irrespective of its political complexion. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) made a gallant defence of the Government, in the course of which he said that during the debate for every four Opposition speakers only one Government supporter had spoken. The members of the Labour party are in the majority in this chamber. It is an indication of their interest in this vital matter that for every four members of the Opposition only one of them has sufficient interest or sense of party discipline to defend the Government's actions. people. Honourable members opposite can say anything they like. member for Fremantle claims that he is a responsible person. I have never heard eo much irresponsible drivel as the honourable gentleman uttered tonight. In the course of his speech he manipulated articles and clauses and twisted facts so that even a Philadelphia lawyer could not have understood him. In addition to manipulating facts, figures and cla.uses the honourable gentleman said that the United States of America might have insisted upon annexation if the State Department had had its way, but that Congress was against such action. The true position is the reverse of that. In a book entitled Trustee/ship in the Pacific, it is clearly pointed out that it was the Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America who insisted upon annexation and that the State Department resisted them because it felt that it was bound, as the Australian Minister for External Affairs (Dr. 'Evatt) was bound, by the international obligations that had been entered into.

Let us look at the interfering inquisition that is now being imposed upon Australia. I shall quote examples of Trusteeship Council.

The Opposition's whole attitude is unrealistic. The honourable member went on with a dramatic recital of what happened in New Guinea as far as our own forces there were concerned. [ listened to that portion of his speech with respect, but in the next breath the honourable member talked about selling the pass. He is certainly not supported by the people of Australia. No matter what the sacrifices made in New Guinea were they were made with an ally beside us. There is no conflict on Pacific policy between Australia and the United States of America. Does the Opposition think that it is a bad thing to have a common point of view with the United States of America on Pacific policy, when it babbles about strategic trusteeships rather countries or they accept this proposal. 1 than the trusteeship provided for in the bill? The Opposition has talked in hyperbole about the whole matter. Let us be practical. Isi t not good to know that the United States of America has armed these islandswith airstrips for planes that can bestride the Pacific in our defence? Yet honourable members opposite talk nonsense about what might happen in New Guinea. Even at the weakest point of trusteeship we are given the power to erect defences in New Guinea. If the rabble-rousers and sabre-rattlers opposite had their way we would seize New Guinea and say to the rest of the world, "" What are you going to do about it? "" If honourable members opposite have made any study of the various documents regarding this issue that are available in the Parliamentary Library, it was only recently, and the period of digestion has yet to be completed. The undigested scraps that we have heard from the honourable member for Richmond show that the Opposition has made no long study of the matter.. That honourable member started his speech by attacking the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley).

The conclusion I draw is that whatever the honourable gentleman learned about New Guinea only recently has not been of much benefit to him. Certain clear points emerge. Either honourable gentlemen opposite want us to annex the Territory of New Guinea and thereby proclaim to the world that we are the equals of the undemocratic concede that we have some sacred rights to the territory which we have earned by sacrifice; but that does not say that we should annex it.

It is stupid for honourable gentlemen opposite to try to whip up public fury with slogans about giving .away our birth right in New Guinea. We had no birth right in New Guinea. New Guinea came to us by the conquest of Germany. The United Nations stands for the removal of tension between nations. It is idle for honourable gentlemen opposite to talk about island specks in the Pacific like the fortresses in the Carolines, Truk and other places. In those places there is no native problem, and a trusteeship that is merely a strategic "" Annexation"" is a sinister word. It trusteeship is applicable. The Trusteeship Council allows their fortification. They were used by the Japanese. Can one blame our valiant allies, the Americans, for wanting to fortify them? We should be thankful to the Americans for fortifying them. We should he realistic and appreciate that the spearhead of our defences has been taken 2,000 miles farther from us. In New Guinea, however, we have the task of lifting the standard of the natives. That was the task given to us by the League of Nations. We were charged with developing that country in a democratic way in order that eventually the black people there may reach the highest possible standard under the tutelage of the white man. The statements, made for political purposes, about the defence of New Guinea do not apply. The defences have been moved farther forward. I can not understand the basis of the claims of honourable members opposite that we should annex New Guinea. If the fear is in their mind that Russia might probe the administration in New Guinea, I remind This clause is them that we have nothing to hide. If In the deliberations they believe that any fortress can be hidden from potential enemies, they have learnt little from the last war, the war before it and even from the Trojan War. I marvel at their contention that we must annex New Guinea in order to defend it. The Trusteeship Agreement provides for the necessary fortification of New Guinea, in any case. But honourable gentlemen opposite perform an amazing somersault when they say. Such talk in on the one hand, that we should give Manus Island to the Americans in order to take a defence burden from our shoulders and, on the other, that New Guinea is a strategic area that we should annex for defence purposes. I remind them that we do not own the whole of the mainland of New Guinea. There is first British New Guinea. Then we have that part of the mainland and the islands that come under the Trusteeship Agreement. Then there is Dutch New Guinea. What the Australian people ought to keep in mind is that "" trusteeship "" means a great deal. The literal meaning of "" trusteeship"" is strong reeks of the rattling of sabres and it belongs to the past. We must conclude that the whole opposition to this clause is expressed in antagonism not to what has heen done in New Guinea but to the decision by votes in the United Nations on trusteeships. Trusteeships are a substitute for mandates, which fell into disuse because of the disappearance of the League of Nations. One of three courses had to be taken, and, in my opinion, the best was taken. courses were annexation, trusteeship or the taking over of the mandate by the United Nations itself. By a series of discussions Trusteeship Council found a formula for the settlement of the New Guinea question. It would be wrong for us, a young country, which has been assailed in the East for not having developed our own territory, to be reaching out for islands when we have no money to spend on them. r,hen? ligent a remark as I could expect from the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr ferred into the Pacific area. I am quite Holt). I imagine that both in service and in brains he has little to give away. I am talking seriously about a serious subject. [ yield nothing to the Opposition in my regard for the service and devotion of the Australian troops and their American allies, but I should be chary of using them as a stalking horse to advance the plea of "" Let us annex this country "". Honourable gentlemen opposite may say, "" We are through with the United Nations; let us run to the Americans to look after us "", but that is appallingly absurd and it shows that the Opposition has never been sincere in this debate. The whole case of the Opposition has rested on personal attacks on honourable members on this side of the chamber. The contributions of honourable gentlemen opposite to this discussion has been meagre and their conclusions absurb. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The Government has made a colossal blunder. If what we have just heard from the honourable member' for Parkes( Mr Eaylen) is the apology for the blunder, it is a most pathetic apology. All honourable members with goodwill for Australia and regard for the service rendered by its men in two world wars must have listened to his claptrap with disgust. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), which the Government ought to accept,aims at placing the Territory of New Guinea, not The under the trusteeship system as intended, but under the strategic trusteeship system that, with the approval of the Security Council of the United Nations, has been and elaborations the adopted by the United .States of America in relation to its trusteeships. No honourable member can be satisfied with the Government's proposal. I believe that all Government supporters, including the-, honourable member for Parkes, are disgusted at what has happened. That i& why we have had such a flimsy reply from the honourable member for Parkes, who floundered in trying to build a case on personal references to honourable gentlemen on this side. I believe that world problems and difficulties will be transsatisfied that the trend of events in international affairs to-day, with the tragedy that has taken place in Japan and Korea. which has been overrun The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! This is not a debate on international affairs. the importance of New Guinea and showing why we should have a strategic trusteeship and not the one proposed.

358,Mr Francis,"No; I am pointingour bastion in the circumstances that T am endeavouring to bring to the notice of the Government, which does not appreciate their importance. By this proposal the Government will place the Australian people for many years in great danger of attack. The clause provides for approval for the placing of the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system. That will, hamper our opportunity to develop the defences of New Guinea. We are to have a certain minor authority under the trusteeship system to set up certain defences, but if honourable gentlemen read the other provisions of the trusteeship system, they will realize that any other nation will have the opportunity to spy throughout New Guinea and find out exactly what we are doing to defend it. As other speakers on this side have said, the United States of America would not stand for that; but this Government proposes foolishly that Australia should stand for it. The United States will not allow any person into the islands over which it has strategic trusteeship except hy special permission, but we ahall have to admit freely into New Guinea whatever representatives other nations like to send there. The Government's proposals are the opposite to those that the United States regards as essential to the strategical protection of all its obligato maintain control over the strategic tions in the Pacific. The Government has fallen down on its job, and has placed tween Australia and Asia. That point Australia in a very difficult position. I cannot allow the clause to go through without voicing my protest. New Guinea and the islands adjacent to it were acquired by Australia during the first world war. For a time during the second war we lost them, but by our efforts, and those of our allies, we won them back. After the first world war, we administered charges against any one in his absence. New Guinea under a mandate from the League of Nations. Then the league died, and the territory came back to us. It is Australia's duty to defend it. Our contention is that New Guinea should not he held under a trusteeship as defined in this clause, but should be held told the House that this was not the first under a strategic trusteeship which we would have the right to administer without supervision by the Trusteeship Council. New Guinea is a bastion for the defence of Australia. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, and try to undo the damage which has already been done. honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) twitted the Opposition for pressing the Government to take more definite action in regard to New Guinea because the war aims of Churchill and Roosevelt, as expressed on our behalf, included the principle of no annexation after the war. At that time, we all subscribed to the policy enunciated by those statesmen, and had it been applied there would be very little force in our present argument. But we are dealing with circumstances which exist in 1949. I ask the honourable member for Parkes, and those who support him, whether Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were included in the war aims as defined by Churchill and Roosevelt? Were Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary included? Was the Communist onrush in China, Malaya and now in India foreseen at the time the statement of war aims was made? Of course, those occurrences were not visualized at thai time, and those who are responsible for the security of Australia cannot ignore recent developments. Therefore, we have to point out the vital need for Australia territory of New Guinea, which lies bewas developed during the second-reading debate on the bill, and I do not propose to go over it again, but merely to submit two points for the consideration of the committee. I regret that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) is not here now. He was in the chamber earlier, and will, perhaps, be here later. I regret his absence, because I do not like to make I charge the Prime Minister with having misled the Parliament and the people as to the consequences of the actions taken by the Government in connection with the trusteeship issue. Earlier to-day, the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) opportunity we had had to deal with the trusteeship issue. He reminded us that in August, 1946, the Prime Minister made",85,Paibs
359,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [10.2],"Th ea statement to the Parliament and that, from that time onwards, honourable members had the opportunity to deal with the issue. The TEMPORARY ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member cannot in committee refer ro a second-reading speech. [ am discussing the clause now before the committee. On the subject of the trusteeship, we were given an assurance by the Prime Minister in August, 1946, and I quote his exact words as recorded in volume 188 of Hansard, for the 7th August, at page 2584Eventually Australian legislation will be required to give effect to the trusteeship agreeon 13th December, 1940. In Australian constiment and to make the appropriate amendments in the New Guinea Act. As the General Assembly will not meet until September at the earliest, it will not be possible to bring the necessary measures before the Souse during the present session. f f those words mean anything they mean that Australia could not be committed on this issue of trusteeship until the matter had been determined by legislation in this Parliament. Minister's language was clear and unequivocal. The statement was made, not by a back bencher, but by the Prime Minister himself. The legislation now before the Parliament is the first the Government has brought down dealing with the subject since the Prime Minister made his statement, and this is the first opportunity the Parliament has had to decide the issue in accordance with the assurance then given by the Prime Minister that eventually legislation would be required to give effect to the trusteeship agreement. honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), he tricked the Parliament and the people of Australia. The fact that he tricked us is brought out in an official document issued by the Government. I refer now to the publication, Current Notes, issued by the Department of External Affairs, volume 20, issue No. 1, at page 92, in which is published a report of the discussions which took place in the Trusteeship Council when it was dealing with the proposal for a joint administration of Papua and New Guinea. The representatives of China and the Philippines raised this very issue. They said, in effect, that Ausuntil the issue had been dealt with by the Australian Parliament. They might not have known of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister, but they knew I do not propose to do so. the common practice in the democracies of the world. The reply of Australia's representative, given in December, 1947. a little more than a year after the undertaking by the Prime Minister, is recorded as follows:It was stated in reply that the agreement did not require ratification and entered into full force on its approval by the General Assembly tutional practice, ratification where required was an executive and not a legislative act Legislation was necessary only to give effect in domestic law to an agreement binding Australia internationally. In this case, ratification was not necessary as the agreement had been proposed by the Australian Government and approved by the General Assembly and entered into full force from that date. When we are told that we should have protested earlier against the action of the The Prime Government, I throw the statement back in the teeth of those who make it . The Prime Minister gave a solemn assurance that legislation was necessary to give effect, to the agreement. That legislation is now before the Parliament, but Australia's official representative on the Trusteeship Council said that the agreement was in f u l l force from the moment, that the United Nations adopted it . The second assurance of the Prime Minister concerned this fundamental consideration to which he referred. I quote his remarks as recorded on page 3853 of Hansard of the 7th August, 1946, as follows:Australia will have complete and exclusive power in controlling the administration of New Guinea and that the only limitation upon this control is the obligation to carry out the duties imposed by the charter. I again refer to the official report of the proceedings of the Trusteeship Council as reported in Current Notes. The report includes a summary of proceedings before the council when Australia brought up its proposal for the joint administration of Papua and New Guinea. A t that meeting, the representative of Australia was placed in the humiliating position of",86,Paibs

362,Mr Holt,"Yes, in the words of thebeing in the dock under cross-examination by the representatives of a variety of countries including, as an ironic travesty of justice, Soviet Russia, which had overrun many of the Baltic countries and several other European countries as well. Notwithstanding that record it assumed the right to probe into our administration of New Guinea. We have been assured that Australia merely advised the Trusteeship Council as a matter of courtesy of its intention to unify the administration of Papua and New Guinea. However, the report of the discussions in the Trusteeship Council make it very clear that the council regarded itself as having a very direct interest and authority in the matter. In the concluding recommendation, it was stated that the council would review the matter of an administrative union in the light of the conclusions previously expressed, and also in the light of the views expressed in tie council. It is obvious from the discussions in the Trusteeship Council that the matter is by no means closed. Australia's decision to form an administrative union is not regarded by the council as binding. It reserves the right to review our action. My contention that the matter is not to be dealt with finally by this Parliament is supported by the view put forward hy our representative at the meeting of the Trusteeship Council. Australia was pressed to refer the matter of the union to the International Court of Justice, and our representative in the dock had to come back with counter proposals. He saidI t would be premature to refer the question tion of this clause, the uglier it become?. to the court when the legislative processes have not yet been completed, and the final form of the bill was unknown. He said in effect, "" Let us get the bill through first, and then, if you like, refer the legislation to the International Court of Justice "". The bill referred to is still before the Parliament. sentative also advanced the argument that reference of the matter to the Court of International Justice at that stage might tend to preclude the redrafting of the bill. In other words, an indication was given of what kind of bill should be brought down to bring about an administrative union, and that if we were to refer the draft of the bill to the Court of Internationa] Justice opportunity might be given for the reconsideration of the objections which those countries might have to the redraft. At page 87 the report saysSome representatives would have liked to sec n phrase added to this operative clause requiring the Australian Government to refrain from action to implement the B ill 'before it* review and report to the Council, and when this sub-section was considered in the Council, the President stated it was his understanding that the Government would not in the meanwhile act and present the Council with a "" fait accompli "". In other words, we were told that the council did not want us to pass the bill until the Court of International Justice had had an opportunity to deal with it in order to assuage the representatives of Costa Rica and other countries represented at that meeting. The President stated that it was his understanding that the council would not be presented with a fait accompli. We have committed ourselves, in the course of these arrangements, to supervision by the Trusteeship Council, to periodical inspection and to inquiries such as the 283 put to us in a questionnaire by people who. quite obviously from the nature of tin certain questions they asked, have no idea of conditions in this relatively savage and undeveloped part of the world. Our actions undoubtedly have to imeet with the approval of the Trusteeship Council. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The further one goes with the examinaI suppose that every reasonable member on both sides of this chamber will agree with the proposition that full control of New Guinea as an integral part of thi Australian Commonwealth is strategically and vitally necessary to this country. 5 Our repreuse the words "" integral part of the Australian Commonwealth "" 'because they are the precise words that were adopted at the Versailles Peace Conference and agreed upon, even by President Wilson, who was a great protagonist-indeed , a fanatical protagonist-of the mandate principle. In that connection, 1 refer the committee to another pas sage which appears in the book, Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeships, by",87,Chairman Tralia Could Not Determine The Matter
363,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [10.17],"Fl. DuncanH a l l , fro m which I quoted last night. A t page 123, the author <aysPresident Wilson's general line was that the control of the Territory of New Guinea choice of tlie States to be named mandatories must remain an open question. But at times ho spoke as if he took for granted that the occupying States were to become the mandatories. What he had to say, for example, on 27 January about South-West Africa showed that he regarded South Africa as the inevitable mandatory. Buti t indicated also another point that was to be of interest 27 years later of the Ministerf o r ExternalA f f a i rf to Field-Marshal Smuts-stil l the great leader of his country-whe n South Africa was to raise the question before the United Nations Assembly of the union of South-West Africa with South Africa. The ultimate union of this territory with the mandatory would seem, President Wilson said, a "" natural union "". [ emphasize those words. I remind the committee, hy way of interpolation, that Professor Birdsall, who is an eminent authority on this question, and who was present at the peace conference as a delegate, suggested that "" ""Wilson certainly agreed, implicitly, to an eventual grant of some sort of title to the possessor nations"". reference to "" C "" even opposed to the European and British delegates, including Field Marshal Smuts and others, agreed to the proposition that South-WestA f r i c a and New Guinea must necessarily hecome annexed to the two adjoining countries. In other words, he accepted the proposition that they should ultimately he the subject of a "" natural union "" with the two adjoining countries, the Union of SouthA f r i c a and Australia respectively. I continue with the quotation as follows:It was up to the Union of South Africa to make it so attractive that South-West Africa would come into the Union of their own free will, and, he (President Wilson) declared, if successful administration by a mandatory should lead to union with the mandatory, he would be the last to object. This and similar passages show that President Wilson did not take the doctrinaire view that the "" natural end"" of a mandate was independence, since what mattered was the ""true wishes"" of the people; and these wishes, when they could be ascertained, "" might . . . .perhaps lead them to desire their union with the mandatory power "". From this followed logically the President's adoption of the idea of the administration of "" C "" mandates as an "" integral portion "" of the mandatory's own territory. T have quoted those passages because I have suggested that any reasonable perJfr. Beale. son who approaches the consideration of this matter in an objective way cannot deny the proposition that the fullesi as an integral portion of the Commonwealth of Australia is strategically and fundamentally necessary to us. The question that then emerges if whether the trusteeship, which has been brought about by the action (Dr. E v a t t ) , amounts to something les9 than f u l l control. The answer to that proposition was supplied by the single reference which I made last night. I remind the committee thai Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations sets out the basic objectives of the trusteeship and that Articles4 and 5 of the Trusteeship Agreement into which Australia has entered are subject to the basic principles set out in Article 76 of the Charter. Paragraph d of those basic objectives provides that we must so administer the territory as "" to ensure We reach this, that with equal treatment in social, economic and class mandates, commercial matters for all members of President Wilson, who was the United Nations and their nationals "", and also equal treatment for the latter in the administration of justice. Isi t suggested that a condition like that which has been imposed upon us does not derogate from our sovereignty? Isi t suggested that, having that obligation cast upon us, we are free in the defence of the territory to close its doors against those whom we do not wish to admit. We are bound to admit every national of the members of the United Nations and to grant to them equal terms in social, economic and commercial matters. In all respects the nationals of other members of the United Nations are to have equal rights with us. I s it suggested that all the members of the United Nations should have equal rights w i th us inside the Commonwealth of Australia? Of course it is not! I say, without any desire to give offence, that the nationals of most of the other members of the United Nations are foreigners to us. In Australia, we govern and direct our own affairs as we please, yet in respect of a strategic country like New Guinea, the Minister for External Affairs, by his action at the United Nations, has cast upon us the intolerably onerous condition that we should extend equal rights to every .member of the United Nations. .That brief statement .should answer completely the comment made by the-honourable-member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and others that the trusteeship does not really amount to anything less-than full integral control. It clearly amounts to something much less than that. fact, it amounts to such a derogation from our sovereignty and .control that, in time of war, or nearwar, when an enemy is approaching .our gates, when infiltrations are taking place, and when-if I might use the expression -the red tide is flowing south towards -our borders, this country will be put in a position of peril. With Tne, my country comes first. Its preservation is all that concerns me. are the only considerations that matter to me. .1 feel that every honourable -member in this chamber feels the same. Apart from the overriding. strategic and national obligation, can we justify our refusal to hand over this territory to 'the control of the United Nations on other grounds? answer to that question is "" Yes"". I do 60, first, because in 1919 a compromise -arrangement was 'reached in regard to mandates. In those days, there were antagonistic ""points of view among the delegates at the peace conference. The representatives of the British Empire wanted complete control of strategic and fundamental areas, but President Wilson, the starry-eyed idealist, wanted the mandate system despite the fact that his advisers counselled him against it. A compromise arrangement was reached, and "" C "" class mandates came into being. It was implicit and -clearly known to the representatives at the peace conference that such a form -of control would result in the ultimate absorption of New Guinea into Australian territory, and of German South-West Africa into the Union of South Africa. The second reason that entitles me to .say that we are justified in refusing to hand over the control of New Guinea to the United Nations is that after the League of Nations became as dead as the dodo Australia was no longer under any F32] .obligation to hand the Territory of New .Guinea to :any other 'country, or .to administer it for the benefit of any one else, apart from the moral .obligation to administer it for the benefit of the natives. If that were not so, why did we pour our blood and treasure into the defence of .New Guinea? The League of Nations no longeT existed, and, subject to In our moral obligation to look after the natives, we became entitled to administer :the country as we thought fit. .Notwithstanding that, in 1946 the Minister for .External Affairs, with ;a .flourish of trumpets, handed the territory over to the United Nations. South Africa, on the other hand, realizing that war ends all existing arrangements and necessitates a fresh start, said, in effect, ""-The possession bf .German South-West Africa -is vital to us, and must come under our My country, and its danger, control"". The third reason that justifies us in.re.fusing to hand over to the United Nations the Territory of New Guinea is that our war experiences from 1939 to 1945 have proved conclusively that complete control of New Guinea as an integral part of the Commonwealth of Australia is I say that the essential. When our representatives went to Lake Success and used the phrase "" integral .part of the Commonwealth of Australia"", our representative on the the Trusteeship CouncilI suspect that he was a Russian-objected , and added a qualification. The Australian delegates should have replied, ""We refuse to accept the qualification. New Guinea is an integral part of Australia. Those are the precise words that were used in .1919. If -you do not like it, we shall annex New Guinea"", but instead of taking a firmistaud, they rolled over on their backs like puppies, and, as the result, we have .got into this shocking mess. In .my opinion, this clause constitutes .a betrayal of this country. I do not propose to relate the history of mandates, but I shall emphasize two points. The first .is that, in entering into the '.Trusteeship Agreement, the Australian Government was morally bound'to obtain the best agreement possible. 'It failed to do so. It is all very well for the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) to say thafthe present agreement confers completely sovereign right on",88,Chairman Tralia Could Not Determine The Matter
364,,"Mr ABBOTT (New .England) [10.30].thiB country in respect of the trusteeship. To support his contentions, he read Article4 of the Fourth Schedule to the bill, which statesThe Administering Authority will be responsible for the peace, order, good government and defence of the Territory and for this purpose will have the same powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction in and over the Territory as if it were an integral part of Australia, and will be entitled to apply to the Territory, subject to such modifications as it deems desirahle, such laws of the Commonwealth of Australia as it deems appropriate to the needs and conditions of the Territory. He also read Article7 of the Fourth Schetluie, which statesThe Administering Authority may take all measures in the Territory which it considers desirable to provide for the defence of the Terr'itory and for maintenance of international peace and security. The honourable member considers that Australia will have completely sovereign rights in the territory. Does any country which has sovereign rights report to an outside authority and open its military installations to inspection iby members of such a body 1 Of course it does not! That would be a complete negation of sovereign rights. The United States of America has obtained a strategic area trusteeship former Japanese mandates in the Pacific, and that is the principal reason why I support the amendment which the honourable Anthony) mittee accepts that amendment, we shall have an infinitely better agreement in the interests of the defence of Australia we have in the present proposal. United Nations approved, and almost without United strategic area trusteeships. vision in that agreement the United the administering time as closed for security reasons. areas are vast. America Pacific war. If we are to make effective use of New Guinea in the defence of Australia, we need a strategic area trusteeship and not the present nebulous arrangement. The honourable member for Parramatta Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations which provides that all members Mr AKhntt. of the United Nations shall receive equal treatment in social, economic and commercial matters. The effect of that provision w i ll be that Australia w ill have no commercial rights in New Guinea superior to those of the other members of the United Nations. The strategic area trusteeship, which the United States of America has obtained, provides that each member of the United Nations shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that granted to any other member except the administering authority. The administering authority, in other words the .United States, is given certain preferential treatment compared w it h that accorded to other members of the United Nations, and, consequently, it holds a much stronger position in relation to its trusteeship territory than Australia will hold in relation to New Guinea. In those two matters, the Government has let this country down badly. We have not obtained a strategic area trusteeship, or incorporated in our agreement a provision granting to us preferential treatment in New Guinea compared w i th that accorded to other members of the United Nations. For those two reasons, 1 strongly support the amendment. over Question putThat the words proposed to be left out ( Mr clause. member for Richmond( Mr has submitted. If the comThe Committee divided.

If what I surmise is correct and if the investigations that may be made by the Trusteeship Council supervisors will lead to inquiries being conducted in Australian territory, there will be a possibility of espionage occurring in that territory. The defences that we are permitted to establish in New Guinea under the Trusteeship Agreement may be subject to some form of examination by the supervisors of the council, which would, of course, render the whole defence system nugatory. But that could not obtain in relation to Australian territory, because we are entitled to close such territory and thus prevent any possibility of espionage occurring there.

Clause agreed to. ClauseS (Declaration respecting th* Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea). This clause relates to the merging of thu Territories of Papua and New Guinea into an administrative union. It was alleged in the first instance that the bill was designed only to deal with the merging of the two administrations. The two territories had different forms of government which were abolished during the war and now a temporary civil administration, based on Port Moresby, is operating. The Government has inserted in the bill a provision validating the giving away of the Territory of New Guinea to the Trusteeship Council. 1 extracted from the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) by means of a question that the Soviet view is that it would be impossible to envisage independence when all aspects of administration were fused and the plan would in practice inevitably prevent New Guinea from attaining separate self government or independence. That is behind the main part of the bill. A former administrator of. Papua, Sir. civil servant and a great citizen of the the Trusteeworld, opposed the merging.

Now it is proposed to merge the territories and, I presume, to base the administration on Port Moresby. Port .Moresby is in a dry area and many people believe that a better site could be found. Rabaul, which was the capital of the mandated territory, was almost destroyed in 1937 by a volcanic eruption. Lae is not suitable in many respects for a capital, nor is Wau. Many people consider that, for strategical and other reasons, Milne Bay would be a better place for the seat of administration. The determination of that issue would be a good reason why consideration of this bill should have been postponed. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -There is nothing in this clause which deals with the location of the seat of administration. union must have a capital. That is one matter which should have been considered. Another reason for opposition to the union is that it will give the Trusteeship Council greater power to pry and probe into our affairs, as I showed by means of a question which I addressed to the Prime Minister in the latter part of last year when I asked why the bill dealing with this matter that had been on the notice-paper had been removed from it. I am sorry to say that the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers), I am sure unwittingly, misled the House.

There will also be economic difficulties. The Minister in charge of the' bill has stated that the planters are satisfied with the prices that they are receiving for their copra and that they told him recently how happy they were. I have received a letter from an influential planter which contains the following passage:As you know, the New Guinea planters have had a grievience for some time concerning the price of copra.

I do not intend to let the bill slip through without making some protests regarding matters concerning the administration.. This merging of the administrations has not been properly considered by the Government and the proposal should be reported upon again by those who are competent to report upon it. Sir Hubert Murray was opposed to the proposal, and no honourable member would suggest that his opinion should not be considered. I shall conclude my remarks on this clause by reading the following extracts from an article in the Pacific Islands Monthly:Can we hope to Bee the end of WardUm in New Guinea! In other words, they are hoping that the Edwardian era has gone for all time.

This clause relates to the establishment of advisory councils for native matters. Such councils existed formerly in the territories, and I am sure that this amplification is merely padding out the hill, and is intended to indicate that the Government intends to continue the system and to try to improve it. I approve of that intention. councils are needed, hut the Minister might inquire into some of the foolishness connected with the administration of native affairs. I refer to the proposed expenditure of £100,000 for a native village at Hanuabada as a "" show"" village. At least, that sum w.as allocated for that purpose. The natives protested against the proposal because the village was to consist of houses of a type that the natives do not want. Most of the natives have been taken into the public service and have given up fishing and gardening. Before the war, the number of casual and indentured labourers in employment in Papua, including government employees and police, was 12,500, and of that number 850 were employed by the Government. The balance of 11,650 were employed in various industries in the territory. To-day the number of casual and indentured labourers in Papua is only 9,300, of whom about 4,000 are employed by the Government, including police, leaving 5,300 employed by private enterprise. Many of these natives are pottering about Government House in Port Moresby doing odd jobs, and are now dependent on tinned food brought from Australia. They should be allowed to grow their own requirements and follow the pursuits of agriculture and fishing Minister might well examine. He might also consider whether the more distant tribes, who have not been catered for like the natives of the tourist village that I have mentioned, whose villages were bombed and destroyed during the war, should not receive more medical attention. medical attention now. the notice-paper in which I ask whether the medical services are still inadequate. We should do more for the natives medically and educationally, and, instead of giving them as much money as we do, we should provide them with material things.

Every honourable member realizes how difficult it is to obtain the services of medical practitioners even in Australia. The Government is encouraging the natives to go back to their agricultural and fishing pursuits and. undoubtedly, that encouragement is bearing fruit.

Every effort is being made to develop the territory and give to the natives such amenities as those mentioned by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. White). I should like to make some remarks on behalf of the employers in New Guinea who are endeavouring to carry on the economic life of the territory. A t times they have been slandered in this Parliament and outside of it , and I desire to put on record the official point of view of those whose duty it is to report to the Parliament on such matters. I quote from page 21 of a report of the Territory of Papua for the period July, 1946, to June, 1947, which was compiled by officers of the Department of External Territories, as follows:Throughout the year commendable efforts were made by the majority of employers to provide reasonable conditions of employment, hut difficulties associated with supplies and shipping prevented full observance of some of the requirements relating to employment I have been reading, with gradually However, those difficulties are gradually being overcome. T place on record that statement by the government officials whose duty it is to inspect the plantations and supervise the conditions of employment in Papua. They have stated that, in their opinion the employers in the Territory of Papua have made great efforts to overcome difficulties and to provide reasonable conditions of employment and amenities for those they employ. Those employers are labouring under grave disadvantages. They are a great distance away from Australia and are subject to all the present vagaries of shipping and other transport. In addition, at the present time, they have bad imposed upon them, because of the policy followed particularly by the present Minister for External Territories, rather than by his officials in New Guinea, conditions which make it virtually impossible for them in some cases to operate their plantations. Paragraph 21 of the report statesThe shortages in labour are due mainly to the increased demand for labour in other venues of employment, particularly in connection with the work of administration. The planters complain that the Administration absorbs such a vast proportion of the available labour that there is insufficient labour left for the production of copra, rubber and the various other products of the territory. nearly half of the whole labour force. report a series of paragraphs relating to the conditions of employment. A very sympathetic note is apparent in this report of the officers on the difficulties faced by Australians and other Britishers who are endeavouring to carry on in Papua. I hope that the Parliament will recognize all those difficulties, and will show a more sympathetic disposition towards those who are tryin g to hold this territory for us. Clause agreed to.

The division provides for advisory councils for native matters and native village councils. This clause is an example of the nonsense that is being promulgated in this measure. It reads(1.)

Copies of the minutes shall be transmitted to the Minister by the Administrator as soon ae practicable after each meeting. 1 do not believe for one moment that this clause would have been included in a measure of this kind had it not been for the obligation placed on us by the Trusteeship Agreement. This is one of the results of interference from outside concerning our administration of native affairs. Let honourable members examine this division and they will realize how foolish it is.

How many members will an advisory council consist of-five, or three? Whatever number it consists of, there will always be a majority of native members. Do native members understand the fine points of the English language as used in sented :the minutes of council meetings? If an advisory council, in a remote area, for instance, consists of three members there must be two native members and probably one officer. That oflicer would have to prepare the minutes in English. The minutes could not be in pidgin-English or native dialect. Who is to check whether the minutes are correct or otherwise?

The necessity to obtain dollars actuated these sales which were made only after the United Kingdom had been consulted and had signified its concurrence.

Under this system I understand that primary producers are allotted priority No. 3, and are thereby put in very much the same position as people of much less importance in the community such as, (or instance, bookmakers. Will the Postmaster General consider a re-classification of such applications in such a way as to provide that primary producers will be awarded priority No. 2 because of the essential character of their business? Such a priority should apply particularly to primary producers adjacent to the cities wo suffer as the result of the present system. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable member's question:In common with the practice observed by other telephone administrations, a system has been adopted in Australia under which priority is allotted to applications for telephone services according to the extent to which the facilities are required in the interests of the general community. Provision is also made for a degree of preference to be giveu to cases where a service is needed for urgent medical reasons. The priority system, which is applied uniformly throughout the Commonwealth, is designed to meet the present abnormal position and will be discontinued when the department has overtaken the huge list of arrears , of applications and is again able to complete requests within a reasonable period. Primary producers are included with other businesses in Group 3, the two higher groups covering public undertakings such as fire brigades, hospitals, doctors, police, ambulance services and services required by ex-servicemen for business purposes. Many primary producers fall, of course, within the latter category. It is considered that the existing scheme is equitable and pays full regard to the essential activities of primary producers. The priority ratings are reviewed from time to time in the light oi changing circumstances, and the honourable member may be assured that the claims oi those engaged in rural industries will continue to be kept closely in mind. The department has taken vigorous and realistic steps to meet the unprecedented demands for telephone services. Enormous supplies of materials have been ordered from overseas and local sources, and these' are arriving in substantial quantities. Many additional men have been recruited, and the progress in connecting services, which is already double that of the pre-war period, Kill show a progressiveimprovement.",99,Shipping
