The inference bas been drawn that the opinion stated was given by myself, and therefore I ask the honourable member whether any opinion was given by any Attorney-General to that effect; if so, when, and has 'he any objection to stating who gave that opinion? 18 October, 1004. chair at 2.30",12,Setup

I shall have the papers examined, and any information which it is desirable to furnish I shall have much, pleasure In supplying.

A t this stage, perhaps I may be allowed to mention with concurrence that the honourable member for Coolgardie had intended to move the adjournment of the House to-day for the purpose of discussing the question of the granting of preferences in the Postal Department.; but I have informed him that the Postmaster-General is absent from Melbourne, and will not be in attendance here until to-morrow. He has therefore very kindly consented to defer his motion until to-morrow, when the Minister in charge of the Department will be present. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON week a cablegram was published in the newspapers with reference to a movement initiated in London in favour of an emigration scheme, in which it is said that Northern Australia is interested, for the en couragement of cotton growing.

In the Postal Department we have collected The receipts £2^10,264, an increase of £60,264 o n my estimate. That was not my faultI am glad to see the increase-bu t to a very great extent it is accounted for by the fact that the Postal Department was able to collect arrears for services rendered to the Savings Banks in some of the States, going back to the commencement of Fed'eration. The amount collected was about .£41,000, bur I had not calculated such a sum in the amount I expected to receive. The estimated revenue from the post-office this year is £2,560,000, an increase of £49,736 on the revenue of last year. It will be seen that the total revenue received last year was £11,631,056, or £64,881 over my estimate; and this year I anticipate to receive the reduced amount of _£i 1,570,000, or a decrease of £61,056.

We have had to contend against the reduced telegraphic rates which were sanctioned by this House. out the Commonwealth. These were the reductions in the rates brought into effect under the Postal and Telegraph Rates Act, and there is also the decrease caused by the reduction of the postage in Victoria to one penny. On the other hand, we have gained somewhat by charging all the States for Government postage and telegrams. .Only some of the States used to pay those charges. In addition, Aye have received a considerable revenue, as I have said, from carrying out the Savings Bank work for the various States. The postal receipts are steadily improving in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, but, unfortunately-, in Queensland, they are not so good as we could wish. In the latter State the receipts are practically stationary, and in South Australia and Western Australia heavy losses have been occasioned in consequence of the Pacific Cable, and also in consequence of alterations made in agreements entered into with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, those bargains having been made by the States before Federation. I mentioned that last vear we To t a l Commonwealth Increase Includes £41,514 for Savings Banks business. t Includes £45,000 for Savings Banks business. from the weather telegrams? tain, but it should be a considerable sum. ceipts which have been mentioned ?

This, In Victoria? of course, somewhat disarranges the comparison with previous years, and in addition the Postal Department is sanguine enough to expect from the States Treasurers a considerable amount from what are called weather telegrams. A bargain was made two, or it may be nearly three years ago, that such telegrams should be sent by the Commonwealth without charge, on the understanding, however, that the States were to be debited with the cost. So far no amounts have been collected under this head. The total amount we expect from the Postal Department in New South Wales is £ 9 3 5 , 0 0 0 , a decrease of £ 6 , 0 0 0 on the levenue of last year; in Victoria we expect to receive £66o;ooo, an increase of , £ 9 , 0 0 0; in Queensland, £ 3 2 4 , 0 0 0, practically the same as last year; in South Australia, £273,000, an increase of £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 ; in Western Australia, £258,000, an increase of £ 2 7 , 0 0 0 ; and in Tasmania, £.110,000, an increase of £ 5 , 0 0 0 a total increase of some ,£49,000.

In 1902-3 and 1903-4 we received very large amounts from the grain and fodder duties, and this year we received practically nothing from that source. As showing the great effect which the grain duties would have, I may state that, in 1901-2, the total amounts came tp £69,000; in 1902-3 they jumped to £597,000, £528,000; in 1903-4 they came down to £265,000, showing a fall of £332,000; while in 1904-5 we expect to get £33,000, showing another fall of Honourable members will see, t'herefoie, somewhat disarranged; that one item has a large effect in causing trouble with regard to the revenue. Then this year, in consequence of the larger crop in Queensland, we expect a decrease of £100,000 in the revenue from sugar. I mentioned that this year shows less than last year to the amount of £125,000, but the two items I mentioned as deposits in a trust fund-£50,000 -have tion when making any comparison. So that the actual falling off in the Customs revenuefor this year is £209,000. that sum, £56,000 is accounted for by the reduction in the special Tariff of Western Australia, leaving an anticipated reduction of £153,000 on the uniform Tariff in all the States. The special Tariff of Western Australia has now got down to the twofifths stage, and the result is that that State, having been able to charge on foreign imports the State or Federal duty, whichever might be the higher, received a considerable amount of revenue which it will now lose. There will also be a far larger trade with the eastern States. This fall to the two-fifths duties very largely interferes with the revenue in Western Australia. There is an anticipated falling off of £232,000 from grain, £102,000 from sugar, altogether £334,215B u t t h e parison I am making for the consideration of honourable members takes the form which will be found at the end of page 5. I desire to leave out the disturbing elements of grain and sugar in both years, and make a comparison with regard to all other items, so that honourable members will then Sir George Turner. be able to see whether I have allowed fairly for increase or decrease on that particular basis. That seems to me the best and fairest mode of making a comparison. I have allowed for increases amounting to ,£180,000, namely, to New South Wales £51,000, to Victoria £^67,000, to Queensland £24,000, to South Australia £13,000, to Western Australia £21,000, and to Tasmania £2,000-that is, about 2 per cent, all round on the total amount of the collections. ThatI consider is justifiable. I do not think that a Treasurer ought to unduly lower the anticipated receipts. At the being an increase of same time it is wise to keep within the mark, because if we do not, and the receipts should fall .short of the anticipations .to a great extent, then the Federation and the £232,000. Federal Parliament would unquestionably be held to be blameworthy. So that, that the States finances are while not over-stating the amounts I expect to collect, I certainly do not understate them, and have given what I believe will be approximately the amount collected. This year we certainly have better prospects. The crops seem to be turning out well, people are getting into better heart, and there is no doubt that imports are increasing in consequence of people having more money to expend on luxuries and £34>°oo and various imported articles. On the to be taken into consideraother hand we certainly have an increase in . Inter-State trade, and increases in manufactures in many of Of the States. These matters have to be taken into consideration by honourable members when endeavouring to arrive at a fair estimate of what we may expect from our Customs revenue. The experience of the three months, I am sorry to say, has led me to believe that my estimate with regard to Queensland is very doubtful. I am afraid it will not be realized. So far as Western Australia, also, is concerned, the returns have certainly been very disappointing, and unless some very great improvement takes place, I am afraid that State will have to meet a considerable falling off in the amount I have estimated. I have allowed for this year, taking all sources of collection into consideration, for New South comWales, £3,160,000, a falling off of £69,786; for Victoria, £2.440,000, an increase of' £46,000; Queensland,£1,115,000, a falling off of £16,761 ; South Australia, ,£685,000, a falling off of. £14,792; Western Australia, £1.050,000, a falling off of £12,296; Tasmania; £340^00, a falling off of £ 2 , 1 8 9 ; d a n Western Australia, Special Tariff,£i40,ooo, a falling off of £56,429.

31,Sir George Turner,"The differOn pages 6 and 7 I have endeavoured to certain very interesting information with regard to sugar, from which we derive a very large revenue. Honourable members will recollect that the sugar excise and sugar bonus will expire on the ist January, 1907, and shortly it will be the duty ot the Parliament to take into consideration what course should be pursued with regard to the excise, and with regard to the rebates. know that it will be possible to deal with the matter this session. It is one which requires very careful and full inquiry, but so far as I am personally concerned, I sympathize altogether with the position, especially of Queensland', in this connection, and I may say I am prepared to do whatever is possible to assist the sugar industry, to keep it alive, and to enable growers of sugar to work in such a way that they will be able to do without black labour, without suffering any real hardship or loss. The return to which I direct the attention of honourable members sets forth the yield of white and black grown sugar, the number of producers, the area under cultivation, the quantity of sugar produced, and the amount of bonus paid. Honourable members will recollect that the Commonwealth passed a Bill providing the basis for the bonus or rebate. It is pleasing to know that in Queensland there has been a large increase in the number of white producers. In the first year of the operation of our legislation, there was an increase of 527, which was an increase of about 33 per cent, of the total number, and there was a further increase last year of 94. The white producers now number over 'two to one in Queensland. In New South Wales the producers of sugar are nearly all producing it by means of white labour. New South Wales has undoubtedly received a very large benefit from the sugar rebate, bechief loss will fall on the two StatesI . cause, before Federation, the planters there -were growing nearly all their sugar with the aid of white labour. Consequently, the bonus has been a little god-send to them. Unlike the people of Queensland, they have not had to change their methods of production. During the two years I have mentioned, the area under sugar cane in Queensland tilled by white labour has increased from 36.088 acres to 56,289 acres, whilst the area tilled by black labour has decreased from 59,609 acres to 57,402 acres. We expect that this year Queensland will produce 31,000 tons of white-grown sugar, and 98.000 tons place before honourable members of black-grown sugara total of 129,000 tons-whic h is an increase of about 40,000 tons on the production of last year. tion of black-grown sugar is increasing much more quickly than that of whitegrown sugar? labourers employed seems also to be increasing ? ber of black labourers has increased, and so has the area under cultivation by black labour. While the sugar grown by white labour has increased from 24,000 to 31,000 tons, the sugar grown by black labour has increased from 65,000 to 97,000 tons. season. is due to the increased crop for this year? impossible to say. I have given the number of additional acres under cultivation, and the number of additional producers,, but I do not think it is possible to give more definite information to the honourable and learned member. In New South Wales the estimated production for the year 1904-5 is 18,600 tons of white-grown sugar, and 2^000tons of black-grown sugar, or 20,600 tons 7 altogether. Therefore, the total production of the Commonwealth for the year 1904-5 will be 149,600 tons; while our requirements amount to about 187,000 tons. Honourable members will see that, as the production of sugar increases, our Customs revenue will decrease, because whereas we collect an import duty of £ 6 per ton onimported sugar, we collect only an excise°f £ 0 P er to n 0 1 1 locally-produced sugarNearly all the imported sugar comes first to Victoria and South Australia; but part of it is re-exported to the other States, so that during the book-keeping period fhehave mentioned. When we supply the whole of our requirements by local production,there will be a very serious loss in re.venue. happen if we produced locally all the boots or all the hats that we require. to so great an extent. I am not complaining about the increase in the local production of sugar; I am glad of it. I draw attention to the fact because, since some hon-",18,Grain

Unquestionably, some States were bound to be affected by the drought, and, consequently, by the smaller purchasing power of the people. But, as I have already pointed out, other States have derived a largely increased revenue in consequence of the grain duties. Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that one State has gained an immense sum of money, whereas Queensland and Tasmania have, ^unfortunately, lost very heavily. The loss in those States has been occasioned by our action in having abolished many of the revenue duties which they formerly collected under their State Tariffs. The difficulty which the right honourable member for Adelaide, as Minister of Trade and Customs, and I experienced in framing the Tariff was due, to a very great. extent, to our efforts to preserve, as far as we could, the finances of those two States, and we had to provide for revenue duties, .which otherwise we certainly should not have asked the House to impose.

Honourable members will, no doubt, recollect that, regardless of the State in which they may have been collected, duties have to be credited to the State in which the goods, in respect of which they are obtained, are consumed. They may be transferred from one State to another, the State in which the goods are consumed receiving the benefit of the revenue so collected.

The actual amount of Commonwealth expenditure for last year was £4,252,562, being £[67,887 less than my estimate.

NOTE -In this Statement 1901-2 figures represent the cost of services rendered in that year, that is, arrears of 1901-2 paid in 1902-3 are included, but arrears of 1900-1901 paid in 1901-2 are not included. The figures for 1902-3, and later years, represent actual payments within the year, irrespective of the year in which the expenditure was incurred. To show 1901-2 figures on the same basis as the other years would make an unfair comparison, as 1901-2 bore very heavy arrears of 1900-1901 (£281,508), while later years-bore arrears which are not considerable. But the table to which I desire particularly to draw the attention of honourable members is the one on page 21, because that shows the total cost of each Department. Honourable members will be aware that various amounts are paid by the different Departments for other Departments, and when I first became Federal Treasurer, I was anxious to ascertain how much each Department cost in each particular State; but I found it was almost impossible to do so. The items were scattered over different parts of the States Estimates, in places where no one would ever dream of looking for them. Therefore, I have brought into .the table to which I have referred an account of everything expended on account of each Department, so that honourable members . and. the Treasurers of the States will have an ture on page 19, compared year by year, taking the headings as they appear in the Estimates. The totals are as follow:New South Victoria. Queensland. South Australia. Western Australia. Tasmania.

I do not propose to go through all these details, because it would take me a very long time to do so; but, later on, when we are dealing with the Estimates, if honourable members desire to have fuller information, I shall be very pleased to deal with the subject with greater fulness. Honourable'members are aware that we have to close down the Commonwealth accounts on the 30th June of each year. We do not, as some of the States do, keep our accounts open for two or three months, or for ten days after the close of the financial year. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to pay all our accounts during the year. The first year of the existence of the Commonwealth, when the arrears were ,£281,000, afforded an unfair comparison in this respect, because we closed down our accounts on the 30th June, whereas the ordinary payments would run two or three months over that period. In that year th""; total arrears came to £281,000. But in the next year 1901-2, we had brought down the amount to £104,000; and in the year 1902-3 the amount was down to ,£41,000. This year, I am told .that the total unpaid accounts on the 30th June, nevote.

A great portion of the sum unpaid is accounted for by the fact that the Railway Departments have not all sent in their accounts ; otherwise, we should practically have had no arrears on the 30th June last.

The actual expenditure last partment of Home Affairs is that the However, I believe that the arfeet in the Department, and it is to be hoped that the amount I have provided will be expended in proper time. It is of no use my placing on the Estimates sums which cannot be expended during the currency of the financial year. Under the -circumstances, however, I do not think that we shall have anything like the unexpended balance that we have met with in previous years. To show that the Commonwealth is not extravagant in this particular item, I may say that last year the Estimates, exclusive of armament, amounted to £367,000, and this year they are £274,000, a decrease of £93,000. As I mentioned, the amount I ask for is £404,00/0, (Which, with revotes amounting to £47,000, leaves for new expenditure, £356,000. made up of armaments, £130,000; telegraph and telephone works, £155,000; and machinery, £1,600, leaving only the comparatively small sum of £70,000 for any new buildings required in the Customs Department, for any post-offices which may be required, and also for a large number of works which have to be provided for in the Defence Department, not only in the way of buildings, but also in the shape of rifle ranges, small alterations to fortifications, and so on. The amount is made up as follows:-Customs, £[3,000; Defence, £35,000; and Post office, £32.000. that honourable members will agree that I have not asked for too large a sum. In fact, honourable members will probably say, when I ask for £70,000 for new works, that that is much less than they would be prepared to vote if I thought the finances of the various States could stand the strain. The figures appear in fhe following table:Amount asked for this year Deduct re-votes Armament Telegraphs and Telephones . . 155,000 Machinery For New Buildings and Works for three Transferred Departments We have to bear in mind that, whereas in the old days the States met this particular class of expenditure out of loan monies, the Commonwealth Parliament has determined that it shall be met out of revenue. When we compare our expenditure with the expenditure anticipated by the Eederal Convention, we must remember that the Convention never contemplated that all new works would be paid for out of revenue, and merely went to the extent of providing for the interest on any money which might be borrowed for the purposes of new works. I have information which leads me to believe that there will be a saving in the Department of Home Affairs of .£25,000; and I shall 'have the full concurrence of the Coinmittee when I say that, whatever savings I may see later on in tbe yearany savings which are likely, ; or are certain to be made in the DepartmentsI purpose to add to the special vote for armament in the Defence Department. For that latter purpose I have provided £130,0.00 this year. Before That '.expenditure is leaving office I originally fixed the amount at' £125,000, and the honourable member for Bland, when Treasurer, raised it to £129,000 odd, so I thought I would "" gp one better,"" and ask for the round sum of £130,000. £177,000. and if the Department will only be a little economical in the way of lace and feathers, and if there are savings on other works and buildings. I have no doubt that the sum provided will be somewhere near £177,000. I confess I would much rather see the I think, therefore, money for the Defence Department spent in the direction I have indicated than in any other. We must keep up the efficiency of the forces-w e must have officers, and men must be trained, and ammunition provided. At the same time, there is no doubt that if we have money to spare from any of the other votes, we shall be fully justified in applying it to the purchase of rifles, guns.. £404,240 extra armament or accoutrement-whic h .. .. 47,431 are not provided for in the special votes.

54,,"Mr HIGGINS -I s the honourable gentleserious attention of honourable members, is in connection with Fremantle in Western Australia, as is stated on page 31. Apparently, from the best advice we can get, it is necessary that fortifications should be LandArthur Head (State property) . . Moving and re-erecting building3 North fremantle (private property) WorksArthur Head North Fremantle Armament;Arthur Head, one 6"" gun North Fremantle, two 7.5"" guns Allowing for the usual errors in estimates, we may reckon any sum up to £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . this and the two following years, to put Western Australia in a fair state of defence, the money must be expended because the defence of any particular place vitally affects the defence of the whole Commonwealth. Therefore, if we are satisfied, no matter what State we may represent, that that is a reasonable and proper expendi. ture, I am certain that honourable members will not fail to pass the amount asked for. the Estimates last year, devoted to some other purpose? My rule is always to tell honourable members the total amount of expenditure to which I believe . I am committing them when passing any items. On that occasion the information given to me by the Department of Defence was not as f u l l as it ought to have been. I was misled, and I innocently misled the 'House into believing that a comparatively small sum would be required for this purpose. into the details before authorizing the expenditure, I found that the sum asked for was absolutely inadequate, that it would be useless to spend that sum unless we were prepared to spend an additional sum of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 7 0 , 0 0 0. Not having given Parliament that information, I felt bound to come down here before expending that vote and state the f u l l facts. I did not divert the vote on the Estimates, but I allowed an amount equal to that sum and other amounts to go for the purchase of a reserve of ammunition which was badly required in all the States. erected at Fremantle and North Fremantle, and the expense will be very large. The total amount that will be required as estimated is £ 8 7 ,000. The details are as f o l l o w :£23,900 3,800 6,400 £34,100 £10,000 12,000 22,000 £7,600 24,000 31,600 £87,700 orable gentleman? fact was that the officers of the Defence Department did not give me the f u l l information. Several schemes have been suggested, and have been investigated by our advisors. Taking into consideration the area available for the works, the scheme to be carried out, if approved by the -Committee is, I believe, the best one possible, and as I said, it will cost £ 8 7 , 0 0 0. The land will cost .£34,000, but of that sum nearly £ 2 4 , 0 0 0 is required for land belonging to Western Australia. In order to assist 'in getting the work carried out, the State, instead of asking us to pay cash for the land, as in strictness it would be entitled to do, is prepared to let it be considered as one of the transferred properties, and to be so dealt with. That, of course, relieves the revenue from a considerable expenditure. Then more land has to be purchased. The cost of the works is estimated at ,£22,000, and the cost of the armament is set down at £31,000. When we come to deal with But when I came to go this item, no doubt the Minister of Defence will be able to give anv fuller information which may be required. It is impossible for us to disclose confidential communications from our own officers and our advisors in the old country. Therefore honourable members have to be satisfied with our assurances that the best that can be done is being done, and that about the amount named will be required. It will be. for them to say whether an expenditure of say ,£100,000 is justifiable for the purpose of putting this portion of the Commonwealth in a fairly satisfactory state of defence.

There has been a sort of go-as-you-please arrangement, under which I think I have been doing better than I would have done under the agreement which I tried to get. Then we have established a Commonwealth Fidelity Guarantee Fund, the receipts and expenditure of which are shown on page 36. The total amount collected from our officers at the rate of 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum was £1,587, while the defalcations made good during the year amounted to £ 6 6 , so that we made a profit of £1,521, I hope that, for the sake of the fund, for the honour of the service, and for the good example which will be set in dealing with other matters of a similar nature, that state of affairs will long continue in the Commonwealth.

I have spent many an hour trying to ascertain how it could be 'decreased. I cannot see any means of decreasing it, except by some small savings which may be made during the course of the year. In the next table I deal with a matter which has caused me great trouble and anxiety, because I wish to do what is fair and just to the States, and at the same time to keep within the provisions of the Constitution. Under section 89 of the Constitution we have to charge as transferred expenditure all moneys required for the maintenance or continuance as at the time of transfer of the Departments transferred. Any other expenditure is looked upon as ""other"" expenditure. The provision to which I have referred has puzzled me very greatly, and, although I have consulted fhe law advisors of the Crown in regard to it, I have not been much helped by their opinion. Last year it seemed to me somewhat inequitable to charge against the States more than the amount expended in them, say, for telegraphs and telephones, for example. In some of the States it is necessary to spend a large amount on these works; but it seemed to me rather unfair to charge this expenditure on a",31,Extexditube 1901 2 33 37 26 87 17 97 9 11 8 64 4 04 100

74,Sir George Turner,"I shall bepopulation basis, when the revenue derived from them is paid to the State in which they are carried out. I thought that it would be just to charge the whole expenditure for new works against the State in which they were contracted. As I told honourable members, I was doubtful if to do so would be to comply strictly with the terms of the Constitution; but I thought that it would be well to ascertain by way of experiment how the system would work out in actual practice when compared with the system of charging on a population basis. I believed that when the Commonwealth Treasurer came to settle with the Treasurers of the States in connection with the transferred buildings, there would be very little difficulty in making any necessary adjustments. bers will see that in connection with four of the States the arrangement I suggested worked out fairly well. Wales gained only £1,176 in three years, Queensland £3,616, and Tasmania £147, while South Australia lost ^£1,701. It would not have been very difficult to rectify matters in connection with those States, either in consultation with their Treasurers, or in the financial arrangements of the fourth year. But in regard to Victoria and South Australia, I came across a state of things which I had not anticipated. being charged only the amount actually expended within the State, gained in the three years £23,939, while Western Australia lost £27,177, the reason being that, as Victoria is compact and well settled, she does not require so much expenditure on new works and buildings; and where new telephones and telegraphs are provided it is not necessary to erect such long lengths of lines. Western Australia, on the other hand, is a very big State, with a small population, and is only now being opened up, so that the expenditure"" on new works t*>ere is much larger. I was, therefore, forced to reconsider the whole of the circumstances. When I worked out the arrangement for this year in the same way as I had worked it out for previous years, I found that New South Wales would gain £16,196; Victoria, £40,927; Queensland, £ 2 , 5 6 0; and Tasmania, £2,442 ; while £7,458, and Western Australia, £54,667. These figures somewhat startled me. They appeared to be getting too large to permit of any hope of an adjustment being arrived at hereafter, especially if they continued 9 K2 for another year or two at the same alarming rate. This year we are spending-as honourable members are awarea considerable sum upon defence, more particularly in Western Australia. Next year that expenditure will be still larger. Whatevei view I might entertain in regard to expenditure upon post offices, telegraphs, and telephones, I could come to only one conclusion concerning Defence expenditure, namely, that it ought to be charged against the whole of the Commonwealth upon a per capita basis. Wherever expenditure is incurred upon defence matters, it must be regarded-if it is necessary-as being for the benefit of the whole of the Commonwealth, and consequently it should be borne by the Federation. I endeavoured to pick Honourable memout certain items which might be regarded as constituting transferred expenditure, and others which might be looked upon as New South"" new"" expenditure, but in so doing, and in studying the opinions of the Crown La\v officers, I became more mixed than ever. Finally, I determined that the only way in which I could deal with this, matter was to charge the whole of the works and buildings to the Commonwealth upon a population basis, thus reversing the course which I followed last year. I think that in acting thus, I am keeping strictly within the bounds of the Constitution. We shall ultimately have I found that Victoria, to pay for whatever buildings we took over when the Commonwealth was inaugurated upon a population basis, and whatever works we undertake after we get a common purse will also be paid for upon that basis. Therefore, I have concludedthat, upon the whole, it is wise to reverse the course which I pursued last year, and not to charge each State with the expenditure therein. It would be manifestly unfair to impose an extra expenditure of £54,000 upon Western Australia, when a large number of the works which are to be carried out there will benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. If it is necessary hereafter, rectifications can be made in respect of past expenditure. gentleman any reason to believe that the Crown Law officers regard his action as unconstitutional ? was difficult for me to say whether it was South Australia would lose constitutional or otherwise. Law officers stated that there was a good deal to be said upon both sides. also said a good deal upon both sides. I",33,Extexditube 1901 2 33 37 26 87 17 97 9 11 8 64 4 04 100

I was anxious to invest a considerable portion of that amount, but I found, upon going through the figures, that considerable advances had been made for Post Offices, Money Orders, Savings Banks, and Telegraphs. Consequently, I discovered that at the most I could not invest more than .£35,000 or ,£40,000.

I was, to some extent, under a misapprehension upon this matter, because last year I thought that a much larger sum could have been invested. Upon page 50, I deal with the very important question of the surplus returnable to the different States. I have shown it year by year, and have instituted a comparison in the case of each State, and of the whole Commonwealth, with the sum returned in previous years.

To a great extent that is accounted for by the fact that in the previous year-19023 the States received an unforeseen revenue from the grain and sugar duties, aggregating £600,000, and the amount of their surpluses in that year, as compared with the preceding twelve months, was increased by £832^00. At the same time, I realize that it is very hard for the States Treasurers to find year after year that the amount returned to them by the Commonwealth as decreasing. Nevertheless, it is scarcely fair for them to attribute this fact wholly to additional expenditure, or to declare that it is due to extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. The various States have suffered losses in their revenue, the extent of which honourable members would be able to see for themselves by reference to the Budget papers. I do not propose to take them through all the details.

Rifle clubs represent an increased expenditure of £20,400, due to the fact that the effective allowance is for twelve instead of for six months, and that an increased grant of ammunition is to be made. one will begrudge the expenditure on our rifle clubs. It is likely to increase .from year to year, but, having regard to the good value we receive from the clubs compared with the return from other branches of the Defence Department I believe that no reasonable expenditure in that direction -will be opposed. I think that the rifle clubs cost us about £2 2s. 6d. per member, as against a considerable amount per head of militia. Military camps will cost £2,400 more than last year. More men will be in camp, and increased railway fares will have to be paid. The States insist on our paying extra railway fares, which must increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth-it will""be spoken of as ""more extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth ""-and increase the railway revenue for the States In equipment there will be an increase of £6,000, but of that sum £500 represents an old indent order given before the Federation was established. The goods have been delivered, and we now have to find the money for them. Ammunition represents .£200 extra, general £1,300, and repairs, &c., £6,000, making a total of £78,600; but allowing for a reduction of £800 in respect of stores, we have a total increase of £77,800 in this Department. I have gone very carefully through these estimates with the Minister of Defence, lities for trade between the Commonwealth and his officers, and, while I think that there will be savings in.respect of effective view that we propose this additional expenallowance, not.fully earned, as well as in other directions, I do not expect the saving will be a very large one. Whatever it may be, if the Committee concurs, I shall be only too glad to utilize it in increasing the explanation of the details when the Estiarmament expenditure. For the Postal Department the expenditure provided for also seems large, but' we must realize that the expenditure of this Department must necessarily increase. The revenue is increasing, and it is necessary to give the people, and more especially those of the more sparsely populated States, all the conveniences which they may reasonably expect. To do that we must provide for an increase of expenditure. Salaries account for Str George Turner. Last year we had to provide a £63,000 . of this increase, and mails for £11,000. Here again the railways are calling upon us to pay more for services rendered. In Victoria, the Railway Department used to transact our telegraphic work for 25 per cent, of the receipts on telegrams transmitted through its agency; but it now insists upon receiving 50 per cent, of the receipts. That means an increased No expenditure amounting to £3,000 in the Postal Department in Victoria, and an increased revenue of ,£3,000 to the State Railway Department. I do not pretend to say that it is unfair for the Department to make this charge, but I mention it as showing an increase which the Commonwealth cannot avoid. of Victoria refuses to pay for weather telegrams. tenance of lines accounts for an increase of £ 4 , 5 0 0 ; uniforms, which were not provided for in last' year's Estimates, of ,£6,500; pensions, £4,500; and repairs, &c, ,£6,000. Allowing for savings amounting to ,£10,000, the increase jn the departmental expenditure amounts to .£85,500. Then, under the heading of "" other "" expenditure, an increase of £6,000 is provided for in respect of one item in the Estimates of the Department of External Affairs. This is to provide for increased mail and shipping facilities between the Corhmonwealth and the Islands of the Pacific. The question has been under the consideration of several Cabinets,, and from time to time it has been determined that the Government should do all that it could within reasonable limits to increase the faciand the islands. It is with this object in diture of £6,000. We shall.be able to deal fully with the matter later on, and the Minister in charge of the Department will be able to furnish the Committee with a full mates of the Departments are before us. An increased sum of £1,500 is provided for in respect of British New Guinea. This amount is necessary to pav an overdraft with the Bank of Queensland, which was guaranteed by the Government of that State. It will be returned to us in about three years' time in the shape of £500 per year received by way of survey fees.",37,Summary Eor Eoub Years

91,Sir George Turner,"They arePrime Minister made some of them. deal just for a minute or two with the position of Queensland. It is a matter of deep regret that that particular State does not come out as well as we should all like, with regard to her revenue. I found last year that there was likely to be an encroachment on the three-fourths revenue return to the State. I , therefore, went again into the Estimates and cut down and kept back whatever expenditure I could. The result was that we had an unexpended amount of £36,000, which was of great benefit to that State. But, unfortunately the consideration which I showed works out in this way against me» I put off works which I should have liked to carry out last year, but I have to provide for them on the Estimates this year. I kept back the matter of filling up the ranks in t'he Defence Department last year, but I have to provide for filling them up this year. had, we will say-spen t £3,000 upon a new Post-office-for which provision was made on the Estimates-expenditur e to the amount of £3,000' would have been incurred. But as it was not spent last year, the amount 'has to be placed upon the Estimates against this year. That increases the current year's expenditure by .£3,000, and makes a difference of £6,000 as between the two years. It is in regard to matters of that kind' that some of our financial critics do not treat us very fairly when they compare our totals. They do not take into consideration the amount which we have endeavoured to save in one particular year in order' to suit the convenience of the States. They do not consider that the more I try to keep down expenditure in one year, the more I may have to increase expenditure in the following year. These vague remarks about our extravagance are continually being made, and I wish to place before the Treasurers of the States, the full facts of the case, giving the most complete figures which I can give,, in order that our critics may, if they can, pick out any item of extravagance. If they will do so, and will let me know of it I will take care that an investigation is made by myself a^id by the Department interested, i come now to another difficulty, in which the State of Queensland is especially interested -I will admit, however, that it was never That is in regard to the effect of section 87 of the Constitution. The details are given on page 58 of the budget papers. In the Convention we fought time after time to obtain a guarantee for some of the States that they should have a certain amount of revenue returned to them. I know that in Victoria, unless there had been some guarantee, probably there would have been very great difficulty indeed in securing Federation. But the feeling in the Convention was strongly against the Fedewhich I had hoped to ral Parliament being in any way tied or hampered. The members of the Convention wanted to trust the Parliament entirely, as to how much of the revenue collected it should return to the States, and how much it should expend. I was not prepared to agree to that because-althoug h I believed that the Federal Parliament would always try to do justice to the StatesI knew that some people would not look upon it in the same spirit; and I was aware that, unless we had some guarantee, there would be a difficulty in some of the States in carrying out what we earnestly desired. Eventually we were able to prepare a clause which The result is this: If last year I bears the name of a respected member of this House, who, unfortunatelv, has passed away. I allude to the Braddon section. That guarantee was to the States collectively that they should get back three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. But that did not mean that any individual State must get back three-fourths of its own net Customs revenue. I had fought for that in the finance committee of the Convention, and had fought for it in the Convention itself, 'but I had been over-ruled, and had to accept the best compromise we could get. There was no misunderstanding on this subject in the Convention The' Convention knew perfectly well what it was doing. It did not intend to tie the Federal Parliament to give back to each State three-fourths of its Customs excise revenue. derstood it in that way! be no doubt whatever that there was no intention in the Convention to give back that amount to each State individually. I recollect the matter distinctly, and I have since looked it up in the reports. I myself fought very hard to try to get what it is now said by some people that the Convention intended. But I was beaten, and had to accept the best compromise I could get. dreamt that any State would not get back its three-fourths. That is the exact posi-",42,Explanation Of Increases 1904 5 Compared

They could not have been misled if they followed the Convention debates; although I freely confess that the Convention and the Treasurers who were present at that Convention never dreamt that the Federal Parliament would haw to utilize more than one-fourth of the net Customs revenue of any one State.

That amount includes £192,000, the one-fourth of the special Western Australian Tariff. Queensland is a State which unfortunately has been "" hit,"" but, taking the three years up to the present time, even that State has not much to complain about. the shortage in Queensland was £20,000; in 190374, in consequence of my keeping back expenditure, the encroachment was represented by only £2,000, whereas in 1902-3 Queensland received-more than her three-fourths to the extent of £15,000. It will be seen that in the three years this State has had only ,£7,500 taken from its three-fourths of Customs revenue. But in the periodfrom the ist January, 1901, to the 30th June, 1904, we have returned £62,926 more than the three-fourths. In Queensland was not represented in addition, the expenditure in Queensland in 1903-4 exceeded that in the previous year by only £1,325, the loss to that State being caused by reduced revenue. This year, unless we have the savings for which I hope a much larger amount will be deducted from the sum returned to Queensland ; but experience so far has shown that a comparatively small amount has been retained over and above what the Commonwealth would have been entitled to keep, even if we had been bound to return three-fourths to the State. mean by ""keeping back"" ? keeping back expenditur/e on defencesasking the Department not to fill up vacancies, and so on, and also asking the Postal Department not to proceed with new buildings. to call them savings, although they may in one way be so termed. The practice is one I do not like, namely, postponing expenditure, in order to help a State through a particular financial year. sary ? yearthe total ^amount to be returned to the States is £600,000 more than the Commonwealth would be bound to return if we toqk advantage of our full power under the Constitution. In considerwe might have expended. ing this question, we must not forget that in the past we have not been paying interest or sinking fund in connection with the transferred buildings. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the States, but, assuming an arrangement is arrived at this year and the payments start from the ist July last, it will necessitate our providing £450,000, which will leave us only about £150,000. We have still to take over deIn '1901-2 partments, such as the administration of quarantine and the lighthouses, which are . non-paying, and honourable members will see that we shall have very little to ""come and go"" upon.in connection with' the surplus in the future, after charges under these heads have been met. Therefore, while I should be very glad to ask the Committee to institute penny postage throughout the Commonwealth, the accounts disclose facts which prohibit my making that request.

If .tuese disturbing elements were eliminated from ithe figures, the amount of loss to New South Wales would be considerably reduced; but the tables are prepared on actual receipts. may be brought forward by a Treasurer within a reasonable number of years must, I think, provide for a certain amount of revenue belonging to New South Wales being distributed amongst the other four States, if we are to divide on a -per capita basis But I have always felt, and experience strengthens my view, that as the years roll on less Customs revenue will be collected in New South Wales. trade and more Australian -manufactures, and the expenditure in a large State, such as New South Wales; will increase much more rapidly than in smaller States, such as Tasmania and Victoria. space of time, I have no doubt that a per capita basis will be found to be fair and equitable to all the States, resulting in what I regard as a true Federation. No one can realize the amount of bookkeeping which has to be carried on under present circumstances. Honourable members can see the immense mass of figures which have to be dealt with in connection with the finances of all the States. If I had only one fund to deal with, my financial statement would be very simple, and not nearly as trying to myself or to the patience of honourable members. This is a matter which will have to be dealt with, though not in this Budget statement, and I am building up the figures, year by year, so that those who follow may have the benefit of our past experience. I have no doubt that in connection with the next F i nancial Statement the Committee will have to give careful consideration to the question of distributing the surplus; and my belief is, that the true solution of the difficulty will as a rule, an increment does not run for be found in a scheme under which a sliding scale of. say, five years, is allowed to the States other than Western Australia, the latter being allowed ten years. of that period after the expiration of the bookkeeping arrangements, we should not. I ' think, be doing any iniustice to any of the States, not even to Western Australia, by a per capita distribution. of that yet. 1 know that we could apply such a scheme at amount of ' £32,000, leaving the total ' 9L once to any of the States, but sooner or later., there will have to be a per capita distribution-w e cannot be expected to continue the present bookkeeping for all -time No doubt, that was known to the peopleof Western Australia when they Any scheme ' which agreed to enter the Federation, and it was one of fhe reasons why a concession was given to that State, enabling it to tax the productions of the other States on a sliding scale for five years. that; the Western Australian people pay. There will be more Inter-State been in Western Australia, and am not in a position to say what the people there want, but I hope shortly to take a trip West. I know only what the representatives of Western Australia at the Convention agreed to, In a reasonable and what I have indicated was a suggestion made to induce Western Australia to join the union-it was a bargain made between the States. On page 68, New Guinea is dealt with, and on page69 I have tried to get, for the information of honourable members, from the Departments, the increased expenditure on account of increments and promotions. I believe these figures to be approximately correct. In the Treasury, we have no means ot checking them exactly. I fear that some States do not make them up on the same basis as others, and that I intend to inquire into, but I believe that the figures are approximately correct for the purposes of honourable members. From the table, on page 69, we see that for the three years the rninimum wage has been in operation-tak ing the annual expenditure at the end of the year, which is something more than the amount provided on the Estimates, because, the f u l l year in the first instance-w e have paid to these lower-paid servants an extra sum of £ 9 4 , 0 0 0.

It will be useless for us at the present time 10 discuss, at any rate, at great length, the classification of our Public Service orits effect, because there are 2,000 appeals still pending, and until these have beendecided we shall not know exactly what the classification will involve.. The determination of those appeals may remove many apparent inconsistencies which might otherwise-, require to be discussed. able time to deal with them. stand from the Commissioner that the appeals will be dealt with pretty rapidly. WhatI propose is'that the officers shall get the benefits of'the classification as. from'/the j st July last, and it ' wi.Hi noM be: finallyaccepted by the Governor-Generalin>Council until honourable members have-had a f u l l opportunity to. deal withany -objections--. wbich they may think -ought to be brought-, £ 8 , 0 0 0.

Probably in the early part of next session it could easily be dealt with. On the Estimates we have provided for all the benefits given by the classification. One portion ot the Publice Service will be paid at once, but another portion will not be paid the proposed increases. In the first instance and I mention this specially because I understand that my predecessor said he did not intend to pay-in the case of all salaries It will take a considerU P ' £ ° , I propose to commence paying 1 0 I 0 the .increments at once, and not to wait for I underj the, passing of the Estimates. That practice I followed in previous years, with the concurrence of Ihe Committee. Under the Public Service Act there are certain increments which a man gets almost as a right. It is only in a very few cases that the Commissioner would deprive an officer of the concession, and, as the amounts are very small individually. I think it is only right that they, should be paid as they accrue. Then',;!",48,Estimated 1904 5

115,Sir George Turner,"Before theunder section 19 of the Victorian Public Service Act, we have to allow certain officers to receive the amounts at which they have been assessed up to tbe present. These are higher than the amounts which are provided by the Commissioner in his scheme, but until it bas been finally decided, we think it is fair that the officers shall be perceiving the lowerLraiieSjof pay.. <The intermitted to draw them. decided ? session, I hope. officers cannot grumble, because they -are getting an increased amount. The officers of the Crown Law Department are of opinion that as soon as this classification takes effect it will supersede all State Acts with regard to salaries and such matters. very important question which we shall have to fully discuss when we are dealing with the scheme of classification. As we have not too much time at our disposal, I would ask honourable members to refrain from discussing, at any rate, at great length, the various grievances, or supposed grievances, which public servants may bring under their notice when we are dealing with these particular Estimates. As far as the effect of the classification is concerned, the Commissioner took all the increases which should be provided, and against them he placed the amounts which he was giving independently of the increases. Honourable members know that up to £160 a year the increments would operate whether we had a classification or not. Unfortunately the Commissioner mentioned that the cost of the classification was £54,000. As a matter of fact, as he pointed out afterwards, it is nothing of the kind. four thousand pounds was the total of the increases, including £34,000 for increases, which otherwise would have been given. Therefore, the present cost of the classification is £20,000 per annum. That, he believes-and I agree with him there-wil l be considerably reduced, probably by one-third during the year, by filling up vacancies at lower rates which he has provided in some cases, and I think it will be found when full effect is given to the scheme that what he has done will mean little, if anv. increased expenditure to the Commonwealth. That sum of ,£54,000 includes £41,000 for increases' of salaries under ,£200; £1.2,000 for increases of salaries from .£200 to £ SJ £ ° f ° increases of salaries over 0 0 2 2 r £-500; and £^400 for increases for administrative, division. therefore see ihaitat isjnoti a'xaseibf ibenefiting the tall poppies I'andntramplirig -. on.' the little daisies.

States. £ CommonFree wealth Dutiable Total ... The total net imports during the year came to £36,244,000, and the total of the InterState transfers of our own products-no t re --exports of imported foods-cam e to £24,431,000.' There is one matter which is somewhat peculiar in the comparison between New South Wales ancl Victoria. The free imports for New South Wales for the year 1903 amounted to £3,3i7>ooo, and for Victoria they.amounted to ^3,140,000. These amounts are almost the same, but in respect of dutiable goods, the figures for New South. Wales are £9,262,000, and for Victoria £6,948,000. Even allowing for (he discrepancy in the population of the two States, it is shown that an immense amount is being imported into New South Wales in excess of the importations into Victoria, and it is for this reason that I believe that as years go on the New South Wales revenue will certainly come down very considerably from what it is at the present time. I have now given the information supplied by the Budget papers, and I can only say again that I have to go into all these matters for the information of the Treasury Department, and in order that the Treasurers of the States may have full opportunities of comparing the figures. As we have to keep these records under the bookkeeping sections, I think it wise that honourable members should have the benefit of the information they 'supply. If they desire to go to the. trouble of comparing the tables, jn order to work out any amounts referred to ih the financial statement, they will have all the material before them that I have had. I have concealed nothing from honourable members, and I have given them exactly the figures on which I have myself worked.

I am not satisfied with matters as they stand in this respect. I called a meeting of the Treasurers of the States, and we had a very interesting and very instructive discussion on the whole subject, extending over several days. I am glad to be able to say that we came more nearly to an agreement as to what ought to be done than I at first anticipated. When we first started our proceedings, we were very wide apart indeed, but gradually, day after day, upon arguing the matter out, we saw we could get more closely to each other. We agreed that all the debts should be taken over, and not merely a portion of them. South Australia preferred that a portion only of the debts should be taken over, but did not object to the whole being taken over. Then it was thought that we should deal with the whole subject at the earliest possible moment, and the Treasurer of New South Walessaid that he would like to wait to see what would be the effect of the working of the Federation, in order to ascertain whether the Federation could borrow more cheaply than the States. That was one of his difficulties. Then there was unanimity amongst us as to the necessity for a properly guarded sinking fund for each Commonwealth loan a genuine sinking fund, which could not be used by the Federal Treasurer if he should require' it for any 'other purpose.

AllI asked was that, to prevent competition between'the States and the Commonwealth, the whole of the borrowing should be done through the Commonwealth Treasurer, who would borrow for the States what they required, so long as he had ample security for repayment. would there be any danger of the Commonwealth encroaching upon the land revenues of the States? if the borrowing of a State were approaching a dangerous point, the Commonwealth Treasurer would say, "" I will not borrow any more for you, as I do not think that the security is sufficient. Your revenue may fall off. I shall not consent to borrow any more for vou unless you are prepared to assign me further revenue, and to give me the right to collect it myself, if I think sisted that the Braddon section of the Conthat necessary."" which a State desired to borrow be taken into consideration by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth ? my scheme the Commonwealth Treasurer would not interfere in any way with the borrowing of the States. Whatever a State asked for-£r,000,000 , ,£2,000,000, or £3,000,000-h e would borrow if the market were favorable, and the transaction would not conflict with a consolidation loan, provided that ample security was given to him. My suggestion was strongly objected to, because the Treasurers of the States desired to have unlimited and unfettered powers of borrowing. My reply was that if they persisted in that view, the Conference must end. I think that the whole, or a great portion of the benefit to be gained by allowing the Commonwealth Treasurer to borrow on behalf of the States would be in the prevention of competition between States in tbe London money market. We should not have one ' State rushing get an advantage over another State, or over the Commonwealth, nor would a State be forced to take whatever terms .it could get, and be squeezed by the financiers in the old land. I think that all borrowing should be done through the Commonwealth Treasurer. member for Kooyong has suggested that a finance commission might be appointed to do the work; but, personally, I should be prepared to trust the Commonwealth Treasurer to do what is just and equitable. Any man holding the position would have as his only object the assistance of the States, because he would know that if trouble came to one State it would react on the Commonwealth. The only agreement I could make with the Treasurers of the States was that, instead of a sinking fund of ijj per cent, if the Commonwealth Treasurer borrowed, they would provide a sinking fund of 1 per cent. ' if the Treasurers of the States borrowed. That, however, is not an arrangement to which I feel inclined to agree. Of course I do not wish to utter anything in. the nature of a threat. I do not believe in doing that. But I had to point out to the Treasurers of the States what I point out again now. that, sooner or later, the States will be forced, to borrow through the Commonwealth. The Treasurers of the States institution should be made perpetual, and that three-fourths of the total Customs revenue raised by the Commonwealth should 1 be returned to the States each year. South Australia and Tasmania wished to have the surplus returned on a per capita basis. I was ready to go a long way, because I was very desirous of bringing the Conference to a successful termination, and of being able to propose to Parliament a scheme which I could honestly recommend, and for which I could fairly claim support. Besides, having been a State Treasurer myself,I know the difficulties with which the State Treasurers have to contend. I therefore offered to ask the Federal Parliament to agree to an absolute extension of the Braddon section of the Constitution for a period 1 of fifteen years, thus giving it a currency of twenty-five years instead of ten years, as is now provided for. They would then be entitled to obtain collectively three-fourths of the total Customs revenue raised by the Commonwealth for a period of twenty-five years from the inauguration of Federation.. Another proposal I made to them was that, during the currency of the existing redeeminto the money market*"" to able loans, which is something over forty years, the Commonwealth should return to them each year three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue raised in that year, or that they should be given a sum equal to three-fourths of the average yearly collection of the Commonwealth during the ten The honourable years of the operation of the Braddon sec-",52,Increase On Salaries £82 273

Treasurers will not even supply us with their claims. Tbey have them made out, but will not hand them over until we have agreed upon the mode in which they areto be compensated. I believe that these claims amount to £15,000,000 or£16,000,000. The honourable member for Wide Bay interjected just now, "" What does the two things it matter to the electors""? If the States made no charge whatever against the ComI do not monwealth, it would not make very much difference to the position. Whatever they receive, and whatever we have to pay, must come out of the same pockets. The only difference is that upon a population basis some States will have to contribute a larger amount than others. My suggestion at the Conference was that we should strike a balance, and then leave a very small sum -perhap s £2,000,000-to be paid in the manner I then indicated. The States Treasurers objected that the adoption of such a-proposal would result in taking away from them all their buildings, and leaving them with all their loans. To my mind, there is not much in the contention. The main object, however, is to control Federal expenditure. They know that if we had to borrow money and to provide interest and sinking fund we should need to set apart £ 4 o o o o o or 0 That is a detail, £500,00 0 annually out of our one-fourth of the Customs receipts. They make no secret of their desire. Their main purpose is to restrictourexpenditure.

But it is very easy for people outside to originate As a rumour that the Federal Parliament is dreadfullv extravagant, and that it is expending hundreds of thousands of pounds bere, there, and everywhere.

143,Mr King O ' Malley,"-Are we not theview of the fact that we have a large object to gain in bringing about the federalization of the States' debts, I would not stand out for terms unless they were the essence of the bargain. There, are two other matters which I cannot discuss in detail, because they are matters of policy. I refer to preferential trade, and the appointment of a Tariff Commission. will probably speak early in the debat-; upon my Budget statement, and will then be able to discuss these, two questions f u l ly from his point of view. So far as th.; Tariff Commission is concerned, we are all agreed that the fullest investigation should be made into the working and effect of the present Tariff upon Australian industries. We also agree that it should be an impartial inquiry. It should be made by persons in whom the people would have confidence, and whose decision could not be said to be tainted in any way. We should make the best selection possible with human nature to select from, and we should secure the services of a board in which the vast majority of the people have complete confidence. that it should be appointed from outside of Parliament ? point for fuller consideration. Irrespective of whether or not it is composed of members of Parliament or outsiders, the personnel of the Commission must be such that the people will have absolute confidence in it. Admittedly, it is a matter of national importance, because upon the right settlement of this question depends, to a great extent, the future prosperAlthough a thorough inquiry may take a ity of the Commonwealth. Without venturing to offer any opinion upon the question of free-trade versus protection, I say that we should have the fullest possible inquiry. With that end in view, we propose to appoint a Royal Commission, the constitution of which will have to be dealt with by the Government, because a Commission is really an appointment by the Governor General, acting upon the advice of his responsible Ministers. There is one aspect of this matter upon which the honourable and learned member for Indi and myself differ very much. For years we worked together, although we were sometimes a little bit apart, because he was always more radical than I . Nevertheless, we worked together harmoniously for very many years. But so far as this question is concerned, I 9 1.1 differ entirely from the views of the honourable and learned member, and because he desires to restrict the inquiry. ' As I understand his proposal, he desires that the Parliament, with practically no evidence before it, save the statements of interested parties, shall limit the scope of the inquiry to a certain number of trades. That course was adopted The Prime Minister by the late Sir Graham Berry, when he came back from England. I was then Commissioner of Trade and Customs, and in that capacity had intimated that, except for revenue purposes, there would be no revision of the Tariff during the then session of the Parliament. But pressure was brought to bear upon Sir Graham Berry, just as it has been brought to bear on honourable members, of this House, with a view to a variation of that decision. The duties on boots, hats, and woollens were mentioned, and it was urged that there should be a revision of "" just a few lines,"" but I warned Sir Graham Berry that if the matter were once opened it would be impossible for him .to withstand the rush that would be made to extend the revision of the Tariff to almost every industry. I feel satisfied that any effort in that direction, in the case of the Commonwealth Tariff, would be attended by the same results. If we attempted in any shape or form to restrict the inquiry to a few industries to be named by us, without having any proper information at our disposal to guide us in determining whether it should be so restricted that would be the result. The main object of the Commission will be to inquire into the effect of the Tariff, and if we attempt to restrict it in any way we shall make a great mistake. little longer than would that suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi, I have no hesitation in saying that, in my judgment, a f u l l investigation should be made. The representatives of every occupation, trade, and manufacture who desire to appear before the Commission to express the views entertained by those engaged in their avocations should have an opportunity to do so. I speak from experience, because I have been through the ordeal of three Tariff revisions. Two of these took place in the Victorian Parliament, while the third was that through which we passed in this House,) and which, unfjbrtunately, broke down the health of the right honourable member for Adelaide, who was then my colleague, and seriously injured my own.

As the result of this information, I was forced to dealt with before the position of others the conclusion that the very high duties was considered. which had prevailed in Victoria were not wholly required. This matter will have to be fully threshed out before a Commission in whom both sides have confidence, and the work will be a very heavy one. pose that the Commission shall deal with to the whole Tariff? should any industry be shut out?

Honourable members know that the Deakin Government and its supporters went to the country, as a party, knowing that certain industries were not flourishing as well as they ought, and that it was said that they were not receiving the requisite measure of protection to enable them to succeed. Knowing of these facts, we weighed them against the possibility of re-opening the whole question, and all the difficulties and trouble which invariably take place in connection with the revision of a Tariff, and decided, not without the fullest consideration, that we would not support any revision during the life of the present Parliament. I see no reason whatever to depart from that decision. I have heard nothing to show that any change of that policy should be made. No reasons have been advanced during the various discussions that have taken place on the question this session that would justify any departure from the solemn pledge I made to my constituents that I would not support any interference with the Tariff during this Parliament. stituents have released us from that pledge -and few members of the Victorian Protectionist Party, at all events, failed to give it I , for one, shall not feel justified in doing anything to re-open the Tariff question during this Parliament. provisions of the Sugar Bounty Act. provides for an experiment which we decided should extend over a certain number of years. end of the period named for that measure, the growers of white sugar would be able to carry on the industry without any further assistance from the Commonwealth.

That is a matter which will have to be debated; and, I think, that experience has shown that it is better to discuss all matters relating to Departments when the Estimates for those Departments are under consideration. Of course there are some financial matters-such , for instance, as those with regard to States debts, transferred properties, preferential trade, and the Tariffwhich can be discussed at the stage which we look upon, as equivalent to the second reading stage. But all matters particularly affecting Departments, such as the Post and Telegraph Department and the Defence Department, can, I think, be better discussed when we reach the Estimates for those Departments. Therefore, I have asked my colleague, the Minister of Defence, to make a full statement when the Estimates of his .Department are reached with regard to the future administration of the Defence Forces. I have now concluded by task. It has taken me longer than I had anticipated. I have omitted a large number offigureswhich I might have given to the Committee, but I will rectify that omission by requesting the publication of tables in the Hansard report, so that honourable members, before the Budget is discussed, will have an opportunity to consider everything that I have said in t'he light of full information. can only assure the Committee that I have placed the whole of the facts before them, and I have put forward my anticipations, from the only point of view which I could justify-that which I honestly consider is likely to occur.

184,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"the 27th May, 1902. The debate that took place is a matter of history. The measure was discussed at considerable length. Many honourable members expressed themselves in favour of granting bonuses for the production of iron, tout a large number held that it would be a good thing to endeavour to nationalize the industry, instead of holding out encouragement in the way of bonuses to private enterprise. After some long and interesting speeches, in the course of which a great deal of information was given to the House, the subject was referred to a Royal Commission. That Commission was composed of honourable members of this House, selected from each side, and a glance at the fiscal faith, or professed' fiscal faith, of those gentlemen, shows that half may be classed as free traders and the other half as protectionists. This selection insured that from the fiscal stand-point, the whole! matter would be thoroughly investigated, and that a good deal of information of value to honourable members, and to all who take an interest in the matter, would be furnished. The Commission held meetings in three or four of the States, and heard evidence from all the experts available. When the time arrived for the presentation of the report, it was found that the members of the Commission were divided in opinion, and that there were two reports, one of which might be called the report of the Commission, since it represented a majority, created by the vote of the Chairman, while the other was what is termed a minority report. The first report was in favour of a bonus to encourage this great industry, and in favour of its being undertaken by the State rather than by private enterprise. Just at that time there was a change of Government, and an appeal to the electors, and the policy on which the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for. Ballarat, went to the country was fiscal peace and preferential trade. It was understood that the question of a bonus for the iron industry, and also that of preferential trade were excepted from "" fiscal peace "" ; and, consequently, the latter issue was placed before the electors as plainly as was possible on the occasion of a general appeal of the kind . We all recognise that this proposal for a bonus for the iron industry was really part and parcel of the Tariff. A good deal of Injustice was caused by the postponement of the consideration of Division 6A. Those, engaged in the industry suffered much loss; indeed, some of the works have been practically closed, owing to the unfortunate delay brought about in the way I have indicated. will show that there has been this loss? show that. When the new Parliament met, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who was then the honourable member for Hume, introduced a Bill which was almost identical with the proposals laid before honourable members in 1902 by the right honourable member for Adelaide. That Bill reached its second reading stage in the hands of the honourable member for Hume, and is the Bill before us to-day. Before it could be advanced further than the commencement of the debate on the second reading-and when the honourable member for North Sydney had moved the adjournment of the debate-the Deakin Government resigned. Some honourable members at that time attached much importance to a power on the part of the Government to resume any iron works which might be subsidized, but beyond that, there was no great difference between that measure and the measure introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide. When the Watson Govern1 ment entered office, I gave notice of a motion in favour of the encouragement of the iron industry. I recognised that that was a mixed Government-that in fiscal faith its members were equally divided, there being four protectionists and four free-' traders. Under the circumstances, we could not expect that the Bill would be considered in the same way fiscally as it would have been by a Government, all the members of which were protectionists. I gave notice of motion because I recognised that this should be one of the premier industries of the country, and would, if established, give a great deal of employment and impetus to trade. Just about that time the honourable member for Hume asked some questions in the House as to whether the Watson Government would set apart time to enable him to proceed with the Bill, and it was promised that the matter would be 1 considered in Cabinet, and a reply given in a few days. A deputation of iron workers waited on me and asked me to introduce them to the Prime Minister, in order that they might show the great injustice under which they were suffering owing to the delay in proceeding with the measure. They pointed",59,Second Reading

186,Mr Austin Chapman,"I shallout. that in the wire-netting branch of the industry works in Victoria had already been closed, and large establishments in New South Wales, in which an immense sum of money is invested, and which afford a good deal of employment, were about to dose unless they received some consideration at the hands of Parliament. When the deputation waited upon him, the Prime Minister informed me that the matter would be brought before the Cabinet on the following Tuesday-it was a Saturday on which I introduced the deputation-and it was very likely that time would be given to a private member to proceed with the Bill, he at the time mentioning the name of the honourable member for Hume. I told that honourable member that I was very anxious to give every assistance; and it was my intention then to withdraw my notice of motion. We know that on the following week the Watson. Government promised to give the honourable member for Hume time in which to proceed with the measure; but before any further steps could be taken, that Government resigned. When the present Government came into office, it was understood that the question of a bonus to the iron industry was to be an open one, in the same way as it had been an open one with the' preceding Government, with the difference that the present Government stated their intention to afford a private member time to introduce a measure, with a view to obtaining an expression of opinion from the House. been introduced. then, to go on with the measure. honourable member's hands. members are quite able to defend themselves without requiring any champions, and the honourable member opposite need not' show so much pique, seeing that I am not saying anything against the Government of which he was a member. stood the honourable, member for Hume to state, in the House, that he would not accept anything from the present Government. HowI gpt that impression I do not know; but the honourable member has denied making that statement, and I must accept his denial. On the other hand, the Prime Minister assures me that the honourable member for Hume did make such a statement, and I am obliged to accept that assurance also. I asked the right honourable gentleman in the House what he was going to do, and he said that it was an open question. The honourable member for Hume was not on very good terms with me, though for what reason I did not know, unless it was that as I had voted differently from himself, and he had chosen not to be 01; speaking terms with, me for a time. Consequently, I could not approach him and ask him what he proposed to do. I took the next best step. Recognising that the position was serious, I asked the secretary of the Protectionist Union in Sydney^ of which the honourable member for Hume has been president for many years, what, in the opinion of himself and of Sydney protectionists-wh o are much interested in this proposal-wa s best to be done in the circumstances. The secretary informed me that the honourable member for Hume had intimated to him that if I could obtain time from the' Government to go on with the measure, he would give me every possible assistance That naturally led me to believe that the report I had heard-that the honourable member for Hume would not accept anything from this Governmentwas correct. Otherwise, why should he offer to help me? Why did he not say at once, ""Oh, no; this Bill is mine."" If he had done that the position would have been very different. I then asked the secretary of the Protectionist Unioni f he had any information which might be of service to me in dealing with the question. He told me that he had sent a number of the papers to the honourable member for Hume, whom he would ask to hand them over to me. I said, "" Sir William is not speaking to me now, and perhaps it would be better if you obtained the papersfrom him yourself."" He forwarded the papers to me, and I concluded that he obtained them on the understanding that the honourable member for Hume'would give me a'helping hand. When I asked the Prime Minister in the Housei f he would give me time to go on with the Bill, neither the honourable member for Hume nor any one else took exception to my request. Paragraphs on the subject appeared in the Sunday Times and daily newspapers of Sydney, and in the Age and Argus here, but no one raised any objection. After the papers were sent to me, a motion of censure was interposed. During the progress of the debate on that motion, the newspapers referred again to",60,Second Reading

192,Mr Austin Chapman,"I underthe fact that, if it were not carried it was the intention, of the Prime Minister to give me time to go on with this measure, and no one offered any objection until the vote was taken last Thursday evening. Then what happened? Perhaps it would have been better tactics if the Prime Minister had deferred making any explanation until the following day, because honourable members generally were warm, and after a close division of that kind those who are defeated are rather apt to make statements which they would not make in their cooler moments. But the Prime Minister-assum ing, I suppose, that there would be no difficulty-simpl y announced to honourable members what would be the order of business. What remarks were made then? First of all we had the leader of the Opposition on his feet, championing the cause of the honourable member for Hume. All of us who know the latter believe that he is well able to champion his own rights. Why was it necessary, therefore, for the ex-Prime Minister, the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Kennedy, and the honourable and learned memmer for Indi, to rise in their places one after the other and, in championing the honourable member for Hume, pitch into me ? steam. off steam, as I think they will admit now, they did me an injustice. Exception was taken on that occasion by the honourable member for Moira to the fact that the measure should not be placed in the hands of a private member, since an expenditure of ^324,000 was involved, and a similar objection was made by the honourable member for Parramatta. Does it not seem strange that they should take up this attitude when they did not object to the proposal of the last Government to hand over the Bill for Hume? Although the honourable member for Wide Bay cheered the remark that it should not be handed over to a private member, yet he, as a member of the late Government, was quite prepared to hand it over to the honourable member for Hume. What was right then is evidently wrong now. That requires some explanation which perhaps he will be able to give in due course. things had happened since then. that circumstances do alter cases, but nevertheless it is difficult to understand when some persons are in earnest. I took rather strong exception to certain remarks of the honourable member for Bland-first , because he was doing an injustice to me, and secondly, because he was making a threat against the measure. Of course, I accepted his assurance that he was making no such threat, and that he was only standing up for the rights of the honourable member for Hume. But I would call particular attention to this fact: that it was not necessary for four or five of the leading lights on the Opposition side to take exception to the action of the Prime Minister, when the honourable-member for Hume was here to speak for himself. On the following morning I went to the Prime Minister and told him that as there appeared to be some misunderstanding over this business, as the honourable member for Hume appeared to be taking up the role of an injured politician, and as. the leading lights in the Opposition appeared to me as if they would not view the Bill from a too friendly stand-point, I wished him to allow one of his colleagues to take charge of it, so as not to prejudice its passage through the House. consent ? request so that the complaint could not be made that an honourable member was being badly used.

No honourable member has a But I had not the least obright to say that he will refuse or accept any particular amendment in connection with Indeed, I it. That is a matter for the majority of honourable members to determine. I reThat, I ""think, ought to show peat that any honourable member can only be nominally in charge of the Bill, and it would appear to me to be only an attempt to find an excuse for opposing the measure, to give as a reason for opposition to it, the statement that one honourable member, and not another takes charge of it. I wish merely In the first place, he to put my own position clear. I have no desire to jump any one's claim; but I assert the sameright as any one else to push this matter forward, and of course I shall welcome support from any quarter. I do not .propose to speak at length on the principle It is of the Bill, because the pros and cons of the matter have been threshed out so often before. We have had them so well submitted in the report of the Commission, that it is hardly necessary that there should be any long speeches made, and we must recognise that, at this stage of the session, we should as far as possible economize time. I expect that those who believe in the measure will not labour the subject by making long speeches, which may result in its being blocked for want of time. I ' recognise that the real tug of war will come when we get into Committee. We are all agreed that the matter dealt with is one of national importance, and that the iron industry is the foundation and backbone of all the manufacturing industries of Australia. If we do not all recognise that, certainly the great majority of honourable memI suppose bers do, and I believe they are in favour of promoting the establishment of I expect him to the industry, and making it what it ought to be in this country. No doubt the bone of contention is whether it should be under State control or in the hands of private enterprise. As to the great principle involved, He it can hardly be claimed, even by ardent free-traders in this House, that it is against their policy to vote for a bonus, because A t any rate, I am giving we have repeatedly had statements from "" first-rank free-traders in this country that",62,Second Reading

206,Mr Austin Chapman,"if any encouragement is necessary for an industry it is better, in their opinion, that wherever possible it should take the form of a bonus. They give as their reason, that in that form we know exactly what has to be paid. It is a straight-out payment, and there is an end to it. Consequently, they cannot object to this measure on the ground that it is against their free-trade principles. Besides that, at the stage at which we have arrived in this Parliament, a number of honourable members will be able to view the matter from the stand-point, not of free trade, but of compromise. If they agree with me that this is really a part of the Tariff, which has been postponed, they will, I have no doubt, be able to view it in a very much more favorable light than they would if we were fighting each other on the fiscal question, when each honourable member would be standing out to the last for what lie believed to be the best policy to pursue. I say that the establishment of the iron industry may be favourably viewed from the stand-point of compromise by honourable members who might take strong exception to it if it were viewed from the stand-point of free-trade alone. Let me tell honourable members what the present Prime Minister thought of this matter. orable member for Barrier will, allow his memory to carry him back, he will recollect that the present Prime Minister was the political friend of the late Mr Mitchell, who endeavoured to establish this industry in New South Wales. The right honourable gentleman promised consideration of the matter on several occasions, and we believe that but for the early death of Mr Mitchell the industry would probably have been established in that State by this time. But let us come right down to 1901 to learn what were the views of the present Prime Minister at that time. On tb.e 15th October, 1901, during the debate on a motion of censure, referring to tbe. right honourable member for Adelaide, the present Prime Minister saidThe Minister for Trade and Customs was simply immense upon a policy which he hopes to introduce at some future date in reference to the iron industry. I have alw:iys been one who would like to see the iron industry firmly established, but my method of effecting this would be by giving it direct encouragement from the national Exchequer. My reason for so doing would be, that as it is a national,industry the nation should pay the expense of encouraging it. ""The man who uses the iron ought not to be compelled to do that. A national benefit should be paid for out of the national funds. Why should not the whole community pay this bonus to the iron industry if the establishment of that industry confers a national benefit ? Why should the man who is encouraging the industry, and who is buying the material, be the only person to pay for this national advantage? . . . A national advantage should be paid for out of the national Exchequer, and not out of the pockets of a particular individual who happens to encourage the production of a particular article. able gentleman so far. the matter very clearly. The Prime Minister was then in favour of encouraging this industry by the payment of a bonus. I hope we shall find that the right honourable gentleman is still in favour of that. A t any rate, I confidently appeal to him, not only to stand by what he then said, but to view the matter from the point of view of compromise. tleman merely pointed out that a bonus is less objectionable than is a protective tax; but both 'are objectionable. orable and learned member for Werriwa will have an opportunity of explaining later on. The right honourable gentleman certainly pointed out that the iron industry is a naI f the hontional industry which will provide a great deal of employment, and that if he had his way he would encourage it by means of a bonus. able gentleman told the honourable member that he will vote for this Bill? orable member for Bourke is busily engaged in asking questions, but I wish he would devote some little attention to the necessitv for helping this matter along. This is a measure in connection with which protectionists, no matter on which side of the House they may sit, should not squabble and fight amongst themselves. We have a right to expect that, no matter on which side they sit, they will render genuine assistance. I take it that there is no necessity to make any appeal to them. It is rather to those who were once free-traders that I appeal. I ask the honourable and learned member for. Werriwa to view this question now from the stand-point of the understanding, as it has been termed, that has been arrived at on this side of the House. dead against it .",63,Second Reading

Even in England, tbe ary industries, and to show by their votes that they are willing to respect the understanding that has been arrived at. honourable member for Barrier to respect the alliance he has made with the honourable and learned member for Indi. We know that that honourable and learned member bases all his complaints against those of us who sit in the Ministerial corner on the fact that of all kinds into America in 1867 amounted they are the protectionists who desire' to give encouragement to industries. Since the Prime Minister has said that he has no objection to the granting of a bonus, and as we are all in favour of fiscal peace, I think that I can ask even New South Wales free traders if they are prepared to allow the Tariff, bad as it is, to assist only indus1 tries in other States, instead of putting into force that portion of it which would give New South Wales her opportunity. While I ask the honourable and learned member for Werriwa to respect the understanding which has been entered into, I ask the honourable member for Barrier to stand by the alliance of which he is so proud. I think we can all agree that the Commission has proved the importance of the iron industry, and the need for establishing it in this country. When the matter was discussed before, it was doubted whether we had sufficient deposits of iron in Australia to make the manumarkets. It is a question to us paramount to all facture of iron here a commercial success; but the evidence taken by the Commission sets that doubt at rest. We know that there are rich deposits of iron ore in each of the States, and that there are men who are ready to embark their capital in establishing iron works, if they can get security, and in the iron trade, but now, not only are likely to obtain encouragement which will place the industry on a proper basis. Furthermore, Mr Coghlan has officially stated that in New South Wales alone there is enough ore in sight to supply the Commonwealth for many years to come. This ore is situated close to large supplies of coal and limestone, and the necessary fluxes. Furthermore, Mr Jacquet, who is an undoubted authority on the subject, he having given great time and attention to it, has shown that there are extensive deposits of iron ' ore in the different States. Everything points to the fact that the iron industry, which is a' great source of employment in other countries, may be successfully established in Australia. But it cannot be established with iron industry was encouraged, the duty from 1798 to 1825 averaging £ 3 12s. per ton, and at times being over JC6 per ton, which is ten times the assistance that we ask for. In America, where the industry was fostered, the gross production of iron in 1867 was 2,277 tons; in 1868,6,451 tonsj in 1869, 8,616 tons; in 1870, 30,357 tons; in 1880, 864,353 tons; and in 1890, 1,871,425 tons. The importation of rails to 145,580 tons; and in 1881, to 344,929 tons; but by 1890 it had decreased to 204 tons. Englishmen now find even the home market invaded by Americans. Not only are many English bridges made by American firms, but many new buildings in London are constructed by Americans of American-made steel and iron. Let me read what the Times says on this pointThere seems now to be dawning the period foretold, for American makers are sending their surplus product, not only to markets that are common to both this country and themselves, but are attacking us in our strongholds at home. The Glasgow correspondent of Engineering, writing at the early part of November, says"" Steel rails continue to be very much depressed, most of the e>port orders being absorbed by the American mills at prices which British manufacturers cannot at present touch. . . . The abnormal demand of the United States for its own engineering products is fast slackening, thus bringing the marvellous increase of American manufacturing capacity of the last five years-perhap s more especially the last three years-to bear on foreign others. Even the efficiency of the navy is subsidiary to it, for if -we lose our engineering supremacy our naval supremacy will follow."" That shows what has been done by the encouragement of the iron industry in America. Great Britain was once supreme America, but even Germany is in front of her. ceedingly important matter, I wish to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed].

Not only are bounties paid for its encouragement, but cheap freights and other benefits are given to those engaged in the production of iron. Let us take the case of Canada, which possesses a population very little in excess of our own. What does Sir Charles Tupper say of the iron industry there? He saysMy honourable friend stated that the iron industry was one that the Government fudged to be of great importance, for the reason that the wealth created by the development of this kind, of industry is almost wholly devoted to payment for labour. Thus it became an industry almost above all others that deserved a fostering care of the Government, if , by public aid, parties could be induced to bring in their capital, and develop the enormous resources which Providence has given us in the vast deposits of iron ore that exist in the different parts of the Dominion. . . . I know of no measure, after the most careful investigation of this question, that can be adopted-n o single points to which my honourable friend can turn his attention as inviting and developing industry, which will give a greater amount of employment, in proportion to the industry itself, to the people of this country-than the protection proposed to be given to the development of our iron industry. Two dollars a ton cost the country something, but they all contribute to it-it will be taken out of the general Treasury. Buti f we can put thousands of men to work in mining our OTes, in a development of our coal, and in converting it into coke, and the smelting of this iron, we create a large industry in the country. We give employment to the people, who will eventually get their stuff as cheaply as before. That is the policy of the Government, and this is the outcome of that proposition. I only wish that I could hear the Prime insecure footing indeed? MinisFer utter similar sentiments to-night.

What, did some of our most thoughtful proof panic would ensue. Consequently, hontectionists think of this great question when ) orable members who oppose this Bill must they met in conference in the different capitals before the establishment of Federation? They arrived at the following resolution:That, in view of the enormous benefits which may reasonably be expected to accrue to the Australian Commonwealth from the establishment of iron and steel industries within its borders, this Conference recommends that such industries be encouraged by bonuses from the Federal Government for a stated period, to be fixed thereby, of 12s. per ton for every ton of pig iron or steel ingots and bars, rods and sheets, whether of iron or steel, the produce of native ores and fluxes. That in order to encourage the manufacture of iron and steel goods, for two years after tbe imposition of the Federal Tariff, and no longer, a rebate, equal to the amount of duty paid, should be allowed on all pig iron and steel ingots, puddled bar, and steel blooms, and billets imported and actually used within that period in the manufacture of iron and steel goods of any class and character. That is the opinion of thoughtful men, who believe in the encouragement of every class of industry. They point out that the iron industry is the base of all our manufacturing industries, and is consequently worthy of some attention. Since the period when that resolution was agreed to, matters have progressed somewhat. Owing to the labours of the Commission which investigated this question, we know a good deal more of the subject than we did, and are therefore in a better position to arrive at a sound judgment.

How is that possible, in the absence of local ironworks ? Are we to be satisfied with always having an army of unemployed? In a great industry of this character, we might well compare the position of Canada with that of Australia. on to the land. deny that there are tens of thousands of unemployed in our midst to-day, and that business is bad, whilst in Canada, where high wages prevail, and great encouragement is given to the iron industry, there are no unemployed. should like to quote from the Statistical Year Book of Canada for 1902. It statesIn the session of 1894 an Act was passed providing that the Governor in Council may authorize the payment of a bounty of $2 per ton on all pig iron made in Canada from Canadian ore, or a bounty of $2 per ton on all puddled bars made in Canada from Canadian pig iron made from Canadian ore, and a bounty of $2 per ton on all steel billets manufactured in Canada from Canadian pig iron, and such other ingredients as are necessary and usual in the manufacture of steel billets. These bounties were applicable till 26th March, 1899, in the case of furnaces commencing operations subsequent to that date, but before 27th March, 1899, for five years from the date of commencing. This Act was repealed by Chapter VI . of the Act of 1897, which authorized the Governor-' General to give (1) a bounty of $3 per ton on steel ingots manufactured from ingredients of which not less than 50 per cent, of their weight consists of pig iron made in Canada; (2) a bounty of $3 per ton on puddled iron bars made from Canadian made pig iron; (3) a bounty on pig iron manuf ac tured from ore, of $3 per ton on the proportion produced from Canadian ore, and 82 on the proportion produced from foreign ore. An Act of 1898 provided that the provisions of the Act are to be held to have come into force on 23rd April, 1897. An Act of 1899 provides that these bounties shall continue to be paid till 30th June, 1907, at a yearly diminishing rate from igo2-; 90 per cent, of the bounties to be paid in 1902-3; 75 per cent, in 1903-4; 55 per cent, in 1904-5; 35 per cent, in 1905-oj and 20 per cent, ia 1906-7. Active works are carried on by seven companies, and the annual aggregate capacity of all the completed and unfinished furnaces is nearly 1,100,000 grcss tons. The Lake Superior Power Company are building a very extensive plant for the manufacture of pig iron, steel, and steel rails, the latter the first established in Canada. united investment amounts to .24,500,000 dollars, which will be increased to 35,000,000 dollars by new plant now building. Within five or six years the total investment in the iron industry of the Dominion will aggregate, approximately, 50,000,0110 dollars. Mt. Austin Chapman. That is my answer to those who say that if we grant a bonus we shall create a monopoly ; that is my answer, and I think it is a most emphatic one, to those who say that if we grant the proposed bonus there will be no competition in Australia. Let me make a further quotation. It is here pointed out thatOn December 31, 1902, the unsold stocks of pig iron in Canada amounted to 20,328^ gross tons, as compared with 59,472 tons at the close of 1901. On December 3J, 1902, there were twelve completed furnaces in Canada, and four furnaces were in course of construction. Of the completed furnaces seven were in blast and five were idle on the date named. During 1902 four new furnaces were erected. That, again, is my answer to those who In this connection I say that the success of the industry in the United States, Germany, and other countries is due to their large population. In Canada, with a population but slightly in excess of our own a population living under a Government practically similar to that of the Commonwealth, and working under the same conditions-thi s splendid result has been attained. It is no wonder that a number of the young men of the Commonwealth are crossing the seas and seeking employment in Canada. The article continuesIn igor the total quantity of iron ore consumed was 517,623 tons, of the value of $1,390,542. The quantity of charcoal used was 1,835,736 tons, of the value of $100,978; of coke, 321,163 tonsj valued at $1,036,714; while the quantity of coal used was 2,039 tons, valued at $6,117. Of flux consumed, this amounted in the year 1901 to 169,399 > valued at $183,162. The total valus to n s of the pig-274,37 6 tons-wa s $3,512,923, or i2'8o dollars per ton. The value of the ex; ports of iron and steel goods manufactured in Canada during 1896 was $522,988; in 1902 it had jumped to $2,460,781. that be so, it would be very pleasant if, besides supplying our own wants, we could export every , year nearly £500,000 worth of manufactured iron goods, thus giving employment to our people, and bringing money here instead of sending it away. We all know that every care has been taken to ascertain whether the industry can be established on a commercial basis if fair encouragement be given and reasonably fair conditions imposed.

Are we to keep this matter dangling in front of their eyes? Are we going to say that we ""think it would be better for the States tp take up the industry? This morning's newspapers contain reports of a meeting held in Melbourne by a labour union, at which it was decided to suggest to the Government that some provision be inserted in the Bill, giving the Government power to resume the works if the industry be taken up by private enterprise.' We know, however, that the Government always have power to resume. the Bill. even if it were not, the Government would be able, at any time, to resume the works. The real kernel of the question is whether we are going to give encouragement to private individuals to establish the industry, or really to defeat the whole thing by asking the States to take up the industry. What would be the use of our doing so? We have already appealed to the States. What was the answer made by the New South Wales Government to the inquiry of the Commonwealth whether it would be prepared to take up the industry? The honourable member for Bland said that the feeling was so strong in New South Wales that, with a little agitation on the part of the public, he believed that the then Government-the See-O'Sullivan Administration-woul d take the matter in hand and establish a State industry. appeared. ceived an answer from them. That Government had a strong labour backing, so that they were more likely to make the industry a State-owned one than was any other Government that had been in power in New South Wales for some time. They said that they were not prepared to He reported in favour embark in the industry, and suggested that it should be handed over to private enterprise. I take it that that is the opinion entertained by a great many honourable members. We have had most emphatic statements from the Governments of. other States in regard to the question. The Governments of Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania are not prepared to take up the industry, and consequently we may well ask ourselves, "" What are we going to do?

236,Mr Austin Chapman,"I wouldestimate of Mr Jacquet shows that the amount of ore in sight is approximately 50,000,000 tons. There can be very little doubt, however, that there is much more actually in sight in this country. Of course in making official estimates a man who has a reputation to lose is very particular not to make a mistake, or, if he errs at all, he takes care to err on the right side. I find that as much coal has been taken out of England as was estimated to be in sight sixty years' ago. Yet the supply of coal from England appears to be inexhaustible. In America, the amount of iron ore taken out and used in manufactures exceeds the original estimate. Yet there are 650,000,000 tons of ore in sight to-day. No 'industry gives greater employment, or causes a larger percentage of money to be expended in wages than the iron industry. Consequently there is no industry that distributes a larger there can be very little doubt that some percentage of money throughout the community. It must also be remembered that at least one-third of the total amount of iron used in Australia is used by the States. Probably it may be said that one-half of the total is used by them in one form or another. Therefore, if it is decided to give some of the money of the whole community for the encouragement of the iron industry, a very large amount of the money thus expended goes back into the pockets of the people. Not only do our resources warrant us in expecting that in a short time we shall be able to supply our own needs, but we ought soon to be able to compete in the markets of the world. Because it has been proven that we have in Australia cheap coal, and that suitable limestone flux is to be found alongside the coal and ore deposits. would be required in Australia per annum? Not more than 35,000 tons. 1 sent. required at present would probably be more than doubled after a few years. It is difficult to say what quantity would be required when the industry had established itself. The figures from the United States and Canada show that in those countries the iron industry has progressed by leaps and bounds. iron production in Australia are so great that there can be very little doubt that the industry will make rapid progress. matter of fact coal can be raised at Lithgow and taken to the place where it is proposed to establish the iron works at 3s. per ton. It is well' known that iron ore can be raised cheaper in Australia than in America. It is not contemplated that we shall only establish works at an expenditure of ,£100,000 or ,£200,000. We require to have properly equipped works, costing, probably, from £500,000 to £1,000,000, together with every facility for producing and treating ore, and dealing with this great iron industry. There is no telling what quantity we shall be able to use and export when we have those facilities.. A t present there is a difficulty in the way of freights. The freight from Lithgow to Sydney is u s . 2d. per ton, whilst it is well known that iron has been brought to Australia from England at freight as low as 2s. 6d. per ton. Consequently consideration will have to be extended to the industry in the way of cheap freights. That is one of the considerations that has been asked for time after time whenever contractors have placed large orders. Some such system will probably have to be tried as has been brought into existence in the case of the flour industry. For instance, in New South Wales, wheat which is grown out west is sent down as far as Bathurst, where it is treated and turned into flour. It is tHen sent on its journey to Sydney at a low freight. That systemhas been adopted in order to enable such industries to be established in country places. Something of the same kind is necessary in connection with the iron industry. I should like to point out what were the experiences of Mr Rutherford, at Lithgow, many years ago. He established iron works on a small scale, though sufficient for the time. After getting everything in order and producing some iron, he made certain offers to the retailers in Sydney. He offered to put the iron bars and other iron work which they required into their racks and stores, and to wait for his money until such time as they had placed the iron with purchasers. A t that time the selling price was £ 1 4 per ton. Mr Rutherford asked .£10 per ton, ""thus enabling his customers to make a profit of 40 per cent. They held a meeting, but being importers, and knowing what it would mean if a local iron industry became firmly The facilities for established, they declined to take any of his iron.

It is said that works can be established in Australia the apathy in others, in connection with the deat a cost of £ J 00,000. it is possible to establish works at wealth any cost. It has been pretty clearly proven of that country.

First, there has the opposition of the importer, who makes the shipping interests that bring these enormous imports over the sea are naturally strong industry should be Government owned. This section fails to understand that it will require did deposits in each of the States, and freight considerations will, doubtless, insure the erection of plant in nearly every one. The investment of money under such circumstances, will, in a very short time, run into millions of money, and I recommend the following to the consideration of honourable members:The millennium is still a promise of the distant future, and to wait for the State establishment of Australian iron and steel industries inetins losing sight of the practical duties of everyday life. Dreamers have no place in this progressive age, And though their Utopian ideas may attract followers, any attempt to work out their system is certain to result in failure. If the representatives of the people in the Federal Parliament have the true interests of the community at heart, and are not biased by personal ideas or influences, action should at once be taken to give to Australia advantages similar to those enjoyed by Canada. Last year the value alone of iron and steel rails, girders and the like, imported into Australia was £2,303,333; whilst machinery which could be largely made within the Commonwealth if local iion works were available came to £1,342,332, and subheads another £245,888. A very large proportion of the money sent away to pay for these imports might have been expended locally, with most satisfactory results. plaints from every State that labour is not employed. In a new country such complaints should r.ot be heard, ancl the fact that they are heard may be traced to the channels of employment being neglected. Kepair and extend these, and the answer to the ever raised cry for work will bi found. The Government is aware that there are' private individuals who, if they receive the same treatment as the Canadians, are willing to embark their money in building up an Australian iron and steel industry. Whether the venture will prove profitable is difficult to determine, but, that its initiation will carry heavy risks must be admitted. AgainI invite the attention of those who are desirous to see the States undertake the work, to the following words from this good commercial authority:The bonus cannot be claimed until it is earned, and to earn it a big outlay is necessary. Surely those who take this risk upon themselves are entilled to :he insurance consideration which a bonus represents. Unfortunately Australian politics are not practical in character, consisting to a considervernment with all the rails and iron work able extent of talk and fighting between the "" ins "" and the "" outs"" over matters of secondary interest a far as the wants of this suffering community are concerned. Canada, it may be admitted, had tc pass through an ordeal much like our own.. Why should .Australia not profit by experience, which, though purchased by a period of depression, has culminated in prosperity and success? The case is as well put there as it could be put by any one. The article contains suggestions, over which we ought to ponder -it would be very difficult to dispute anything which the writer states. Let us now read an extract from the report of the Chamberlain Commission published in the Mr Austin Chafman. Sydney Morning Herald of 28th August, 1904. It saysOur inquiry has shown (1) that the iron and steel industry of this country has declined relatively '.o that of other countries; {2) that our export trade to foreign countries has diminished, while that to the colonies has incrtased; (3) that, although our trade with the colonies has increased, the colonial market is increasing much more rapidly, and that foreign countries are securing a growing proportion of this colonial trade; (4) that the relative decline of the British iron and steel industry is not due to any natural British disadvantages, or want of skill and enterprise on the part either of British manufacturers or of British workmen; (5) that it is due to the fact that the manufacturers of the United States and Germany, having secured control of their home markets by means of high tariffs and an organized system for the regulation of their export trade, are in a position to dump their surplus products upon the British and other markets, irrespective of cost; (6) that the practice of dumping could not be carried on by foreign countries but for the British system of free imports. The article points out that the British system of free imports is bound to induce dumping; and the protection such as this There are constant comBill proposes to give, would encourage a better system, and afford that protection to which the industry is entitled. report of the Chamberlain Commission, and it affords evidence which we ought to consider very carefully. There is another matter which I should like to bring under the notice of honourable members. It will probably be said that those who are engaged in this industry will be prepared, if they can obtain certain contracts, to carry on their works without the special consideration offered by the Bill. I have here the terms of an offer made to the Government of New South Wales by Mr Sandford, of Eskbank Iron and Steel Works, Lithgow. Tenders were called for, and Mr Sandford, to put the matter briefly, offered, if he were given a contract for five years, to supply the Gorequired, at the average prices which have prevailed for the last five years. Mr Sandford, of course, would allow the Government to stipulate in regard to qualityno product need be taken until it is absolutely certain that the quality is equal to that of the imported iron. price, or has the freight to be added ? price of the article delivered here, I should say.

Can any one wonder that we do riot progress as we might, when we are wrangling over the question whether this great industry should be established by State or by private enterprise? whether it is not better to allow private enterprise to take up the establishment of the industry under the provisions of such a measure as we have how before us, which would give the States power to come in at any time, and take over the works, even though they had proved to be a success? I admit that it is open to argument that it might scarcely be fair to those who put money into the enterprise, to have it left to them if it fails, and to have the Government step in and take it over if it proves a success. But we find that there are men who have the trust which most of us have in the spirit of fair play in this country, and are willing to take the risk.

Mr Sandford said he could produce pig iron at those who would be employed upon the Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favourably with any imported pig iron. Other witnesses, who, however, had less experience than Mr Sandford, doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But, on the supposition of his Having made an under estimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as I ask honourable members compared with the imported commodity. That is a curious method of reasoning. In paragraph 3, the minority report, which was endorsed by the leader of the Opposition, who, no doubt, wishes the industry well, emphasizes the fact .that there is no certainty that the granting of a bonus will result in the establishment of the iron industry, whereas paragraph 7 affirms that the prospects of such an enterprise are so good tliat no bonus is reouired. I repeat that the passage of this Bill would provide a large measure of employment. It is estimated that 1,000 men would probably start work immediately. ford's estimate was that within one month he would be able to start 400 men at Lithgow. We have the testimony of quite a number of experts that, if the industry were properly established, it would mean the employment of 12,000 men. honourable and learned member know that Paragraph 3 of the £4,500,000 worth of iron manufactures is annually imported by Australia?

287,Mr Austin Chapman,"Quite so.that this industry would be the greatest emment. The Bill, as it stands, is very fair, ployer of labour in Australia. Moreover, it is the base of many other industries. Consequently, we have to ask ourselves the question, "" Are we disposed to give the people work?"" If so-and I believe that a majority of us are-we must necessarily ask, ""Who should undertake this work? Should the State, or should we give some encouragement to private enterprise?"" If we adopt the latter course, we are likely to secure an early establishment of this great industry. By granting a bonus for the production of iron, we should induce competition, and we should probably have works established in every State. We were told that with the accomplishment of Federation the market of the States would be broadened, so that in time the cost of our products would be reduced. That being so, why should we introduce provincialism? We know that it would be very difficult to induce any of the States to take up the industry. What would be the use of asking the Tasmanian Government to establish works on the Blythe River, or of requesting some of the other States to take up the industry? them have not been able to deal with what, from the point of view of the States, are more great States of Australia, and Tasmania have not even been able to provide for old-age pensions. In these circumstances, would it not be useless to ask them to establish ironworks which would involve the expenditure of large sums of money. hesitate to do so? Why should we not take a practical step? the remark made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, when the matter was before the House on a previous occasion, that every honourable member who votes to hand over the establishment of the industry to the States will vote for the defeat of the project. I would have no strong objecother half agree with it. That is one of tion to one of the States taking up the industry, if any of them would do so, but I believe that the work can be undertaken with greater advantage by private enterprise. to force our views on any section of the We all know that private enterprise is ready community, and if legislation is to be passed to step in, and I ask honourable members to join with me in passing the Bill.

I appeal to honourable members not to view this question from any party stand-point--no t to say that because some of them have been free-traders in the past, they are free-traders still, and therefore must oppose this measure. I appeal to them to remember what a vast industry this will be; to remember the extent of our resources, the number of men who want employment, and the capitalists who are ready to invest money in the undertaking. I call upon them to bear in mind that .the Government may, at any time, resume control of the industry, and, remembering all these facts, I cannot understand why any honourable member should say that he is not going to agree to ,the spending of the money of the country in this way-that he favours the sending of our money across the seas to give employment to the people of other countries, rather than to find employment for our own. the outset, congratulate the honourable member for Eden-Monaro on the eloquence and legitimate undertakings. The fervour which he has displayed in moving Queensland, South the second reading of this Bill. I am quite sure we must all recognise that if he is unsuccessful in passing the Bill, no one else could have succeeded with it. I trust that it will not pass, and I hope to give satisfactory reasons in support of my oppoWould they not sition to it. I must first express my regret that a measure involving the expenditure I would again quote of no less a sum than £324,000 should have been placed in the hands of a private member. The reasons for the action taken by the Government are obvious. It cannot be denied that one-half of the Ministry do not think that a measure of this kind should have been introduced, while the the very best reasons why such legislation should not have been introduced at the present stage. After all, we are not here at all, it should be passed only when there is a very clear majority in favour of it. I hope that, even at this late stage, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will see .the propriety of refraining from establishing a precedent that would allow private members to take up a measure involving Chafman. sums of this magnitude It seems to me",76,Second Reading
288,Some Of,"Mr CONROY (Werriwa) -I must, atthat it is better for .the House itself that we should insist that measures of this kind shall be taken in hand only by the Ministry, and then only when all the members of the Ministry are thoroughly agreed upon it. There is no doubt that at present the adoption of that course would mean the relegation of the discussion of this Bill to a date subsequent to the next election. I , for one, should be glad if that were done. The honourable member has given us a great many reasons why the bonuses provided for in this Bill should be granted. bound to say, in the first place, that I learned to-day with astonishment .that some honourable members who pride themselves on being anti-Socialists are yet prepared to support a Bill which would grant a bonus to a certain number of men who are prepared to take up the industry on no other ground than that those men have a large amount of capital to invest. other words, they say that the moment men become capitalists, they become worthy of the consideration of Parliament, but that workers are not to be considered for one moment. Such a doctrine ought to be reprobated by every one of us. One is astounded that honourable members professing to hold anti-socialistic views are yet prepared to grant a bonus ,to a big capitalist who has control of half-a-million of money -that they are prepared to grant £324,000 out of the public funds to such a man, and to allow the money to filter through his pockets to the workers, instead of direct from the Government. If Parliament, by the mere passing of a resolution, can .make wealth, then the sooner we have three parliamentary shifts of eight hours per day the better it will be. If wealth can be created in that wav, let the Parliament sit in eight hours' shifts, and pass resolutions establishing wealth as fast as it can. It is monstrous that honourable members should be asked to agree to pay a sum of £324,000-collecte d as it is in such unjust proportions-to any private individual to establish the iron industry. If honourable members would support an amendment which I intend to move, the position would be different. Clause3 provides thatThe Governor General may authorize the payand steel manufactories of the States. He ment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for the purpose and so forth. I propose to move the insertion of the words, "" of any sum collected Southern States of America to-day is 33s. 4d. per only by direct taxation,"" after the words ton, "" Consolidated Revenue Fund."" wished to give a guarantee to capital invested in any particular line, we should thus insure that capital only should pay the guarantee to capital, and that the money should not be collected from the workers, as it would be under the present system by which we collect £.10,500,000 from the poor, and only about £2,250,000 from the wealthy people of the Commonwealth. tion fall only on the capitalist? penny raised by way of taxation lessens the amount which might otherwise be used for productive purposes. I have never urged that any unnecessary sum should be taken from any one, and if I would object to money being taken unnecessarily from the capitalist, how much more strongly should I object to even a In penny, being taken unnecessarily from the workers? That question is involved in the consideration of this measure. Does the honourable member for Eden-Mo.iaro mean to say that the whole of this vast sum should be paid on an output of 450,000 tons? Fiom the figures before me, I find that 2s. 6d. in the ,£1 is all that is paid in wages in connection with the output of iicn, so that it is proposed to hand over £-324,000 to private enterprise in order to obtain that result But let us go still further, and say, that a greater ratio than any which has yet been achieved will be reached, and that one-third of this money will be paid away in wages. If that be so, we propose to hand over to those who are fortunate enough to have the capital necessary to establish so great an industry, a sum of £324,000, so that they may hand back to the workers £100,000. Will any. one argue that that is what we ought to do? able and learned member's data for the assertion he has just made? Jeans' book, which is in the parliamentary Library.

I do not desire to dwell upon the fact that in other countries where iron industries have been established, the bulk of tlie people' appear to have been so misled that some of the greatest fortunes in the world have been built up in connection with them. The fortunes of men like Flick, Schwab, and Carnegie, have been built up out of iron, at the expense of the mass of the workers, who have contributed to the fortunes of these men out of their hard earnings. minimum wage and a Factories Act in connection with the industry. of this sort, I shall take care that every reto do, but of other people's money. Can striction that can be imposed shall be imposed, and shall also see to it that the bulk of the money goes into the proper pockets -that is, those of the workers. It has to be remembered that, when we vote large sums of money for purposes of this kind, we are appropriating the earnings of the people of the community for the benefit of a few other people. If any evidence were required as to the effects of bonuses, we have only to consider the revelations in connection with the Butter Commission in Victoria, where it was found that the bulk of the producers, for whom the bonuses were intended, got very little of the money, which went into the pockets of a few of the larger firms. ancl learned member favour a clause providing for a minimum wage? 2s. 6d. out of £.1 in this industry goes in wages, I should certainly be favorable to insuring that at least 19s. n d . of every £ r of the bonus voted went direct to the workers. But I feel sure that the amendment which I have already"" suggested in clause 3-that if these sums are to be voted, they shall come out of direct taxation-wil l commend itself to most honourable members. If we succeed in carrying that amendment we shall encourage every man to rely upon himself, instead of trying to create in this Australian Commonwealth a body of cringers and crawlers, coming to ihe Government for everything. It should be remembered that it is only by the industry of the citizens of the country that wealth can be produced. Parliaments cannot add to the wealth of the country. All' that they can do is to withdraw something out of the general fund. I shall leave the honourable member for Barrier to deal with the question of spelter. I feel sure that he can give the House valuable information on the subject, and that honourable members will then have no hesitation in voting against the proposal in that regard also. As to the question of reapers and binders, I am astounded-absolutel y astounded-that any member of this House should get up and propose to make a present of £4,000 to any firm. There are perhaps only two firms in Australia at the present time who should require a are making reapers and binders. They make, perhaps, 500 per annum. Because they bappen to have started, we are to make a present to them of £4,000-no t of our own money,-which we should be entitled there be any justification for that? I shall say no more at the present time, but certainly when we get into Committee I shall move the amendment which I have suggested. \nd if anv further sums are to be paid to the capitalists of this country, I shall endeavour to see to it that they are paid only out of moneys collected by direct taxation. By that means we shall insure that the capitalist class will contribute to the capitalist class in respect to these ventures. sincerely hope that the proposal which has been brought forward by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, will receive the very careful consideration ' of the House, the honourable and that honourable members will realize the advisability of establishing the iron industry in Australia as speedily as possible. When the matter was previously before the House, I took the liberty to break away from my party and to oppose the proposal to make the iron industry a State monopoly. I did so for what I considered to be a good reason, believing that the proposal thus made was simply another way of indefinitely delaying the establishment of the industry. able member has no reason to attribute such motives to other honourable members. able member is a great authority on rubbish, but I am not. It was patent that no State would take up the industry. I ventured to prophesy so much at the time, and it has been fulfilled.

315,Mr Ronald,"I admit that the honorThe free-traders of New South Wales weTe unfavorable to the establishment of the iron industry within their State, and this was their method of postponing it indefinitely. We are urgently in need of the iron industry in Australia, because it has been well said that iron is the vertebra, or backuse the term-ne w blood for the iron indusbone, of all industries. The thing which has made America the great manufacturing country she is to-day ""is her iron industry; and we know perfectly well that no country has ever attained to prominence as a manufacturing country, where the iron industry has not been a success. Iron has been well described as being more useful than gold. Undoubtedly, it is on account of the innumerable things for which it is used. The value of iron cannot well be over-estimated. cerned, I see no difficulty at all in regard to the establishment of the industry, nor do I see grounds for any of the fears and the evils which have been prognosticated by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. All we have to do to protect the workers is to insert a minimum wage clause in the conditions under which we grant the bonuses, and that will lead to a proper distribution of the money. in America, and that left only 6s. 8d. them, if doubling is not sufficient. It is simply a matter of insisting upon a minimum wage clause being inserted in the conditions. That will lead to a fair distribution of the money granted by Parliament. But the great point that is made is that the bonus system has been tried, and, to some extent, found wanting in this country. The system has been found wanting, because the conditions imposed have not been sufficiently severe. In this case, it is proposed to pay by results-n o iron, no bonus. That system will prevent the national exchequer from being exploited by any firm. Until they produce a certain quantity of pig iron they will receive no payment from the Government. When the proper quantity t f iron is produced, the Government will be in a position to pay them. Thus there will be no danger of the national exchequer being exploited for the benefit of private employers. I would also point out emphatically that at the present time our pig-iron industry in Australia is in a very bad way. Honourable members are aware that what is known as scrap iron, if worked up over and over again, becomes at last almost useless; and that is the state in which we find ourselves. At the rolling mills in my own electorate, scrap iron is worked up over and over again. Consequently, iron may be used in machinery when it is dangerous to use it. That time must arrive sooner or later. Therefore, we require-if one may try. We require new pig iron to add strength to the industries in which iron is used. Hence the urgency of this proposal. So long as we are dependent upon America for the bulk of our iron, we shall be continually obliged to work up our scrap iron, and to over-work it. But when we have native iron employed, there will be a continual supply of fresh pig iron. I sincerely hope that we shall not go on wrangling in regard to the creation of this great industry. So far as I am conIt is time that something definite was done. Some honourable members believe in making the industry a State monopoly. But all that can be secured by means of a State monopoly, in connection with the iron industry, can be secured through private ownership. I should be favorable to granting a lease of from twenty to thirty years to the capitalists who embarked upon the industry. I should be prepared to treat them liberally. ThoughI am as staunch a State Socialist as any man, I am prepared to admit that the State in the initial stages of any enterprise does everything at a maximum of expendfture with a minimum of utility. But let us employ private capital in order to initiate this industry. Tffen we can step in with advantage, and conduct the industry by means of the agency of the State. It can be understood that in the initial stages of such an enterprise, great difficulties will attach to working it by means of the State. But if the industry is started by private enterprise, those who engage Tn it will know that they will have only a limited time in which to make their profits, and, with due regard to the utilitarian aspect, commence in the most economical way. At the expiration of their term, the works become the property of the State, just as the tramways in Melbourne, and elsewhere, become the property of the municipalities at the end of a given period. I believe-that people would be prepared to start the industry on these terms; but, of course, there must be rigid labour conditions. The urgency of a measure of this kind is manifest. We have no iron shipping, or armament, and on an island continent where, at some time, though, I hope, it may be far distant, we may have to be on the defensive, we would scon",80,Second Reading

The butter bonus, and the beetsugar tonus, were failures, and why? It was for want of what is known as State Socialism rigidly applied-for want of strict State supervision. But we learn by past experience, and I am quite sure that if we have a minimum wage, an eight hours' day, sanitary conditions in the works, and payment by results, no men will be able to use the bonus for their personal aggrandizement. If a State is prepared to take up the industry, I am in favour of a State monopoly; but I should like to know what the price is to be. In the electorate which I represent, there are a. large number of occupations in which iron is an incidental or an essential, and a bonus would impart new life to them. Industries are at the present time in a very low state in Australia. We are fast reaching the point when we shall be mere hewers of wood, and drawers of water-worker s on farms and stations. If this country is to be made great, it must be by manufactures. America is our great exemplar; and had it not. been for manufactures and protection, that country would not be the hive of industry it now is. . I should be quite prepared to impose a duty of 25 per cent, in favour of the iron industry, but it is an absurdity to protect what does not exist.

I think that a proposal of this kind deserves ticularly, I believe, on those of Victoria serious consideration from a full House. I feel rather despondent about the manner in which a larger number of us view our responsibility to the States Treasurers, when we see an important proposal of this kind, which will lead to very serious depletion of the States revenues, taken in a most casual wanner. speeches on the proposal, and I am sorry that I was unavoidably prevented from hearing all of them. My predecessor in the representation of Wannon happened to be a member of the famous Royal Commission On the iron bonus. He was one Of those gentlemen who signed a report, which was prepared by the honourable member for Bland, and the then member for Kalgoorlie, all of whom did not believe in giving an iron bonus. As honourable members are aware, there were six members of the Royal Commission who did. My predecessor took the view which was set out in the minority report. The grant of a bonus was opposed by the honourable member for Bland, the honourable and learned member for West Svdney, the then member for Kalgoorlie, the honourable ancl learned member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Wannon, and the honourable member for Parramatta. I entirely endorse the decision which they came to, and which, it seems to me, was warranted by the evidence and' the financial position of the States. The grant of this sum of £324,000 would mean another large increase in Federal expenditure. Honourable members must not forget that the other night we agreed to the expenditure of ,£20,000 on the survey of a railway to yVestern Australia. We were told by the Treasurer to-day that, in connection with the sugar question, there will be a great falling-off in Federal revenue, which means that a lesser sum will be returned to the States. confronted with the position that this proposal must lead to a further depletion of the money returnable to the States, a further impoverishment of the States Treasuries, and consequently increased retrenchment in the various States Departments. . As one who was a member of the State Parliament when retrenchment had to be undertaken, I have no wish to see such a state of affairs brought about again. But I am confident that the granting of this sum, together with the loss of revenue which will occur in other directions, will inevitably impose a very severe strain on the finances of the States generally, and parand Queensland. yet. orable member that they have suffered a good deal. The experience of Canada in connection with these bonuses shows that as I have listened to most of the soon as the sum provided for in the first Act is paid away, a demand arises that a further sum shall be granted, and that has been the experience in other parts of the world. The Canadian experience speaks volumes for the habits of mendicancy that bonuses produce on big manufacturers. They have been consistent beggars at the doors of the Canadian House of Commons, consistent log-rollers and lobbyists to get further money out of the pockets of the people. I am not one of those who believe that the whole of the people should be taxed for the benefit of a small section. I look upon this proposal as a method of taxing the whole of the people for the benefit of a very small section. The sum proposed to be expended seems to me to be outrageously excessive. I have given notice of some amendments which, if carried, will have the effect of reducing the proposed expenditure by £190,000that is to what seems to me an enormous expenditure, namely, £134,000, instead of £324,000. I see no justification for paying as much as £1.34,000. The only recommendation it has is that it is less than £324,000, and will not injure the finances of my State so much, or injure the finances of some other States which, as we know from the press every day, are being strained very severely. One has only to read the financial statements of South Australia and Queensland to know .that their Treasurers must have before them a very difficult task. We are, therefore, I do not wish to make their task any more difficult by giving away money in this manner to one of the wealthiest sections in the community.

The diggers who risk their lives in the pioneering work which will render the Territory suitable for white men in the future, are given no representation. They do not believe that non-official members of the Council who will be appointed will represent them, and they desire representation' in the Council. were necessary to pay some persons to act as members of the Legislative Council, that should be done, because the pioneers, to whom we must look for the future development of the Territory, should be represented in its administration. It would be wise to further postpone the clause. I left the Department of External Affairs, some representations had been made by certain persons professing to represent one section of the white population of the Territory, in which they mentioned a proposal similar to that which has been briefly outlined by the honourable member for Kennedy. I am bound ,to sav that these representations were not at this time sufficiently definite to justify the we had agreed to insert a clause to provide late Government in taking .any steps. But I am sure honourable members would like to hear some fuller explanation of .the constitution proposed for the Legislative Council than the Prime Minister appears to be able to give us this evening. We can readily understand that the white population of the Territory, if they so desire, should have some sort of say in the government of the country. However much the right honourable gentleman in charge of the imeasure may differ from honourable members on .this side, I have no doubt he is sufficiently in favour of the principle of representative government to be prepared to give facilities to the white population of the Territory to express their views. Personally, I had no idea that this measure had been dealt with to the extent it had, and I think the Prime Minister might agree to further postpone the clause. members to go into Committee on the postponed clauses of this Bill, I must confess that I did not anticipate that such an important question as that of elective members of the Legislative. Council would be raised. I quite admit that the matter is one of very great importance, and I have no desire to ask honourable members to decide it off-hand. As I have no wish to take honourable members by. surprise, I am willing that the clause should be further postponed. I think, however, that the Committee might agree to help me in dealing with clause 36, which is to be found in the Constitution of every State of Australia, and, indeed, of every country having representative institutions, and with clause 40, which deals with the assent to ordinances, on lines folI think that even if it lowed by all countries. instructions practically. clauses to which I refer deal with matters with which honourable members are familiar, and .they follow the lines which have been adopted in all the States, and in the Commonwealth. I am prepared to further postpone clause 28, in view of the important question raised by tbe honourable member for Kennedy, as it is worthy of careful consideration. Clause further postponed. Postponed clause 36 (Prohibition of import duties discriminating against the Commonwealth), for reports, at not longer intervals than six months, being made to the Department of External Affairs, 'for tbe purpose of enabling the Department to be fully seized of what the Government of New Guinea is doing. If that clause has not already been inserted, no doubt the right? honourable gentleman will have no objection to afford an opportunity for its consideration. ' Clause agreed to. Postponed clause 40 agreed to. orable members for helping me to get rid of these 'two clauses. I shall not proceed further to-night. Progress reported.
