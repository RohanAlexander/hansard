He saidAccording to this honourable member, the object of the Labour party is to nationalize all industries. The quotation was made to prove that statement, and to prove that I had said that it would be decided in caucus where the GOVERNMENT OFFICE CLEANERS. money necessary for the nationalizing of industries was to be got.

It might be asked how they were going to get the f u l l results of industry. They believed in State control. They asked the electors' authority to take so many steps, and were prepared not to go any further. Theni f that proved satisfactory, come back every four years and .ask for further authority. tt should read ""three years."" They wanted to take control of monopolies -when they were dealing unfairly with the workers and exploiting the public. He -referred to the sugar monopoly, and stated white-grown sugar in Australia could be purchased £d. per pound cheaper in South Africa than it was being sold here for. The growers of the cane .complained of their treatment at the hands of the manufacturers, there being no competition in the market; the employees complained also, and the public as well. Therefore when the Government could not regulate monopolies the only other thing to do was to take over control, and surely if they can run their railways and tramways so satisfactorily they can industries of lesser importance. Then followed a portion quoted by the honourable member for Illawarra. As to where the money required for the nationalization of industries would come from, questions were asked at the end of my address by the Hon. W. Robson, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. not used throughout my speech as reported in the quotation by the honourable member for Illawarra. When asked where the money would come from I saidWe expect to get a little from the Federal land tax, but there are other ways-a n income tax, for instance. Then you intend to get the money by taxing the people? Mr Catts said he was not there to say how they'd get it ; that was a matter that would be decided in Council. i WhatI said was that the party, as a whole,; would consult together, and the money would be found by the means which appealed to the majority, as mqst expedient..

' the Acting Treasurer whether the new regulations, which, of course, I have not seen, in regard to old-age pensions, and also the regulations in regard to invalid pensions, especially the former, are in accord witb the recommendation of the Treasury officials, whether in fact they have been recommended for approval by those officials as sufficiently protective of the revenue? the Treasury Department is carried out in such a way that the Minister is responsible. He will be responsible for the regulations referred to when they are issued from the Department, and every possible consideration has been given, not only to the necessities of applicants for old-age pensions, but also to the interests of the Commonwealth. able member for Melbourne, the Acting Treasurer said that the list of questions to be answered by an applicant for an old age pension has been reduced to a minimum AmI to understand that all the questions which have been described here often as unnecessary will be struck out of the form?

The actual revenue received from subscribers to telephone networks for the years ended 30th June, 1909, and 30th June, 1910, respectively ? 2. The estimated revenue which will be received for the year ending 30th June, 1911, which included two months (July and August) at the flat rate? [The particulars relating to each State to be shown separately.] will be prepared and furnished. General, ufon notice1. Whether he is aware that 350 subscribers are receiving unlimited telephonic service at the , rate of 4d. per day on the Sydney Exchange? 2. If so, what steps does he propose taking to honourable member's questions areput an end to this anomaly and to remove the injustice inflicted on the Department? honourable member's questions are1. The Postmaster-General is aware that there are in Sydney subscribers owning lines purchased prior to Federation who are at present receiving an unlimited service at approximately the rate mentioned. 2. The rights of the subscribers in question. are preserved to them by the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901, and the lines can only be resumed with the consent of Parliament. Legislation would, therefore, be necessary to place these subscribers on the same footing as other subscribers to telephone exchanges, and the matter is under consideration. PER), asked the Postmaster-General, ufon notice1. Has his attention been directed to the statepropose to ask the House to disagree with ments published in the public press regarding the amendment, which I may explain will the methods that were followed in connection with the allotment of increments to 3rd and 4th not make a great difference. class omcers in his Department? 2. Does he agree that the returns which have been furnished to this House disclose that the Public Service Commissioner's policy is to grant promotion in alternate years to officers in the. 3rd and 4th classes, and that the knowledge that such a policy is in operation must make the officers feel that merit cannot receive proper consideration ? 3. Is it the intention of the Government that the Government shall determine the amount to be made available each year to grant sub-divisional promotion to deserving ofiicers? honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. No. The Public Service Commissioner has TELEreported that no such policy is in operation. Of 453 officers provided for on the Estimates this year, 123 officers, or 27 per cent., also received increments last year. 3. No. There is at present no limitation as to funds, and every officer entitled to increment receives it. The determination of a fixed amount to be made available for increments each year might result in injustice to ofiicers who are deserving of advancement, or, on the other hand, in increases being allotted where"" the circumstances would not justify it. master-General, ufon notice1. Whether the Government have arrived at an agreement with the Canadian Government in regard to the question of "" route"" under the new contract for the Vancouver Mail Service? 2. As the inclusion of Auckland as a port of call will act prejudically to the interests and legitimate claims of both Melbourne and Brisbane as regular ports of call, in a subsidized Pacific Mail Service, will the Minister give the House an assurance that the interests of these ports will be protected under the new contract? 1. No; the present position is that a cablegram has been received from Canada asking concurrence in the acceptance of a tender for a service from Vancouver to Sydney, vid Auckland, and a reply has been sent stating the Commonwealth Government cannot agree to the proposal. 2. The Government will see that, in any arrangement to which they are a party, the interests of Australia will be duly protected. Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment.

Act provides that persons who have resided in the Commonwealth for six months shall be liable to service; but to my mind the period should be extended to two years. We are making strenuous efforts to induce people to come to Australia. All the States, are operating in that direction, and a very -considerable influx of immigrants, which I hope, will be largely increased, is now taking, place. It would be a distinct deterrent to compel persons to submit to military training practically as soon as they put foot upon Australian soil, and I therefore move That the following paragraph be inserted :"" (aa) by omitting the words 'six months' and inserting in their stead the words ' two years.'"" £11.10] I do not think that the Committee is quite clear as to what the honourable' member has moved. that he objects to the words "" six months "" in section 125 of the principal Act, and proposes to substitute for them the words "" two years."" posed amendment is that an immigrant should have more than six months to make arrangements to settle here before he is called upon to undergo military training. I should like the Attorney-General to say, because I think it might clear up a doubt, whether the section would apply to any arrivals in Australia who were over eighteen years of age. I am under the impression that it would not; that only persons who had not reached the age of eighteen years of age would .be liable to serve. The objection of the honourable member for Echuca is that immigrants would have their time fully occupied for the first six months after their arrival in determining where they would settle, and that it would be rather too early to call upon them, whilst they were busily occupied in determining the character and locality of the business in which they should engage, and in what State they should reside, to undergo military training. If the provision applies only to 125 of tbe principal Act is boys under the age of eighteen years the argument is not so strong. But, if it would apply to fathers of families who had just arrived in the country, and would compel them to devote a certain number of days to military training whilst they were in the midst of their preparations to settle in the country, then-1 think it would be, as the honourable member for Echuca has said, a distinct deterrent to people coming here. Section 125 of the principal I do not think we are so hard up for men in the Commonwealth that we cannot afford to allow new arrivals in this country a little more than six. months as breathing time in which to settle down before calling upon them to undergo compulsory military training. Consequently, I should like the Acting Prime Minister to inform the Committee whether the provision will apply to any person over eighteen years of age. I intend to support the amendment. A very large proportion of the irmnigrants who come to Australia will be placed upon the land, and, undoubtedly, some little respite from military training ought to be granted to them in view of the difficulties which they must encounter in establishing (Parkes) homes for themselves. It is presumed that most of the persons who will be called upon to undergo compulsory training will I understand be engaged in settled occupations. \They will thus be able to enter into an arrangement with their employers to serve for the necessary period. But it would be unfair The reason for this proto apply such a provision to new arrivals in the country, who, within a period of six months, will scarcely have had sufficient time to enable them to choose a home for themselves. As a matter of fact, if they wish to establish farms in new districts they will require to devote themselves exclusively to the task for at least two years before they can hope to make their lands productive. I hope, that the Acting Prime Minister will accept the amendment. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will agree to the amendment, which is not vital to the Bill. During the first six months after their arrival in Australia many immigrants may be searching for steady employment, and it would be unfair to require them to undergo military training within that period. It will take them quite that time to get settled down. A man with a family, for instance, cannot pitch upon a home immediately.",18,Pairs

57,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [11.18],"will not be affected. Minister will explain whether the clause will affect adults. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.19] -The section of the principal Act is quite clear. It provides for the training in our Citizen Forces of persons over the age of eighteen years. It has been suggested that the clause of the Bill which we are now considering will apply to all persons who have been in the country for a period of six months, and who are not exempt from its provisions. The honourable member for Echuca proposes that an exemption should be extended to persons who have not been resident in Australia for a period of two years and upwards. Then the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Wimmera have suggested that the clause will operate with undue harshness in the case of immigrants. I fail to see that it will. Why should an immigrant be treated any better than our own people will be treated? As a matter of fact, compulsory training is less likely to inflict hardship upon an immigrant, who has no settled avocation, than it is upon a native-born Australian. During the time that he is undergoing instruction, the immigrant will be maintained, and he will also receive a little money for his service. I would have been glad to get such a job when I came to Australia, instead of floating idly around. awaiting immigrants it is a jolly good trouble. a man who comes here from England, Scotland, ireland, or Wales cannot do what is necessary in the matter of undergoing a military training-in other words, if he cannot do what any other citizen has to do -it is about time that he went back again. Section 131 of the principal Act provides that that measure shall not apply to persons of eighteen years of age before this part of the Act becomes operative. Therefore they will not be liable to military service until this part of the Act is proclaimed. Of course, it is possible that some immigrants between the age of eighteen and twenty-six years may be married. Under such circumstances we shall witness the spectacle of a man being torn from his home to undergo eight days' training in camp, during which period he will be fed and paid for his services. he will not be subjected to worse treatment than our own citizens. To my mind every person ought to be treated alike, and that is what the Bill proposes. -It seems to me that six months is rather a short period after their arrival in Australia within which to require immigrants to undergo military training. It will take a newcomer some little time to decide in which State he intends to settle. I would, therefore, suggest, that the Acting Prime Minister should consent to make the period twelve months, except in case of emergency, of which the Department will be the judge. That would overcome the difficulty. [11.24] -The Acting Prime Minister appears to be labouring under a misapprehension. He imagines, and so does the honourable member for South Sydney, that the fathers of families from abroad will be required to undergo military training. That is not the intention of the Department. As a matter of fact, no persons above twenty years of age will be obliged to undergo any training during the next three years. In reality this Bill is unnecessary for a period of three years. All that it does is to settle the lines upon which military training will operate three years hence. Everything else is provided for in my measure which was passed last year. It is not intended that any men who have passed the age of eighteen years shall be subjected to If that is the only trouble compulsory military training. I shall have something to say upon that aspect of the If six months after his arrival question on the motion for the third reading of the Bill. The clause will not apply to the adult portion of the immigrants who come to Australia. They will not be subjected to compulsory military training. It is only their boys who will have to undergo it. It would be an advantage to oversea immigrants, who have to spend a good portion of their time immediately following their arrival in Australia in selecting a place in which to settle, if the period were fixed at twelve months instead of two years. I would suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that he should adopt my suggestion which represents a fair thing in the case of youths from oversea. Acting Prime Minister has spoken as if every Australian will be subjected to compulsory military training. As a matter of fact But even then only a small proportion of our people will",19,Pairs

For instance, there might be in Australia a sect with small establishments all over tlie country, each establishment so small that in itself it could not form a company of cadets. Under this proposal, all those different half companies might be organized into one battalion, although the battalion, as a whole, would never be drilled. ferent area officers. . officer has anything to do with the cadets. An effort was made by Sir Thomas Ewing three or four years ago to do something of the same kind. In that particular case I think the Marist Brothers' scliools were in' terested. That society has schools all over the country, and with a natural anxiety to maintain the general control over their "" boys, they wanted them, wherever situated, to be organized into units together. was pointed out at that time, this would is not meant. have meant having one commanding officer for a battalion of boys scattered all over Victoria, and they could never have been drilled together. The Government would do well to consider first the general interests of the Defence Department, and afterwards the interests of private scliools and other educational establishments. The suggestion may, perhaps, arise merely from the amour propre of those institutions, which are desirous of training their boys by themselves. I do not see that the proposal is of any value at That is the diffipresent, while it might be dangerous, and Otherwise the object is. the Minister would do well to reconsider its exact terms. am glad the Attorney-General has introDoes it refer to private duced this amendment, because I regard it as necessary. It applies not only to private, but to public, schools. In New South Wales lads who desire to become teachers go into college to prepare themselves for their examinations. While there they, have to be very studious, and have not the time for drill that other boys have. Consequently, an arrangement such as this is advisable to enable them, after attaining the age of eighteen, and until they are through with their education, to do their drilling where they are carrying on their studies, and have then nights to themselves. I know a number of lads now at the different High Schools in New South Wales, some of them over the age of eighteen, and every night they have to do homework up to 10 o'clock. Unless special provision for their training is made, I am afraid an injustice will be done to them. There may be some little difficulty about battalion drill, but I think the officers will be able to overcome it by arranging for these lads to go through it during their holidays. In any case they are not likely to be at school after the age of twenty-one, and in the following five years they will surely get sufficient battalion drill for all purposes. The amendment is a goocl one in the interests of the public as well as private schools, and I hope the Committee will adopt it. pleased that the Attorney-General has introduced this provision.

I was, however, told by the Principals of the two others that they had their regular battalion drill, and after inspection by the Military Department passed the very highest tests of efficiency. I am glad the amendment has been introduced, because we ought to tone down, as far as possible, the beginnings of this system of conscription, which I do not welcome, by recognising the excellent work done by the schools on voluntary lines. [12.6] I have in my mind the position as it appears in Sydney to-day. large private schools all have cadet units, and have what is called a public school battalion, consisting of units from the large from the speeches that have been delivered. scliools. In order to make up that battalion one of the units has to come from Bathurst to Sydney, about 140 miles, and another from Armidale or Tamworth, 200 or 300 miles. That is the difficulty.. I am in thorough agreement with all the .work of the units in the schools, so far as that goes. It is advisable to do it within the schools as far as possible at such hours as may be convenient, but the Bill requires that there shall be efficient battalion drill will come under 'it. for the senior cadets. I do not see how that is to be obtained with this grouping, except at great inconvenience. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.8] -The clauseaims at disturbing as little as possible the educational course of students. I do not knew what arrangements have been made with regard to battalion drills, but it has been the practice to fix them as far as possible for public holidays In any case, in a big area, such, as that of which the honourable member for Parramatta has just spoken, where the units have to be brought from all over the place; the same difficulty would occur, in spite of this clause. The clause does not accentuate it, but rather tends to relieve it, because you have your unit in the school, and all the units are brought down to form a battalion. Under another system you would have to bring individuals down. school there may be thirty or forty to form a half-unit. If any of them are over the age of eighteen, instead of going into the [220]2 citizen force, they can remain attached to I was also the school unit, so long as they are students there, but they must do the amount of drill required for the citizen force. That is a great convenience to a young man going through a school or university course. Surely it is a great advantage if a young man can do eight of his sixteen days' training, and all his detached drills, in his university or school ? So long as he does the drill there, and satisfies the authorities that he does it, why should he have to go out? The clause is a very valuable one. am very much concerned about this proposal. If it includes State schools, well and good, but if it affects only private schools schools also. Australia is, I hope, a Democracy, and we must not encourage the creation of a caste in this community. According to the Minister, if a cadet remains at school after eighteen, he is to be permitted to avoid the eight days' training, so long as he can carry out eight days' training in his school. What State school is attended by boys that will come under this provision ? lower schools. until he reaches the age of eighteen; and then only if he wishes to stop at school. provision strikes me. Its object appears to be to provide that the students at the Church of England Grammar School, the Wesley College, or the Roman Catholic Institution shall be permitted to carry out their military training in their own school yards. I have no objection to that if the children attending State schools are allowed the same privilege. boys attending the colleges I have mentioned are to be allowed to escape the night drills, tlie children attending the primary State schools should be allowed In a to escape them also.' teen the boys in the State schools are drilled in the day-time.",24,Pairs

If there is one institution in Australia which more than another contributes to the growth of the spirit of Democracy, it is tire State school, <n which all children, no matter of what religion, or what the financial position of their parents may be, are educated together. I was educated for a time in a State school, but my parents moving to another part of the town, it was too far for me to continue to attend the State school, and more convenient that I should attend a Roman Catholic school. Wad to remain outside while the Roman Catholic children were being given their religious instruction. -bis school, I thought that Roman Catholic boys were of an entirely different type from boys of other religions. It was not an infrequent thing for boys of the school to which I went to sally forth in the afternoon and pelt stones at the boys who attended the Roman Catholic school.

If this system is to be permitted to lead in any way to the disparagement of the State schools, and encourage divis on amongst our people, it must be ; strongly deprecated. If parents find that by sending their children to such private schools as I'have mentioned, they will be able to avoid drill or the eight days' continuous trainingj they will try to muster up all the funds they can in order to send their children to these schools. So little are the families of Australia prepared for this rigid compulsory system that we are proposing to introduce, that I am satisfied that parents will do their level best to enable their children to escape it I sincerely hope that all schools in the Commonwealth will be included under the operation of this prevision. To show that I am right in my contention, I remind the Committee that the honourable member for Parramatta instanced the case of an ""Armidale school, and said that the boys attending it would have to join with those attending another.

Will the Minister accept an amendment to provide for the exemption from training of the children of parents who have a conscientious objection to their children being trained in the use of arms ?

I hope that the time will come when we shall find quite a different attitude adopted towards boys and men who are seen in our streets with grime on their clothes and hands. But that time will not . come if we are, by our legislation, to afford facilities for the creation of class distinction. I am with honourable members who are desirous that students for the ministry, who are to be engaged in a peaceful calling, entirely different from that of the man of arms, shall be exempt from this drill.

He argued that we are making a distinction between the scholars attending the different schools, but, as a matter of fact, we are making provision that the scholars attending each school may be given their training within the institution. The honourable member states that boys attending the State schools are to be treated differently from boys attending private and High schools. That contention is ridiculous. This provision is intended to meet the case of lads who have reached eighteen years of age and are still at school, and I do not see that they can ma^e the slightest objection to it. The honourable member asks whether they are not to be allowed to associate with apprentices. But I would ask him where, apprentices are to be drilled. They cannot be drilled at their factories, and must get their training at night in the drill halls. The provision will accomplish two things: it will relieve the strain upon the drill halls, and it will establish compulsory training with a minimum of inconvenience to every one. We, on this side, are all opposed to the creation of class distinctions, but compulsory training, although necessary, is inconvenient, and we wish to minimise the inconvenience. To allow boys to drill at the schools which they attend will be a sensible thing, and will notcreate class distinctions.

There are certain youths who remain in educational establishments, both public and private, after they have reached the age of I eighteen years.

The amendment means tliat youths who, after reaching tlie age of eighteen years, remain at an educational establishment, either public or private, may be trained with the senior cadets, as they had been trained during the previous four yeafs, instead of being put into the Citizen Forces, where the drill is different and longer than in ordinary circumstances.",28,Pairs

I do not deny that outside the learned professions there are men whom we should like to see within them, and there ought to be no unnecessary embargo. With the contention of the honourable member for Adelaide, who speaks from personal experience not open to most of us, I am perfectly in accord ; but, obviously, it can apply only in the rarest cases. We have to consider the whole effect of a system; and if we open a door or crevice, however small, the result may be that the system will break down, and there will be more exceptions than observances of the rule. The proposed regulations contemplate that for tlie first examination a candidate's sixteenth birthday must fall on or before the rst March, 1911; and his nineteenth birthday after that date. With regard to the training, the idea is to get the students at or about a certain age, keep them a prescribed time, and turn them out according to a prescribed pattern. I admit that that system is open to the objection urged by my honourable friend, but I understand that he himself is not at all desirous that any person should be. appointed who has not passed the examination of the College. All he wants is an opportunity for persons rarely and highly gifted to qualify. As to that, the recommendation of Lord Kitchener isI have shown that 350 officers are required for the 'Staff Corps, and I shall now discuss the organization of a Military College to maintain that corps. Taking twenty years as the average service of an officer, it appears that after the Staff Corps is up to establishment the yearly output required from the college will be about eighteen cadets. The minimum length of course required to efficiently ground a cadet in his profession is three years. As has already been pointed out, strict selection should be enforced from the. moment a boy becomes a cadet The age of entry should not be less than seventeen nor more than nineteen. We have closely followed the recommendations of the Field Marshal. The matter will be dealt with by regulation, and I have had an opportunity of consulting with the Minister of Defence, who, while not pledging himself to do as the honourable member suggests, says that he is not adverse to meeting the honourable member in a reasonable way. He thinks there should be established a general rule, which should obtain in all but the rarest cases. If the honourable member will take my assurance Mr Hughes. that the Minister has authorized me to say that he is willing to favourably consider the suggestion that opportunity should be afforded by the regulations in certain cases for persons over the age now mentioned not be done by regulation if it is not done first in the Act. vent it being done. All that the Bill says is that the person must be a graduate of the College. It does not say at what age he must enter the College. The whole point of the argument of the honourable memher for Adelaide is not that officers should not be graduates of the College, but that no one should be stopped from being a graduate of the College by reason of his being over the age of nineteen. The question of the age being a matter for regulation, the honourable member's objection can be got over. The Minister, without binding himself in any way, declares that he is prepared to favourably consider a suggestion to enable the age limit to be waived in rare cases, where that may be reasonably asked for. Beyond that, I do not think we ought to be asked to go. We must remember the very heavy and grave responsibility that rests upon the Defence Department and the Minister, of turning out the new force in the most approved form, and that everything depends upon the-personnelof the instructional staff. This, in its turn, must depend upon the process to which it has been subjected, and in the circumstances I think the Government might reasonably be clothed with the power for which they are asking in this clause. [3.5] -The difficulty that I see arises'from section 22 of the principal Act when read with this clause. There seems to be a clear conflict between the two. Section 22 of the Act says that the Governor General may appoint any person to be an officer without his passing the prescribed examination, while this clause provides that no person who is not a graduate of the Military College, as prescribed, shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Forces. for Adelaide is not asking for that to be altered. point with which the honourable member will be met wheu he begins to try to do what the honourable member for Adelaide",33,Pairs

Section 22 of the Act can have no relation to section 148 as contained in this Bill, because this clause does not refer to a prescribed examination at all. It rektes to the Military College. with officers in general, and this clause deals only with officers of the Permanent Forces. The effect of the clause is simply to take away from the Governor General the right to make any person an officer ot the Permanent'Forces. away from him the right to appoint any person an officer of the Citizen Forces, or to regulation what we ought to do by Act of promote an officer for distinguished service, irrespective of whether he is or is not a graduate of the Military College. Section 22 is not in conflict with this clause, except not accept the suggestion of the honourable in one particular, and only doubtfully in that. in section 22, unless defined, must include all officers. and I am not sure whether section 22 has not been touched by the amending Bill. The net effect of new section 148 will simply be to take away from the Governor General, at the most, the power under section 22 to promote a person to be an officer of the Permanent Forces-no t the Citizen Forces. That is, it will only prevent him making a man an officer of the instructional staff. A man may be the Bravest in the world, but be totally unequipped to teach the scienselves in the service, whereas those who tific side of artillery or engineering. Another man may be very nearly a poltroon, and yet a very good mathematician. The idea of the Military College is to turn out persons thoroughly versed in the science and art of war as we know it to-day. I hope the Attorney-General will accede to the request of the honourable member for Adelaide. We ought not to exclude men over the age of nineteen from entering the Colljege, because it is very Irarely that young men before that age start to think for themselves. A young man may be exceptionally qualified, and may, at the age of twenty, decide to take up a military career. It would be a distinct disadvantage to debar him from entering the College and qualifying as an officer of the Perwholly on the Citizen Force. Our aim must manent Force simply because he was over nineteen. We may be able to place every reliance on the present Minister of Defence, but a time may come when another Minister may do all planner of things by regulation. We should emphatically state our intentions and wishes in this Bill. This is one of the most important aspects of the defence question, because we are trying to arrange to have men well trained to instruct our Forces, although, with the honourable memSection 22 deals ber for Capricornia, I hope the day is notfar distant when men will become so educated and civilized as to be able to do without warlike preparations. We have, however-, in the present circumstances, to arm as other nations are arming. I do not beI t does not take lieve in clothing even a Minister of the greatest integrity with power to do by Parliament. I should like to see the age of entry into the College increased, say, to twenty-five years. If the Minister canmember for Adelaide at once, will he promise to consider it, and bring up, on recommittal, a clause giving.effect to it? If he does, I am sure that course will meet with the unanimous approval of honourable members. This is not a new question It has been, I suppose, under the consideration of every Minister of Defence since the establishment of the Constitution. We are proposing now to go back to where we were in 1901. When I became Minister of Defence. I found that commissions in the Permanent Forces were reserved solely for those who entered at an early age, and qualified themhad served faithfully and well in the Citizen Forces, and had made a special study of military tactics, were altogether debarred from obtaining any of the plums of the service. There was a good deal of dissatisfaction about it at the time, because a great many who had entered into the military life in the militia or the volunteers had' developed a great liking for it, and wished to qualify themselves for appointments, of which there are a good many in the service, such as all the staff appointments in the different States up to the position of commandant. From all of these positions citizen ofiicers were debarred.

If we deprive them of the opportunity to win the prize of high promotion, they will, ""naturally, have less incentive to improve themselves in the knowledge and art of war. The question assumed a practical shape when I was Minister of Defence in 1903, and I was not long in coming to the conclusion that we must do everything possible to encourage the citizen soldiers. Therefore, just before transferring to another Department, I wrote a minute directing that a regulation should be made which would allow citizen officers to obtain promotion where they were qualified, without being debarred by age conditions.'

There is on record a resolution of the House to the effect that no military force shall be created in this country other than that required for instructional and similar services, and, of course, the great bulk of our force will consist of ordinary citizens. While I do not wish to do anything to lessen the standard of efficiency among officers, I do not wish to prevent those who have performed their duty faithfully and well, and, perhaps, have fought in the battles of their country, from being promoted to the highest positions if qualified for them.

A young man with whom I am acquainted, who has had a good deal of experience in the Canadian and British armies, was not accepted as an instructional officer because he was over age.

It may he necessary for us to appoint more officers than can be passed through the Military College. What guarantee have we that five years hence we shall have a sufficient supply of capable officers who have passed through the Military College to train the Military Forces of Australia? We have no provision in this Bill to enable us to meet such an emergency. The honourable member for Maribyrnong made a good point which he might well have emphasized. Young men will enter the Military. College We at an age at which they will scarcely have made up their minds as to what their profession is going to be. They will have a sort of general idea that they will better themselves by adopting a military career; but probably, in many cases, having completed their course, tiiey will decide to abandon that career. There is a very serious possibility ot our having a great dearth of properly trained and qualified officers. I therefore wish to make it easy in such an emergency tb secure other men of exThe same remark perience and ability by making eligible for commissions in the Permanent Forces those who have passed a prescribed test. Under the clause as it stands, we shall be unable to take advantage of the wide and practical knowledge of men who have served in the forces ot other countries, ancl have liad an experience that must make for the development of the best type of citizen soldiers.

What, then, are we to do? plunge into a dark and bloody struggle, the result of which no one can determine, in order to furnish experience for our Australian Citizen Forces? Not at all. We are proposing to do the best we can in the circumstances ; and whether it is in sport or in economic fields, or elsewhere, the Australian can always hold his own. I come now to the amendment. It is proposed to create this College to educate, not the men who are going to fight, nor the men who are going to lead our troops into battle, but the schoolmasters of the army. ASK any one who has been a school teacher what sort of a chance there is in that profession for a man who has brains, but no training. What chance can he have, unless he has been through the pedagogic mill ? A man who has not cannot teach. The school teacher has to be trained, just as the man who wishes to follow any other profession. The Minister is willing to consider the suggestion that the age at which a person shall be allowed to enter the College shall be raised; but for five years the whole world, is ours. pearls of military wisdom on the beach, let any beachcomber here gather them in. For five years he may do that, and I should have no hesitation in extending the period to seven years, so that we may have ample time to stimulate our poor lethargic Australian intellects up to the desired supreme miliwe wish to alter. I listened with envy to Mr Hughes. tary height. I hope, however; that honourable members will have faith in their own countrymen. During the Boer War many honourable members who are now asking that we should go outside and obtain experienced men, had not a good word to say for those who went to South Africa. The suggestion now is, however, that we should avail ourselves of those who have had actual experience of war. What were our troops supposed to be doing during the Boer War? Spearing some people, poultry. These men are now to be elevated and appointed to teach us the noble art of war. For my part, I believe that this is a serious business. Lord Kitchener, who has had more experience of actual war than any one here I hope will ever have, says that the way to train men to make our army is that which we My honourable friend calmly propose, and I am in favour of following his recommendation concerning a matter about which I , happily, know nothing. It was interesting to follow' the Acting Prime Minister as he travelled all round the clause, but I would point out that he failed to touch the Bill itself. This clause provides for instructors, and, under it, a man above a certain age who desires to enter the College to learn the art of instructing other men will be debarred from becoming an officer of our Permanent. Forces. In other words, no man may enter the College after he has passed the age of nineteen years. Some of the best of. pur. ofiicers might come from the instructional staff, and I think that we should so amend the clause that an instructor who may desire, after a few years, to become an officer of the Permanent Forces, shall have an opportunity to do so. We should provide for the examination of such men after they have passed the age of nineteen years. The Acting Prime Minister has talked of the Germans, the Japanese, and the French, but we have to deal with the clause as it stands. My contention is that we should have the widest possible choice, and I would, therefore, If there be any undiscovered broaden the clause so as to allow instructors to submit themselves to an examination for a commission in the army after they have passed the age of nineteen years.

As a general rule, it will be found that very few will be able to graduate in later .years; at the same time, there is no necessity to debar them. The clause as it stands should, I think, remain, and it then becomes simply a matter of the regulations, which honourable members will have an opportunity of considering when they are submitted. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent anybody from becoming an officer; all it provides is that they shall be graduates from the College, so far as regards the instructional and permanent staff. We all understand that iany citizen may become an officer of the Citizen Forces, and all that is provided in the clause is that no one shall become a member of the instructional qr permanent staff who is not a graduate of the College. move That the following word's be added to the clause :"" Students of any age not exceeding thirty years may, on passing the prescribed comning hissword through a soldier because petitive examination, obtain admission to the Military College."" examination for entering. tions whicli show that, before a person can enter the College, he must pass an examination that is not very simple; and in that examination we have the obstacle. examination be)'ond the average boy of sixteen at the present standard of education. twenty to twenty-two, whose parents could not afford to send him to school, and who has to' work for his living, may desjre, and be competent, to lead a military life, but, under the regulation, he is debarred from offering himself for the examination simply because he is over nineteen. It is a fine old Tory argument on the part of the Attorney-General to declare "" We must not open the door."" It is a pity that there are not honourable members in the House capable of heaping on the Attorney-General vituperation of the character that he heaped on the honourable member for Brisbane. Vituperation is all very well, butmember deal with the clause? dealt with the honourable member for Brisbane in a very severe and uncalled-for manner, entirely evading the point that we are about to create a military caste of the worse description. There can be no other result if we provide that only the sons of rich people shall be officers in the Australian Army. This is to be a Citizen Army, which means an army composed of the mech anics, labourers, architects, builders, and others, who play their parts in the economy of the Commonwealth. If only people whose parents can afford to send them to school so as to enable them to pass the examination prior to the age of nineteen are to be the officers in the Permanent Forces, we shall have a good many gilded youths ordering the mechanics of the Commonwealth about. That is wrong. I submit to honourable members, most of whom have gained their education and experience in the university of the world, that young men who go straight from the schools into the Military College, will not get the experience necessary to qualify them to treat the citizen soldiers properly. What happens in Germany? Some time ago we read in the cables of a German officer actually runthe soldier refused to salute him. We want as permanent officers of our Commonwealth Forces men who have an everyday experience of the world. It will do these, young men good to have amongst them men even of thirty years of age who have worked outside amongst the populace, and can give them a true sense of what is due to the citizens of the Commonwealth. [4-3]-I am afraid the honourable member for Richmond is not quite accurate when he states that the intention of the scheme is that any officer may pass the graduating examination whether he has been to the College or not. The clear intention of the Kitchener scheme is that the candidates should all be taken young, kept at the College, and put through it. Lord Kitchener recommendsCandidates should be selected from the most capable of the Senior Cadets, each area officer submitting the name of his best cadet to the major in charge of ten areas, who will then examine these ten cadets and forward five names through the district headquarters, who will state their recommendations, if any, to the central administration.

On the whole, the Kitchener scheme is good, and if it is a little too rigid for our Australian requirements, we must remember that it aims at efficiency first and foremost. The more we discuss the matter, the more we see of the Bill, and the more we hear of the regulations and of the Ministerial trend of mind, the more clear does it become that we are about to create a military caste so far as the officers of the Permanent Forces are concerned. The Minister suggested in his mildest manner that we should leave it to the Government in the future to say what the regulations should be, and depend upon their promise to look into the subject. If we do that we sha]l be depending upon a very slender thread indeed, because the moment the Attorney-General"" was put into a corner his vehemence almost overwhelmed us, and his language became positively sanguinary. That is a clear indication tliat the Ministerial mind does not tend in the direction of making any amendment or improvement of the regulations respecting the College. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out, while we have an exceptionally capable Minister of Defence, one of the most capable and painstaking that we have ever had, according to the statements of military officers inside and outside the service, we must remember that he lacks even the smallest degree of practical knowledge of things military, and is to a large extent in the hands of officers. There is now in the Defence Department a caste. Among the officers who are advising the Minister in this direction there are a number who look with horror on the prospect' of any ordinary citizen coming into their -ranks, or in any way interfering with their privileges. The whole tendency is to keep the ranker down in the ranks, and to keep commissions for a particular class of the community. Lord Kitchener's first proposal was that a premium of £ 8 0 should be paid for entry into the College, and that the boy's parents, should keephim while he was there. This clearly indicated that in Lord Kitchener's opinion only a small section of the community, irrespective of ability, should ever be allowed entry into the College. get in. when Lord Kitchener is quoted as an authority on the question of officers for the Australian Forces, we should remember the effect of his recommendations on this subject. Of course, he brought with him the ideas of older parts of the world, where officers are drawn from a certain class, and in some Gases are given commissions with almost a disregard for their qualifications and adaptability. We propose to ignore the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, and to throw the College open to all, providing for the keep of the students during the whole of their term. But it is proposed to have a selection. can submit himself to the competitive examination he must be recommended by the officer commanding his cadet corps, or, if he is above eighteen years of age, by the officer commanding the squadron, battalion, or regiment of which he is a member. that which allots a certain number of students to each State. tions for the College been issued? proposed regulations. liminary selection, though I do notobject to a competitive entrance examination, and I am not prepared to say that the standard read out by the honourable member for Capricornia is too high. At first blush, I do not think that it is. But I complain that a man cannot enter the College unless he is under the age of nineteen years. The honourable member for Richmond suggests that persons may be allowed to graduate without residing in the College, but that is not the intention of the Government or its advisers. Persons will not be able to graduate from the College unless they have entered it after passing a competitive examination before attaining the age of nineteen years, and have resided there for the whole of their term. dence should be insisted on. member says that one condition should be insisted upon, and proposes another, he is not on firm ground.

Under the system provided for, all who do not go through the Military College, which must be entered before a man reaches the age of nineteen years, will be debarred from promotion as officers. Obviously, if fhe Minister is left to deal with the matter by regulation, our suggestions will be put on one side. I know, from personal knowledge, that on the instructional staff there are commissioned officers receiving from £300 to £450 a year who, so far as knowledge, teaching ability,-education, and general capacity are concerned, are not equal to many of the non-commissioned officers on the staff, who receive from ^170 to £200 a year. sioned officers obtained their positions in the way n which the honourable member wishes ; it to be possible for men to obtain promotion under our new system, namely, by influence, and not by proving their merit by passing competitive examinations ? they obtained their positions, if it were not by undue influence; but I have never raised any objection to the competitive system, nor do I object to compelling those who wish to become officers to graduate at the Military College. But I object to a rule preventing persons from graduating, no matter what their ability, because they are over the age of nineteen years. Why should a man who is a ranker remain a ranker for life? would have to draw, the line somewhere, and exclude some men from the chance of becoming officers. I have already said that the Minister is willing to favourably consider a suggestion for increasing the age at which men may enter the .Military College. promise if this were my first session; but 1 have a thousand times heard Ministers promise to favourably consider suggestions, and do nothing to give effect to them. I do not wish to speak disrespectfully of the present Ministers. Every Minister has, at some time or other, used the words, "" We will favourably consider your proposal if you let the Bill pass."" member would let us get to a division. ingly important matter, ancl the vehemence of the Minister in combating our view was of such a character as to lead me to think that this promise of favorable consideration will not be of much advantage to us. I therefore propose to add a further proviso. I do not favour the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Capricornia, but that which I shall propose will enable -persons with military leanings who have served, say, three years in the Forces, and have had time to obtain a settled conviction as to what vocation they would like to follow, to submit themselves to any entry test",42,Pairs

My amendment would afford such persons as those to whom I have referred an opportunity not to be pushed into the commissioned ranks, but, on passing a prescribed examination, to enter the Military College,' and to graduate therefrom. honourable member is not quite fair to the Acting Prime Minister. He ought to remember that the honourable gentleman cannot be expected to know intimately everything that is in the mind of the Minister of Defence; but the basis of his attack has been the Ministerial intention, whatever it may be, with regard to future regulations. I have realized in the course of this debate that the Acting Prime Minister, nobly as he is transacting his duty in the Chamber, is not, and cannot be expected to be, in such close touch with the Minister of Defence as his colleague who acts for the Minister in this House. Last night, for instance, we held combat on the subject' of whether uniforms should be provided for riflemen, and the project was scouted by the official head of the Government. That important matter had been definitely decided by the responsible Minister, but the Attorney-General was absolutely without information last night, and induced his colleagues to support him in an untenable position. member must not discuss that matter. made that the Acting Prime Minister indulged in vituperation against the unoffendprovision to be extended to the Permanent ing member for Brisbane. I did not hear Forces. I understood that it governed all any vicious attack upon the honourable memtho Forces. ber for Brisbane, or the honourable member for Capricornia; nor did I hear a omit it altogether. It is, after all, only a whisper on his part against the professional question of favouritism. reputation of the honourable member for -Adelaide. Why, then, this attack on the able member's jaundiced view, everything Acting Prime Minister, who is doing his best to struggle with a measure which possibly, owing to his having his hands full in other directions, he does not fully understand? Perhaps it would be better to ascertain from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, at question time, exactly what is proposed with regard to the Military College, and the point as to the extension of the age of entry to thirty years. It seems to me that whether the age limit be fixed at thirty, forty, or nineteen years, the younger, a man is -on entering the College, the better he must be equipped in competition with his fellows. Those who have had to study for competitive examinations late in life know that it is infinitely more difficult for a man, no matter what his intrinsic ability may be, to acquire new kinds of knowledge, than it is for a youth under the age of The twenty-one years to do so. Whatever age we may arbitrarily fix, nature will defeat us. Let me give honourable members an instance of what I mean. The right honourable gentleman who formerly represented East Sydney, and every one will admit his ability, told me once what a trouble his Bar examinations were to him when he entered upon them at the age of about thirty years. His difficulties were infinitely more than they would have been in the case of a man with so much ability had he started his studies ten years earlier in life. A man does not require great ability to pass an examination such as that set out if he starts upon his studies at an early age. There are periods when a man can readily acquire book knowledge, and other periods when a man finds it most difficult to direct his brain into new channels. ledge of no consideration? have already suggested that section 22 of the principal Act gives power to raise to Permanent Forces who shows his capacity.",43,Pairs

I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will consider seriously the representations that have been made to him. I do not think that he will do any good for those who urge the case of men who might wish to enter the College later in life by accepting the amendment. But some means should be adopted whereby a man in the Permanent Forces who has shown in a marked degree his practical fitness for promotion to commissioned rank will have an opportunity to secure that promotion without having to pass a theoretical examination too late in life.

281,Mr Tudor (Yarra,"Minister of Trademany deputations with the object of rectifying various .anomalies which have arisen under the Tariff. schedule of these anomalies; and, after submitting it to the Committee, will, before I sit down, move that it take the place, so far as it goes, of the Tariff which has been in operation until to-day. Many honourable members, I have no doubt, will be disappointed because particular items in which they are, perhaps,, interested, are not included. I may say at the outset, however, that this rectification of anomalies is not regarded by the Cabinet as Tariff revision; and it has been decided that there shall be no revision until after the referendum on the question of the extension of the industrial powers of the Commonwealth. If isthought that in the past the workers in both protected and unprotected industries, but particularly in tlie protected industries, have not had their fair share of the general benefits of Protection. Other Governments promisedand we must presume they intended to carry out their promise-to introduce a system of new Protection; and the present Government have introduced and carried Bills asking the people for increased powers to enable the workers to obtain their fair share of benefit under the settled policy of the country. It will be realized that the character of the revision must be largely influenced by the result of the referendum. employers are alike either in protected or unprotected industries. It is admitted that many of the workers have received fair treatment, but it is also acknowledged that many have not. When a deputation waited on me, in, I think, May of this year, and asked for a complete revision of the Tariff, I declined to support the request; and I take full responsibility for what I then said, having no desire to take shelter behind any action of the Cabinet. I represent, I think, one of the strongest Protectionist electorates in the Commonwealth; and I told the deputation that, until the workers were assured of their share of the benefits, it was not proposed to' revise the Tariff. I quoted to that deputation, as I could this afternoon if I so desired, case after case in which the employers had received practically a monopoly of the Australian market, and had not given the employees their share of the Protection. That is the reason why the Ministry decided not to re-open the whole Tariff until the people of Australia had had an opportunity of pronouncMr Tudor. ing upon what is known as the new Protection scheme, as involved in the proposal I have prepared a to amend the Constitution by giving increased industrial powers to the Commonwealth. ber say what profits those mar.ufactureis have been making? I intend to single out any industry, although it would be fairly easy to single out some. I have in my mind at present one in which those engaged are able to sell in Australia every ton of the particular article they produce, and they have not been noted for fair treatment of their employees. Boards deal with those cases? Boards in some of our industries. cannot deal with the new Protection proposed by the Government. They go further than the Wages Boards. good work as the Wages Boards have done, and be able to do even better. ber says that, has he any specific legislaI t is not suggested that all tion in view? plying to an interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta. After each Tariff revision anomalies have been found to exist. The first Tariff took over eleven months to"" settle, after a very strenuous session. It was not finished until October, 1902, and the work was hardly completed before there was an outcry that anomalies existed, because sufficient Protection was not given to some industries. Again, in 1907-8 the Tariff had hardly been revised before anomalies were discovered. not the slightest doubt that many honourable members will be disappointed when they see the schedule. put a very liberal interpretation upon the word "" anomaly:'* be no Tariff revision until after the refer-",45,Customs Tariff

There is toendum has been taken. member may think that half-a-dozen items in which he is interested have a claim to be dealt with at once, and independently of Tariff revision; but if each of the seventy-five honourable members of this House were to pick out one or two items for revision before the referendum is taken, I would not give much for the chance of tlie referendum being carried. say that there will be no Tariff revision if the referenda fail? the result of the referenda will influence the Cabinet as to how the Tariff is to be revised. I believe the bulk bf the people of Australia are Protectionists, because they believe that the conditions existing in Australia are superior to those existing in the countries which compete with us by sending their goods here. That is why this Parliament has placed ad valorem, or fixed -duties, upon a number-of articles; and it is to insure the workers their share of that increased Protection that the Cabinet have arrived at the decision that there shall not be any Tariff revision before the referenda, although the anomalies in existence shall be, as far as possible, rectified. the free list articles which are manufactured in Australia. That is an anomaly. there are on the free list articles manufacr tured in Australia, but that is more a matter to be dealt with in a revision of the Tariff. A deputation from Queensland which waited upon me the other day suggested a very simple method of'dealing with "" anomalies "" in the Tariff. They pointed out that, as there was a duty of only is. per central-upon bananas, and a duty of 2s. per central on other green fruits, we should bring the duty on bananas up to the higher level. I said that if we did the same thing with the apparel and iron duties, wcwould make a very sweeping change, and that if the deputation considered that that was a rectification of anomalies, and not Tariff revision, I . could not agree with them. That is why we have not dealt with any items whicli the Cabinet consider to involve Tariff revision. The list which I intend to move will, it is trusted, remove the diffiof making it here ourselves. culties which the Department experience in determining under what item certain articles come. partmental revision? partmental revision, for the purpose of making the interpretation of the Tariff better and clearer. In one or two instances we have increased the rate of duty upon articles, thereby increasing the amount of protection in those instances, but the reason of that is as follows:-We have been reclassifying ""some of the articles, particularly with regard to the paper duties, which I am sure my predecessor, in office will admit are the most difficult in the Tariff to interpret. For clearness, some lines which were wrongly in the free list before have had to be made dutiable. That has made the raw material of some Australian manufacturers dutiable, and, therefore, we have had in one or two cases to increase the rates of duty on the lines produced by those manufacturers in order to compensate for the increase in duty on the raw material. the case in Sydney? that will be dealt with-in relation to the cardboard box industry, and so on. increase the duty on cardboard? with that item when we come, to it. When we are considering the matter of Tariff revision we should keep in view the necessity of utilizing as far as possible the raw material available in Australia, and also of turning out an article which gives employment to the greatest amount of labour under the best possible conditions,. I do not agree with the statement that has been made in this House, that there are some industries that are not worth protecting, because I believe that every industry is worth protecting, but 1 think that some are more worth protecting than others, and they should receive from the House in any Tariff revision a greater amount of consideration. We should endeavour, as far as possible, not to partly finish an article in Australia, but to turn out a completed article. An illustration was recently given in the debate on the oil bounty question, when it was shown that we were turning out raw material, sending it away, and importing the finished product again, instead When we do tackle the work of Tariff revision 'we should not allow any process of that sort to take place. We should utilize our own",46,Customs Tariff

In any case, as I say, a man should not be compelled to go to law in such a matter, because the Tariff ought to be so plain as to be readily understood. The only other item I have to refer to is 373, namely children's tricycles and quadracycles. It was, unfortunately, successfully held that the quadracycles came within the category of bicycles, tricycles, and similar vehicles, not elsewhere included, and dutiable at 25s. each in the case of foreign, and £ 1 each in the case of British goods. It was known that that was not the intention of Parliament, but under the determination the charge had to be made, although it amounted to 100 per cent. The alteration is to bring the quadracycles into the same category as the toy tricycles. I admit that I had not seen the printed schedule until it was laid on the table to-day. I have been working from a typewritten copy, and, perhaps, like others, I took it for granted that honourable members were as well up in the subject as myself. I see, however, that the schedule, as printed, does not give honourable members any idea of the alterations proposed, and I hope by to-morrow to have the schedule in such a form as to be readily understood. Dr. seem to deal almost entirely with definitions and administration. of them; we are not proposing any Tariff revision. -It is, of course, impossible to discuss this schedule with any degree of fulness at this stage, and the Minister has very properly intimated his intention to permit an adjournment of the discussion until tomorrow, when he will be able to supply more concise information. I must say that the Minister has been quite frank in connection with this subject; he does not wish it to be understood for a moment that 'this schedule is in the remotest degree to be regarded as a revision of the Tariff. It is a mere correction, from a departmental standpoint, of anomalies, with the object of the more harmonious working of the Tariff. I brought an recognise many of the anomalies as those which ought to be dealt with as early as possible. At the same time, I must confess to a sense of profound disappointment, which will be shared by the community generally, that the Minister has seen fit to limit himself to these purely departmental corrections, in one case going so far as the mere alteration of a semicolon. the means of losing revenue. is serious; but the Minister has rigidly confined himself to immediate departmental difficulties, and, as I say, there will be a sense of disappointment throughout Australia that many of the more glaring cases, which show a complete departure from the original intention of Parliament, have not been submitted; because I feel sure they had only to be presented for revision to meet with approbation. Of course, whenever a Tariff is revised, anomalies are necessarily disclosed within a few days or weeks. All this points to the absolute necessity for a permanent Board to watch the operations of the Tariff and supply the House with information on which we may form a correct judgment. I do not blame the present Minister for following the practice, which has always been to throw before the House forty or fifty, or, perhaps, 500 items without any information whatever, except the information that can be obtained in the discussion that follows. If, in connection with each item, an expert Board showed the necessity for the gave the House the knowledge essential for its judicious consideration, the passage of the measure would be facilitated, and the result would be an infinitely better Tariff than we have been accustomed hitherto to create.

If we venture to alter one item the alteration may seriously affect many others. The House, from the stand-point of business, will find it essential to have a Board of experts to advise it in order that it may proceed with knowledge. The Minister has given as his excuse for not going beyond mere departmental difficulties and anomalies, as we have chosen to call them, the fact that it is proposed to submit certain alterations of the Constitution to the country, and that the shape and form of the revision of the Tariff will completely depend on the decision of the country in that connection. I disapprove of that as unfair, but quite apart from what the decision of the country may be on those measures, there are, perhaps, twenty or thirty items which have been brought under the Minister's notice, and under the notice of his predecessors, in connection with which it would be at once manifest to honourable members that an increased protection would give a very substantial advantage to industries and to the people of Australia. In regard to those items our own people are seriously suffering by reason of certain materials being brought in under items under which they could not hitherto have been admitted. The honourable member for Melbourne could give the Minister several cases which he has brought under the notice of the Department. Minister could have seen his way to introduce twenty or thirty of the more pressing and urgent items, he could have established such a conclusive case on their behalf that the House would readily have accepted his proposals with great advantage to the community as a whole. bei' has not been in this branch of the Federal Parliament when a Tariff has been considered. Chamber eleven years before the honourable member came in, and was for five months sitting where the Minister of Customs is now sitting, carrying through the Victorian Tariff of r8p6. It was also my privilege to pilot the Tariff of 1908 through another place, so that I have a little knowledge of the difficulties involved. Where, however, it can be shown that manifest injustice is being done, honourable members, no mat[221]2 ter what their fiscal ideas may be, are prepared, having regard to the decision of the people as to the fiscal policy of Australia, to do the utmost justice to the industries concerned. They will not stand by and allow them to suffer, as many of our industries are now suffering. The Minister should have been bolder, and dealt with some of these cases. I am not attempting to depreciate the value of the list now submitted to us. I am sure the Committee will readily accept it. It will assist towards the more harmonious working of the Tariff, by removing anomalies which have, to some extent, been created as the result of differing expert advice. The extraordinary thing is that on various items one can get the most skilled advice either way, and in the operation of the Tariff the result, in many cases, has been that large importations have come in under items under which this House had. no idea that they could enter. The Minister has contented himself with an increase of duty in regard to one item, and that has relation to paper. I do not think my honourable friend could have done otherwise in that matter. There is no more complex or difficult item in the Tariff than that of paper, and the experts themselves are those who differ the most in regard to it. If by this means the Minister can co-ordinate the various classes of paper, and can so assist the easier and more harmonious working of the Tariff, well and good. It will involve ort some lines an increase, of duty in regard to raw ma^ terial, yet that is fairly and reasonably If the compensated for by increase of duties, so far as the made-up article is concerned.

Whenever he mentioned an increase of duty he took care to apologize for it, as will be evident from a reading of the printed report of his remarks. The proposal now before us is in keeping with the general attitude of the Labour party regarding Protection. The Protectionist policy is up for sale. Although the electors have spoken with no uncertain voice, they have been told that effective Protection will not be given unless officers, taking their ipse dixit, and passing something is got in return. their share. able member is stipulating like the most ardent Free Traders in the party that tiie giving bf effective Protection shall depend on the granting of somefhing ""to an individual.

The principle is that it shall be a Commonwealth Navy, manned and officered by Australians; and that its purpose shall be to act, as it were, as a continual patrol of this great coastline of ours. Its antenna? will push forth into the outermost spaces of the Pacific, and will supply information as to the movements of' hostile fleets or cruisers. And so Australian commercewill be doubly safeguarded, not only by the power of these vessels to repel or to threaten invaders, but by the fact that information will be at their disposal, so that they may time their journeys by the circumstances and the position of the enemy, lt is a double duty, with which the Australian Fleet will thus be charged. standard of efficiency is to be the same as in the British Navy. There is to be a control which shall be efficient, and that control, obviously, must not be divided. In war it is impossible to have two generals of co-ordinate authority, and it is, therefore, provided in the Bill that in time of war, the control of the Fleet, subject to the sanction of the -Commonwealth, shall pass to the senior -naval officer, and that it shall become a part of the British Navy. The armoured cruiser, and the unarmoured cruiser may have to fight in seas far removed from what, in the widest interpretation of the term, are territorial waters. It is necessary and three submarines. Two of these deto fight the enemy wherever he is. It may be in the China waters ; it may be nearer Japan, or somewhere else; but, wherever it is necessary, there the Australian Fleet will strike a blow for Australia. Naturally, the Fleet falls easily into two divisions: one.which is peculiarly for local defenceI speak of the destroyers and the subr marines-and the other, which may be, but is not necessarily, purposed for operation in far-removed waters. The destroyers, although in themselves not a match for a battle-ship or a first-class cruiser, must have the effect of keeping those in command of battle-ships and first-class cruisers very wary. At night time such war-ships may not approach within a radius of 100 miles of any port at which destroyers are known to be stationed. A coast infested by destroyers is as safe as a coast can possibly be. Land defences alone are admirable, but something more mobile is required-; and the deficiency is supplied by the destroyer. A destroyer is, as it were, a movable fortress, capable of striking a deadly blow at an enemy TOO miles from the coastline, or even further, and capable of demoralizing -whic h is much more important-the morale of an attacking fleet. When there is a never-dying period of vigilance necessitated by the operations of a fleet of destroyers, there is created, as was shown by the position of the Japanese and the Russian fleets, practically a panic, or something bordering upon it. There is created something that, as it were, emasculates those operations, which would otherwise culminate in a reckless dash through the narrow waters into the very heart of your citadel. It furnishes, too, a sufficient and effective provision against the bombardment of your capital. What is to prevent a vessel standing outside Hobson's Bay, during The the hours of the night, and dropping its shots or shells at its ease on the great city of Melbourne? Absolutely nothing. The land defences are practically powerless at night against everything that moves without the limited sphere of a searchlight, but the destroyers will keep such raiders moving at night well beyond gunshot. In daylight, we may see them, and our land forts can, at least, render, I hope, a good account of themselves. It is proposed that the Fleet shall be composed of an armoured cruiser of the Indomitable class, three unarmoured cruisers of the improved City class, six destroyers of the improved River class, stroyers are already in Australian waters, and are expected to reach Fremantle within the next day or two. The third is to be constructed from material already prepared in Great Britain, and the other destroyers are to be constructed in Australia. As to the vessels generally, I hope that they will all be constructed in the Commonwealth. It is very gratifying to be told by the Australian artificers who went Home that they see no reason why we should not construct a first-class cruiser here. It is very gratifying to Australians to learn that, by the universal admission of the authorities in England, no men were more adaptable and none quicker than they were in picking up those peculiar methods followed in the construction of ships in naval dockyards. They werefirst-classworkmen, both in the character, the quantity, and the quality of their output. It is the policy of this Government, therefore, not merely to have an Australian Navy, but to have it constructed, as far as possible, in Australia, and refitted in Australia. A navy, like an army, cannot move far from its base Without coal, it cannot go far, and it must also be near a dockyard to be refitted and, if necessary, repaired. We hope to be able to make the gun mountings, the guns, and everything connected with them, and, before long, produce the iron of which they are made. I shall run very rapidly over the important features of the Bill, and leave to honourable members the task of criticism. There are to be established naval, gunnery, torpedo, and other schools for the training of our officers. Admiral Henderson comes here with the recommendation of the late First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, and of the present Sea Lord, at the invitation of the Government, to advise as to the establishment of naval bases throughout Australia. obvious that we must have more than one place in Australia where the vessels can find shelter, conveniently wait for the enemy, obtain coal, be docked and refitted; and, as to the precise localities, we twelve to fourteen'years of age to men of require the advice of an expert such as we believe we have obtained in Admiral Henderson. A Naval Board of Administration is to be appointed, and on that Board each sub-Department will have a representative, in the officers in charge of the Construction Branch, naval intelligence, contracts, paymaster, the training of the Naval Forces, and there will be also the Minister. Naval Captain Creswell, is to be abolished. That does not for. one moment mean that the services of Captain Creswell are to be dispensed with, but that there is to be initiated a new system. As I have said, the vessels are to be manned by Australian seamen; and until we have enough the Admiralty will supply British seamen. It is asserted that two years' training will be sufficient for the lower ratings, but that.ten or twelve years will be necessary for the men of higher rating. In modern days everything depends on efficiency, and principally on efficiency in gunnery and torpedo shooting. Since one man who shoots straight may save the nation, it is obviously of vital importance to the country, not so much that we should have guns, though these are necessary, as that we should have men who can fire straight. Japanese war shows conclusively that effective gunnery decided the contest. If we have guns with which we cannot hit, they may be admirable weapons on paper, but in an engagement they will be a delusion and a snare. I am pleased to be able to say Mr Hughes. there is every reason to be proud of the gunnery of our land forces; and we have every reason to believe that in the new Fleet Australian seamen will display as great an aptitude for gunnery as have our Permanent Artillery and British seamen. There is now in the British Navy the highest record for accurate gunnery in the world. Practically the effectiveness of the British Navy has been, not merely quadrupled, but added to ten-fold, by the accuracy of its gunnery during the last few years: From the Boer War down to the present time British gunnery has been revolutionized; and now the British Navy shows a larger percentage of hits than, I It is very think, any other navy. I am perfectly certain that Australians, when they have an opportunity, will shoot as straight as anybody. There, is provision for training, from boys of twenty-six. Of course, the provisions of the Defence Bill will apply, and the Citizen Forces will be trained on the ships in exactly the same way, and subject to the same conditions, asthose on the land. Those persons recruited on the coast will be drafted into camps, and will join the Naval Reserve instead of the Citizen Defence Forces; but there will be the disThe office of tinction that, whereas in the Military ForcesDirector, now occupied by there is no permanent fighting line, but only a permanent instructional staff, there must be a permanent fighting force in the Navy. To have good sailors and gunners the men must be permanently employed. recruited on a volunteer basis? pulsion relates only to the twetity-five days' training, which would obviously not make a man a sailor, much less an .expert gunner. If a man puts in eight days on a torpedo boat, his experience either then or afterwards may not strike him as altogether pheasant; but that is a matter for himself. The idea-and I think it is an excellent one-is that we have an enormous reserve of men in the mercantile marine. We are a nation, and the offshoot of a nation that has never been behind in producing an ample supply of sailors; and, The history of the Russotherefore, we do not anticipate any difficulty in recruiting. Of course, if there is any difficulty we shall have to offer higher inducements. The Naval Force will consist of, first, the permanent naval forces; secondly, the naval reserve or militia; and, thirdly, the naval volunteer reserve.",60,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
380,Mr Joseph Cook,But they will be,62,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
381,Mr Hughes,"Of course; the comThe last-mentioned will be composed of those who have served their term, and are over twenty-six years of age, and are liable to come up for training only when called upon. The line of the present naval reserve will be continued just as at present until we see whether we may safely disband it-for all practical purposes there will be no interference ""with this reserve. If the volunteers choose to continue in the service, it will be advisable to avail ourselves of their services. Further, we have a reserve in the Torres Strait pilots, who possess peculiar knowledge invaluable to the Commonwealth. Unless foreign nations have been very wide awake, it will be impossible for the ships of any to come inside the Great Barrier Reef at night, unless they are in charge of men with a very wide and comprehensive knowledge of navigation .in those waters. We have, therefore, decided to take over the Torres Strait pilots as part of our naval defence. The cost of this fleet amounts to ,£3,695,000, made up of one armoured cruiser, to cost £2,000,000; three unarmoured cruisers, £1,060,000; six destroyers, £480,000; and three submarines, £165,000. These figures represent only the estimates supplied to us by the Admiralty, and it may be that the piice of material and wages have since risen. Further, these are English prices, and the cost may be more in Australia. I do not desire honourable members to say afterwards that they understood ,£3,695,000 to be the total cost in Australia, because that is only an estimate, given for what it is worth. I have no doubt that it will be worthwhile to have the fleet constructed here at somewhat higher cost, considering that we have the inestimable advantage of dockyards and a staff of men who are able to refit and repair-a n advantage without which we should only be living in a fool's paradise. repair is worse than useless, because we are led to depend upon it, and it may fail us in our hour of need. the navy is estimated at ,£500,000, which is less than the estimate of the Admiralty. The reason is that we propose to pay for upkeep out of jrevenue, and not out of loans, so that we shall have no interest to provide; and, further, I may say that we -do not propose to accept the £250,000 from Great Britain in lieu of the subsidy. We propose to accept nothing from Great Britain, but to pay for the whole fleet ourselves; since we are going to do the work, we might as well do it well. The British Defence Act is to be adopted as a regulation. That is an up-to-date measure, containing no trace of the barbarous methods by which discipline, or so-called discipline, was enforced in days gone by. While death remains a punishment fer other offences than murder, it is reserved for desertion in the face of the enemy, and so forth. Honourable membfers will realize that men cannot be permitted to desert in the face of the enemy, because such is not only bad for the nation, but is contemptible and cowardly; and a man who does so is much better dead, and no one need shed a tear ""over his projected demise. In my opinion, the proposed expenditure is amply warranted by all the circumstances. We are a young nation just beginning to realize cur mighty potentialities. We are treading now with firm steps, and moving resolutely to our destiny. We propose to establish a fleet and man it ourselves. We propose to let the world see that Australia is moving along the line which she conceives has been marked out for her, and by J establishing this fleet, and. showing our capacity for construction, manning, repairing, and maintaining it, 'we are setting forth in the clearest way the fact, not only that we are here, but that we claim to remain here, and are taking the most effective ineans to substantiate our claim[8.28] I have listened with some degree of pleasure, particularly to the reference to the Naval and Militia Volunteer Force, which it is proposed to keep intact. I remember very well only about twelve months ago the fierce fulminations of honourable members opposite at the very idea that any volunteers should be kept for the purposes of the navy. The honourable member for Maranoa pointed out time and again how wrong it was to have anything to do with A vessel out of volunteering in connection with these forces. This is evidently one of the changes which honourable members op : The upkeep of posite have made since they passed over from this side. The Attorney-General last evening, in connection with another proposal, declared that his party had made no changes in passing over; but here we have a right-about-face. They were fierce in their denunciations of everything relating to the volunteer principle in connection with the Naval Force, but now the honourable gentleman sees every advantage in fostering it to the fullest extent. I desire to-night, to examine the claim winch the",62,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
382,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"Minister has made on every public platform, and whenever he is away from this House, that whatever developments there may have been in the shape of naval defence is due to something done by the Labour party. That claim has not been made to-night, because here is the place where it can be answered. I propose to answer it after it has been made about a hundred times by the honourable member in various parts of Australia. I have no quarrel with the honourable member's statement of facts, but to make the facts fit their former policy he has to go all wrong in his naval strategy. I challenge the honorable member's statement as to the strategy of this Fleet in his endeavour to make it appear that their former proposals were the only useful ones. We shall do well to remember our position in connection with the Fleet whicli we propose to develop, and its relation to the great Fleet oversea which platform now, but in a place where we can stands for the defence of the Empire at large. The honourable member laid it down, only a moment ago, that our Empire must be defended on the high seas-that that is its first line of defence. Without superiority at sea, therefore, the Empire of which we form a part cannot by any possibility be maintained. It is also recognised to be the duty of each self-government. We undertook the responsibility, ing portion of the Empire to provide, as far as possible, for its own territorial security. That is another fundamental principle which finds embodiment in the Fleet which we are now discussing. Another requirement of a proper defence of the Empire is that there shall be evolved schemes for the mutual assistance of every part of it. That is to say, when times make it necessary, the whole Empire's strength is to be concentrated in the defence of any given part of it. In this way there must be mutual co-operation for the purpose of Empire defence. Those three principles, therefore, have been defined to be a sea command, self-defence by the Empire's units, and mutual support of the whole and form the basis' of any strategy for the purpose of an adequate Imperial defence. I find all these requireof this proposal. ments of an Imperial defence met in the proposal which is now before the Chamber a proposal which carries out our naval defence scheme. The Attorney-General says, "" It is ours also."" Query, whose is it? yours. Mr Joseph Cook. see whose scheme it is. Whoever else may lay claim to it, the Labour party may not. They have denounced it from every part of Australia, gibed at it, and ridiculed it from every public platform in every State of the group. "" Dreadnought "" 1 nought is part of this scheme.

He may well laugh, but he is setting that paper up as an authority for himself. He swears by it when he thinks it happens to be against one of his political enemies, and accepts it at no other time. Let us come to the point as to whose scheme this is. The scheme announced at Gympie was to be all destroyers. Honourable evidently bent on the destruction of something, somewhere, and at some time. They will destroy themselves if .given a little rope. At any rate, they set out to destroy the whole of the enemy's fleets by this Fleet of theirs, consisting of "" four ocean destroyers, sixteen other destroyers, and three already ordered."" I understand that it is in connection with the "" three already ordered "" that the Acting Prime Minister is constantly basing the -claim to the authorship of this scheme.

It was this party that had the Surplus Revenue Bill put through. was put away safely in the Trust Fund, but before the Labour party would give the Government the money to put away, they required from them an undertaking, whicb was repeated three or four times, that not a penny of it should be spent until a scheme was in all the for its spending had been outlined to this Chamber.

If they do, I shall have to remind honourable members personally of the fact that they are out of order. the truth. able member for Echuca must not interject. members opposite were printed statement showing what the various naval defence schemes have consisted of. It shows that there has really been an evolution of ideas beginning with a fairly sensible proposal by Captain Creswell,' eight or nine years ago,, so far as it went, but dwindling down in the time of my honourable friends to those ocean destroyers and nothing more. They proposed a fleet of twenty-three destroyers, which could do no damage to anything in the trade routes. It could not go into the trade routes at all, but was to skirt the mast of Australia, and prevent an enemy from coming here to bombard our cities and towns. We heard that antiquated strategy given utterance to a moment or two ago by the Acting Prime Minister, who statement is thereby furnished indisputable proof that' he knows nothing whatever about naval strategy. He talks of something which belongs to the period of the "" troglodyte in the post-pliocene epoch."" I have heard the Acting Prime Minister use that expression so many times that I know it perfectly well; hut to-night in His enunciation of naval strategy he has shown that he, at any rate, belongs in a naval sense to that period of the world's development. That projected That is how those three fleet of ocean destroyers would be of no use whatever for co-operative purposes in «Empire defence.

408,Statement Out Of The Mouth Of Mr Mckenna,,65,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
409,Mr Mckenna Attacked And Swept Out Of,"elaborate a scheme of naval defence for the The honourable member told us to-night that outlying portions of .the Empire. saidUnder certain conditions the establishment of pert would express such a view. The naval local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo opinion of to-day is that the local fire craft and submarines, might be of assistance brigades could cope with all the damage in time of war to the operations of the fleet, but such flotillas cannot co-operate on the high which any hostile ship might doseas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks frpm hostile cruisers and squadrons. torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo crafts would not in itself, moreover, be a good means of gradually developing a self-contained fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force-whateve r its size-complie s with this condition it can never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British inmarine is a defensive vessel. All nations at terests. The scheme of the Labour Government is twenty-three torpedo-boats to skirt our coasts, as the Acting Prime Minister said just now, to frighten all the big ships in the world away. What a ridiculous notion 1 scheme as that was laid down; it was only a proposal. scheme proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay, at Gympie. that made for use? Minister repudiating his leader's Gympie speech ! I am quoting from the speech in which the Prime Minister declared that to be the naval policy of the Government. There were to be twenty-three torpedo-boat destroyers, with never a Dreadnought or a cruiser among them. I shall show the honourable member in a moment what these destrcyers are worth. I propose to sweep his little tin-pot navy away, and he can quote me again next time he speak as having said that his proposal was for a tinpot navy, which would be costly and useless, because unsuited for co-operation in the defence of the Empire. There could be no more absolute condemnation of the proposal of the Fisher Government than that contained in the memorandum of Mr naval attack has, in practice, always led to the McKenna, which I have just read. Now, honourable members opposite are continually quoting Lord Charles Beresford in defence of their proposals, but this is what he wrote in a magazine article which was published a little time agoThe only way that our distant Dominions can be hurt is by their trade routes being cut. He we could be hurt by ships coming here and blowing up our towns. No naval exIn these days, if we go to war, it is most unlikely that a cruiser of a foreign country The operations of destroyers and would get to the Dominions-' and operate by going into a harbour and blowing down a town. Away goes the justification alleged by the Acting Prime Minister a little time ago for the proposed fleetThe days for that are past. What would they get from a town? They would get a certain amount of money and probably a certain amount of bills which may not be paid when due. Foreign cruisers would go to a trade route. Remember, a torpedo boat or a subthis moment for fighting efficiency are short of cruisers. What would probably occur would be that an armed mercantile auxiliary would go out into the trade routesand there wage war upon the commerce of a country. In other words, ships are not likely to come here to destroy our towns. We need cruisersfor far other purposes than the defence of our cities. The idea of having ships along a coast-line of 8,000 miles waiting for a fleet which, according to experts, will never come, is madness and folly and waste. Sir Cyprian Bridge is as good an Was not authority on these questions as Captain Here is the Mahan-a t least he is the best British authority. He says as to the proper use of smaller and special class craft in warThe greatest distance to which they are sent should not exceed forty per cent, of that represented by their fuel endurance. It has been stated that our vessels will have a 3,000 miles radius, and that they will be able to go 1,500 miles from our coast, and return. But, according to the opinion which I have just quoted, they will be able to go in safety only 40 per cent, of that distance, which is 600 miles. To continue the quotationLocalized floating defence is the weakest form that naval defence can assume. The aim of strategy should be to include its strongest form in any plan adopted. Fixed or passive defence against apprehended adoption of a long series of protecting arrangements, to enumerate which would be to parallel the jingle of the "" House that Jack built.""

I heartily approve of the proposals before the Chamber, and am glad to hear also that Ministers are able to provide out of revenue for the annual outlay to be incurred in maintaining a fleet. I hope that they will realize their further obligations. In my judgment, we cannot safely stop in the development of our naval power. If the Empire is to be maintained during the troublous times, which must occur in the near future-becaus e the political atmosphere is so disturbed that I do not know how things can go on as they are-w e must be ready; the nation which is not able to defend its interests with its strong right arm will suffer. Therefore, the Commonwealth and the other outlying parts of the Empire should concert further measures for contributing to its defence. We are rich enough to do it, ancl it is our duty, if only to relieve the Mother Country. We should free her, at least, to meet the menace in the North Sea. Our obligation is to secure and preserve our inviolability, and take measures which will enable us to defend the Empire by being ready wherever danger may threaten. And so I am glad to' find in this Bill a proposal for the standardization of these various units which will make up an Empire Fleet. It is not to be merely a mechanical standardization. We are not merely to have the same type of ship but the same discipline in the British and in the Commonwealth Navy; and we are also to have men trained to the same standard. And so we shall have a complete standardization, not only in ships, but in men. This, I believe, will help us to take a worthy place alongside of all who wish prosperity, and for all time to maintain it against its foes.

423,Mr Joseph Cook,The Minister's,67,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
424,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"but since he has already spoken this evening, I suppose it would be too much to expect him to speak again at this stage. We are all agreed as to the necessity for naval defence, and, to my mind, it is even more important than is land defence. The Acting Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, rightly assumed that our Naval Forces would prove to be as efficient in gunnery as are our land Forces, and those who last Monday had the privilege of watching the gunnery practice at Queenscliff must feel confident that the gunners at the Heads would give any vessel that attempted to pass .through a very hot time. I was exceedingly pleased to hear the honourable gentieman say that the estimated cost of constructing the Fleet, namely, £3,690,000, might be exceeded, because of the probability of a goodly proportion of the Fleet being constructed in Australia. I hold the view that we ought to build our vessels here, even if their local construction involves an additional cost of £1,500,000. In the first place, we have in Australia men capable of readily being instructed in the work of. building such vessels; and secondly, we cannot hope to have a perfect system of naval defence unless we are able to build our own war ships, and, when necessary, to effectively repair them. I still hold to the opinion that the requiretain from the Old World an officer capable ment as to twenty-five days' drill per annum will seriously interfere with the wage-earning section of the community, and I trust that propei measures will be taken to insure that the least possible harm will be done those whq have to give up so much time to the work of fitting themselves for the defence of their country. I hope that provision will be made by regulation to prevent any employer punishing a man because he has to attend drill at a time when the employer thinks he should have his services. Whilst the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking last night, I interjected that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had "" sacked "" two of their men because, after asking for leave, they took a day of f , in order to attend, as If such a practice be allowed, then in no members of the Naval Reserve, a memorial service which was held in front of this building. Those men trained to fit themselves for the defence of Australia, yet a large company like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which has fattened on the people of Australia, refused to give them time off to enable them to take part in that memorial service. If that sort of practice is to be indulged in, there is a Mr Mathews. hard time in front of our men who are called upon to attend drills. The Government must take steps to see that such companies, and not their men, shall pay for the defence of Australia, since they reap the whole benefit of the system. I hope that full opportunity will be given every man to avail himself'of the Naval, as well as the Military, College. The Minister told us that the administrative body would be reconstructed, and asserted that, whilst Captain Creswell's position could be done away with, we could not afford to lose the services of Captain Creswell. I have no feeling against that officer, but I trust that when we have a Navy, the Government will secure the services of a man who knows something about the handling of a fleet. Captain Creswell might have been an excellent officer to control a fleet if he had an opportunity; but no man in the Australian service has had any experience in handling a fleet such as we hope to establish within the next few years. I disagreed with the proposal that a military officer should be obtained from the Old Land in connection with our Defence Force, and I am not sure now that we. did right in that connection. But I do feel that it is essential, in the interests of the Australian Navy, that we should obof handling the fleet that we propose to create. I desire to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to clause 38, paragraph a of which provides: ber will not be in order in discussing the details of a particular clause. the Bill for the senior officer taking command, subject to certain regulations, when our Fleet co-operates with the British Navy. I hope that the Imperial authorities will not be allowed to make a regulation under which a junior officer in the British Navy will in such circumstance be able to supersede a senior Commonwealth officer. circumstances shall we have officers fit to control our Fleet. I do not know that it will be resorted to, but under the clause as it stands it will be possible. I hope that in the very near future, when we have completed our Fleet, no junior officer of the Imperial Navy will be able to supersede a senior Commonwealth officer, either on this or on any other station. The only other question to which I desire to refer relates to the matter of pensions. Provi-.",67,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
425,Mr Speaker,The honourable mem,68,Naval Defence Bill Second Reading
426,""" Mr Mathews","Provision is made insion is made for the wives and children of men who may be killed in action, and for men who are called upon because of infirmity or injury to retire from the Navy; but littie or no provision is 'made for a navy pension."" I contend that Aye should institute a pension system in connection with our Defence Force. Ours is the only Defence Force in the world of which I know in connection with which no provision is made for the payment of pensions. After serving for ten or twenty years in the army or navy, a man gets into a certain groove which unfits him for other callings. In the absence of a pension system, a man, after serving his country for twenty years or more, may be turned adrift, and may be subject to the bufferings of adversity, although he has spent the best years of his life in the defence of his country. The wages paid in the Australian Navy are not commensurate with the services rendered. If we capitalize the wages received by men in the Imperial Navy-thei r consolidated pay, their allowances, and their pensionswe shall find that our own men have been considerably underpaid. As a fighting unit, a man is not of much use after he has passed the age of fifty years. As a petty officer or an instructor, he may do good service, but as an A.B., perhaps, he would not be of much value. I do not think that men who have served in that capacity for twenty or thirty years should, on reaching the age of fifty years, be cast adrift without a pension. Such a system is by no means democratic. I hope that the Government will, in the near future, make provision for pensions in connection with our Defence Force. It has been suggested that the men themselves should contribute to a pension fund, but, whilst they receive their present rates of pay, they cannot possibly do so. A considerable addition will have to be made to the present rates in order to do justice to those who are serving us. In conclusion, I would again emphasize the point that the requirement as to twenty-five days' training a year will seriously dislocate every calling of the wage-earning section of the community in almost every part of Australia. should not have spoken to this question but high seas to protect the trade routes.

The honourable member for Parramatta has quoted three authorities with regard to naval construction and the class of navy we ought to establish, but I would point out that all those authorities are Britishers. They give their views from the stand-point of Great .Britain, which is not a self-contained country like the Commonwealth, but has to depend for its food supplies on the protection of the trade routes. £120,000,000 a year. affected by war, but not one man or woman in the country would thereby be deprived of a meal.

If the Fleet of Great Britain were defeated neither our Dreadnought, nor our little cruisers, would be of much use on our coast; and at such a time the whole of the Fleet should be placed under one Admiral, to fight the battles of the Empire wherever necessary.

Although the Minister has not, I think, pointed it out, the reason is found in the desire to separate the naval and the military Statutes, with a view to easy reference.

On the date of the issue of the proclamation the Territory will pass over to the Commontem of government we shall have no means of properly administering it.

In order that all possibility of development may not be held up until this Parliament meets again and a Constitution can be framed for the Northern Territory, it may be necessary to pass some Ordinances, and that is really the object of this Bill.

That clause provides thatNo Crown lands in the Territory shall be sold or disposed of for any estate of freehold, except in pursuance of some contract entered into before the commencement of this Act. That clause has been inserted in accordance with a promise made to the honourable member for Kooyong, and also to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, whilst the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was under consideration. Obviously, if no Crown lands in the Territory can be sold, then such South Australian laws as permit of the selling of Crown lands can be of no effect, and we must substitute other laws for them. To that extent, it will be necessary to make certain Ordinances before a complete working scheme is approved in order that lands may be taken up. not allow much land to be taken up before it has framed a definite policy. but it is wholly undesirable that the development of the Territory should be held up any longer than is absolutely necessary.

I have not a very wide experience of tropical cultivation, but from what I can learn from others, one of the difficulties connected with tropical development has generally arisen from the fact that areas altogether too large have been taken up. Honourable members will see quite clearly the scope of this Bill. Under it, certain Acts will apply to the Territory, on much the same lines as those adopted under the Seat of Government Administration Bill. Lands Acquisition Act to acquire lands for public purposes? where leases have been granted, the conditions under which such land may be acquired are set forth in the South Australian Act, by virtue of which the leases were granted. To what extent they would conflict with the Lands Acquisition Act, I cannot on the spur of the moment say. sions of the Lands Acquisition Act are applied to the acquisition of land owned in the Territory by any person, for any public purpose. touch the question of the rights and obligations of lessees under existing leases. referring to future settlement. ercise wider powers in connection with big leases and closer settlement. that we could at present touch the leases that have been granted. They have been granted for a fixed term, and we can alter the conditions of the leases only in accordance with the terms of the Act under which they were granted. Leasehold lands can be resumed for agriculture, and they can also be acquired, if required, for any public utility ; but whether they could be resumed to enable more pastoralists to be settled upon them is a question that is open to doubt, We are taking over the Territory subject to all the obligations of the State of South Australia in connection with it. It is provided that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and the Secret Commissions Act shall apply to it. There is a further provision, which I undertook to insert, to determine the compensation to which an owner is entitled under the Lands Acquisition Act. It declaresThe value of the land shall be taken not to exceed the unimproved value of the land, or the interest therein of the owner, at the date of the passing of this Act, together with the value of his interest in the improvements on the land at the date of the acquisition of the land. That will carry out a promise that I made to the honourable member for Franklin. These are the only points to which 1 need draw the special attention of the House. Whilst we have no cut-and-dried policywhilst I am not prepared at present to in the dicate, even in a general way, the lines of policy that we shall adopt-ou r first vyork will be that of inquiry and investigation as to the best means of developing the known localities in the Territory. The Barklay tablelands, the Victoria Downs country, the MacDonnell Range country, the Victoria, Daly, and Adelaide River flats are all pretty well known; and attention will first have to be directed to the question of how best to develop the lands there. No big work of policy will be undertaken by way of Ordinance; and honourable members will be placed in possession of the decisions of the Cabinet when we have had an opportunity of arriving at them after inquiry. The question of the treatment of the aborigines has been raised, notably by the honourable member for Laanecoorie; and a very useful article on the subject has lately appeared in the Victorian Labour Call. The conditions of the aborigines are not, I think, a credit to us; and we shall have to take the earliest steps for their improvement. the existing Administrator in his office, or to appoint a new Administrator? the honourable member did not ask me to express an opinion. We have taken power to appoint an Administrator, who may be the present Government Resident, or he may not.

It is not advisable at first to will have to be equitably, or even geneplace the officers under a Public Service Act, because it may be necessary to have a Territory service. The Papuan service is not under the Public Service Commissioner; and the conditions are such that it might be impossible to transfer men. of the Territory positions might be made interchangeable, because it would give an opportunity for transfer from the parts where extreme heat prevails. It is too soon to talk of a Constitution, but at the earliest possible moment the Government will give the white residents there some representation, of which they have none of any kind at present. There are about 1,500 whites there, but we hope that before long there may be a great many more. The two State members will of course cease to represent them from the ist January supposing that to be the date of the proclamation; and it is not possible to give the people even a vote in the referenda because they relate to questions exclusively between the Federated States and the Commonwealth. Under the circumstanees a Bill of this sort is inevitable to provide for an interregnum, but that interregnum is likely to be unusually long. That is to say, the parliamentary recess will probably be of exceptional length, yet the work to be done in the Territory is of the first importance.

I quite agree that the task for the next twelve months will be almost wholly one of investigation, inquiry, and research ; and very competent people will have to be chosen for that work. They will need to be sufficiently directed, and yet not tied too fast by any particular instruction given from here. Generally, the Minister is likely to have an extremely interesting and active twelve months under this measure. The chief rocks to avoid are those in connection with appointments, which, I assume, will be of a more or less temporary character until the fuller measure is introduced, and the Minister has made up his minu which officers he desires to retain, and which he is willing or unwilling to part with.

We shall look to the honourable gentleman to bring home his sheaves by the time Parliament meets. The problems of this Territory will not w a it if they would we should never have had this Bill-and next session we ought to take decisive steps towards multiplying the population and the productiveness of that part of Australia. The intervening twelve months can be well used, and will not be a day too long. often the Minister need expect suggestions to extravagance from this side, but I urge him not to be penurious. He should use all the time available, and all the assistance he can get, so as to be able, as soon as Parliament re-assembles, to place befoie us some actual propositions to which immediate effect can be given, which will be the means of commencing an expeditious settlement of the Territory. and my sympathies are all with Ministers who are undertaking it, and particularly with the Minister in charge.

I see no reason why we should take over the Northern Territory before, at least, the ist July. Immediately we take it over, we take over its liabilities, which are very severe. I presume it would mean that from the ist January until 30th June we should be undertaking a liability of anything from ,£200,000 to ^300,000.

There are plenty of competent persons whose services can be obtained to examine the country and report on it in a few months, especially in regard to railway routes and the lands that should be surveyed along ihe railways and opened up for settlement. A good deal has been said here, especially this session, about the scarcity of land in the Commonwealth, and the difficulty experienced by people who want to get land. That statement will never be able to be made with any justice in the future, because we have all these millions of acres of land awaiting settlement. It has also been stated by persons who think themselves competent to speak on the subject that the climate of the Territory is salubrious, and that white men, women, and children can live and work well there. If this is so-and the Labour party say it is-how can it ever be said again that there is any difficulty about obtaining land for immigrants and other intending settlers? If the people about here want more land-if they are crowded out-all need to say to them will "" There are immense areas of fertile lands with a fairly salubrious climate, where you can work out your destiny, if not under peculiarly good circumstances, at any rate under circumstances of which the Labour party approve."" Honourable members opposite contend that white men as well as coloured men can work in any part of Australia. That being so, they have a great opportunity to utilize this Territory to the fullest. opposite, who have always been eager for the transfer of the country to the Commonwealth, with the object of making it the home of thousands of our own race, will be ready to send their nearest and dearest there to live.

This provision will stand in the way of improvements being made. If the Government want it, they should take it within a reasonable time ; but to say that this provision shall apply for all time, that after many years the Government are to go back and ascertain the value of the land at the date of the passing of this Act, is altogether unreasonable. A similar provision was inserted in other Bills where it was intended to take over land within a reasonable time. ber contemnlate a depreciation of values? tion did take place, the land would still have to be taken over at its value at the time of the passing of this measure.

570,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [11.9},"for our homes next week, and we should like an opportunity to discuss the Budget before we do so. There should be an opportunity on Tuesday or on some earlier occasion of discussing the Budget. It has to be discussed at some time, and the subject has already been delayed inordinately. If the Acting Prime Minister will not afford me an opportunity I cannot help it ; but I wish to be perfectly straightforward in saying that though I should like to have one, I cannot avail myself of it unless it be afforded on Friday or Tuesday. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [ II . II ] I should like to give the right honourable member for Swan an opportunity of discussing the Budget, but he has placed me in rather an awkward position, with inclination and duty struggling for mastery. The right honourable member has informed us that he is going away from Melbourne, and he also asks me to put down the Budget for discussion before he goes. Well, one has had very fair experience of discussions lately, and I should have been inclined to put off discussion on this matter as long as possible. Still, however, I should like to give the right honourable member a chance to speak if he is really going away. I may, therefore, mention that it is our intention to proceed with the Tariff Anomalies Bill until it is finally dealt with. There then remain to be discussed the Defence Bill, a Judiciary Bill, a small Bill introduced by my colleague the Minister of Home Affairs relating to the referendum, a Bill relating to Customs Administration which has already passed, the Senate, 'and a Supply Bill. We can possibly deal with the Tariff Anomalies Bill, and the BUls in charge of my colleagues, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister of Trade and Customs, before Friday afternoon. If that be the case, I shall be very glad to give the right honourable member from 3 to 4 o'clock on Friday in which to make his speech, if that will serve his purpose.
