The most frequent reference to the need for the Minister fundamental defect is in section 4 which sets out to pay attention to Aboriginal tradition. the purposes of the Act. It states: Section3 (I) defines 'Aboriginal tradition' as 'the The purposes of the Act are the preservation and body of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs of protection from injury or desecration of areas and obAboriginals generally or a particular community of Abjects in Australia and in Australian waters, being areas originals and includes any such traditions, observances, and objects that are of particular significance to Aborigcustoms or beliefs relating to particular persons, areas, inals in accordance with Aborigine tradition. objects or relationships'. This provision is important because the Act But this definition does not require that tradition leaves a great deal of discretion in the hands of or belief should have any religious or mystical the Minister. He has no obligation to balance basis whatsoever and any belief held by any any other interests against those of the Aboriggroup of Aborigines would apparently seem caines.
