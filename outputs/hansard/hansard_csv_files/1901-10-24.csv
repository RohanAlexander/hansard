There is a constitutional rule which would make it an impropriety to give an answer even under, exceptional circumstances ; for that I am sorry. The honourable member may recollect that before the motion of censure was brought on a promise was given to ask for the fullest information on the subject; it has been fulfilled. I can say no more at present. 18 T 2 Debate resumed (from 23rd October, (1) That bhis House cannot accept the financial and Tariff proposals submitted by the Government(a) Because they would place thefinancesof the Commonwealth and the States upon an unsound and extravagant basis. 0) Because they fail to adjust the burdens of taxation and the advantages of the . freo list in an equitable manner, revealing a marked tendency, which this House regrets to observe, to press . upon the necessaries of life and appliances UBed in our farming, mining, and pastoral industries more heavily than they do upon many articles of luxury.

The conditions, differ so widely in every civilized country I am sorry to say that that statistics in themselves convey no true impression as to the state of the people, taking all matters into consideration, or as. to the effect on a nation of a particular policy. We have had England quoted to a very great extent, especially by the free-traders, as showing the great value that attaches to a free-trade policy. Apart from the fact that England built up her industries largely under a protective system, she got a certain start of other nations, especially the",14,Setup

She got such a start that her continued surplus of exports left her with a large amount of money, which she loaned out, and thus became the creditor nation of the world. That led to the continued sending to England, in the form of goods, of immense sums year by year to meet the interest.

Because of this vast expansion of her ex.port trade, notwithstanding the recent war, which has upset matters to a slight extent, we find a continual out-stretching of the United States capitalist in the endeavour to find an outlet for the vast Bums which are accumulating year by year. That is shown by the recent purchases by Americans of steam lines and various industrial businesses in England. ' And I feel certain that within a .very few years, so far as the signs of the times point, the United States will to a large -extent displace Englandi n the money market. That, again, will have an immense influence, I think, upon the general trend of trade and commerce throughout the world. Another feature has to be borne in mind. When we attempt to compare America with England we have to allow for the vast natural resources of a comparatively virgin country compared with the state of affairs in England. But, on the other hand, when some honourable members on your left, sir, attempt to compare England with the Continental nations, they should make allowance for the fact that not only have her two principal competitors had during comparatively recent times to bear the enormous expense of a war, which meant in the case of France on indemnity of £100,000,000, and the expenses of the war amounting to That is one thing which, many hundreds of millions, but also the continued withdrawal from active production of the position which England oca very large proportion of their populations in In view of standing armies and general military training. We know that England spends more on her army and navy than does any other nation, but England is able to meet her expenditure in that direction many times over out of T h a t is loyal, anyhow. the-interest which she draws from foreign It is very likely that I loans. The main drawback, however, against which the continental nations have to contend is the withdrawal from active production of such a large proportion of their people, and it is only fair that that should be taken into consideration in any comparison that may be made. As far as the After years of United States are concerned, it seems to me that even our free-trade friends must admit that the iron industry of the United States has been developed as the direct result of the protective Tariff that has been in existence there for many years. able member must consider the royalties. a factor; but against that it may be pointed out that in connection with the' production of iron, England until recently had in close juxtaposition the coal and all the varieties of ore necessary for the manufacture of iron and steel. During the last few years England has had to send to Spain and Belgium for certain kinds of iron to mix with the native ore in order to make perfect steel. That, however, applies to only recent years, whereas in America they have had from the outset to convey the iron ore, in the greater number of cases, for a very considerable distance. In one instance, where I admit that they have reduced the cost of handling to the lowest possible degree-in connection with the Carnegie works, now under the Steel Trust-the y have to carry their ore 1200 miles by water, and for a considerable distance by rail, before they can bring it to the cool and the fluxing",14,Motion Of Censure

I recently read a magazine article which was written apropos the formation of the large Steel Trust in America, and the writer evidently was not speaking with the idea of supporting any particular fiscal view, but was merely stating facts of interest to the general community. He statedt do not know myself, because, unfortunately for me, I have never been in the United States-that the great bulk of the ore used in connection with the Carnegie works had to be carried a very long distance. of the Royal Commission of 1888, the position in England is very different from what the honourable member has'represented it to be. cently read in the Sydney Daily Telegraph -whic h cannot be stated to hold protectionist viewsa letter from their New York correspondent commenting on the big strike that lately occurred in connection with the Steel Trust works. Although the unions were on strike, no question of wages was involved, according to this writer, because, leaving out of account foremen and clerks, the wages for artisans and labourers puttogetheraveraged 3 dols., or 12s. 6d., aday. to adopt new methods and new machinery. It is not likely that underthese circumstances Soi n the matter of trusts; it was only any question of wages would be at stake. The question of unionism was at stake, and this, of course, might eventually lead, directly or indirectly, to the being involved, but strike of wages had arisen. I maintain that the wages show a very considerable balance in favour of the payments made to the American employees. We have been told a great deal about the trusts that exist in America, and I am prepared to admit that trusts generally are likely to form one of the most important factors in the industrial life of the future, straining to the fullest possible extent the collective wisdom of the Parliaments of all the countries of the world. ever, be recollected that trusts are not peculiar to America, notwithstanding the statements made to the contrary by a writer to whom I give every credit for his great intelligence, his general analytical power, and his desire to state the case fairly. Notwithstanding these statements, we know that under free-trade in England trusts flourish to a considerable extent. Quite a number of these trusts exist in England-the salt trust might be quoted as an instance-and trusts will always flourish where large amounts of capital are available, and where there is competition between capitalists. It appeals to any capitalists-whethe r they are under free trade or protection-that if they can come to an arrangement by which they can reasonably limit the output, and control prices, they will be all the betteroff for joining in with their neighbours. That, of course, is human nature under any fiscal system. I do not say that the trusts "" obtain in exactly the same degree in England as in America, but they do exist there, and one reason why they have not assumed the same proportions as in America, up to the present time, is that the English manufacturer is acknowledged to be a man of slow growth as far as his methods are Concerned. He is like most of us, rather conservative; and it is a good thing in some respects that we do not change until we are thoroughly convinced of the necessity for change. The English manufacturers, however, have been outstripped in many instances by American, competitors, because of their unwillingness when they found that the Americans derived great advantages from these combinations that they have followed their exwages ample. was concerned, no question factures are three times greater per head of the population than are those of America. but that is due to the difference in the conditions of the two countries.

More trade goes through the canal down to the St. Lawrence than passes through the Suez canal-that does not apI t must, howpear in statistics, because it is only internal trade.

So far as the ""Song of the Shirt"" is concerned, the lesson which that poem conveys is quite as true of England to-day as it was 40 or 50 years ago. Indeed, the condition of affairs is even worse at the present time. I do not -say that it is extended over a greater area, but in its intensity it is even worse than it was when the ""Song of the Shirt"" was written. An HONORAB LE MEMBER No . absolutely. I read a description of theJewish quarters in London, from the pen of a man who has every reason to speak well of the people to whom he was particularly referring. I am alluding to Arnold White, but I do not for one moment contend that the condition of affairs of which he speaks is due to free trade. Speaking of the Jewish quarter, and as a. man who had been employed by Baron Hirsch to control large benevolent enterprises on behalf of the Jewish community of Russia, he depicts the conditions existing there to-day as horrible in the extreme, and as not being at all outdone by those existing in a similar quarter years ago. I do not say for one moment that these conditions are directly due to free-trade. I am not so unfair as to argue in that way; nor do I admit that the sweating which obtains in New York is due to protection. In each case it is due to the fact that a number of people who the cotton trade of the world. have been persecuted under old world governments have fled to where freedom-eve n if it amounts to freedom to starve-is obtainable. They have flocked to New York and London in exactly the same manner. This influx has had a very material effect It is a true friend of labour. upon the conditions which prevail there. The leader of the Opposition stated that the' gap between the rich and poor in America is greater than that which obtains in England. I should just like to quote for his benefit a statement by Mid/iall. I notice that the free-traders generally fly to Mulliall, because he is suspected of having free-trade leanings. Mr F. E . McLEAN W ill the honourable member put any statistician against him ? accept Mullwll as an authority. I believe I admit-as every sane man that he is a fiee-trader, and I know that the free-traders are not satisfied unless one quotes Mul/iall. If any other authority is quoted, they are apt to discount his testimony. Apropos of the matter to which I have just referred, namely, the gap between the rich and the poor in America, Mulhall, according to Coghlan's Seven Colonies, page 421, statesIn the United States it takes the population 70 working days to earn their food. their clothes 1 Midhall saysIn the United States it takes the population 7G working days to-earn their food and beverage, On l y a little while ago whilst in the United Kingdom it takes them 127 days. That isa very large difference; in the United States; work at higher pressure; but even that faGt will not account for the very wide distinction.

I point out this fact to show that, so far as statistics go, the gap between rich and poor is not so great in the States, if the working population on an average can earn the food which is necessary for their existence in 76 days. The honourable and learned member for East Sydney also referred to the boot manufacturing industry in New South Wales. I do not intend to say very much in reference to the continual cross firing which has been going on between New South Welshmen and A ictorians, because T it seems to me that the matter has been carried too far. I do not feel that we are justified in assuming that all the Victorians are scoundrels, politically speaking. member for AVentworth said the other night that the representatives of Victoria ought rather to disfranchise themselves than carry out the decision of their constituents upon this occasion. He said that if honourable members who represent Victoria were the means, with others, of securing the passage of this Tariff, it would be Government by a minority. When the honourable member said that, he evidently forgot that the twenty Victorian representatives can do nothing unless they are backed up by the nine or ten New South Welshmen, who are also returned as protectionists. were political scoundrels. that was the inference.

As far as betraying anxiety to boss the situation is concerned, that newspaper performs its task pretty well.

The honourable No ; who said that 1 and learned member for East Sydney, in speaking the other evening, said that the employees in the boot manufactories of New South Wales are betterpaid than are those in the Victorian factories.

Immediately the statement was made by the leader of the Opposition, that the boot trade employees in New South Wales aie better off than are those in Victoria, I wrote to the secretary of the union, who has since replied to my communication. He states:Some time ago, in consequence of the misleading figures given by Mr Coghlan regarding the earnings of makers and finishersThere are two branches of the boot manufacturing trade.

The right honourable gentleman says that he is going to take the burden off the back of the poor man. In my view, however, his proposal is simply to shift the burden from one shoulder to the other. The leader of the Opposition is not now in the position he was a few years ago in New South Wales, when he said to the State Parliament and the people-"" I am prepared to adopt free-trade, and its concomitant of direct, taxation,"" The power to impose direct taxation gave him the chance of establishing free-trade. member think a revenue of £9,000,000 is necessary 1 such a revenue is necessary, but I shall deal with that point in a moment. The leader of the Opposition was on logical ground in the position he took up in New South Wales; but I contend that, so far as the general taxpayer is concerned, it does not matter a snap of the finger to him whether the £7,000,000, £8,000,000, or £9,000,000 of revenue is raised from cotton goods or from woollen goods. The leader of the Opposition almost shed tears over the working-man, when he said, the other day"" What can we do for the pioneer away in the interior ?-wh y should we tax liim out of existence, and give him no assistance from the Treasury of the country ?"" But the right honourable gentleman did not say that he was going to relieve the tea of the poor pinoeer from any impost at the hands of the Government. He did not say that he was going to make the kerosene light any cheaper in the farm-houses of the country. He did not say that the poor man's wife's underclothing, and the ordinary goods which go to keep up a household, are going to be made any cheaper at his hands. It is absolutely misleading the country for an honourable member to get up and allow it to be inferred that he is going to lighten the burden of taxation, when he knows that he is going to raise practically the same sum from taxation of the people. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -That is not case. Constitution B ill in New South Wales the leader of the Opposition objected to the Braddon clause, because it would compel the raising of more taxation than was necessary for federal purposes.

The honourable member for South Sydney invariably supported the Federal Constitution B ill , but he is in a different position from his leader, who made the "" head and f r o n t "" of his attack upon that measure that it contained a provision in the shape of section 87 which would, willy-nilly, take from the people of New South Wales in particular £ 1 or 25s. per head more than they had had to bear in the past. the honourable was studying the masses ? right honourable member does not now bear I do not think that in mind his prediction of that time ?

Neither can I lose the opportunity of securing some portion, anyhow, of the protectionist policy in which I believe, if it is carried out under fair conditions. But at the sametime I must give my own opinion as to the position taken up by the Government. So far as New South Wales is concerned I contend that the whole attack upon the Constitution B ill , in regard to its financial provisions, rested upon the Braddon clause. I admit that so far as I and a large number of Members of Parliament and citizens of the same way of thinking were concerned, we looked upon the financial clauses of the Bill as comparatively unimportant. What we objected to was the constitutional mistake of giving, inour opinion, too great a power to the smaller communities. But, at the same time, what bulked very largely in the minds of a great portion of our people was the financial aspect of the question; The people of New South Wales were sufficiently afraid of, the financial clauses of the Bill, which necessitated raising four times the amount of revenue that the Federation itself might require; but what would their feelings have been if they had .anticipated that that minimum would be largely exceeded, by the first Federal Ministry1 L venture to say that the vote against the B ill in New South Wales, apart from any question of free trade or protection-merel y in regard to the matter of raising so much moneywould have been materially increased if it had been known that a sum of about a million and a half more than the ""BraddonB l o t "" makes necessary, would be raised. I am prepared to admit that the Ministry have endeavoured, to look at the question from various stand-points. at it from six stand-points ! apparently from the point of view of the interest of the State Treasuries, but I contend that that is not necessarily the interest of the taxpayers of the States, nor is it As a. protectionist it is necessarily the interest of the individual members of the community, who as constituents of the federation, have just as much right to consideration at our hands as have any minority in each or any one of the States. Therefore I contend that all we have to concern ourselves with here, is to ensure that the sections of the Constitution are adhered to, and that we cover our federal expenditure, allowing for a fair margin for expansion, and raising through customs and excise at least four times the amount required. That is the extent to which the Constitution compels usto go, and. certainly that is the utmost extent to which I am prepared to go. Now sir, the people of the States in every instance, I contend, have resources in the shape of direct taxation which can be availed of if the amount returned to 1 them by the Federal' Treasury is not sufficient to give them the amount which they have hitherto received; from customs and excise. While at the present time. I am not prepared to advocate direct taxation for federal purposes, in view of the fact that we have not prepared the people for' any such proposal at this juncture,, yet I say most distinctly that if the States do not utilise the means of direct taxation lying ready at their hands, we shall have to do it. The people of the federation will speak with no uncertain voice if it comesto a question of deciding between excessiverevenue duties through the Custom-house on the one hand, and direct taxation on the other. I should not mind having a little wager on the result. The Federal expenditure for this year, after, allowing for the income from the Post-office for services rendered, will be £1,706,000.

The leader of the Opposition made a great deal of capital out of the Government proposals in regard to the duties on agricultural implements, but I should like to point out that perhaps 80 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used in New South Wales is manufactured within the borders of the Commonwealth. Our strippers, harvesters, ploughs, and harrows are made either in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia. They have hitherto been imported into New South Wales from Victoria and South Australia, in competition with the whole world. I do not anticipate, therefore, that so far as these items are concerned our farmers will be placed in any worse position by the adoption of the Government proposals in that regard than they would be if the market were left free to the importer. So far as I am aware, however, machines, and reapers and binders are not manufactured here, and the increased price would have to be paid on them. I am prepared when in committee to consider that aspect of the question. MrV . L . SOLOMON -AVhat about mining machinery and corrugated iron ? iron is 30s. per ton, and I do not think that is very heavy. Something has been said about the duty on condensed milk. It must be recollected that in the manufacture of condensed milk a certain amount of sugar is used. trated milk, but that keeps for such a short time that it really does not compete with condensed milk in the interior. It is able to compete with condensed milk on the coast, or near its sources of supply only. MrV . L . SOLOMON -There is both sweetened and unsweetened milk. the silence of honourable members on the subject, we are going to carry out the proposals of the Government in regard to the sugar industry, it will be necessary for us to put at least a countervailing duty on the sugar contained in the sweetened portion of condensed milk. That must be conceded even by the free-trade champions in this House, and I suggest it for their consideration. I do not wish to say more than that I thank the Treasurer for the lucidity with No ; I shall not vote which he presented his Budget statement. For myself, I must say I was in the rather novel position of being able to follow the whole idea which the right honourable gentleman was attempting to unfold to the committee. For me, that has been a unique experience so far as Budget statements are concerned. It is, I think, especially gratifying to find that the Treasurer was so clear, in view of the fact that he had such a large number of different matters to refer to, involving the finances of so many different States. I wish to commend a suggestion put forward by the right honourable gentleman, that we should make some effort to compel the financial institutions to keep a certain portion of their reserves in Government notes or Government debentures. I think that is a matter which cannot be too strongly insisted upon. While I admit the right of the Treasurer to make, and the propriety of his making, due inquiry before portable engines, thrashing launching out into a scheme which affects private financial institutions, I still hope that the result of his inquiry will be that the Government will adopt a proposal of that sort, and thus, without injury to the financial institutions themselves, confer a very great benefit upon the Commonwealth as a whole. With regard to the proposal for a sinking fund, I fear any such proposal is very much of a delusion and a snare. The experience, in New South Wales at least, has been that sinking funds have a fatal facility for dematerialising. They seem to disappear in a most mysterious fashion. It is not used in concenthere is a deficit. minence then, but they are not actually in existence. They appear, of course, as an entry. WhatI desire to put forward is that the only way to properly safeguard the expenditure of loan money is for the Ministry first, and the committee afterwards, to take If , as I anticipate from every care that nothing isexpended from loan votes unlesss upon absolutely reproductive works. Of course that means eternal vigilance on the part of members as well as Ministers. It is, perhaps, too much to ask for, in view of the experience of the several Statesi n the matter of loan expenditure ; but having regard to the fact that our friend, the Treasurer, has for some years past in Victoria kept the loan expenditure within reasonable limits, there is hope that the I right honourable gentleman will cany that",22,Motion Of Censure

81,Mr Watson,"They come into prostraight course into federal politics; and we, I hope, shall back him up in it. I can only add that, so far as I am concerned, I admit all the difficulties connected with the framing of this Tariff, and of the financial position generally. I admit that it is a time of strain for Ministers, and for members from all the States, alike. But I do hope that an endeavour will be made to lighten as far as possible the burdens upon the poorer members of the community, and to go no further than the Constitution itself declares that we must go, and that is, four times the amount of ouv prospective expenditure. ing remarks of the honourable ineniber for Bland supply only another assurance that ""hope springs eternal in the human breast."" When the honourable member tells us that he still has hope that loan moneys will be used for none but reproductive works, he is inviting me to hope for something I have never known to occur in the past. While on that point I desire to say that while we continue to borrow money for public works, there is no hope whatever of having that money expended only upon reproductive works, it is only when we commence to construct public works out of our annual revenue that we can exercise that supervision to which they are fairly entitled. W it h the major portion of the remarks of the honourable member for Bland, I find myself in almost complete accord, more particularly when we remember the different and conflicting elements that this Parliament is called upon to reconcile. We are not, as we have been doing in the past in the Parliaments of our respective States, dealing with affairs in which there may be a particular trend of thought or feeling. We have here, for the first time in the history of Australia, to attempt to reconcile the conflicting and divergent elements of the different States, and to harmonise them, not in the interests of one particular State, or one particular set of individuals, but in the best interests of all. When we come to remember, further, that we have sitting in this Parliament honourable members who in some instances represent an area extending over hundreds of thousands of square miles, and in other instances representing electorates around which they could drive comfortably in an afternoon, it is only reasonable to assume that we shall have very divergent views expressed. I mentioned last night, that although in the motion before the Chair we have reasons, so to speak, given for it, in the major portion of this discussion those reasons have been carefully avoided. Only one particular reason has been given' for differing from the policy enunciated by the Government, and it is founded upon this eternal fiscal question. From the many able speeches contributed during the course of the debate, and to which I have listened with extreme pleasure, one would be forced to the conclusion that it was entirely the fiscal policy which any particular State or nation followed, upon which would depend the degree of prosperity of its people. Sweating, according to some, is a condition peculiar only to protected States, and according to others, the direst results follow to the industrial population only under free-trade. I am prepared to admit, at the outset, that no matter what the fiscal policy of a State may be, it is not the only factor in determining the condition of its people. There are many other-and perhaps equally important-factor s in determining the condition of a people. I will go a little further, and say that there are greater opportunities for insuring, to the industrial population of any community, that share of wealth production to which they are justly entitled, under a truly protective policy than under any other fiscal policy with which I am acquainted. We have had volumes of figures showered ' upon us to show the conditions obtaining in the protected nations of Europe, and across the Atlantic, as compared with those obtaining in Great Britain, and the respective conditions obtaining in New South Wales and Victoria, have also been attributed to the fiscal policies of those States. I am not going into the question from the academical stand-point, nor shall I deal with it in the abstract. I shall confine myself to it as it presents itself to my mind from a hard matter-of-fact stand-point, and from personal observation of the major portion of three of the States of the Commonwealth, and of a limited portion of two of the other States. When the leader of the Opposition spoke of the splendid educational effect which the utterances of those who viewed the situation from his standpoint would have upon the benighted protectionists of Victoria, I looked forward to a treat; but the trend of",23,Motion Of Censure
82,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"The concludthe debate has forced me to the conclusion that the educational process will not have to proceed very much further before the pupils become the teachers. I was, to a great extent, in sympathy with what the right honourable member said, in terms such as he alone can employ, about the difficulties and hardships of our pioneers, and of those engaged in the farming, mining, dairying, and other industries of the country. The right honourable and learned member's heart seemed to bleed for them; but I tried to conjure up in my mind the attitude which he would take if he were entrusted with the framing of a policy for the collection of the revenuenecessary for the Commonwealth. If it had fallen to his lot to formulate a Tariff, no more execrated man than he woidd be living in Australia to-day. He has almost convinced himself, and he appears to think that he has convinced the House, that he could raise £9,000,000 of revenue without taxing anybody in particular. There is a general consensus of opinion that about that amount of revenue will be required. £8,900,000. Mr V. member for Bland says that £7,500,000 will be sufficient. information, I am prepared to accept the statements submitted by those upon whom the responsibility rests. Although the leader of the Opposition in his address came very close to this point once or twice,"" he no sooner approached it than he struck off again at a tangent, though, according to his computations, it appears that at least £S,700,000 would be required. The real difference of opinion is not as to the amount of revenue required, or as to the source from which it should be collected, but as to the incidence of the particular duties. .""We are asked, when we say that protective duties do not increase prices, "" W h y then impose protective duties ?"" Before answering that question I will ask another. members prepared to remove the Crimes Act from the statute-book because crime is not prevalent in this country 1"" It is in cumbent upon those who object to protective duties to prove that they increase the cost of the protected article to the consumer. My personal observation shows that they do not. In Victoria we have been able, by means of protection, to establish industries which have been an immense source of wealth to the community, and although we are told of the great progress made by a sister State under free-trade, I ask how is it that, notwithstanding her magnificent resources, she has hitherto been unable to raise sufficient agricultural produce for her own requirements ? To those who desire to know the grounds of the faith that is in me, I would say that the apostle of the free-trade cause made me a protectionist, -and my personal observations, which have been confined to Australia, have confirmed me in the views I hold. In becoming a protectionist, I was a disciple of no less an authority than Adam Smith, who says on page 164 of his book on The Wealth of NationsThe capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country in order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country generally replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals that had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country, and thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it sends out from the residence of Not as much as the merchant a certain value of the commodities, it generally brings back in return at least arc equal value in return of other commodities. L . SOLOMON -The honourable When both are the produce of .domestic industry, it necessarily replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals which had both been employed in supporting productive labour, and Until I have further thereby enables them to continue that support. The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to London and brings backEnglishcom and manufactures to Edinburgh necessarily replaces by every such operation two British capitals, which had both been employed in agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain. The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry replaces too, by every such operation, two distinct capitals, but one of them only is employed in supporting domestic industry. That is the point that caused me to pause, and, upon due consideration, I found that the subsequent paragraph confirmed me in the view I have taken. The capital which sends British goods to Portugal and brings back Portuguese goods to Great Britain, replaces by every such operation only "" Are honourable one British capital. The other is a Portuguese one. Though the returns therefore of the foreign trade of consumption should be as quick as those of the home trade, the capital employed in it will give but one half of the encouragement to the industry or the productive labour of the country. This is the fundamental principle which has governed my attitude on the fiscal question. We have had some, very able expositions of",24,Motion Of Censure
83,Mr Thomson,,25,Motion Of Censure
84,Mr Kennedy,"the subject from the historical and academic points of view from honourable members on both sides of the House, and particularly from the honourable and learned member for Indi last night, and with that phase of the question I do-not prOpose to deal at the present time. I wish to refer fora momentto thedifficulties which confront any honourable member in dealing with the situation. When one considers the time occupied in verifying statements or quotations, and, when, after a considerable amount of research onefindsthat extracts are not in accordance with facts, it leads one to distrust some of the quotations and references which are made. When one finds that statements, made in good faith on the floor of the House, are no sooner given to the public than some of those who are implicated deny at once their accuracy, one is confronted with a very grave difficulty. This phase of the question presented itself to my mind in following the leader of the Opposition in some statements made by him, and the opinions founded thereon, in relation to reaper and binder twine. He told us that one of the Victorian manufacturers was a free-trader; that he was given such information on authority ; and that, under certain conditions, this manufacturer was getting 2d. per lb. more in Victoria for the product of his industry, established by the aid of a protective duty, than he was getting in New South Wales. A t the very first opportunity on which Mr Miller could meet that statement, the 17th October, he addressed this letter to the Age :Mr Beid, in his speech last night, referred to me as being only a protectionist, in consequence of having an interest in a mill for the manufacture of cordage, &c. Allow me to say that I was a member of the first Tariff Beform League that existed in Victoria. This league was formed in Geelong, where I was at that time a resident, about 1860. fornia ; Mr W. Hitchcock, now in London; and the late Mr Elkington, were connected with the same committee. About that time a vacancy occurred in South Grant, and I was appointed to see Mr P. Lalor, who then had a sawmill at Port Melbourne, and find out whether he would stand as a candidate in the protectionist interest. He did so, and was the first protectionist member returned to the Victorian Parliament. Since then I have been and am still a protectionist. Yet we have had the assurance from the right honourable and learned member that this gentleman is a pronounced free-traderMr Beid also states, what is obviously incorrect, that my company sells binder twine at 2d. a lb. less for consumption in New South Wales than in Victoria, although the duty in the latter place was under Id. per lb. Allow me to say that nothing of the kind exists in fact, and I defy Mr .Reid or any one to prove the truth of this wild and injurious statement. There is a complete denial, and in the conflict of such testimony it is very difficult indeed for one to arrive at what are the facts. Ever since reapers and binders have been used in the colonies I have used them to a greater or lesser extent every year, and of course binder twine; even during last season when exceptional conditions prevailed in Victoria-becaus e it must be remembered that the raw material from which this twine is manufactured was dearer last season than it had been for ten or fifteen years owing to the war in the Phillipine Islands-not withstanding the fact that binder twine was subject here to a duty of six-sevenths of a penny per lb., last year-the average farmer of Victoria was able to get the best twine in the world for exactly the same rate as could the average farmer of New South Wales. Is it not amusing when one hears a brother farmer, the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Cameron, making so much of this splendid advantage derived from the Victorian manufacturer selling cheap twine in Tasmania? He makes very much of a little ball of twine, but has no hesitation in swallowing a reaper and binder. That is practically what we have been doing throughout Australia for fourteen years; we have been giving the importers of reapers and binders 100 per cent. turer of reapers and binders. seen invoices. they were not. some Deering binders which were imported some time ago, and they were sold here by the importer. I had on opportunity of finding out exactly what the manufacturer got for them. In the United States as well as in Great Britain, whence there is practically only one kind of goods sent here to any considerable extent, it is sold to the exporter to Australia at exactly the same rate as to the local user of the machine. I know that beyond question. Y e t we have the honourable member for Tasmania making a .very wry face, .indeed, about the ball of twine,.",25,Motion Of Censure

The teams were stopped at all hours, and the stuff was imperfectly tied. But since we have had the advantage of using Victorian twine, I have never met a man who has said that he could find better twine, no matter whence it came, or what price he paid. at a lower rate than imported twine was ever obtained at. The honourable member for Tasmania made one gratifying admission. Speaking as a free-trader, he told us that the Tasmanian farmers, as well as all the other farmers, would benefit by a protective duty. federalist when he had no option, and he was a free-trader. all the time. AVhenI first sought a seat in the State Parliament eight or nine years ago, Federation was looked upon as an abstract question, but I stood practically on that issue. At that time, we had in Victoria, strange to say, federalists, federalists with border duties. The question that-naturally constituents then was this-"" How are we going to get along without the stock tax?"" is one of the things never much benefit anybody. one of those barriers which separate usfrom our brothers across the river, and the sooner it goes the better, because the longer we remain apart the more barriers will be put up and the greater will be the difficulty of our coming together."" I stood in this unique position, that I was one of the few men in public life directly identified with farming, who stood up for the Commonwealth And the only condition I have ever laid down in regard to the federation of these colonies was that the government of the people should be in their own hands. AVe have heard many more which are very hard to follow. I might refer to reaper and binder question, and it is the result of your statement from the chair, sir, that leaflets of this sort are .showered upon honourable because all that is said or interjected in a Mr Kennedy. disorderly way is not fully reported in I speak now as a conthe press. When the honourable member the Vicfor Macquarie was dealing with the question of reapers and binders, and the price of them, he said that reapers and binders I used to buy twine before were being sold some two years ago for £30 a-piece. I interjected innocently that it was some machine they wanted the farmers to experiment with. That was reported in the press, but I also said distinctly that no standard machine was being sold for £ 3 0 . I now repeat that statement, and say further that it is only during this year, for the first time in the history of And we have got it Australia, that a standard reaper and binder has been offered to the public for £30. Last year they cost £ 5 0 each in A^ictoria and New South Wales. that machine now. He also told us that he was a some very useful information bearing upon the fall in the price of that particular I have been a federalist machine. The reduction has not been made because of any diminished cost of production, but because somebody has been looking through the screen, and has thrown some light upon the operations of the importers. I should like to say, at this point, that if but there is one section of this community more than another the members of which are able presented itself to my to gather to themselves and retain the good things of this world it is the importers. We have heard a good deal of talk about the I said, ""AVe must rub it out. It robbery of which the manufacturers have which would been guilty, and we have been told that It is they despoil the people of the proportion of the protective duties which they put into their pocket; but no honourable member has attempted to show the increased cost of a protected article to the consumer in A icT toria.

Is that the way in which we are going to deal with this question t Is it on these minor issues that we aie going to determine the policy of this country ? to derive over a million of money from these minor issues. often surprised me-that the fates of governments and nations have sometimes been determined by small issues, but we should not be carried away by any trifling considerations in this matter. We should confine our attention to issues in which millions are involved. To concern ourselves about starch, as compared with those matters which relate to the employment of thousandsof ourpeople,is to trouble ourminds about matters which are as small as the locks, on the sheep as compared with the fleece in the eyes of the squatter. No one knows that better than the honourable member for Maranoa. My sympathies are with the honourable member when he speaks of the pioneers in the western countiy. We have heard much about the heroism of those who give up their lives on the battle-field, but I venture to say that there is as much silent heroism displayed in the back-blocks of Australia as has been shown on the battlefield. We cannot think too highly of, or admire too much, those men who have lived out their lives in the interior, who have been born and reared in the mountains of New South Wales and Victoria, and in remote places on the continent, and who have grown grey in the work of pioneering without ever having seen the sea, and without ever having, until twenty years ago, seen a railway train. A t the same time, are we to be diverted from the consideration of the vast questions which are presented for our discussion, by such petty issues as those involved in the duties on starch and wax matches ? lSu ridiculous to see a gentleman occupying the position of leader of the Opposition appealing to the House on such trivial matters' W h y ' does he not challenge the Government, or advise the House on questions where millions are involved ? W h y does he not select the larger issues for testing the feeling of the country and of the House-question s affecting the miner or the agriculturist. I could have understood his having taken up an attitude such as was assumed by the honourable member for Perth, who had in view the interests of 100,000 men engaged' in producing wealth which is adding, materially to our national substance, but the right honourable gentleman has playedi to the gallery for thousands, whilst millions, were at stake in other directions.

Coming closer to the question at issue I find myself a good deal in line with the reasoning of the honourable member for North Sydney. That honourable member desired to arrive at a conclusion from the effects of two varying fiscal policies under conditions Then, as nearly as possible resembling each other. I agree with a good deal of what the honourable member said when he compared the conditions prevailing in Victoria with those impression existing in New South Wales. The people of these two States are practically the same people. They have something of the same The document from temperament, enjoy the same climatic conditions, and follow similar pursuits. I agree that one has the advantage of territory, and that the other has the advantage of condensation, a larger proportion of good arable land, and is more easy of development. I do not dispute that statement. I differ from the honourable member, however, in that his statement may possibly convey the impression that Victoria has",28,Motion Of Censure

I do not think that the honourable member intended to convey that impression. :arable land in proportion to its area. a basis common to myself, and those who hold a different opinion as to the effect of the fiscal policy of the two States. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that theconditions prevailinginNew South Wales -and Victoria are very similar, and that there is more arable land in the former State than in the latter. that basis, what do we find ? If a free trade policy is the panacea of all the ills to which we are heir, one would naturally imagine that New South Wales would be in a much more prosperous condition than Victoria, that her agricultural resources would be more highly developed, that her manufactures would be in a more flourishing condition, and that she would have a much greater output in the way of wealth production. There is just one other point concerning which I should like to arrive at some agreement. It has reference to the density of the population. In producing from the land under similar conditions we know that the area of land from which an individual can get a living is clearly defined. I think that the honourable member for North Sydney will agree with me that in Victoria we have practically reached that limitunder our present system of agriculture. intense system is only beginning in Victoria. that has been recognised by those who have cast their eyes on the future of Victoria, The trouble is to educate our agricultural population out of methods which were good enough for our grandfathers. I should like to refer for a moment to an article from what has been termed a protectionist newspaper, quoted by the honourable member for Macquarie, and also, I believe, by the leader of the Opposition, dealing specifically with the condition of agriculture in Victoria. The article said that protection has done a good deal in certain directions for agriculture, but was not able to do all that should be done. That statement cannot be challenged, and if that article had been read in its entirety I am sorry I have not it here it 18 17 2 would have been shown that it advocated that those in authority in this particular State should set themselves to educate the agriculturist to higher ideals and better methods of cultivation, by which produce from the land could be conI desire to start from siderably increased. It was pointed out that by better methods of culture and scientific processes the agriculturist would be able to grow £ 2 or £ 3 worth of produce where he was now growing only £ 1 worth. Starting fairly from that basis, what do we find? Instead of New South Wales having made rapid strides far and away in advance of Starting from Victoria, we find that up to the present, she has not overtaken the latter State. Notwithstanding the limited area we possess, Victoria is considerably ahead in every line of agriculture to which our conditions are suited, and is exporting surplus produce to states of the old world; whereas in a number of industries New South Wales is an importer. New South Wales has an area of 198,848,000 acres, with 46,856,577 acres alienated, 128,034,958 acres leased, and 23,956,465 acres unoccupied; and Victoria has an area of 56,245,760 acres, with 23,245,563 acres alienated, 13,148,701 acres leased, and 19,848,940 acres unoccupied. We have now to deal with the values of some of the staple products, and the amounts produced. I am sorry the honourable member for Robertson is not in the Chamber, because when he was speaking I, in a somewhat disorderly fashion, interjected a question as to what was the wheat production of I do not think so; the 1896. The honourable member, with an assurance apparently born of conviction that what he was saying was absoT h a t is the trouble lutely true, was calmly and deliberately stating that the impetus given to wheat production in New South Wales was brought about by the free-trade policy. But what do we find on investigation ? In 1891 there were in New South Wales 356,666 acres under wheat cultivation, yielding 3,963,668bushels. That was after some 30 or 40 years of a mild policy of free-trade; with all its splendid agricultural re-' sources New South Wales was not able to grow enough wheat for its own requirements. A small fillip was given to wheat growing by the imposition of a duty of 6d. per bushel in 1891. The honourable member for Robertson claimed that a great increase in production arose under an absolute free-trade policy in New South Wales. In 1896 the harvest was put",29,Motion Of Censure

After three years of the splendid benefits of free-trade, from 1896 to 1899, we find that the growers of New South Wales were not able to produce enough for the consumption of that State. In 1899, according to Coghlan, there was a nett import of wheat into New South Wales of 2,726,000 bushels. Y e t we have the honourable member for Robertson, who says he represents a farming district-and I have no reason to doubt his statement-tellin g us of the splendid impetus to agriculture in that portion of New South Wales. the acreage during those years ? figures, there was an acreage of 123,000 in New South Wales; whereas in Victoriai n that year there was an acreage of 196,000 acres, or 70,000 acres more. Victoria is a little bit ahead still. the acreage from 1896 to 1900 ? considerable, but I have not the figures. MrD i2AKIN -There was an increase, but it was less than in the previous five years. other phase of this question to which I should like to call attention-that is in regard to the margin of profit to the producer under the respective policies. I do not for a moment attribute the whole of the impetus in this particular direction to either free-trade or protection, because there were other factors at work, chief amongst which was foot-rot in sheep. It may require a stretch of imagination on the part of those who have not been closely identified with the industry to see any connection between wheat production and foot-rot in sheep; but there is a connection. InRiverina, in 1890, owing to the peculiar climatic conditions prevailing, we found the raising of sheep embarrassed to a considerable extent; and it was thought that wheat production would afford relief in the difficulty. The values then ruling for wheat were also a factor. In 1891, in New South Wales wheat gave a return of £ 2 0s. lOd. per acre ; yet in 1900 it gave a return of £ 1 5s. per acre. After 30 years of free-trade in New South Wales, we find that State in 1899 importing over 2,000,000 bushels of wheat to meet the requirements of the people. Honourable members may endeavour to explain that away as they may, but the fact remains. With greater potentialities, I venture to say, than any other Statei n Australia for agricultural production, New South Wales, after all these years of absolute free-trade, imported wheat for its own requirments; and it simply depends upon climatic conditions,, whether that State will not have to import wheat this year. weather. sufficient attention to the industry, as is done in other States under other conditions,, to raise the food required. It might be W h a t was the increase in said that free-trade caused a less production of milk from cows in New South WalesI n 1861, in round than did protection from cows in Victoria.. It is a most extraordinary coincidence that New South Wales has so neglected her dairying industry that the free-trade cow will not give within 56 gallons as muchmilk as the protectionist cow in VictoriaW h a t was the increase of will give. Of course I do not attribute that to the free-trade policy of the sister It must be pretty State, but to dairying being a neglected industry. But is it not extraordinary that, as I think the honourable member for Illawarra will bear me out, some years ago the The r e is just one dairymen of Victoria went into his district to get an object lesson in dairying? They came back to Victoria, took that lesson to heart, and with what result? That our dairying exports to-day are nine times as great as those of the mother State. ought to be thankful for the teaching we gave. of the pupil becoming better than the tutor. I believe that the object lesson we have given to honourable members opposite will not only bring them up to our standard in everything pertaining to agriculture, but also in respect of their fiscal faith. So much in respect to wheat and dairying. Now, with regard to' other items of agricultural produce, let me take one which is of considerable importanceone of the products for which the sisterState is well adapted.'

I have invariably found that when the gentlemen I refer to have their little axe to grind, they try to get the farmer to turn the handle. I certainly say that the grower of wheat gets no advantage from such a state of things as I have described. Another agricultural product is potatoes. What do we find in this Instead of the mother State, with all her resources, growing enough potatoes for her own requirements, I find that in 1899 she imported 58,384 tons of potatoes, whilst Victoria exported 10,962 tons. Hay is another requirement in all large centres of population. I find that the imports of hay into New South Wales, in 1899, were 131,609 tons, whilst Victoria exported 105,177 tons. How is it that this beneficent policy of free-trade has not given the agriculturists of New South Wales an opportunity to grow enough for the requirements of that State, and all the advantages that follow from production for local consumption 1 Coming to the minor products* I find first of all that in the cultivation of the vine, Victoria is still ahead. There are two particular lines in which the mother State stands out conspicuously. B y the grace of nature her pastoral pursuits return to her double the amount obtained from the same sources in Victoria. This excess is not due to any superiority on the part of New South Wales in the management of these industries, or because of the fiscal policy of the State. It is due entirely to the superior endowments which New South Wales has received from nature. The same remark applies to her mineral resources, for her fiscal policy, of course, has no bearing whatever upon her productions in that direction. In wealth production from minerals, New South Wales is approximating to double the amount derived from that source in Victoria. I do not think that any honourable member, whether he is a protectionist or a free-trader, will lay any particular stress upon the effect of a fiscal policy on the products of these two industries. those industries have to pay for the protective duties. assertion before, but I have shown that the imposition of protective duties does not raise the cost of the articles produced. Coming to our manufactures, what do we find ? It may be a sore point with some honourable members that we have heard a great deal about the mendicant industries of Victoria. I have never seen them, nor have I heard of them before. It is only those who desire to talk to the gallery who put forward such statements. We may have some minor industries for the assistcase 1 ance of which it is not desirable to impose taxation. I am not prepared to say anything in regard to them. As the result of protection, however, we have established many industries of which I am justly proud, and I would do nothing that would injuriously affect them. In order that I may not weary the House* I will give only in round numbers the figures relating to manufactures. I find that in those industries that come into competition with imported products we employ 11,000 people in excess of the number engaged in the same industries in New South Wales. natural to the soil, and not aided materially by any fiscal creed, New South Wales has an excess over Victoria of 8,000 employees. This excess occurs chiefly in the saw-milling, pottery, and such-like industries. Before leaving the subject, I should like to say a word or two in regard to the saw-milling industry. One-would imagine, from some of the cross-firing which took place in the House last night, that this industry is confined to the towns. In New South Wales, with its splendid resources, it is confined exclusively to the forests, but it is true that in Victoria some of the sawmills are connected with the large manufactories in the towns. Much attention has been devoted to the fact that more females are employed in the industries of Victoria than are to be found in the manufactories of New South Wales. Buti n what industries do we employ them ? Are those industries in existence in New South Wales? And if she had them there, could she protect the employees as we protect them in Victoria1 I say unmistakably that she could not do so.

I feel that I have encroached unduly upon the patience of the House, but before resuming my seat I should like to summarize the relative positions of the industries of Victoria and New South Wales. In the pastoral industries New South Wales has an excess of £7,30S,000 over Victoria; whilst in her mining industry she has an excess of £2,502,000 over Victoria. Her forests and fisheries, for which Providence or naturenot her fiscal policy-ar e responsible, show an excess over Victoria of £428,000. these three natural industries New South Wales has greater potentialities and possibilities than we possess. I am not envious of New South Wales's happy position in that respect, because the success and prosperity of the mother State has meant always the prosperity and success of Victoria. Now that we are united it will be so to a still greater extent. The wealth production of these particular industries in New South Wales is £10,238,000 greater than that produced from similar industries in this State; but in those industries on which we have to depend, and which we could establish only under a protective policy, we have an excess of wealth production of £2,539,000. In the dairying and its allied industries depend on protection ? honourable and learned member when he appeals to me in that way, and it is more in sorrow than in anger that I would say a word or two to him. answering. Surely after digesting for eight or ten hours the little pill administered last night by the honourable and learned member for Indi to those of a different faith, he should have assimilated sufficient of it into his political anatomy to know that it is not only by protection through the Customs that we can assist an industry. The honourable and learned member for Indi was at pains to point out that it is by direct grants from the Treasury, as well as by protection through the Customs, that it is possible to assist industries. Let me give the honourable and learned member for Werriwa an illustration. I have in my possession a statement setting forth what has been done by Victoria during the last five years for the protection of the agricultural industry, and more particularly the dairying industry. I find that in bonuses, in technical education, in direct grants, and in the supervision, classification, and inspection of exports from 1896-7 to 1900-1 Victoria expended no less a sum than£223,543 . Isthat not protection? That might be called direct assistance, but we might directly assist the agricultural producers of the country more than we could through the customs. Is it not a splendid illustration of the beneficent effects of protection, either direct or indirect ? £220,000 back out of £30,000,000 of revenue they have contributed. learned member may pitch that little fairy tale to somebody whose imagination is not quite so vivid as mine. The honourable member says that we have taken £30,000,000 from the agriculturalists of Victoria in the last four years; the State does not amount to a great deal more for the time. indicate the amount of money taken from, them. members talk so f requently and so uninterruptedly about somebody putting his hands into some one else's pocket that it seems to me to be a practice familiar to a great many of them.

We know how they walk His query is well worth into them. I have given one illustration, and the separator is another. The thing is legalized robbery. We have had the same cry about protecting the miner. We do give him some protection. As was mentioned by an honourable member last night, in New South Wales the agriculturist is given more protection directly than we give him or have given him in Victoria. I may say that I am sorry I have been drawn into a comparison between the two States, but it has been forced upon me. It is because the illustrations do not bear favourably upon the policy of New South Wales that I have been subjected to so much interruption. However, I rather welcome the interruptions* because they induce me to give a little more evidence as to who is right and who is wrong.

Is that encouraging, or what do honourable members call it ? Is that free-trade?

I say we have done so calmly and deliberately, fully believing that ultimately the whole community would be decidedly advantaged by our action. I should like to give a little parting advice to honourable members opposite who are always preaching about "" rickety industries."" If they refer to Coghlan they will find that they have a few little ""rickety industries, ""as they term them, in New South Wales, to which they hold out a little encouragement in the shape of protective duties. If they will refer to these particular industries, and to the prices of the articles produced by them, I would ask them how much the cost of those articles has been increased by the duties they have imposed. I would ask them, further, to consider and note what their statistician says: That in the case of the particular industries which have received the benefit of a protective duty, the employees have increased, during a certain period, by 40 per cent.; whereas, in the case of the other industries which have had no assistance whatever, the increase in the number of employees has been only 20 per cent. covering that particular learned member must know the industries. Those for which a duty has been imposed in the State he represents are so few and far between that he should have no difficulty in finding out what they are. In order that they may make an examination upon the point, I shall also refer members to a price list quoted by the statistician of New South Wales, giving the range'of prices during the operation of what were known as the Dibbs duties in New South Wales. The items upon which the duties were imposed were butter, cheese, potatoes, maize, bacon, eggs, rice, oatmeal, salt, soap, starch, sugar, and bread, and honourable members can compare the prices ranging over that cycle of years with those for the subsequent period, when the duty was taken off the D o e s that inmajor portion of them, if not all.

There is, to my mind, a useful object lesson to be derived from the discussion that has ensued upon this motion, and I hope it will continue for a little longer. I feel I have had a splendid education during this debate, an education that has confirmed me in the position I have always taken up. W it h regard to the proposals contained in this particular Tariff, as I said at the outset, I do not for a moment hold myself wedded to every line and every proposal in the Tariff. When we hear some of the outcries made about the Tariff, and when we examine into them, what do we find ? We have had, through the press and in this House, specific references made to the way in which the duties will affect the farmer.

What have honourable gentlemen who are screeching for a revenue Tariff to say to that ? There is not a protectionist in this House who would not strike off every one of those duties if it were possible. that duties lower the price to the consumer ? revenue duties increase the price of the articles upon which they are imposed, and no protectionist would from choice impose such duties. But what are we offered by the Opposition ? Mi-. KENNEDY I am not sitting on the opposition benches, and that the Tariff was not introduced by the leader of the Opposition. I could then have denounced for weeks any free-trade Tariff that he might have introduced, and I should have had the people of Australia behind me. The proposals of the Government embody good and sound principles, though a number of them are bad, and nothing will be left undone on my part to get rid of duties injurious to the producers. How would the leader of the Opposition get the £8,500,000 worth of revenue which he has practically admitted is required ? He has told the citizens of the Commonwealth that he would not raise sixpence except by means of customs and excise duties, and he asked us to believe that revenue can be raised without taking money from any one. Surely we are not so insane as to believe such a statement. The honourable member for Wentworth proposes to put duties of 10 per cent, upon all the articles that are now on the free list, amounting to some £6,000,000 worth of imports. Last night the honourable member for Dalley quoted a speech made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, on an occasion when he was denouncing the action of a Government which lost its political life because of proposals similar to those of the honourable member for Wentworth. That Government wanted to reach all the people by means of drag-net duties, and when it went to the country it lost some 30 of its supporters. But do we find any unanimity among honourable members on the opposition benches ? The honourable member for Perth fearlessly expressed the opinion that he was prepared to accept a revenue Tariff, but only as a steppingstone to direct taxation, and a similar opinion was expressed, in an interjection, by the honourable member for Barrier. AVe find both honourable members sitting side by side with the honourable member for AVentworth, who, I believe, would obtain all the necessary revenue from customs and excise duties.

If the leader of the Opposition made that the clear-cut issue, would the honourable member for Illawarra go to his constituents in support of it ? The term "" traitor "" has been applied to the leader of the Government, and we have heard the words "" treachery"" and "" deceit"" used during the debate, although the leader of the Opposition admitted that the Prime Minister stated in his Maitland speech that protection would be the order of the day. How would such words be accepted if applied outside this Chamber? Would not those who used them be made to substantiate them? And is the code of political honour with which we are to begin our parliamentary existence to be lowered below that which regulates private affairs ? Notwithstanding the imperfections of the Government, I am glad to support them, and no one will do more than I shall to assist in getting rid of the difficulties created by the Tariff. I would not assist those who are on the opposition benches to cross to this side of the House, because the leader of the Opposition has behind him honourable members who say that there should be no indirect taxation.

And I am prepared to make considerable sacrifices in the interests of the union, in the interests of harmonizing the conflicting elements in the States; but on the question of principle I am not prepared to give way. Without unduly harassing any industry, or without placing extra charges on any section of the people, it is possible for us to establish on a satisfactory basis industries which will be of benefit to the whole of Australia. give way to no one in my desire to assist those who are engaged in mining, pioneering, and prospecting throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. When one realizes the extent of the territory over which our control ranges, and the sparseness of the population along the coast line, the unlimited area of unpopulated territory we have to develop, one recognises that our responsibilities are great, and that the demands on the Government will be great and perpetual. Consequently we should view with the most serioxis consideration the proposals of the Government in preference to those emanating, for any object whatever, from any other source. So far as in my power lies, I shall try to correct what, to my mind, are the errors or defects in the Tariff proposals. But from those who fight against them in order to get pn to the Treasury benches, we require to have a clear cut issue; and when it comes, let us go back to those who sent us here, and whom we are here to represent, as best we may in the interests of all. Mr G. B . EDWARDS (East Sydney) There is one point on which I cordially agree with the honourable member for Moira. I do not think that either the House or the country can regret the time which has been cocupied by this debate. It is undoubtedly a very important subject we are considering, and I, for one, am prepared to admit that it is surrounded with very mairy difficulties. The discussion has had, I am free to confess, a very educational effect on me. I really did not know that there were so many men, earnest, conscientious, and highly intelligent who take views which I am forced to believe are in contradiction to the highest intellectual discoveries of our civilization. To that extent it has been an education to me to listen to this debate, which I believe ""will ultimately have an educational influence upon the people of this Statei n particular, and upon the Commonwealth as a whole. When the Prime Minister indicated last evening that he hoped that this disdission would be shortened, I thought that his remarks were quite uncalled for. The debate has been conducted without the introduction of any personal feeling, and honourable members on both sides of the House have spoken from the highest public motives, and in a conscientious, honest manner. I do not think, therefore, I that any one inside of the House or outside can regret the time that has necessarily been taken up in discussing the most important subject that Australia has to consider. When I entered into the struggle to secure federation for these States, what we had most to fight against in New South Wales was the feeling of the people against the surrender of their free trade principles, and joining with others under a Tariff which, if it would not be protective, would not at any rate be free-trade in character. We free-traders have been accused by many inside and outside of the House of being insincere, in so far that we cannot secure absolute free-trade in the circumstances under which we have to administer the affairs of this Commonwealth, and although I am a convinced and consistent free-trader, and have been so a l l my life since I was able to think, I am prepared to admit thus early in our federal existence that I do not for one moment-no r could any one, short of an idiot-expec t that a policy of absolute free-trade could be brought about in this Commonwealth. Whilst, however, we abandon the hope of instituting an ideal policy of free-trade, we are not prepared to accept a policy of ideal protection. That is the point where we join issue with honourable members opposite in connection with the proposals now before the House, and I say that in submitting the Government policy for our consideration, the Prime Minister has not fulfilled the promises he made, not only at Maitland, but on subsequent occasions* when his ideas were emphasized and uxpanded. The impression he created in the minds of very many people in New South Wales and throughout the Commonwealth was that we must necessarily have a Tariff of compromise, and that we should have a scientific Tariff, that we should have an Australian national Tariff. In Victoria he said that no one could suppose that we could have such a protective Tariff as that which was then in force in that State. Whether the Prime .Minister is a traitor or not-and he has been defended by the honourable member who last spokeI -say that he has not only not kept his promise, but he has glorious opportunities that is ever likely to be presented to an Australian statesman. The right honourable and learned gentleman, from his commanding position, and owing to the part which he took in the fight for federation, was selected to form the first Federal Ministry. The members of this Ministry were not directly elected by the people, either through selection by this House or by the direct vote of the people, but they were placed in their present positions by the force of circumstances. The Prime Minister admitted that fact, and stated that he was going to give us a national Tariff-that is, a Tariff that would be a compromise. In fighting for this B ill in New South Wales, we free traders have invariably had to enforce the ideas of the right honourable gentleman in order to secure the acceptance of federation by the electors. When the Tariff was put off from time to time after the meeting of Parliament, I was asked by many of my constituents what I thought the Tariff would be. I said"" It will not be a free-trade Tariff, you may depend upon that; but it certainly cannot go .above 15 per cent., otherwise the Prime Minister would break his explicit promise to the people of this Commonwealth, and I do not believe that under such circumstances the House would allow the Ministry to remain in power for a week."" promise. Mr G. B . EDWARDS Minister had properly appreciated the fact that he had been selected for national purposes to start this national machine, he would have adopted a Tariff which both sides of this House-protectionist s and free-traders-coul d have accepted, and we should have had a fair start as a nation with what the mercantile world has been longing for for many years past, a fixed Tariff. This would have enabled the people to get to work and to know what they were doing. From what the Prime Minister intimated in his various speeches, it appeared to me that he had an opportunity of which he intended to take advantage to frame a national Tariff. Our Tariffs have grown up haphazard, as necessity has arisen for raising revenue, for protecting some industry, or for meeting emergencies, and so on, and one Tariff has that differed from another by reason of the cirmissed one of the most cumstances of the State in which it was instituted; but here was an opportunity given to the ablest and most experienced men in Australia to frame a Tariff for a continent -for a new nation. That Tariff might have been laid down on scientific lines, such as would have involved no harm to existing industries or prejudice to the people of the Commonwealth. There has, however, been no attempt on the part of the Government to proceed on scientific lines. The first canon of taxation is that taxes should be so levied that the burden will fall according to the strength of those who have to bear it. But under the proposals that are now before the House, we have instance after instance in which the burden will fall upon the weakest shoulders. We have instance after instance where luxuries and articles used only by those who can command everything they want, are lightly taxed, and in no sense is this a scientific Tariff. Even from a protectionist point of view it fails in this respect, because taxes are put on raw materials and on the machinery of production. The agriculturists are oppressed .by duties on their implements and machinery, and on everything that they consume. cannot give a single instance in which a difference is made in the price of machinery 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am not going He never made any such to follow those honourable members who have quoted statistics. We have had more staI f the Prime tistics quoted in this House during this debate than we shall ever have again I hope, and I cordially agree with the remarks of that honourable member who said that they were simply thrown about from one side of the House to the other without effecting any good purpose. I know something of statistics myself, and I have seen them used on both sides of the House with a twist and a strain that was not altogether honest. I do",37,Motion Of Censure
167,Mr Chapman,,39,Motion Of Censure
168,Mr Chapman,"The honourable membernot think that the case can be at all assisted by any reference to statistics. I have twice had to deal in this House with questions upon which, I had to admit, I possessed no special knowledge, and I was twitted by the Minister for Defence with having slated the DefenceB ill after having acknowledged that I knew little about the subject. To that I plead guilty; but, regarding this measure, I claim-whethe r it may appear modest or not-that I know all that a man wants to know. I know as much probably of what will be the incidence of this taxation as does any man in this House. I have had experience in business, and I know what the effects of this Tariff will be upon business men. I am a manufacturer myself, and likely to be more largely interested in manufactures as the years go o n ; but since I cannot tell in what particular direction my money will be invested, I cannot be accused of being actuated by feelings of self-interest in this matter. I say that the Tariff, whether looked at as a revenue Tariff, as a protectionist Tariff, or as a scientific Tariff, fails in each respect. What is the first principle for which we look in a Tariff? Commercial men in my own State and elsewhere, when I talk to them about Tariff matters, say-""It does not matter very much what the Tariff is, so long as it is settled upon just, sound lines, which are not likely to be disturbed for some years."" That is just where this Tariff fails. I believe that numbers have been counted, and that the Tariff will be carried by this House. But admitting that the phalanx of revenue tariffists in this Chamber are unable to prevent its passage, I say that as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning, so surely will an agitation be commenced at the next election for the repeal of the best portion of it. As a result, we shall have to discuss this matter over and over again till a reasonable compromise, such as I am advocating, has been arrived at. I do not contend for one moment that we ought to have a free-trade Tariff. We cannot obtain the revenue we require by an absolutely free-trade policy. Buti t is possible for us to frame a national Tariff which will lay down the lines of our fiscal taxation in such a way that for some years to come fewpeople will be inclined to call it into quesframed a national Tariff under which, irretion, whilst mercantile and manufacturing interests will go on their way, and begin to make profits. Not only is this Tariff not scientific or revenue producing, but it enters in some respects into matters which are quite new-matter s of taxation which have not been defended in the slightest degree by any single member of this House. It contains, for example, such items as the package rates which in other States were abolished years ago as a relic of barbarism. Then we have a new system of taxation introduced-a t any rate, it is new to mein the nature of "" composite"" rates, under which Ministers have concealed a vast, amount of protection. Honourable members by perusing the Tariff will see that the rate upon certain sorts of boots is so much per dozen pair and so much per cent., but until they work out the calculation they cannot realize to what extent the duty in question is operating as a protective one. Then there is a provision which enables the Government to impose certain duties by proclamation. It is most dangerous to put into the hands of any Government the power of levying a duty at some future time upon any article at their own sweet will. What does it mean ? The time will come when some individual wants to start a particular form of industry. If he does not happen to be friendly with the Government of the day, this power will not be exercised, and duties will not be imposed to enable him to commence operations. But should anyone come along who enjoys their good-will, this provision will immediately be put into operation. I maintain that the power of levying taxation should be in the hands of this House and should never leave it. When Ministers set to work to frame a national Tariff they had a right to pay regard to the fact that we have differences throughout Australia far greater than any single State has had to face, far greater, probably, than any nation in the world has had to contend with-difference s in climate, industrial differences, economic differences. For example, a tax upon blankets in one part of the Commonwealth will be felt by the poor. In northern Queensland, however, it will not affect the poor one iota. A tax upon boots will be felt by the children of Victoria, but in Queensland I have seen many children of well-to-do parents who do not wear boots. These differences serve to show that Ministers should have spective of the varying circumstances of the States, the people would have been equally taxed in accordance with their ability to pay taxation. The problem which Ministers had to face was one of raising a certain amount of revenue, instead of which the problem they have put before themselves and before this House is one of fiscalismof supporting certain industries and of endeavouring to promote particular lines of manufacture in order to help certain people in contradistinction people. That was never the problem with which they were confronted. which they should have attempted solve was how to raise a certain sum of money in such a way as would be equitable, whilst producing the least amount of irritation amongst the people of the Commonwealth. production at all. Australia, if we leave it to the intelligence of the people, will take very good care of itself. Production in Australia is probably greater per head than it is in many other countries of the world, and it will continue to increase relatively to the production of those countries. production ""here. The problem with which we have to deal-and which will have to be dealt with more earnestly as time goes on -is that of the more equitable of wealth amongst the people. are commencing, in our first economic legislation, to lay down a system of taxation under which the poor man will pay as much as the rich man, and which will tend to still further accentuate the difference between the position of the individual who produces the wealth of a country and that of the individual who enjoys it. Any attempt to protect manufacturer's, if carried to its logical conclusion, can result only in protecting about one-twelfth The other eleven-twelfths will have to bear the burden, and it is manifestly unjust to tax eleven-twelfths of our population in order that one-twelfth benefit thus derived. mind is a fraudulent principle. it is possible to point to instances in which manufactures protection,, and to countries ""United States where extraordinary sperity has reigned, and where wealth has been created to a fabulous extent, that does not disprove the statement that protection is a fraudulent principle, because side by side with the creation of this wealth we behold increasing poverty and pauperism and an increasing number of millionaires -people Mr G. B. Edwards. did the kings of old. The fallacy which underlies the contention of some honourable members in this matter can be likened only to a man advising the honourable and learned member for Indi to quit his profession for an hour or two a day and devote his time to the making of his own boots. It from certain other seems to me that a nation cannot become rich by abandoning its natural The problem industries, and devoting its attention to to something which is not natural to it, and which it can pursue only by some system of force or compulsion. We can no more enrich countries, by forcing them through any fiscal legislation, than we It is not a question of can enrich an individual like. the honorThe production of able and learned member for Indi by compelling him to make his own boots. There is an essential difference between the principle of taxation proposed by the Ministry and that suggested by the Opposition. I admit that we cannot have anideal free-trade policy, as others, no doubt, admit that they There is no necessity to foster would not care to go to the full extreme of protection. When the protectionist seeks to derive revenue, and at the same time protect certain industries, his efforts have the distribution effect of diverting into the Treasury a cerYet we tain sum of money. But that is not the end of the transaction. The person protected levies on the consumer'another tax which is frequently the larger of the two, and the burden, thus increased, is always greatest when the taxation is great. We cannot impose high taxation of the kind without increasing the accompanying burden which the people have to bear. If we grant a monopoly, as it were, in a community to manufacture a certain of the people. article, which cannot be imported from abroad except on payment of a duty, the consumer has to pay not only that duty, but also what the manufacturer may charge him may enjoy the on account of the impost. The difference Protection to my between the two principles is that honourable, Although members on the Opposition side of the House would tax the people in order to take have been established by as nearly as possible the £7,500,000 or the like the £8,000,000 required, and would see that the promoney went into the public chest, whereas those on the Ministerial side would tax the community in such a way as to raise £15,000,000 or £20,000,000, in order to place £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 in the Treasury. Those honourable members who fail to see the distinction between the two forms of taxation must be somewhat who wield more influence than deficient in intellectual vision. The policy of commercial freedom will give more stimulus to manufactures than will any system of protection that can be devised. The people of this community, with their intelligence, energy, and proneness to enter into any enterprise which promises profit or affords them an opportunity of getting on in the world, will, if left alone, be absolutely certain to develop the interests of the country in the best directions. It is not in the power of this or any other Parliament to legislate for the whole of the employment and prospects of a people, and tell them how and where they can best use their energies. The people themselves are the best judges of the industries into which they ought to put their money and their labour, and the less they are interfered with the better for the national welfare. It is not the duty of this side of the House to formulate a policy under which revenue for the Commonwealth can be raised. We have been twitted by some honourable members with having objected to the policy of the Government without showing in what way we ourselves would raise the revenue. We have not the command of means, nor the time for solving the problems involved ; that is the duty of the Ministers. The Government, having taken a long time to solve these problems, laid their proposals before the House, and the duty of the Opposition is to say whether the Ministerial policy is the best for the country, or whether it is possible to adopt a better oiie. Although from the beginning there was not the slightest chance of oustingthe Government, the position taken up by the Opposition of presenting a formal motion condemning the Tariff proposals was one which, if we were to be honest and adhere to our principles, we could not shirk. There was a distinct challenge thrown down to us by the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he said:"" This is a protective policy."" We had not been looking for a protective policy, but for a national policy. The gauntlet, however, was thrown down, and the leader of the Opposition would have been wanting in dignity and in consistency to the principles he advocates, if he had not picked up that gauntlet, and let the country see that, at any rate, the Opposition were prepared to fight, even though they knew beforehand they would be defeated. For myself, if I were asked how I would deal with this Tariff-and a member is, suppose, free to say how he would deal with it I should in some respects adopt the view of the honourable member for North Sydney, who is manifestly right when he suggests an increase in the excise on tobacco. I know that the tobacco industry will permit of an increase. I regard that duty as a tax on a luxury, which can be borne by the people much better than can some of the taxes on the necessaries of life, and even on the very food of the poor. The suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney is a wise and sound one, and I hope the House will take it into favorable consideration. the tobacco growing industry. Mr G. B . EDWARDS It is very easy for honourable members to say that such an increase would kill the tobacco growing industry. surely the honourable member will be guided by experience. Mr G. B . EDWARDS I am guided by my experience, which I dare say is as great as that of the honourable member. I know that money is being made in the tobacco industry more largely every year, and tobacco is a luxury on which people can afford to be taxed. As Napoleon said, luxury has a broad back and can stand the weight of taxation. When we are faced with the alternatives of putting a tax on tobacco or of putting a tax on food, blankets, or boots, the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney comes to us as a sound piece of fiscal advice, and I hope it will be taken by honourable members. I am not so clear as to that honourable member's further suggestion that there should be an increase of the excise on beer. I have not had time to go fully into this matter because calculations of this nature involve expert advice, and the obtaining of figures from those who possess full information; and very frequently when an effort is made to get figures from those who are interested in a trade, they are either unobtainable, or we are misled. I am not in a position to check the figures with regard to what would be the probable effect of an increase of the excise on beer, and I am not prepared to advocate such a step. But, if it can be provedthat an extra Id. of excise can be placed on beer without doing any very great harm, I should prefer to see the impost made, and some of the duties taken off the actual necessaries of life, tools of trade, agricultural machinery,",39,Motion Of Censure

I myself have a factory, and have done very well under that policy. AVhileI am speaking on this point, I may allude to what was said by the honourable member for Mernda the other night. He twitted me .about my interest in the jam trade when I said something about starch. I am going to deal with the question of starch later on, but I may say now, -with reference to the jam trade, that I started jam making in New South Wales under the Dibbs Tariff. I had my first 18 months of manufacturing under that Tariff. There was a strong duty upon imported jam at that time. With a quarter of my capital and one-sixth of my turnover, I made more money in one year under the Dibbs Tariff than I have ever made since. That was of no benefit to the consumers of New South Wales and of no benefit to the workers. The only person who benefited was myself. industries generally. In one half of them the big profits which are made by the manufacturers are kept in locked ledgers and covered up in various accounts, so that they may be kept as quiet as possible. There is another section of factories that are started by people who make foolish calculations of the amount of profit they will derive in consequence of the protective system. Industries started under those auspices very frequently come to grief. So that there are two classes of Mr G-. B. Edwards. I do say, though, that it is something in what the honourable member He would lose Mr G. B . EDWARDS If there is any chase our own stock each year. Mr G. B . EDWARDS T h a t would be a very good system to adopt. Another matter which the Treasurer touched upon is of even greater importance than that, namely, that of inducing or compelling the banks to keep their reserves in Commonwealth notes. We have there a source of convenience and a source of profit of which the world has been frightened for many years. There have been South Sea Bubble schemes, and many other failures of the kind, which have made the world somewhat frightened of paper money. In the past we have had Governments which possibly have not been so honest as those we have to-day, and which have not possessed the same soundness and stability But the time for suspicion, and for looking askance at schemes of paper money has gone by. Thinking men That is the cose with artificial now recognize that paper is quite good enough as currency so long as there are honest men and an honest State behind it. If we believe in our Commonwealth there is no reason whatever why we should not, when the Treasurer wants £1,000,000, issue a million £ 1 Commonwealth notes, and pass them out to the people, so long as the money is incontrovertible, and will be received by the Government in shape of taxes.

When we are talking about financial expedients, let me point out that we have had a Ministry sitting for eight or nine months considering the question of a Tariff, cogitation the mountain has brought forth this terrible monster-thi s mouse, or whatever honourable members like to call it. Mr G. B . EDWARDS had no serious attempt on the part of my .right honourable friend the Treasurer, whose care of the public accounts has so distinguished him, and to whom we look with some confidence in these matters, to take advantage of the chance of a lifetime in starting our Commonwealth finance upon a proper footing. The Treasurer has had an opportunity such as only occurs once in the life of a statesman-that of starting our finances on sound lines. The Treasurer admits that the Commonwealth has been started on a basis of extravagance, and I think he will be forced to admit that the Government have not shown any definite financial policy in dealing with the problem. There has been no attempt to restrict what will inevitably be a growing extravagance on the part of these States. One would have thought that the wisest and ablest men we could bring together in the Commonwealth-som e of whom have occupied the. position of Treasurer in their own States-woul d have evolved some scheme for dealing with the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the State Treasuries. We have had no intimation whatever of any such action, but Only a rough-and-ready chandler's shop policy of wanting so much money for the States-of raising so much revenue, and dealing it back again to the States to meet their requirements. I am not a financier myself; I am just a plain business man. But I say there are opportunities for displaying financial policy in connection with these matters, for which we had a right to look from men so gifted as those who occupy the Treasury benches. I think that some ripe and just scheme could have been evolved, by which £1,000,000 that we have to give to New we could have consolidated the debts of South Wales1 these States, and so relieved ourselves of this terrible bother of having to consult the 18 x necessities of the States every time we are called upon to deal with a financial statement for the Commonwealth. making a big present to the bond-holders. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -I notice what the Treasurer said in his Budget statement, but that does not go right to the heart and that after much of the question. I believe that we shall have a serious difficulty staring us in the face every year when the financial statement is made, if we do not pay attention to the growing extravagance of these States. InB u t we have my own State of New South Wales, and I think the other States are in very much the same position, the Government are positively anticipating this surplus which the Commonwealth is giving them. We have a gentleman in New South Wales named O'Sullivan. He would take the whole £9,000,000 if he could geb it. It would be a mere nothing to him. In New South Wales they are increasing the cost of government year by year. Successive Administrations have let the expenditure grow from £8,000,000 to £9,000,000, £10,000,000, £11,000,000 and £12,000,000, and they are still running up the outlay. The Federation will never be able to provide the revenue that that State will require. The same appears to be the case with the local authorities in this State of Victoria. They are looking forward to the surplus they will receive as a means of paying their old-age pensions, to pay off the deficit, and to do all sorts of things. In the meantime no attempt at economy is made in the States. When the people were agitated in favour of federation it was said to them that economies would be effected in the States, and that these would necessarily follow the establishment of the Commonwealth. I preached from that text with all my heart, because I believed as an honest man that that would be done. So long as I can talk I shall preach it. The State Governments administered the affairs of the whole Federation for £7,000,000 odd, and why should not the Commonwealth Government be able to administer their affairs for that sum, plus the £269,000 odd which the Treasurer says he will require for new expenditure t money.",43,Motion Of Censure

EDWARDS Treasurer every praise for the succinct statements which he put before honourable members in delivering his Budget speech. Lik e the honourable member for Bland, I had no trouble in following his exposition of the financial, position, and we know that it is not always the case that a Treasurer makes a statement whbh honourable members can follow. But if the right honourable gentleman had shown the quality for which he so signalised himself in his own State, and had exhibited a rigid determination that the expenditure of the Commonwealth should be cut down, I should have been much better pleased. Although the new expenditure that is provided for does not include the whole amount which will ultimately be expended under that head, and includes items of an extraordinary and non-recurring nature, I think that, on the whole, it is well within the limits that we had a right to expect would be imposed. But the right honourable gentleman should have exerted some control over the growing expenditure in other departments. the increases ? Mr G. B . EDWARDS the Estimates of the Defence department, for example, we find that during the last two or three years they have increased by some hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr G. B . EDWARDS Treasurer has taken a most extraordinary attitude in regard to those Estimates. He admitted that the figures are too high, and, with his character for careful financing and economy, we might have expected that he would have cut down these wretched items against which the economists in all the States have been fighting year after year. But, instead of doing so, he brings them forward and says that he looks to honourable members to assist him in reducing them. Defence department's estimates by hundreds of thousands of pounds. IS x 2 Yes ; but under Mr G. B . EDWARDS Then goodness only knows what would have happened if they had come to us as presented originally to the Treasurer. I can only say that the Treasurer will have my best assistance in cutting them down further, and thus removing the necessity for increased taxation upon the people. I think it is apparent that the Treasurer has over-estimated his I give the expenditure. Of course one speaks with difficulty upon this subject, because the Treasurer has the best advice obtainable. He has the time and opportunity to consult books and to give attention to other matters necessary to enable him to form a correct estimate. He ought to be right in these matters, and we should be able to take his estimates as correct. But having regard to the basis upon which the Treasurer has framed his estimates of expenditure I feel justified in saying that they are inflated. Whilehe complained of the suggestion that he should base his estimates of receipts upon the returns for an abnormal year, we find that he has not hesitated to adopt that course in regard to his estimates of expenditure. The expenditue last year was swollen grossly by excesses in the Defence estimates to which I have referred, and by large excesses in regard to special items, such as the cost of contingents and the festivities in connection with the celebrations. cluded. Mr G. B . EDWARDS The Treasurer H a v e I not stopped bases his estimates of the revenue he is likely to require upon what was admittedly If we take the inflated expenditure of last year.

If one set of figures come out as correctly as that the other set must be pretty well accurate. If the Tariff had been tabled on the 1st June the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue from sugar would have been exceeded, as it will be in future years by £51,800. Treasurer was introducing his financial statement. I was greatly struck by the fact that his estimate of the revenue from the duty on boots and shoes amounted to onty £68,100 for the whole Commonwealth. Unmistakably that revenue is grossly underestimated. The Treasurer ought to get four times as much. W h y is he not going to get it? Simply because he is pursuing a protective policy, and the duty is put on not to get revenue, but to stop it. That is the whole truth. If the Government, in the exercise of all their ability, had put on a poll-tax that old financial expedient and ancient method of taxation -of 2s. per head upon the whole of the people of this Commonwealth, it would have given us a revenue of £400,000, and it would have saved the people of this country another £500,000. advocating that ? Mr G. B . EDWARDS son with the Ministerial proposals, I say it would have been .an abler financial expedient. It would have been the means of getting more revenue, while more lightly taxing the people, if the Government had reverted to that ancient form of taxation, and had imposed a poll-tax of 2s. The working man would have saved many shillings a year by it, and would have been much better off. But the Government in order to protect the boot factories of this State, and some of the other States, but certainly not of New South Wales, where they appear to be able to get along very well without a duty, have put on a duty so high as to restrict imports, and bring down the revenue to be derived from boots and shoes for a population of 4,000,000 to only £68,100. AVe are imposing an increased duty for the protection also of some six or eight factories in Tasmania, where they are progressing very well under a 20 per cent. duty. In this Tariff the Government propose . duties that range from 60 per cent, down to 25 per cent., and yet they only get the revenue I have mentioned, £68,100. This duty upon boots and shoes will be a poll tax upon the working-man of 10s. a year instead of 2s. a year. The Government come down upon him most severely with this boot tax, which, above all others, in this iniquitous Tariff, bears most heavily upon the working classes. When the honourable member, the facts are againsthim. Mr G. B . EDAVARDS I say that the Treasurer, in estimating the revenue, has. taken a wrong view of it, because he refuses to take the figures for last year, although he. has taken last year's returns as the basis for his estimates of expenditure. The right honourable gentleman goes back from last year, because in respect of revenue he saysit was an abnormal year, and was inflated. I point out, however, that the Treasurer goesback also beyond what is a normal rate of increase. It has been establishedI think pretty definitely, in looking over several years-that there is a normal rate of increment in our customs and excise taxation, a. natural growth without any alteration of. duties, of about 4 per cent. I believe the exact percentage is something like 3'83, but 4 per cent, is near enough for purposes of calculation. The revenue of the Commonwealth States in 1899 was. In compari£7,437,596. If we add 4 per cent, to that, it gives us £7,724,600, and the actual revenue received in 1900, which the Treasurer refuses to take as his basis, was£7,766,000, or just £42,000 more than the figure I have stated. If we put 4 per cent, on to that again, I say the Treasurer would receive more than he has anticipated, and not because of any inflation, but in consequence of a normal increase. The Treasurer cannot tell me or any other business, man in this Commonwealth that we are to stand still, and that there is to be no increase in the rate of our progress. Each year will have to be calculated on its own basis. I have taken simply what would be a normal year at the present time. Mr G. B . EDWARDS I am referring to what I consider the erroneous basis adopted by the Treasurer in declining to accept last year's receipts on the ground that they were abnormally high, while, at the same time, in going back to another year he has not added to that year any amount I to represent the normal rate of increment,",47,Motion Of Censure

I must confess that all the standard authorities I have been able to consult have not supplied me with sufficient information to enable me to say whether or not that estimate of £2S,000,000 is correct.

The inI t would be open to grave abuse in many respects* because there can be no doubt that the States would take very good care not to use an article unless it was imported direct by themselves. I object to the enormous amount which the Treasurer has taken off' to leave the taxable sum at £21,000,000. On the items I have pointed out, a man of business intelligence could safely affirm that there would be a difference of £2,000,000 in favour of the taxable imports that would be left to the Treasurer to get revenue upon. He will get £4,119,000 from the customs and excise duties on spirits and narcotics or actually half the total revenue required. I do not think any exception is taken to these items on one side of the House or the other. In fact* we have had from the honourable member for North gestion in which I quite coincide, that the excise on tobacco, and probably the excise on beer, might very well be increased. We might thus bring the revenue from the duties on spirits and narcotics up to £-t,.500,000, and the Treasurer, according to my showing;-and I think my figures will take some amount of disproving-woul d get another £50,000 from sugar. Then, to a very large extent, as was pointed out by several honourable members on the other side, this must be looked upon as a tentative Tariffa Tariff which will certainly come up for reconsideration very shortlyand the Government might, for these reasons, have made the ad valorem duties much lower, because, iu most instances, the high duties will have the effect of decreasing the revenue, particularly in the weaker or necessitous States. If this is not a Victorian Tariff, it certainly is a Victorian .manufacturers' Tariff, and its effect will be to give more protection, though not, perhaps, in so good a way as the protectionists think, in Victoria itself. On most items, it is argued, the duty is lower than it was formerly, but, even so, the duty in many cases is higher, and the Treasurer anticipates that in Victoria there will be a very large surplus over and above what was received from the Tariff in the past.

The Minister for Trade and Customs, in throwing it on the table with a mailed glove, said that ib was a protective Tariff. It is acceptedby the Age as a protective Tariff; it is looked upon all round as a protective Tariff, and it will have the effect anticipated by the Victorian manufacturers. There is no feeling in my heart or mind about differences between States; I have avoided as Sydney a sugr far as I could instituting any comparisons between New South Wales and Victoria, not only because I think that such comparisons are worthless, but also because they are positively injurious in other directions, and we ought to begin, in the first year of the Commonwealth, to look upon ourselves as members of one nation. The effect of the Tariff in Victoria is protective, but what about New South Wales% The result there has been very remarkable. The whole of the people in that State are incensed at the weight of the burden that they will be called upon to bear. Prices have gone up in all directions-price s which we were told that the foreigner would have to pay, but it does not appear that the time will ever come when the foreigner will have to pay. When we go north to Queensland, we find that the new Tariff will prove more protective than the Tariff which was formerly in operation there. Not only will ib keep up the burden of protection, but it will reduce the chance of obtaining revenue by reason of the fact that the Victorian manufacturer will be able to supplant manufactures that have hitherto been imported from across the seas. The effect and the intention of the Tariff in that direction are one. In Tasmania the same results will be brought about. A lower Tariff, a more reasonable Tariff, a compromising Tariff, a national Tariff, would have yielded more ""revenue-in Tasmania,, but a Tariff which is instituted for the protection of the manufacturer-and when I say manufacturer, I mean very largely the Victorian manufacturer-wil l It is no apnot yield revenue in Tasmania, but -will",49,Motion Of Censure

As I said before, some attempt should have been made to solve the difficulties arising out of the shortages in Tasmania and Queensland. Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, in speaking of this Tariff the other day, defended himself from an attack-if made by the right honourable member, Sir Edward Braddon, upon his past history in that State as a free-trader. Although the honourable member delivered a very able speech mostly on that subject, I must confess that to my mind-and this occasion went back to the very early days of my boyhood-he gave no adequate reason why, considering his past political career, he should have supported a Tariff of this sort. The honourable member may talk as he likes about the political necessities that forced him to do this or that or the other, but at no time was he ever more than a revenue tariffist, and I distinctly recollect him throughout the best part of his career as a free-trader. only turned his back, as it were, on the principle of free-trade, but he has set to work to defend the Tariff which have been made in Tasmania on account of their protective He talks of hearing the merry music of the factory bells in Hobart, but if any honourable member went to that city, he would strain his ears a long time before he would hear the merry music of the factory bells there. There are two or three, small factories-boot and, presuming that these have been a success, upon what sort of a Tariff have they been built up ? The duty on boots in Tasmania was 20 per cent., and if , with the limited markets they had there-for have no outlet for their goods beyond the State itself-they lish boot factories with the assistance of a 20 per cent, duty, what need have the Government to which the honourable member belongs to propose duties on boots for the whole of the Commonwealth, from 23 to 60 per cent. be shown honourable has led to the establishment"" of boot factories, under a 20 per cent. Tariff, he had no right to be a party to proposing more Mr O. B. Edwards. than 20 per cent, for the protection of the boot manufacturers in the Commonwealth. If the duty had been fixed at 20 per cent., more revenue would have been produced for the little island State. The honourable member alluded to candle factories, which he said had been established The honourable member for in Tasmania as a result of protection, but there are no candle factories there. What goes on in connection with the manufacture it were an attackof candles there is simply a robbery of the Customs. There are certain institutions there which import what may be called candles in bulk from Holland and Germany, and then melt the material down and make candles out of it. There is not one man my mind on employed in Tasmania in making candles from Australian raw material. There are, however, some successful manufactories in Tasmania, including a cloth and woollen factory. Mr G. B . EDWARDS Yes ; there are three, and they are all successful, but two of them turn out cloth and flannels equal to anything in the whole world. They produce more than they can get rid of in TasHe has not mania, and they send their surplus to New, South Wales, where they have hitherto been able to sell all they can make, in alterations competition with imports from the whole wide world. If that can be done in the incidence. little State of Tasmania, why should we require a high protective Tariff to encourage the making of woollens and cloths on the mainland. In Tasmania they have other industries still more successful than these, namely, those connected with the fruit preserving trade, which are the most flourishing factories-established there; of all. These have succeeded really in spite of the Tariff, which has had no effect on them whatever. Therefore, all that the honourable member had to say in the shape of excuse for his action in inflicting this they iniquitous Tariff on Australia, had no basis at all, because his actions in the past show's have been able to estabthat they could start factories in Tasmania, and carry them on successfully without any protection at a l l ; whilst those which were not successful were not worth starting. On one occasion they started a cigar and cigarvarying ette factory, under an arrangement with If it can Government by which the raw material that in the past the came in free.

195,Mr Piesse,"There are three.tobacco as on the manufactured material, and they cleared the factory out of the the place. Now, what will be the effect of this Tariff on the Commonwealth t I say the effect will be-and I am not talking of the question as one of free-trade and pro tection-to heap the burden of taxation upon the poor. The whole effect of the Tariff from start to finish will be to cast the burden of providing the means of governing this country very largely upon the poor of the Commonwealth. [ know that some honourable members have spoken of this talk about the poor man as claptrap, and as so much talk to our constituents in order to secure our return to this House. I do not think I shall return to this House, but whether I return or not, I hold that there is no claptrap about objecting to a scheme of taxation the heavier burden of which will fall upon the poor, and the lighter burden upon the rich. Claptrap or no claptrap, I shall always advocate a system of taxation different from that. I desire to see a system of taxation under which the people will have to pay in proportion to their ability to pay, and not in inverse proportion. This Tariff imposes taxation upon the women and children and upon the homes of the poor. are already feeling its effects in New South Wales, and it is sad to think that our best statesmanship should produce such effects as are to be seen in New South Wales as the result of the imposition of these duties. In the State of VictoriaI understand that men are given 8s. per week in the form of an old-age pension, but under the Government scheme these men will be given 8s. and will have 2s. taken back in the form of taxation. All the taxation is heaped on to the lower end-on the food and on the common clothing and the boots of the people. This is not clap-trap, but it simply describes what is felt by every poor man in the Commonwealth who has to spend his money to the very best advantage in order to keep himself in reasonable comfort and bring up his family respectably. It is clap-trap to talk of this as clap-trap. It was to be expected in a Tariff framed upon national lines, and in a community in which we are adopting measures every day to improve the conditions of living of the lower orders of society, that in the adjustment of the incidence of taxation the poor would receive some consideration. I have looked at the free list and have endeavoured to pick out the exemptions which are in favour of the poor. The first item that I notice is ""Miners' hats."" But though I have made inquiries at several places, I have so far been unable to discover that there is any distinguishing hat worn by miners throughout Australia. The other items are ""Firemen's helmets, wooden buckets, lead pencils and wooden penholders, spectacles, and cyanide of potassium""-the last named, I presume, to enable a man to poison himself. It reminds me of what Sydney Smith, the witty divine, said about a child being put into a taxed cradle, wrapped in woollens at 20 per cent., fed on foods at 25 per cent., oppressed through life with taxes of 20, 25, and 30 per cent., and finally put into a coffin that was also taxed under the Tariff. We are to be taxed under this Tariff from the cradle to the grave. The burden of this taxation will always fall upon the poorer classes of the community. I have taken the trouble to ascertain what is considered by those who have made careful calculations a fair estimate of what a man with a wife and two children, who earned £ 2 per week, would spend upon different items. As nearly as I can make out, such a man would spend £ 2 0 16s. per year in The women and children rent; bread, meat, fruit, vegetables, milk, fish, butter, books, and other untaxed goods would absorb £ 3 7 ; whilst upon narcotics and stimulants he would probably spend £ 3 . That represents an expenditure out of his earnings of £ 6 0 16s. He would consume 4 cwt. of sugar, which would cost £ 4 , and the duty upon which, at 33 per cent., represents £ 1 6s. 4d. He would also require 28 lbs. of tea, the duty upon which, at 25 per cent., represents 7s. On clothing, drapery, and blankets he would spend £ 2 0 , which, at 20 per cent., means a further contribution to the revenue of £ 4 . H is expenditure upon boots would probably be £ 3 , and upon these, seeing that they are taxed at 50 per cent., he would have to pay £ 1 10s. In groceries he would expend about £ 1 3 , which, at 40 per cent., represents a duty of £ 5 4s. Thus, a man with a wife and two children, would be taxed no less a sum than £ 12 19s. It will, of course, be urged that many of these articles will be produced within the Commonwealth, and that, as a result, the working man will not have to pay this amount. But as far as importations from abroad are concerned he will have to pay it. If we add what lie will probably spend on narcotics and stimulants the sum will be increased to £17, or 17 per cent, of the whole of his income. A man who is in receipt of £1,000 a year -would not, upon msmj items, spend asmuehasbheworkingman-. Tariff it would be impossible for the former to contribute to the revenue more than £50 per annum, which represents only 5 percent, of his income. . That is the difference in bhe taxation imposed by this' Tariff upon the wealthy man and the hard-working skilled mechanic, small farmer, or small tradesman. evidence that protection is being extended to the manufacturer, but no sign that any protection is being given to the working classes who play such a large parb in bhe creation of the wealth of the Commonwealth. nil very well to talk about vested interests in regard to the manufactures established in Victoria and elsewhere. that the vested interests which ought to be protected are those of bhe bone and sinew, the stomachs and brains, of the individual members of the community. been no consideration shown for them. The whole of the protection offered by this Tariff isbestowed upon the manufacturers* most of whom are making money, and will continue to do so whether protective duties are levied or not. If a man has sufficient capital, he will soon discover a way in which to make money out of it. all very well to talk about the sweab and blood which are expended in the clothing factories of London, but sweat and blood are spent in Australia, upon the fringe of our civilization. small selectors our civilization struggling to obtain a livelihood. These people have no protection extended to them under this Tariff. are called upon to bear all the heavy burdens of the proposed taxation. connection I wish to refer to a speech made by the honourable member for Mernda in 1892. He saidIt is clearly our duty and our interest to see that these sources of the supply of our exportable surplus are placed-in the best position to produce effectively and satisfactorily for themselves, because, if the woollen manufacturer feels aggrieved when he cannot make a profit, if the boot and shoe maker comes up to Parliament and whines because trade is not in a paying condition, and wonts an extra percentage of protection, what must we think of the position of the farmer, the miner, and the grazier, who, from the nature of their callings, have got to produce the exportable surplus to which I have referred, and the prices of whose surplus products Mr G. B. Edwards. are not ruled by the prices in the colony, but X>y the prices obtained throughout bhe world? If those who engage iu these greab producing indusfcries are .not placed in a fair position to obUnder this tain ease and comfort of life, which they liave as ranch right to enjoy as those who are engaged in bhe protected manufacturing industries of the colony, how can we expect them to produce that exportable surplus in sufficient abundance to meet pur obligations and provide for all our requirements'? That is the contention of honourable members upon this side of the House. If we heap In line after line there is every bhese taxes upon the people for bhe purpose of benefiting a set of manufacturers who number aboub one-twelfthof the population, the effect must be felt upon the articles we It is export-the -articles out of which we live, and out of which we have created the wealth we now enjoy. Let honourable members exI maintain amine the anomalies of this Tariff.

I maintain bhat It is bhis is nob an equibable system of baxabion at all. Ib is one under which bhe poor bear all the burdens.. Then we come to a new industry, bhat of parasol-making. The honourable member for Bland said thab, I have seen protectionist as he is, he does nob believe in on the outskirts of imposing duties which will not assist in establishing substantialindustries. Whab sorb of an indusbry is bhis 1 Printed books, TheyI notice, are to be admitted free, but a duty of 10 per cent, is to be levied upon paper. In this I should like bo poinb oub that many firms in Australia at the present time print large books, such as direebories, itc. Under this Tariff' ib will pay bhem bo send such work oub of Australia, simply because of the 1,0 per cent, duty which is to be imposed on, the paper. I believe that a newspaper ought to pay the duty. It is not bite raw material of bhe newspaper publisher, bub ib is of bhe maker of books, and bhe Bulletin, which, is bhe ablesb protecbionisb paper in Australia, and "" knocks spots,"" as bhe sporting men say, off the Age, is quite prepared to pay the duty, and also newspaper postage rates. We-have no right to put a duty on raw paper out of which books are made, when we have in our midst an industry of the class I have mentioned. The terms of the motion have been ably defended' by the leader of the Opposition and most of his more immediate supporters, and I have no doubt that if the question were remitted to the people, a vast majority would' be found to be in favour of framing some different system of taxation. To put a tax on the primary industries of the country, and impose a burden on the great masses of the people for 4he benefit of the few, is a system of finance which is neither honest nor reliable. Thehonoraible and learned member for Bendigo the other night gave some reasons for the faith that is in him. I listened very quietly, knowing the honourable and learned member to be a very able man; but I could not discover in what he laid before us anything beyond the old stock arguments which have been used iu defence of protection, but which were dead, and done with long years ago. One of his arguments was used in Spain 300 years ago-namely , that we ought to keep the gold in the country. Not to trespass too much on the time of the House, I would like to read an extract from a speech of the late Sir Henry Parkes, in which he said :With regard to protection, this country (New South Wales) hud for many years jjast been known all over the world as a free-trade country, and he believed we were favourably known because we were free traders. We once lived for a period of eight years under a system of duties very much the same in character as those proposed to be levied by this Customs UntiesB ill . We lived under that system for eight years, .and during, that period we made no progress in our commerce, while the very opposite was the ease when the duties were taken off. The other day a wise alderman at the G-lebe stated that if we only had protection instead of sending the money ont of the country to buy railway plant, we should have the railway plant made in the country, and have the money also. That is the sort of argument which we hear in this House. Sir Henry Parkes continued :A man. so wise as that was above the reach of argument. It never occurred to that alderman to give himself the trouble to examine into the inevitable laws of exchange and international trade which were as exacting and true as the laws of naturei You could not import anything by sending your money out of the counbry as-a rule : though that might be done in a trifling, Isolated case. You could not import without exporting; and your imports were bhe measure of the real' value of your exports. As an illustration he would suppose a man to invest ±'10,000 iu horses for the Indian market. He chartered a ship and took his horses to Bombay, where he sold them at prices which gave him £5,000 profit clear of all expenses. He would not bring back his ship in ballast and his £.15,000 in Indian coin ; but he would purchase rice or sugar, or other produce of Indian labour,, and if he purchased well, his clear profit on his new venfcuxe might be, say, £2,000. So that the complete transaction between Australia and India would be represented by exports -£10,000, imports ±'17,000. Would any one say that the balance of trade was against Australia ? Was it nob clear that Australia would gain £7,000 of additional wealth, by the transaction V That is whab we say. We cannot im"" pose taxes on trade which will not be felt by all the community. So far as we restrict trade, we restrict -development of wealth, and prevent that process by which we are gradually extending the fringe of civilization further and further into the wilds of Australia. The honourable member for Mernda, when speaking bhe other night, used a phrase"" Codlin is your friend, not Short,"" and an honourable member interjected that this was a "" coddling "" Government. A protective Tariff results in nobhing bub unhealthy industries, whereas enterprises which are lef b alone grow up naturally strong and able to sband a succession of storms. When industries have to be supported from the beginning, it is inevitable that, when the pinch comes, they have to ask for more assistance. The curse of the system of protection is that when once it is begun we have to go on giving more and more support, until it becomes so bad that even protectionists have over and over again admitted that if a 45 per cent, duty is not enough, the industries ought to die. That is bhe point at which we must arrive ab some bime or other, and ib is bebter bo make a sband ab the beginning, and refuse to have any bub industries which are healthy, and which will survive under the ordinary laws of commercial transactions. The honourable member for Mernda, in defending the Tariff as regards starch, grew angry about what he considered was a personal imputation on himself. I have taken some parb in ridiculing this duty upon starch ; and I should regret if the honourable number thought bhah I, or any other honourable members on this side of the House, would make any imputations on him in this matter. It is not bhe man we are dealing with, but the principle of levying a duty on starch. The honourable member for Bland, in referring to-night to the duty on matches said that there are industries which are not worth establishing by protection ; and I regard bhe starch industry as one of these. I admit that the honourable member for Mernda has a reputation as an honest, honourable merchant, a reputation which has extended beyond this State, and anything I say must not be construed as an imputation on him. Starch, according to the honourable member's own figures, realizes l-|d. per lb. more in Victoria than it can be obtained for elsewhere. An industry like this is as bad as the match industry ; it employs too few for the price we are paying for its support. The honourable member himself said that about 2 lbs. of starch per head per annum were consumed in the Commonwealth, and, though I think that is a low estimate, I shall adopt it, seeing that the honourable member knows more about the subject than I. If per annum of starch are consumed throughout the Commonwealth, the effect of the duty will be-even admitting that the difference is only Id. per lb., though it is greater -that the people will pay £33,000 a year more for the commodity, while the Government will get a revenue of only £3,733. That is the sort of industry which I contend ought not to be established in our midst. We are better without such industries, and, as I said before, it would bean abler expedient all arguments from that point of view are to put on a poll-tax, and free us from such an impost. Even supposing the foreigner, as the protectionists contend, pays the £3,733, the people of this community are called upon to pay £33,000; establishment of industries which do not employ, perhaps, more than 100 or 200 people, and which give such results as these figures show. Mernda the other day said that there was very little difference between the charges in Victoria and the charges elsewhere for Victorian starch. torian starch is sold in New South Wales at a lower price than in Victoria. in my hand invoices from manufacturers in Victoria, was sold in Echuca at 4^d. per lb., and at Moama at 27s. 6d. per gross. This works out in the following way :Allowing 3s. lOd. for the different kinds of packages used in the trade it makes a difference of a 11-16th of a penny, whether the starch is sold in New South Wales or in Victoria, though it is Victorian made starch in either case. That carries out my contention that in the Commonwealth we shall be paying Id. a lb. more for our starch in order to keep up two Or three factories. Mi: G. B. Edwards. It is businesses like that which this iniquitous Tariff is intended to keep up. people pay no more for their starch than the people in Victoria, and I know, because I live there. Mr G. B . EDWARDS W h a t I say is that they pay less. I have only two or three other points to make before I sit down. I should like to refer to the argument used by some honourable members opposite, that it is the foreigner who pays these duties. Only the other day the Age had an article contending that it is the foreigner who pays the taxes imposed at the Customs-house. If the foreigner pays the taxes, why on earth do the protectionists go in for exemptions at 2 lbs. per head all 1 If the foreigners pay the taxes why not impose a tax on printing paper, which the Age has never given its consent to ? If the foreigner pays the taxes, there should be no exemptions at all. But we know very well that we ourselves pay the taxes, and that is the reason for the exemptions. It is also the reason why the free-traders thoroughly disapprove of this policy. I feel that upon this question I hold a brief for the poor. I know that called '-' clap-trap "" by some honourable members opposite. But, as long as I can "" vent clamour from my throat,"" I will lift up my voice against taxation of this sort, and I condemn the which, from start to finish, is placed upon the poor while the rich are exempt. The question before us is not really one of free trade or protection. I said at starting The honourable member for that we cannot have an ideal free-trade Tariff. But we ought to go as near to free trade as we can, and by doing so we shall get an equitable system of taxation, under But I know that Vicwhich we shall be more likely to have economic and honest government. It is for that I have reason that I support the motion of the leader of the Opposition. Sir, we have which show that starch instituted the practice of opening the proceedings of this House by prayer. I was doubtful about the expediency of that practice when it was proposed, but I must say that it has turned out very well. The prayers are listened to reverently by honourable members. In the prayer with which every day we open the proceedings of this House, we pray to the Author of our being, "" Give us this day our daily bread."" Honourable members are now tryingtoimpose heavy taxes on the bread, on the food of the people. I am aware that it is said that we can",51,Motion Of Censure

Dealing with the subjecb before the House, I do nob inbend bo follow the course which most honourable members have bhought it necessary bo pursue, and bo enber inbo a controversy in relation to free-trade and protection. WhatI do wish to do is to examine one of the indictments laid against the proposals of the Government by bhe leader of the Opposition. I refer particularly bo bhe firsb allegation in the resolution which he has submitted, that the financial and Tariff proposals of the Government wouldPlace the finances of the Commonwealth and the States upon an unsound and extravagant basis. ThenI want slightly to examine the position as it affects my own State and to give some reasons for my own attitude in regard to the motion. While I do not intend to enter upon the subject of protection and free trade, I do not wish it to be thought that I am in a position of hesitation about the principles which should prevail if we were in a position to apply them in their entirety. The discussion has been of a very instructive character, and afber listening to ib pabienbly I have come to the conclusion bhab bhe honors of the debate, so far as its academic character is concerned, lie with the advocates of the cause of free-trade. MrO ' MALLEY The honourable member for Indi knocked them all out! deal of attention to the speech of the honourable and learned member. It was an admirable speech, but there was an element of special pleading in it. However, as I have said, I do not wish to discuss the speeches of honourable members, because if I did I should take up more time than would be fair to the House. I would say, however, that though bhe leader of the Opposition would look with a light heart upon a change of fiscal policy for Australia, and would, if I judge him rightly, seek to do in the Commonwealth what he was able bo do in his own Sbabe, the conditions are albogebher dissimilar. In his own Sbabe he found a community in which manufacturers had not had the support of protection as they have had in a great part of the Commonwealth, and it was much easier to bring about the change which, to his honour, he brought about when he so largely introduced the principle of free-trade in that Stabe. But we must -and I am sure he himself would, if he had bo bring in tariff proposals, consider the sbabe of affairs as it really is. There are indusbries which, righbly or wrongly, have developed under protection, and we could nob, in fairness bo bhose engaged in bhem, and more especially to the workers, who even now are shivering in fear as to what may happen if they are interfered with, at once remove that protection.

Virtually, -therefore, the requirement of the leader of the Opposition is met in the Budget, and the Treasurer is not raising for the actual benefit of the States much more than the revenue of 1899. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Can the honourable and learned member explain that item of arrears ? I see that it has not been provided for If the honourable member turns to page 12 of the Budget papers, he will see that the arrears are deducted. They are set out in detail and charged to each State, and they amount with other expenditure to some £246,000. That is a special deduction from the Budget of this year that ought not to occur again if the Treasurer's estimate is correct. He will not have to carry forward -o r he ought to have revenue in excess if he does-an y debit of that kind in years to come. This year the States are going to receive less on that account by nearly a quarter of a million. That being so, I do not see that we can object to the Budget. As to the means by which this revenue is to be raised, the Treasurer contends that in order to obtain £8,000,000 from customs he must make up a schedule of duties which, under normal conditions-wit h all the goods taxable under it entering into consumption and passing through the Custom-house-woul d yield £8,900,000. The odd £900,000 however is not going to be received. It is simply a floating revenue, which must necessaidly be calculated in order that the Treasurer may make sure of receiving £8,000,000. There may be questions as to the accuracy of this estimate, but I am sure that any man who set himself up as a Treasurer would have to meet the pressing difficulties of the situation by adopting that principle. He would have to make up a schedule of revenue for a much larger amount then he expected to receive for the year. So far as this large excess is concerned I should like to see a change made in the Budget. I should like to see the item treated separately, so that it could be dealt with in years to come, and not left, as honourable members assume it will be, to be treated always as part of the revenue of the Commonwealth. I know that it has been said that it is absolutely necessary to have £8,900,000 as the permanent revenue in order that we may provide for the financial needs of the States, and that even then we shall not get enough for three of the States. In the State of Tasmaniai t is said there will be a deficiency of £135,000. 1 do not like to think that Tasmania's need of another £35,000 means £900,000 additional .taxation for the Commonwealth as.a whole. Ontheother hand, I am pledged to obtain as much customs revenue as it is possible to secure without I cannot explain it, but treating unfairly other parts of the Commonwealth. I am, therefore, bound to support the raising of the largest possible revenue. In regard to the details .of this TariffI shall have much to say. I cannot support duties which are imposed merely to shut out goods. According to my principles of revenue-getting, the duties that go on to the Tariff ought to be l'evenueearning. We must, of course, have regard to the position in which we find ourselves. We must not ruthlessly break down at once the barriers which have sheltered some of the protected industries, and under which they have grown to their present state. I do not think the Treasurer has over-estimated the loss that Tasmania is likely to sus tain under these proposals. If we take a return which has been prepared and laid on the table of the House, showing the consumption of a certain group of articles known as the opimeter group, we shall, find that, as a matter of fact, the Treasurer has very much under-estimated that loss. We shall find that Tasmania will have some £30,000 or £40,000 more to meet, unless we obtain more than is shown by that measurer of revenue. Even if the returns for 1891-the best year that Tasmania has experienced-ar e taken as an index of our possible revenue-earning power, we shall be still £28,000 worse off than the Treasurer has made out in what, in my opinion, are his optimistic calculations. I want to dwell upon this point, because some honourable members seem to think that £35,000 is a small matter. The honourable member for North Sydney said that another £35,000 would make very little difference to us. When I point out that we have the heaviest land tax imposed in Australia, namely, £d. in the £ 1 on the total capital value, with no exemptionwhich represents Id., or even l i d . , on the unimproved capital valueI think honourable members will agree that there is no land tax in Australia equal to the weight of its incidence. New South Wales has a land tax of Id. in the £ 1 on the unimproved",57,Motion Of Censure
203,Mr Piesse,"capital value, but with an exemption up other States, in deference to their duty to to £240, which means the exemption of their own constituents, can see fit to render the greater number of the landed prothem. I am therefore unable, looking at perties of that State.

MrA . C. GROOM -They are not the revenue duties. Sir WILLIAM LYNE member read them out ? MrA . C. GROOM out if it is desired, but to do so I should have to speak for two or three hours, and I do not think the House would care to have a speech of that length inflicted upon it at this juncture. In addition to that, there are at least one-thiid more on exactly the same basis as the duties of the Victorian Tariff; and in the case of the other third the duties are lower than in the Victorian Tariff. I find, therefore, that two-thirds of the duties imposed by the Tariff brought down by the Government are as high, or higher, than the late Victorian Tariff, and, in the case of one-third, they are lower. That cannob be considered as a fair compromise Tariff, or as such a Tariff as the Commonwealth was led to expect from the speech of the Prime Minister at Maitland. To my mind, the Government, in regard to this question of obbaining the revenue we require from the Tariff, has failed to grasp bhe situation altogether. The duties should have been fixed so as not to prevent imports. Ib is necessary that we should have a cerbain amounb of imports. Immediately we impose dubies of more bhan 15 or 16 per cent, we largely stop importations, wibh bhe result that we cannot geb bhe revenue we require. We find that in the Tariff proposed by the Government bhe revenue dubies are down to aboub 10 or 15 per cent., but bhe protective duties run up to 20, 25, and in the case of the fixed duties, bo 30, 40, 50, per cent, and, in facb, we cannob say where bhey end. In some insbances bhey are certainly over 100 per cent. If revenue was the firsb consideration, how came bhe Tariff to be framed in bhis way ? If we bake bhe average of bhe duties put on by bhe Government for bhe purpose of collecting revenue, we find thab ib is not more than 15 per cent, while the protective dubies run from 25 up bo 75 per cent. If ib had been a revenue Tariff we should nob have had bhese high probecbive duties included in ib.

They are axes -and bhe importation of them does not. come to a large amount of value-bra n bags, corn sacks, wool packs, gunny bags,,, brass, copper, tin, lead, canvas, cotton, such as sewing cotton and crotchet cotton, cream separators, on which they propose to put a duty shortly, hessian, timber in the log, needles, blasting powder, rabbit traps, reapers and binders, on which the Government propose to put a duty ab a very early date, milibary rifles, rock salt, saltpetre, saws, sheep shears, scythes, spades, shovels, hoes, rakes, and forks.

They knew that probably they would have a duty on oats, and also a duty on maize, but in any normal year those dubies are of no use bo bhem. They also believed that a large export brade would be developed, that our great natural industries would be encouraged in every way, and that the markets of the world would be opened up bo bhem. They had a righb to expect that the Government would take bhe earliest possible sbeps bo provide the cheapest freighbs, and to send out agents bo bhe markebs of bhe world to see how they could help the paper-cubbing, stone-working, and farmers and producers of this great Commonwealth. Neither in the speech of the Treasurer nor in the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs did we have a single reference to what bhey propose to do for the great producing interests of Australia. All their sympathies were for the manufacburers. I want bo glance at the Tariff for a few minutes to show bhe bogus duties which bhe Governmenb have pub on for the purpose of protecting bhe farmers.

But blankets, under the present Tariff, are taxed all round 20 per cent. duties on floor cloths and mats of 20 per cent., and upon hats and caps, common felt hats, of Is. each and upwards. There is also a duty of 20 per cent, on flannelette, which is used, as we all know, by the poorer classes more than anything else. We also find that tents and tarpaulins, powder and shot, cartridges and guns are taxed. Firearms and ammunition have to be used by the farmer for the purpose of destroying rabbits and other vermin.

That is a new duty, because corrugated iron was free under the old Tariff, and it is a highly protective duty. While I am on this question I should like to say that the other day I consulted with a builder who came to see me with regard to this Tariff when I was in Gippsland.

Going further down the list I find that amongst the articles that are subject to duty are tanks, weighing machines, scales, Then there are boilers and pumps, axles and springs, bolts and nuts, and barbed wire. The Government propose also to put a 10 per cent, duty on bar, rod, and angle iron, and even on axle grease they have placed an impost of 4s. per cwt. Oils are taxed to the extent of 6d. per gallon, and paints at the rate of Is. per cwt. Portland cement is also subject to a highly protective duty ranging from 30 to 40 per cent. We were told that these were to be revenue duties, but when we come to look into them the Government at once stand convicted of having failed to carry out the promise made at Maitland, that the Tariff would be a revenue-producing one first, with protection, if that could be given, afterwards. I do not for a moment say that I am going to throw myself into the arms of those who tell us that they are absolute free-traders. I am nothing of the kind. I am here to keep my election pledges. I explained my position when I spoke during the debate on the address in reply. I then said I had stated on the platform in perhaps the largest agricultural district in the Commonwealth, that the duties which we should probably require would be, on the average, somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent -a t the outside 20 per cent, although in a few instances it might be necessary to give some specially favoured industry as",61,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

Boots are subject to a. duty of anything from 25 to 50 per cent., and cloth for waterproofs, india rubber hose, and harness and whips are also taxed. On express waggons, which are really farmers' vehicles, there is a duty of 35 per cent, and hiore. The duty is fixed at £ 5 each, and, with a 15 per cent, ad valorem duty added, honourable members may work out the percentage for themselves. Then there is a duty on halters of 20 per cent. Even the poor fisherman has to pay 20 per cent, on his nets. There is a duty of Id. per coil on the fuse that is used by the miner. The Government could not even let him be free, for in addition to paying on his fuse he is also subject to a tax on his candles and other things. A duty is placed on reaper and binder twine, and butter boxes are subject to an impost of 3d. each. This is the way in which the Government propose to encourage our great natural industries and to stimulate our export trade. The fixed duties are, I think, the most iniquitous in this Tariff because the actual amount of the duty is covered up under a provision that it shall be reckoned at so much per cubic foot, and that there shall be an ad valorem duty as well. Articles such as china and glass are charged at 6d. and 9d. per cubic foot with an ad valorem duty as well, and if the articles are of the class generally used by the great mass of the people in the Commonwealth it will be found that the duties will run up to 25, or even 75 per cent., and that they will be practically prohibitive. There is not the slightest doubt that if there were a dissolution to-morrow-and I am not afraid of it-and the Government went before the country, they would be swept out of existence.

Ever since this Parliament met and the debate upon the address in reply opened, I am ready to stand by my there has been a great educational work going on in Victoria. The'addresses delivered by honourable members upon the opposition side of the House have had a great educational influence upon the people of this State. The community is grateful for having been told the truth. U p till the time of the opening of this Parliament, the people of Victoria had heard only one side of the fiscal question stated, and that was the prohibitionist side. More especially are they indebted to the free trade labour members, because the working men of Victoria are now beginning to see that after all there is somethingI will not say in free-trade-bu t in moderate protection, in lower duties. They are beginning to realize that in the past they had paid through the nose in order to keep the large manufacturers going. They are getting tired of the operation, and the longer this debate continues the more will the people be educated in favour of the imposition of moderate duties. No wonder that the Government are anxious to close the discussion. MrO ' MALLEY The y do not want to stop it. MrA . C. GROOM All I can say is that the newspaper which is supposed to represent the present Government offers daily comments upon what it terms the useless drivel which has been poured out by honourable members. It states that everything that can be said either for or against the Tariff has been said, and that we ought to close the discussion and get on with business. During this debate we have heard a great many statements in regard to the position of England under free-trade.

But, as a matter of fact, the position of Great Britain to-day is better than it has ever been. country has not advanced during recent years at the same ratio as she progressed when she first adopted a free-trade policy, it is argued that she must be a decaying nation. In like manner, because other nations which have adopted a policy of protection have advanced in greater ratio than has Great Britain during the last few years, it is affirmed that that policy is a wonderful success. But I would point out that when Great Britain started manufacturing she had practically the whole world at her feet. All the markets of the world were open to her. The result was that her manufactures increased by leaps and bounds. Her ships were in every port. She could not supply the demand that existed for her manufactures in foreign countries. The other nations of the world woke up to the advantages which she was deriving from those manufactures. What did they do? They started manufactures of their own. But they were not courageous enough to start them upon a free-trade basis. They had to surround themselves with a Chinese wall of protection. They had to go in absolutely for prohibition. Yet, despite this prohibition, we still find British manufactures in every country in the world, though not, perhaps, to the same extent as they were to be found formerly. The ships of Great Britain aie in every port, and her position to-day is far in advance of that which she has occupied at any time during her career under free-trade. Great Britain has a position of ""splendid isolation""-if I may use the term-amongs t the nations of the world. She is the only nation that has had the pluck to maintain her free-trade policy in spite of the obstacles which have been raised against her. Foreign nations have to pay £80,000,000 annually to Great Britain for the privilege of having their goods carried in her ships. Is that evidence that she is a decaying nation? I cannot understand why honourable members should be continually decrying the mother land--the land from which they sprungfor the purpose of proving that she occupies a position which, in reality, she does not occupy. They should rather be roused to admiration of the situation which she holds in spite of the obstacles which have been raised against her. Notwithstanding all those obstacles she is still the dominant mercantile power of the world. Nobody, can deny that. main so ? MrA . C. GROOM I may tell the honourable member that the commerce of the British Empire is double that of any nation in the world, and half as much again as that of all the rest of the world put together. The honourable member for Gippsland started a fallacy the other night in reference to the imports and exports of Great Britain. The honourable member said-and I have heard the same statement made by other protectionist members of this House-that if a country imported more than it exported it must become insolvent. I will give a case in point in order to show the fallacy of that contention. If 1,000 tons of butter, for instance, is exported from Victoria, it is exported at the price which it is worth in this country-sa y 9d. per lb., or £ 7 5 per ton ; and that is entered in our exports here at £75,000. When the butter reaches England it is sold, we will say, in order to keep within limits, at £100 per ton. That means that the butter, which was worth £75,000 in Victoria, is worth £100,000 in England; and payment for that butter comes back in the shape of imports, which are bought in England at the price which they are worth there, less charges. Whatever charges there may be are taken off the amount, and payment for the butter is remitted here in imports. But these imports are not entered hereas worth£100,000, the price at which they left England, because at least 10 per cent, is added to the value at the Custom-house ; and, therefore, the butter which was exported from Victoria at £75,000 comes back into this country in the shape of goods worth £110,000. MrA . McLEAN The honourable member is avoiding the great point, and he knows it. MrA . C. GROOM I have said that the goods come back, less charges. MrA . McLEAN T h a t is the whole difference. MrA . C. GROOM -But does the honourable member mean to say that the charges amount to more than the difference between the value of the goods when they left Victoria and the value of the goods received in exchange? Is there no profit on the transaction ? The profit comes here and swells our imports ; and, therefore, I say that if,",63,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

For every £ 1 0 0 worth of goods we send away as exports, we get in return imported goods worth at least £ 1 2 5 , and these latter are entered on our books here as imports valued at that amount. This illustration at once does away with the fallacy which we have had advanced time after time by protectionists, that if a country's imports exceed its exports, that country must be going insolvent. protectionists.

224,Mr Wilks,"was a very strong protectionist indeed. We were sent here by the nation, if I may so put it, to create the best fiscal policy possible for the whole of Australia, not for any one State in particular. The whole Commonwealth is looking to us to do that, irrespective of what Government occupies the Ministerial bench. I trust that although I am going to vote against the Government they will listen to reason in committee. I have made up mind to cross the floor upon this question. I do so with very great regret, for the simple reason that all -my friends whom I have known for years are sitting on the Ministerial side of the House. I am sorry indeed to leave bhem, but at this stage we are called upon to fulfil the pledges we made to our constituents. It is the knowledge that I am compelled to do this which leads me to cross bhe floor, and I inbend bo sib on bhe opposite side of the House as soon as a division has been taken. I feel that I could not consistently sit behind the Government when there are such a large number of items in the Tariff which I shall have to use strenuous efforts to get knocked out, or largely reduced.

AVhenI took my seat on the Ministerial side of the House, I was actuated by bwo considerations-bh e personaliby of bhe righb honourable bhe Prime Minister, and his policy. Ab bhat bime I had no pei sonal knowledge of bhe right honourable genbleman. I had never had an opporbuniby of a personal introduction to him. But his name was a household word throughout Australia as that of one who had fought the battle of federation in the front rank, and who had been intrusted by the Governor General with the formation of the first Ministry of bhe Commonwealbh of Australia, and with the task of setting the Commonwealth machine in motion. As bo the Prime Minister's policy, I took as my text a speech which he made ab bhe Town Hall, Melbourne. I had not an opportunity of reading the speech which has been so much referred to by honourable members-the Maitland speech. But I had studied the Argus report of the Prime Minisber's speech in the Melbourne Town Hall. The Prime Minister himself has assured me that he acknowledges that report as absolutely correct, and as being one of the best reporbshe has had. In that speech the right honourable gentleman said bhis :First, it must be recollected that the Federal Tariff must produce a large revenue, and must in one sense be a revenue Tariff. (Applause.) But while.I have any hand in the Government of the Commonweidth. it will not be a revenue Tariff accompanied with destruction, but it will be a Tariff which will prevent destruction. (Loud cheers.) A VoiceA high or low Tariff? Another VoiceA moderate one. some who have been frightfully annoyed with me for only saying half-a-dozen times in every speech that I was a protectionist. They wanted me to say it 100 times. (Laughter.) While the Commonwealth has to raise a large revenue, it will have to have moderate duties. Then a little while afterwards, in the same speech, the right honourable' gentleman saidIt is the belief of myself and my colleagues that you must take care not to destroy that which has been created, and that is-phras e it as you like the continuance of protection upon certain industries worth continning. In addressing the constituents who returned me to this House, I took that speech as my text. In doing so, I believed that I adopting the policy outlined by the Prime Minister. I had some little knowledgeof free-trade tactics in the United States of America, where by the indiscretion of some of the free-trade leaders the cause was set back for years simply because bhey tried to force mabters on too hurriedly. Recognising bhat, I felt that it would be a difficult and dangerous thing bo adopb an altogether free-trade policy. I have heard a great deal of late -years of the the limitation made by John Stuart Mill in regard to one of his doctrines, or rather of an admission he made modifying an opinion which he had previously entertained in regard to free-trade. That modification has always commended itself to me as a fairly reasonable concession, although objectionable in one particular. That objection is the difficulty, once duties are put on for protective purposes, of getting them taken off again.

The Attorney-General was referring to the Victorian honourable member interjectedWhen were these bounties first granted ? torian Parliament in 1889. enough. enough, and they have been discarded. These bounties have ceased, having answered their purposes. It seems to me that if the honourable and learned member recognises that a bounty having served its purpose should cease, he cannot logically contend that a duty which has done so should be continued for all time. It was that statement which reconciled me to the programme of the Government; but I had another reason for believing that that programme would be characterized by moderation and compromise. The Minister for Home Affairs, when speaking in Sydney, is reported to have saidHe knew from experience that the imposition -of revenue duties was in many respects in its incidence protection. In another speech he said thatIn his opinion the duties would range from 10 .to 15 per cent. Reading those statements in connection with the speech of the Prime Minister, I concluded that a very niuch more moderate 'Tariff would have been introduced that which has been put before us. I heard the Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing the Tariff, say that it was -designedly protective, and that it was intended to expand it in the future in the direction of further protection, I felt that I had been under considerable sion as to the intentions of the Government. There are a great many internal of protection throughout the Tariff. hardly necessary to tell us that it was a protective Tariff, dence of all is the deduction of £5,000,000 to allow for the stimulation which will be given to protected Mr Skene. heavy deduction was made because the figures were based upon the returns for an abnormal year, and forvarious other reasons.

I contend that if duties are imposed upon £26,000,000 worth of imports, instead of upon £21,000,000 worth, there will be no necessity for such high average rates.

I do not propose to take up time by dealing with the items of the Tariff, but I desire to say something as to the way in which the primary industries of the country are to be treated. the labour of the agriculturalist is productive of wealth to a State. of the miner in winning from the bowels of the earth the precious metals, which form the base of our mediums of exchange, are second only to those of the agriculturalist. not possible to assist the primary by protective duties, because they are exporting industries, and no duties can help industries the productions of which have to compete in the markets The only possible way to help them would be to diminish the cost of production. far as I can see, not the slightest has been made in that direction 1 ing for agriculture 1 of her agricultural industry, but, like other old nations, she is becoming a net-work of towns. we have here a continent of what is practically virgin soil. We have heard a great deal about our home market, but, after all, it is a very small one, and every industry which has to deal with the production of the soil very soon reaches the export stage. agriculture under the fiscal policy which the honourable member is proposing to support. honourable member. learned member for Bendigo put before the House the other night some calculations which he had worked out in regard to the number of holdings in this country, and the amount of duty payable upon agricultural implements. I think his figures worked out at something like 4s. 6d. per holding. I fail to see that that fact proves anything. It does not prove what I should like to know, namely, the extent to which the agricultural implements upon these holdings are increased in price by the protective Tariff on imported machinery. If he could have shown us that, then we should have had something to work upon. In my opinion a protective duty increases the price of importations of that kind. I fail to grasp it in any other way. Some ten years ago I had an experience which bears out that view. I went to a Melbourne firm to purchase a portable engine. The first question asked was whether it was required for Victoria or All political economists agree that New South Wales. When I inquired the reason for the question, I was told that if The operations the engine was required for New South Wales, the price would be £180, but that if it was for Victoria, the price would be £210. That was ten years ago, but the It is fact stares me in the face that a farmer in industries New South Wales who wants an engine of that kind, would have to pay something like £ 3 0 duty on it, under the present Tariff of 15 per cent.

I have known him as a partner on attempt the share system, and in every relation of life in which one man may know another. is England doI feel that the Tariff, which is now proposed, will be a hindrance to men of very small S h e is losing a great deal means, who are trying to work out a living under the share system. I should like to put a concrete case before the House, in the We have to remember that shape of an experience which I had last year with one of my own tenants. He made a proposal to me that if I would find him half the quantity of phosphate manures required for fertilising 200 acres, which he proposed to put under crop, he would purchase the necessary drill. I consented at once to do so. Under our agreement I was to get one-third of the crop, while he took the remaining two-thirds. After a very careful calculation the farmer could not see his way clear to purchase the drill, I do not follow the the selling price of which in Victoria is The honourable and about £ 3 5 or £ 4 0 . I estimated that the amount of duty pa3 able upon it was about 7 £ 3 . Expert evidence goes to show that seed drilled into the soil with these manures gives a return of at least 4 bushels per acre in excess of the yield obtained from seed sown in the ordinary way. This farmer friend of mine could have bought the drill upon the time-payment principle, and very probably if the price had been a little lower he would have been tempted to secure it. He would thus have been able to put 200 acres under crop under conditions which j>robably would have returned him 4 bushels per acre more than he could secure from the ordinary sowing. But even if by this means he had obtained an increased yield of 2 bushels to the acre,",67,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

245,Mr Skene,"the carriage of the additional grain from the local railway station to the market at the rate of 4Jd. per bushel would have amounted to £ 7 10s. That sum would have gone to the railways of the State, and surely it is just as well to obtain the revenue in that as in any other way. That farmer's chance of purchasing a drill this year is much reduced, because he is a man with a family, and he is taxed upon the whole of the necessaries of life. The food that he and his family eat, and the clothing they wear, are taxed, and therefore he is thrown back further than he would have been under other circumstances. This may seem a very small tiling but it has been said that the advancement of the world depends on the use made of the small balance of advantage over disadvantage. If that appertains to the whole world how much more does it apply to a man who has to struggle hard in order to improve his position ? Some honourable members can hardly realize how much the payment of a small sum in that way affects a farmer. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo expressed the opinion that protection did something for the inventive genius of the country. I think, however, that a great ,deal more harm is done to the country by shutting out the inventive genius of the whole world. Inventive genius is largely imitative and we know perfectly well that the reason why the local manjifacturers of -agricultural implements have been able to do so well is that they have been able to improve upon the imported machines. member would say that the stripper and the harvester are illustrations. machines were invented here. I do not question that there have been some local inventions, but I see no object in shutting out an invention, which a man could use at the present time, for the sake of getting something hereafter, which another person will be able to use when that man is dead. I see no reason why for the sake of a very small and paltry duty we should keep back the best implements from outside. Sir JOHN QUICK not keep them out. duty ? AVe are told on the one hand that the duty will not keep them out, and yet it is said that it will have the effect of protecting local manufacturers. understand that form of reasoning. In my opinion the farmer certainly should be encouraged. Moneyi n the hand of a farmer is not simply a piece of inert matter. It is matter which he may sow, like the seed in the land, to beget a product. It is the concentrated essence of product, and in the hand of the producer it grows into additional wealth. The large fanner conducting large operations should been* couraged to go on and still further increase his operations. I think it was the honourable member for Moira who said that there were 30,000 acres less put under crop this year than last year. honourable member who said so. I find from the Government statistics just published that the area under crop this year is less than the area put under crop last year by no less than 250,000 acres. This is really true with regard especially to wheat areas. It must be remembered that our wheat farmers have to compete in the markets of the world against the best appliances in the world in the ""United States, and against cheap labour in the Argentine, in India and in Russia, and also against the advantage of a shorter distance of carriage. Seeing that the fanner has to compete against all these advantages in favour of other countries, it is certainly in the interests of the country that he should be encouraged by diminishing the cost of production. I know of many, farmers, and particularly one I suppose the honourable farmer in a large way alongside my own holding, who have given up farming altogether.

254,Mr Skene :,"I am simply stating a factand one is tbe difficulty of getting agricultural labour. The honourable member for Moira must feel that in his district also, as it would be a very extraordinary thing that it should occur in one part of the country and not in another. Whatever may be given to the farmer or the worker in the way of concession now, and in the way of cheaper necessaries of life, is a penny saved, and a penny saved is a penny gained. A penny now will he a great deal more to them than a very much larger amount in prospective, and which they may never realize at all. I feel that the cost of living under the altered conditions imposed by this Tariff will be so much increased that it will affect the poorer people throughout the Commonwealth. The effect will be practically to raise the starvation line. There is here, unfortunately, as there is in all countries, a submerged fraction of the population, and if we increase the cost of living to the poorer classes of the people we increase that submerged fraction, and in this case I believe it will be increased to a very considerable degree. that also. says, a revenue Tariff will do that also. I came into the Chamber this afternoon when the honourable member for Bland was speaking, and I follow very much the lines the honourable member took. I feel that the danger we are running now is that of raising too much money through the Customs to hand back to the States. I should prefer, as the honourable member for Bland was suggesting when I entered the Chamber today, that the States should be left to raise the amount required to meet any deficiency themselves rather than that too much should be collected, because the whole of the money received will be spent. In this connection I should like to make a quotation from Professor Ely's book on Taxationi n American States and Cities. I value the book particularly on account of an -incident which I may relate. When I got it as far back as 1891 I drew the attention of the late Mr Service to it, and lent it to him for a few days. He sent it back to me with a note saying that he thought so much of it that he intended te invest in one for himself. That should be a recommendation of the book to Victorians. socialist. very sound upon this point, I think. authorities upon economics in the world. competent to enter deeply into the subject. I desire to put before the House some statements from the book which bear upon the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bland to-day, that it might be necessary that there should be some sort of taxation by the States to make up any deficiency arising from an insufficient collection of revenue through customs duties. Whether the taxation is made through the State Parliament Or through the Federal Parliament it is all the same. The first part of this book is devoted to a discussion of taxation as it is, and the second to taxation as it ought to be. The one idea running through it is, that there should be what. Professor E l y calls a "" central variable tax."" He is, of course, referring to America, where they have the same federal form of Government as our own, with. State Governments and systems of local A revenue Tariff will do government such as we have. He saysOne tax ought not to be considered by itself, As the honourable member but all the taxes our Federal State, county, and local taxes must be considered as forming one system of taxation, and the nim of the legislature should be so to adjust the burdens of taxation, that each one may pay a fair share of all the tuxes to which he is liable. Federal taxes, for example, bear with undue severity on the poorer and. middle classes, and as we are American citizens as well as citizens of our various Commonwealths, and as States are not independent in matters of taxation, it is but fair that State and local taxes should aim to lighten the burdens of the poorer and middle classes, somewhat, as compared with the wealthier classes. He then goes on to sayIt is not extremely difficult to frame a system of taxation for American States and their cities, and the other political units, into which they aresub-divided, if the various principles which have been elaborated, be kept in mind. A f t e r m a k in g a number of suggestions, and saying that for local government a real estate tax should be the central tax, he savs thisThe taxes which have already been described are suitable for local purposes. The central tax of a proper system of local taxation is the tax on real estate; and this will vary from year to yearaecoitling to the needs of the public Treasury. An estimate must first be made of the revenues from productive property and local enterprises, from natural monopolies, from liquor licences, and from all other sources, and then a tax rate on Ely is a real estate, justhigh enough to make up what is still lacking, should be fixed.

This should vary from year to year, according to the needs of the State Government, and its rate should be calculated after the revenues from other sources has been estimated. It occurs to me that some system of that sort will eventually have to be adopted. would be a most extravagant system to collect, haphazard as it were, a n immense surplus, as we might accidentally do, and hand it over to the States to be squandered practically, and have one f o u r t h left, w h i ch we probably woul d not know what to do with. remember.

Now, gentlemen, I hope I have made my posibion clear. IfI have anything to do with it, I want to be generous to Mr. Burton, because of the good work he has done in the cause of federation, and because I feel, after having followed him through the greatest part, if not the whole, of the Convention debates, that It he has been consistent throughout, moderate, and willing to act in a spirit of compromise. I think Sir William Lyne is also determined to act in a broad spirit. W it h regard to the others, I reserve my judgment.

262,Mr Skene,"the line of argument which has been so frequently indulged in by comparing the various industries of the sister States of Victoria and New South Wales, by contrasting the rates of wages, the hours of labour, the number of operatives, males or females, employed in the different factories, or, in fact, any of those statistics of which, I feel sure, most honourable members are pretty well sick. I cannot see that any good result can come out of an analytical comparison of statistics such as I have mentioned. To attempt to compare two States having entirely different circumstances, different areas, different climates, different natural resources, and different rainfalls, seems to me to be a fruitless way of endeavouring to convince honourable members on either side of the benefits of either free-trade or protection. I think this State versus State comparison. In our addresses to the electors, both before the advent of federation and since, we have all prophesied that it would mean the abolition of those imaginary border lines which have marred the map of Australia, and fondly imagined that even the jealousies, the trade rivalries, which had operated in different States, would speedily be forgotten. It is not for us to consider what the resulb has been either to Victoria under a protectionist policy during the past few years or to New Soubh Wales under a free-trade policy. I think it has been amply demonstrated by both sides of the House that, whabever may have been bhe varying causes of bhe prosperity of New South Wales, the fact remains that under a free trade policy her industries have increased and her prosperity is at least equal to that of any other Statei n the union ; and, in saying this, I consider that I am extremely moderate. AVe have had numerous comparisons of the progress of different f ree-brade countries with that of probecbionisb counbries of the older world. AVe have had day after day from the probecbionisb side of bhe House whab I may berm the most unpatriotic allusions bo bhe British Empire. Judging from the remarks of some honourable members, notably the honourable member for Gippsland, England is a decaying power. The fact that America, wibh her vasb areas, wibh her resources almost untried, has made more rapid strides in the last quarter of a century than Great Britain, that was at the time America started pretty well at the apex of her commercial power, has been looked upon as a positive proof that the policy of free-trade in the case of Great Britain has been a failure. I suggested the other night, by interjection, an argument for which I was indebted to the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. It is a very cogent argument bo use, when bwo nations such as America and Great Britain are compared, namely, that we can hardly expect the growth of a fully matured man to be as rapid as that of a growing lad. To compare Great Britain, fully matured as she was in her commerce, and her industries, and her power, almost 'before America, wibh all her vasb resources, had sbarbed, is, bo my mind, somewhat absurd. The idea that England is gradually decaying has been so drummed inbo my ears during bhis debate that I . have been strongly reminded of an incident that it is nearly time to drop occurred in one of the back blocks gold-field townships of Western Australia, where I had the pleasure of staying at a little shanty some few years ago. There were some other travellers there, including a few teamsters, who were having a high time. One of these was a musical genbleman, who kepb bhe one song going for 24 if nob for 36 hours, and the refrain of his song was very much in this style""Hingland, dear old Hingland, is a-goin' down the ill . "" I believed as much bhen in the truth of this gentleman's musical statement as I now believe in the correctness of the conclusions of honourable members on the Minisberial side of the House as to the decadence of the British Empire when compared wibh Germany and America. The Minister for Defence, when speaking a night or two ago, seemed to regard the question before the House as one merely of personal ambition, and as the outcome of a struggle for office on the part of the leader of the Opposition and bhose associabed wibh him. I do nob bhink ib is anybhing of the kind. That is certainly nob the aspect from which I view the matber. It is of little consequence to me or to the State which I represent whether the Prime Minister or the leader of the Opposition leads the Government of this Commonwealth. What is desired, however, by the State of South Australia and the whole of the smaller States is the adoption of a policy which will best serve the interests of the whole Commonwealth, and advance the prosperity and happiness of the. people. When I was addressing the electors a few days after bhe Prime Minister had spoken at Maitland and declared the policy of the Government, I told the people distinctly that if the somewhat veiled remarks of the Prime Minister as to revenue without destruction meant that he was going for a probecbionisb Tariff which would seek bo bolster up the industries in the Sbabe of Victoria at the expense of the people of the Commonwealth,, the Barton Ministry would have ray opposition. necessary for me to explain my abbitude beyond saying bhab, after having mosb care fully analyzed this Tariff, I regard ib as one designed more in the inberesbs of bhe Victorian manufacturers purpose of obtaining revenue or for the advancement of the industries of other Stabes. It has been poinbed out that this Tariff is lacking in consideration for the three greatest industries of Australia, which have made the various Stabes whab bhey are, and to which we must look in the future for our advancement agricultural, and pastoral industries. general trend of the Prime speech me to believe that these industries would be so utterly neglecbed as bhey have been in connection with the framing of this Tariff. having utbered those notable words as to revenue wibhoub desbrucbion, and as to his intention industry of New South Wales, told the people ab Maibland that he did not intend ;to do any juggling with figures or words, I did nob know whab was in his mind. One thing, however, I did call to at once, and thab was bhat the cry about protecting the sugar industry of New South Wales was rather far-febched when ib was considered bhab bhe sugar of Queensland-the Wales would free the moment federation was accomplished. . liberty of pointing out that the Prime Minister, when estimating the amount of money that bhe Commonwealbh would require, had nob said one word aboub bhe immense amounb of duby which bhe Federation would lose by bhe opening up of bhe markets of the obher Sbabes to the sugar of Queensland. I then pointed out that in the year 1898 the exports of sugar from Queensland to the adjoining Stabes amounbed to 116,260 bons, of which New Soubh Wales received 28,992 Mr V. L. Solomon. bons; Vicboria, 49,000 tons ; Soubh Australia, 15,000 tons ; and bhe obher Sbabes, bhe balance of 3,000 odd bons j and that bhe duby which would be losb bo these various Sbabes bhrough bhis sugar being permitted to come in free would amount to something between £480,000 and £500,000. I then sought and the speech was published throughout the length and breadth of South Australia-to learn from Therefore it is not the Government how this £500,000 was bo be made up. I endeavoured bo elicib whebher bhere was an intention on the parb of the Ministry to impose an excise duby.

263,Mr Jose Ph Cook,"Ought not the honorhonorable members who have vacated their seats, I am not at all troubled about their absence. Indeed, it rather pleases me, because I shall probably avoid some very stupid interjections, which might have led me away from the ordinary current of my thoughts. The burden of this Tariff falls upon the shoulders of the miners, agriculturalists, workers, and pastoralists, who receive no protection in return. The honourable member for Moira said that the mining industry had received assistance to the extent of some £200,000 or £300,000, and that agriculture had been aided by the construction of roads and railways. As a matter of fact these industries have contributed to the wealth of the various States, in proportion to the amount which has been expended in their encouragement, one hundred fold more than have any of the fostered industries in Victoria. Let us take the case of the mining industry. I find that mining machinery is taxed 15 per cent., and in some instances 20 per cent. When one considers that last year, in Western Australia alone, over £300,000 worth of mining machinery was imported, morethanhalf of which came from the older countries of the world, much of which was patented machinery that could not be made in Australia, and when one remembers that the timber which it is necessary to use upon these mines, the galvanized iron for their sheds, battery buildings, and so forth, as well as the timber employed in the BrokenH ill mines, are to be heavily taxed, one may safely conclude that the mining industry is not being assisted, but is more likely to beinjured by the Tariff which has been placed before us. good timber in Western Australia. MrV . L . SOLOMON similar interjection from the Minister for Defence the other night. I do not know whether he has ever visited BrokenH ill , but if he had seen the timber employed in the mines there, he would know that what is necessary for the open-set system in the Barrier mines is not either Jarrah or Kauri, but Oregon. The explanation given by the whole of the leading experts of BrokenH ill , is that both Jarrah and K a u ri are too short in the grain and too hard to work, and that their tensile strength is not nearly so great as is that of Oregon. Isi t at all likely, if Jarrah and Kauri could be used, that the BrokenH ill companies would spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in importing Oregon from great distances for their mining work 1 handle, I think. MrV . L . SOLOMON On the other hand, the smaller Jarrah for some purposes would be more suitable than is Oregon. But in the underground work of the BrokenH ill mines, where at times there is a strain of thousands of tons of overhanging rock, it is necessary to have a timber which will not crack, but which will give a little, and the experts of BrokenH ill , who have been mining all their lives, are, I think, better qualified to give an opinion as to the relative value of the timbers mentioned than is the Minister for Defence. > member say that Oregon is stronger than Jarrah? MrV . L . SOLOMON -Undoubtedl y it is for that purpose. Sir JOHN FORREST -Is it stronger when it is of the same size ? MrV . L . SOLOMON It is stronger than Jarrah when used for the purposes I have mentioned. As I have already explained, the grain of the Oregon is longer, and its tensile strength is greater. Alsoi t will give a little, whereas, the Jarrah snaps. I find also that duties are placed upon dynamite, fuse, and nails, whilst there is a heavy impost upon galvanized iron. What is still worse, there is a large duty upon iron tanks, altogether regardless of whether they are imported full or empty. The Minister for Defence knows that there are thousands of 400 gallon tanks in use throughout Western Australia. They are almost as indispensible to the miner there as are his flour and meat. A 400 gallon tank has to I heard a pay a duty of 12s. irrespective of whether it is full or empty. Throughout the length and breadth of Western Australia, these tanks during the last seven or eight years have been the salvation of the country. They are not used for conserving water, because the rainfall in the back country is so infrequent and light that they are utterly useless in this respect, but they are required for condensing purposes. These tanks, which cost only a few pounds, can, with the little skill possessed by most miners, be converted, with the aid of a few hundred feet of iron for tubes, into plant for the purpose of condensing fresh water. One may see, not tens or hundreds, but thousands of such tanks throughout the",73,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

266,Sir John Forrest,"Does the honorableback country, providing tens of thousands of people with fresh water condensed from the salt water of the lakes. Without these tanks in Western Australia back-country prospecting would be impossible, and it is a matter of surprise, or should be, that the Minister for Defence, who knows that country so well, should have permitted such a ridiculous and tyrannical duty to be placed on what is an absolute necessary for the working miner. Then we have to consider the position of the ordinary father of a family, or of the ordinary housewife, under this Tariff. It has been pointed out before that blankets, rugs, woollens, flannels, and flannelettes are subject to a duty of 20 per cent., while silks, velvets, ribbons, trimmings, flowers, and embroideries, which are all articles of luxury used by the more wealthy portion of the community, and which have hitherto been taxed 25 per cent., 27£ per cent., and even more in some States, have been let off with 15 per cent. Yet that is what the Ministry call a revenue Tariff. Flannelette forms an important item in the daily and weekly expense of poor families, and yet this commodity is, along with blankets, taxed to the extent of 20 per cent., whilst silk is admitted on payment of a duty of 15 percent. In the Government we have honourable gentlemen who have hitherto posed as leading democrats and friends of the working classes, and who owe their present position, honourable as it is, to the loyalty of those classes. The Minister for Trade and Customs defended the duties I have mentioned, pointing out that blankets are a finished article, and, as such, are charged at the rate of 20 per cent., but that silk, which may be worth 6s., 15s., or 1 Is. a yard, is an unfinished article, which has to be sent to the dressmaker in order to be made up. In like manner flannelette, which is sold retail in many instances at from 2£d. to 4d. a yard, and, perhaps, at even less, and in poorer families, is such a valuable article MrV . L . SOLOMON that flannelette is more dangerous than any my children had to be brought up on this other dress material. We hear of as many food at Port Darwin, and I do not believe fire accidents in connection with muslin that for £ 1 a quart it would have been posor cotton dresses as in connection with sible to obtain, within a radius of 100 miles, flannelette underclothing. ribbons, trimmings, and other similar Other families in the back-blocks of northern articles, which cannot be produced in the Australia have had the same experience. State, but are manufactured in Paris and Berlin, and which could well be charged a stiff revenue duty, are to be admitted at 15 per cent., while the absolute necessaries of the poorer classes are charged 20 per cent. I observe that dungaree, calico, moleskins, and shirtings are allowed to come in at the same rate as silk, feathers, flowers, and trimmings. The Government put a 25 per cent, duty on patent medicines. If there is one class of commodity more than another that is a boon, not only to the poorer classes of people in the city, but to those who have to go into the bush and on the mining fields, very often many miles from medical assistance, in order to develop the industries of this vast continent, it is that of patent medicines. I admit that many of the drugs and, medicines which are advertised are absolutely useless ; but, on the other hand, there are patent medicines, such as chlorodyne, the old fashioned pills, and Friar's balsam, which are absolutely invaluable to the poorer classes of people who are out of the reach of medical aid. Now we come to the increased duties on pretty well all the necessaries of life, such as tea, starch, kerosene, candles, coffee, cocoa, currants, raisins, oatmeal, and tinned milk. I intend to deal with several of these items presently, and give a few particulars regarding them. As to the last item of tinned milk, it was rather amusing to see honourable members On the other side, who, perhaps, have never been in all their lives more than a few hundred yards away from a cow, and who hardly know what condensed milk is, laughing when honourable members on the Opposition side talked of the injustice of placing a heavy duty on this commodity. Out of the 100,000 residents of the gold-fields of AVestern Australia, the 7,000 or 8,000 people in the northern portion of Australia, and the 10,000 on the northern coast line of Australia at various ports been Brisbane and Cape York, I do not believe there is 1 per cent, who see a glass or a cup of cow's milk from one year's end to the other. Preserved milk is an invaluable article of food to people in those outI do not think side districts. I know that at least one of Embroideries, a pint of fresh milk for the child's use.",74,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From
267,Mr Pijjssb,"And a dangerous article.This tax on preserved milk is undoubtedly protective, and meant to foster an industry which ought to be able to fight its own way ; and I regard it as a most unfair impost. Many of these imposts I have alluded to, that will press so hardly on certain classes of our community, whose interests are worthy of consideration, will not bring in much to the revenue, and it is clear that they are not intended to be revenue-producing. For instance, we find that the tanks, which are so invaluable to the miners and prospectors in the back-blocks of Western Australia, and which are used for condensing purposes, are being taxed to the extent of 12s. per 400 gallon tank. Not only are they used by miners, but every occupant of a shearer's hut, and every little cocky farmer who is trying to make a start, is glad to obtain one of these 400 gallon tanks, with which he can conserve a little rain water. The duty of 12s. is estimated to bring in a revenue of £7,560. When we come to starch, we find that the total duty estimated to be received, is £3,733. Candles are expected to yield £ 3 , 4 6 8 ; preserved milk, £28,750 ; and kerosene and the other things I have mentioned bring in various sums. I will allude to them presently. Meanwhile, as I have mentioned starch, I will deal with that question, and with the amount that the duty on it is expected to realize. The honourable member for Mernda, in discussing the Government policy, expressly referred to the starch duty. With tears in his voice, the honourable member told us that he was in a most delicate position in regard to this question, and that he had never been placed in such a delicate position during his political career. I am rather surprised at that statement, seeing that the starch duty has been imposed for years in Victoria, and that during that period the honourable member for Mernda was a member of the State House. There is no excuse for a member of this House or of a State Parliament being placed in a delicate position concerning a matter which he feels affects his own pocket. It is easy for him to be out of the House when the vote is taken on the article in which he is interested. That is a course which I have seen adopted in the State Parliament, of which I was a member, in regard to a similar tiling, and that course could easily have been adopted by the honourable member, by means of which he would have avoided placing himself in a somewhat delicate position. I 18z am not surprised, however, at the honourable member feeling the position somewhat acutely. The importation of starch into the Commonwealth, judging from the importations into the States, will amount roughly to about 7,000,000 lbs. weight. A duty of Id. per lb. on this would amount to a trifle over £29,000. But with the duty of 2d. per lb., which the Government haveput on starch, they only expect to receive a sum of £3,733. In the years 1S97-8, there was a total weight of 7,500,000 lbs. of starch imported into the various States of the Commonwealth. Of this quantity, considerably more than half was imported into New South Wales, where it paid noduty. A small portion was imported' into Tasmania, where it paid only Id. perlb., and into Western Australia, where starch paid a duty of 15 per cent., £2,500 worth was imported. One half of this 7,000,000 lbs. of imported starch yielded, in one. year, duty to the amount of £15,653. It is now estimatedI presume on a similar basis of 7,000,000 lbs. of starch being imported into the Commonwealth-that the duty of 2d. a lb. will yield £3,733,. although a duty of Id. per lb. would yield £29,000. I should like to ask therepresentatives of the Government whether that is one of their revenue-producing duties, or whether it is designed merely as a protective duty to the starch industry 1 It appears to me that there can be no otheranswer than one to that question. I anticipate that the answer of the Government will be"" Although we have put this duty on starch, we have a counter-balancing duty on rice. If the starch duty will only yield one-seventh of what the duty of Id. perlb. would yield, we put a duty on rice-' which is expected to bring in £142,000.""' How much of this rice is to be used iu themanufacture of starch 1 Approximately, the rice imported into the Commonwealth during a given year amounted to about 23,000 tons. Out of that the quantity used for the manufacture of starch is only 7,000,000 lbs. So that we find that for the purpose of encouraging this industry the Government not only put a prohibitory duty on starch, but they also charge the consumers of the whole of this 23,000 tons of rice a duty very much in excess of what should be charged upon such an every day article of diet, which is certainly appreciated by the poorer classesan article which should rather have been selected to be let in free as a necessary of life. The Treasurer, in speaking about some of these lines, told us that he recognises since framing the Tariff that mistakes have been made in regard to several lines, and that there is no doubt that on re-consideration some of those lines might be altered. I do not quite know what the Treasurer meant. If he meant that, seeing the feeling of some of the protectionists, that the duties were not nearly high enough, the Government would, if sufficient pressure were brought to bear, consent to still further increases in a protective direction, I may safely utter a word of warning that any such attempt will do much to prolong the debate upon this question if the Tariff gets into committee. desire to see the Tariff agreed to in any form this side of Christmas, they will turn a veiy deaf ear to the blandishments of some of their interested protectionist supporters who may ask them for alterations in the direction indicated. I come now to deal with the manner in which some of the items on the Tariff will press upon the consumers of the Commonwealth. I have received information from South Australian importers as to the effect of the duties upon crockery. Several of the speakers who have preceded me have pointed out that the composite duty upon the commoner kinds of crockery of 15 per cent, and so much per foot measurement will press most hardly upon the poorer classes of the community. The firm of Flint and Sons, a large importing firm in South Australia, has written me a long letter on the Subject, which I shall not read to honourable members, because I do not wish to lengthen my remarks more than I deem absolutely necessary, though the question is too important for honourable members to refrain from expressing their opinions upon it, and I am only the second representative of South Australia who has spoken. Messrs. Flint and Sons point out that in connection with an invoice of brownware, the cheapest form of crockery, valued at under £ 3 0 the 15 per cent, duty amounted to £ 4 9s. 6d., while the measurement charge of 6d. per foot brought the total charges up to £ 1 0 9s. 6d., or over 50 per cent, of the first cost. voice in Sydney last week, where the duties amounted to 89£ per cent. MrV . L . SOLOMON In another invoice for printed earthenware of the commonest class, 29 crates cost £19 6 7s., and the duty of 6d. per foot measurement and 15 per cent, amounted to 37^ per cent, upon that sum. The firm say that in some instances these composite duties will increase the price of the cheaper kinds of glass and crockeryware by nearly 90 per cent., so that I think that I may safely say that .this is one of the duties which we can deal with in committee with a view to paring it down rather than to increasing it. Coming to the duties upon timber, I find that the importation of timber into the Commonwealth in 1900 was valued at £1,492,000. A great deal of that timber was used in the BrokenH ill mines. The Mining Standard, in dealing If the Government have any with the manner in which the duties will affect mining operations, points out that the mineral production of Tasmania for the last year for which the figures were'available was £2,539,000; of Western Autstralia, £6,346,000; of Queensland, £ 3 , 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 ; of Victoria, £3,579,000; of New South Wales, £6,081,000; and of South Australia, £516,000; or a total of £22,201,000; which is 18 per cent, of the aggregate wealth produced in all the States, or 23 per cent, of the wealth produced in the Commonwealth by the primary industries. To say that an industry such as the mining industry should be hampered at the inception of federation is to ask honourable members to sanction a course which I do not think they will sanction. I had intended to give the number of hands employed in the timber industry of the States, but as the hour is late, and I have more important matters to deal with, I shall leave that matter for others of a more analytical turn of mind. I now come to another matter which has already been alluded to by some honourable members. Under the new Tariff it is proposed to put a duty of Is. 6d. per lb. on unmanufactured tobacco, and an excise duty of Is. per lb. when it is manufactured locally, the whole duty upon tobacco locally manufactured from imported leaf being 2s. 6d. per lb., as against a duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. upon the imported manufactured article; the duty in most of the States having hitherto been 3s. per lb. The difference does not appear to be very much, but I had occasion some months ago, in dealing' with the federal question, to challenge the figures of the tobacco manufacturers of South Australia. Since this Tariff was placed upon the table, I have",75,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From
268,Mr Josephcook,"I saw a similar inascertained from Sydney and Melbourne the position of the tobacco manufacturers in New South ""Wales and Victoria. I have here figures showing the importation of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco in both States during the years 1897 to 1900 inclusive. honourable members by giving the whole of the figures. the quantity of manufactured tobacco imported into Victoria was 988,113 lbs., while in 1900 it was 745,027 lbs., or a decrease in the manufactured article, on which a duty of 3s. per lb. was paid, of 243,086 lbs. The quantity of manufactured tobacco imported into New South Walesi n 1897 was 924,707 lbs., while in 1900 it decreased to 858,053 lbs., showing a falling off of 66,664 lbs. During this period there was a decrease of over 300,000 lbs. in the quantity of manufactured tobacco imported into these two States. The decrease of duty paid in Victoria amounted to £36,463, and in New South Wales to £9,998. As a contrast to this picture, which shows the devery close to them. There are two very crease that took place under Tariffs very similar to the Tariff now proposed, let us take the importations of leaf tobacco. In 1897 the importations into Victoria of leaf tobacco for local manufacture totalled 640,433 lbs., while in 1900 they amounted to 1,328,707 lbs., or an increase of 688,274 lbs. factured leaf into New South Walesi n 1897 totalled 683,928 lbs., and in 1900 they amounted to 1,181,668 lbs. wrong. MrV . L . SOLOMON tained them from a reliable source, and have had them checked. The fact that they have been taken from different statistical returns may be responsible for some slight variation, but practically, I am quoting the absolute figures. The duty paid on the manufactured leaf in Victoria, during the period under review, showed an increase of £34,415, while the increased duty in New South Wales was £24,887. To put these figures into a condensed form, we find that in 1900, as compared with 1897, there was a decrease in the importations of manufactured tobacco into New South Wales and Victoria amounting to 309,000 lbs., and a decrease of £46,000 in the duty paid upon it. On the other hand, there was an increase of 1,186,014 lbs., in the tobacco 18 Z 2 manufactured from imported leaf, with an increase of duty amounting only to £59,302. If the imported leaf had been barred altogether from New South Wales and Victoria during these years, and only the imported manufactured tobacco introduced, I shall not weary the additional revenue of those two States them would have amounted to £365,034. One In 1897 would imagine that in framing a Tariff like this the Minister for Trade and Customs and those assisting him would have looked more closely into such astounding figures. When we see a decrease on the manufactured article, which pay a duty to such a large extent, and an increase of over 1,000,000 lbs. in the unmanufactured article, which pays the lower grade of duty, the thought is suggested at once that some tremendous profits must be made in the manufacture of this tobacco locally, or else the State is losing a very large amount of revenue. What is the real position? It is difficult to obtain absolute details of the manufacture of tobacco here, but I think I can come large tobacco manufactories : one in New South Wales and the other in Victoria. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the output of tobacco from these factories averages about 100,000 lbs. per month. The tobacco leaf imported into the State costs from lOd. to Is. per lb. The darker The importations of the unmanutobacco, of which four-fifths certainly is manufactured in both States, costs lOd. per lb. in its raw state; the lighter tobacco which comes from Virginia, costs Is. per lb. The duty in one of the States has been Is. 9d. per lb. The cost of manufacture, includI have obing the cost of labels, boxes, and so forth, approximates 5d. per lb., and the profit that has been made by these tobacco factories is according to the computation of two or three gentlemen with whom I have consulted on this question, no less than from lOd. to Is. per lb. on every pound turned out by them. In proof of that statement. I am informed on good authority that this tobacco, whenmanufactured and exported in bond to Tasmania in large quantities, is invoiced at Is. 3d. per lb., which shows that the estimate of lOd. per lb., first cost, and 5d. per lb. for manufacturing charges and casing, is a fairly good one. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Therefore , I hold that it is fair to tax the monopoly represented by these two large firms, in each of which not more than £100,000 is",77,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From
269,Mr Kingston,I think those figures are,78,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From
270,Mr Henrywillis,"It is a monopoly.-invested, and in which each of them has been making as much as from £50,000 to £60,000 per annum out of the consumers of these two States. This shows that when we go to work to encourage our industries there should be a limit to that encouragement. When I point out that in spite of the countervailing excise that we are allowing in the Tariff as introduced, the difference between unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco is Is. per lb., and that the cost of manufacture is at the outside not more than 5d. per lb., I think. I may safely say that the. suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney -and endorsed by the honourable member for South Sydney-that tobacco could well stand a slight increase in excise is a good one. Perhaps a better course still would be to lower the import duty upon the manufactured article, and that would bring into the Commonwealth, in the way of increased revenue, anything from £25,000 to £50,000 a year, and still give magnificent profits to those who have invested their money in machinery for carrying on this industry. -ber suggest a particular amount ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -The honourable member for North Sydney suggested that, instead of the excise of Is., it might be as well that it should be raised to Is. 3d. reduce the import duty by 3d. ? MrV . L . SOLOMON in reference to the manufacture of tobacco from colonial leaf. The amount manufactured in Victoria in 1897 was 406,315 lbs.; and in 1900 the quantity was 220,253 lbs., The quantity manufactured in New South AValesi n 1897 was 1,188,808 lbs.; and in. 1900 it was 996,998 lbs., or a decrease even there of 191,810 lbs. So that, in spite of these duties placed upon imported manufactured tobacco, the use of colonial leaf has been gradually decreasing. mediately the last Tariffi n New South Wales was brought in, because the excise on tobacco made from colonial leaf was too high in proportion to that made from the imported leaf. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The excise on tobacco made from the local leaf in New South Wales was Is. 3d. 9d. per lb. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Even with the difference of 9d.only, I have already shownand I challenge those interested in the trade to prove my figures wrong, if they can-that the cost of manufacture does not exceed 5d. per lb. MrV . L . SOLOMON Yes ; they are supplied to me by various persons in the trade, and I have compared them pretty closely. It is impossible, of course, to get at the books of the two manufacturers to whom I have referred, but they are turning out, approximately, 100,000 lbs. weight of tobacco each month, and are each making something like £50,000 a year out of the transaction. These figures were given to me by a gentleman for whose opinions I have the highest respect, and I am sure they are approximately correct. I say at once that we have here an opportunity to take some of the duties off the necessaries of life that have been mentioned, and to make up the difference by a slight extra duty to be collected, not from the pockets of the Consumer, but from the pockets of these gentlemen who are making such magnificent fortunes out of the tobacco manufacturing industry. In contradistinction, I find that the profit from cigarette manufacture has been reduced by this proposed Tariff to the vanishing point. The figures given to me show that although the manufacture of cigarettes by machinery may still I have figures be profitably conducted, the manufacture of hand-made cigarettes, in which hundreds of operatives are employed, cannot be conducted at a profit. In one factory I went through a little time ago in A ic7 or a decrease of 286,062 lbs. toria, there were 300 girls employed. They sit down all the time, and apparently have easy and clean work to do. They are employed merely in the rolling and papering of cigarette tobacco, and not in the preparation of the tobacco itself. Manufacturers who have machinery are still left a fair margin of profit, but those who have T h a t occurred imto resort to hand labour in the manufacture of cigarettes, and who are largely employing labour, can only continue the manufacture at a loss of something like 6d. or 7d. per 1,000. going to distinguish between machine made and hand made cigarettes for the purpose of excise ? That cannot be done very well. MrV . L . SOLOMON I admit it is a difficult problem to deal with.",78,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

276,Mr Kingston,"I s the honourable membernot differentiate between the two. If we increased the duties the machine man would get it all. MrV . L . SOLOMON difficulty, but the position as stated to me is that in the manufacture of cigarettes by hand the total cost, including the cost of the tobacco, is something like 18s. Id. per thousand, and the selling price is something like 17s. 6d. per thousand, leaving a loss of 7d. per thousand. I believe that machine made cigarettes will still show a profit, and it becomes a question as to whether, if we are going to encourage local production at all in these things, it would not be fair to differentiate, where the employment of a large amount of labour is involved. We might either do that, or fix the duty at such a rate as would give the revenue the benefit of the whole. We have no more right to play into the hands of those who can afford this machinery, as against those employing labour in an industry, to the detriment of our revenue in the case of cigarettes, than we have in the case of any other article. I shall be glad to hand the Minister the figures supplied to me, so that he may be enabled to take any steps that seem necessary. the duty on tea, I have received a communication from several firms interested in the the trade, and a somewhat lengthy letter from the leading importers in South Australia, pointing out that the composite duty on tea proposed by the Tariff is one which would be most difficult to work and most unsatisfactory in its working. ber intend to say anything about cigars, because that is also a troublesome matter t ' lar in reference to cigars, but I am not sufficiently posted upon the matter. I do not care to use figures without having thoroughly verified them. I suppose the Minister has received a similar circular to that which comes to me from leading cigar importers in Sydney. It seems to me to be a kind of pitched battle between the importers and the local manufacturers. I am not in possession of sufficient information to enable me to deal with the subject in an intelligent way, or even to make up my mind as to what the rights of the question really are. On the question of the duties upon tea, the circular I have from the leading importers of South Australia, including Messrs. Gilbert Wood, Fowlers' Limited, Berry and Co., Gollin and Co., and Wilkinson and Co. first of all refers to the fact that the duty would be a difficult one I admit the to collect, and they add that it will lead to under-valuation. Of course, that argument is used in reference to everything upon which an ad valorem duty is placed, but there is no doubt that undervaluation will take place in the case of tea, and it will be a most difficult thing to check it. I have had something to do with groceries during my life, and I know it is a most difficult thing to get even an expert to tell the value of tea. We would have constant trouble with the customs-constan t disputes between experts as to the value of the tea. duce the invoices ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -The invoice value of tea of course would be taken as a guide, but the Customs might say"" This tea was imported from China, where they are pretty good at invoices, or from Ceylon. We shall not accept their value. We shall get the opinion of an expert,"" and he might say"" This tea instead of being invoiced at 4d. should have been invoiced at Now, with regard to 9d."" It is represented, and there is very little doubt, that it would lead to a poorer class of tea being imported. Again, some of the importers are very strong on the point that an additional duty of a penny a lb. upon the teas done up in given weight packets, is an impost to which they should not be submitted. They put it that these teas, fresh from the pickings, are packed in one or two pound packets, lined with thin sheet-lead and stout paper to keep the aroma of the tea intact almost straight from MrV . L . SOLOMON I have a circuthe plantation to the home of the consumer. There is a very great deal in that argument. Any one who has had anything to do with the business knows that tea if it is left open for a very short time loses a very great deal of its strength and delicate flavour. These are the points which are. put by the various importers, and even though it may mean a little difference in the revenue which is estimated at £382,312I would rather have a distinct duty of 3d. per lb., which, taking the nearest estimate I can get as to consumption, would yield £340,000. A duty of that kind would be more satisfactory to importers as well as consumers. In committee I shall endeavour to alter this line in that direction, and to do away with",79,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From

279,Mr Hbnbvwillis,"W ill they not prothat somewhat unjustifiable impost of an extra Id. a pound because the tea is put up in packets for its preservation. I am not certain whether a memorial on this question was presented to the Government by the honourable member for South Australia, Sir Langdon Bonython. I had a letter from the firm of D . and J . Fowler, of Adelaide, in which they sayThe tea trade are conccrued.at the fixed and ad valorem duties proposed by the Government on tea entering this State, and they have addressed a letter to the Treasurer, Sir George Turner, which we are sending through Sir Langdon Bonython. We enclose you a copy of the petition herewith, and also a copy of a letter which we have written which will enable you to follow the position, and anything which you may be ablo to do to forward our object will be esteemed. I do not know that I have put the case as strongly as it can be put from the view of the leading firms in South Australia. Their letter runs as follows :We, the undersigned, representing the whole of the tea trade in the State of South Australia, desire hereby to lay before you the reasons following herein for the opinions we hold in regard to the Tariff proposals of the federal Government in reference to tea. Our opinion is to the effect that the old system of a fixed rate of duty is preferto throw the consumption on to the commoner able to the proposals of the Government, which we are unanimously of opinion would prove to be eminently unsatisfactory and difficult of application in practical working. Wo boso this view on the considerations following, viz. ;-1 . That the fixed rate of duty is the almost universal system throughout the Empire, if not the world, and it is a system which works satisfactorily and economically. The application of the principle of ad valorem would, on the other hand, involve a vast amount of detailed work in passing entries, since an original import invoice generally covers a number of lines of varying cost. Under a fixed duty one entry would be passed for £he whole shipment, whereas ten or twenty entries might be necessary under the Government proposals. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable argument, that where a firm imports 100 halfchests of four or five different values-for instance, 20 invoiced at 4Jd., 20 at 6d., 20 at 8d., and so on-a n enormous number of customs entries will require to be passed. Then they go on to sayThat large quantities of tea have been and are sold in bond by the importers, and it would be impossible to continue this practice (which has for long prevailed, to the great convenience and advantage of the trade) if the ad valorem principle is applied. The seller would not for obvious reasons disclose his costs before a sale was completed. And the buyer would not operate unless ho could determine beforehand the duty-paid cost of the tea to him, for he might buy a tea at lOd. in bond, and find he had to pay an ad valorem duty on a cost of Is. Mr V. L. Solomon. That seems to be a very reasonable point. It would be absurd for a business man to have to produce his invoice to the person to' whom he was intending to sell a parcel of tea. He would not only divulge what the teahad cost him, but he would have to produce his invoice before he could estimate what expense would be involved in clearing the tea from bond. It is further pointed outThat in the case of consignments, and assuming unscrupulous parties involved, a wide door is opened to fraud. Tea is different from most other articles, in that it is one to which only a highly-trained expert could apply a check upon the invoiced value; mid even here, because the tea may havo depreciated since shipment, the check is by no means beyond criticism. That a .very large export trade from this State to Western Australia has been carried on for many years in blended teas, which would be practically killed by the Government proposals. Whether packed in bond or free store, it would be almost impossible-and , if possible, only at enormous cost in detail work-to ascertain the basis for an ad valorem tax, consequent upon the great variety in values and proportions of the tens so blended. That the consumption of high-class teas is a very small proportion of the whole, and the effect of the proposed ad valorem duties will simply further reduce this proportion. The whole tendency of an ad valorem rate would be and cheaper teas. Debate adjourned. House adjourned at 11.15 p.m.",80,William Lyne Those Are The Preventing A Large Number Of Imports From
