I had a consultation with the Government Printer in my office this morning. He assured me, in the first place, that there was no delay so far as the printing office was concerned. As to the suggestion that men from outside might be employed to carry out this particular work, it must be remembered that it is of a confidential character. It would be most improper if any idea of a tentative or a preliminary proposal, dr one n regard to f Avhich there might be a printer's error, were communicated to the public until everything is finally adjustedTherefore, the work is confidential as well as very important, and the Government Printer thinks it right, and very properly too, to keep at this work as many of his regular hands as he can accommodate in the office. In this connection, _ the question of overtime was mentioned, and Mr Brain assured me that the only overtime lately worked has been volved These have now been completed, and no more overtime wort will be necessary in regard to them. this. I must express my sympathy with the compositors who are out of employment. I can appreciate their case, as I have p been in the same position myself, as a compositor. I have told the Government Printer, and he quite sympathizes with the idea, that he should avoid overtime on every possible occasion. general rule, is not good either for the employer or the employee. nises that, and Mr Brain assures me that he has not for a considerable time sanctioned it, except in the case of the printing of the re-classification scheme. asked him to obtain the services of extra hands, whenever they can be secured, for any extra work that is required. that when Parliament is sitting, the Printer receives instructions from Mr Speaker, or from Ministers through Mr Speaker, that certain work must be completed by the next morning. In such cases there is no time to call in outside men to cope with the extra pressure. The work must be done immediately, and it may not be possible to find suitable men on the spur of the moment. the times, therefore, overtime cannot be avoided in the ordinary working of the office. My instructions to the Government Printer are -and . I am sure that he is anxious to carry them out-to minimize to the fullest possible extent the overtime worked in the office.

I. would ask, further, whether, in view of the very aggravating nature of the duty and the infinitesimal amount of revenue derived, it is worthwhile to proceed with its collection? able to give the particulars required offhand, and I would ask the honourable and learned member to give notice of his question.

27,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"Imajority. Some time prior to that a Committee of Parliament was appointed to investigate the matter of the proposed reform of our coinage. That body devoted considerable time to its work, and eventually . submitted a report to the House. a resolution which was carried some twelve months ago. I do not know whether, in Federal politics, we are to follow the practice which is common enough in Victorian politics-and perhaps in those of some of the other States-of receiving reports, adopting them by considerable majorities, carefully pigeon-holing them, and afterwards forgetting all about them. honourable member resume his seat. I would point out that there are quite a dozen conversations, proceeding in different parts of the Chamber; it is almost impossible for the honourable member to proceed. ask honourable members to refrain from conversing aloud. matter should be remitted to a Committee for inquiry, unless the Government honestly intend to deal with it subsequently in a practical way. is involved on the part of members of the Committees, as well as a waste of public money. The practice to which I have referred ought not anced. The Committee appointed by Parliament in this instance spent a good deal of time in investigating this matter, which, in my opinion, is worthy of much more serious consideration than appears likely to be extended to it by the Government. length upon this proposal, because the honourable member for South Sydney traversed the ground so thoroughly and capably that there is really very little more to be urged in support of it. I merely purpose answering one or two of the objections which have been urged against its adoption. Before doing so. however, I would point out that since the preparation and adoption of the Committee's report several bodies have discussed the question most exhaustively, notably, the Australian Natives Association, which, at its annual conference, representing as it did some 20,000 members in Victoria, unanimously adopted the proposal of the Committee in favour of a decimal coinage system. appeared upon the question in the more influential newspapers of this and other States. articles were published in the Age. WhilstI do not regard that journal as an authority upon every subject, I hold that upon financial questions it is probably as well edited as is any newspaper in the British Dominions. On that ground alone I hold The report was adopted on that its opinion is entitled to respect. One of the objections which have been urged against the adoption of a decimal system of coinage is that it should be accompanied by a reform of our weights and measures system. I admit that some force attaches to that objection. Personally, I am of opinion that there should be a decimalisation of our weights and measures system, just as there should be a decimalization of Will the our coinage system. A t the same time. I do not hold that until we can secure both reforms we ought to refuse one. I am prepared to accept the first now, and to afterwards endeavour to obtain, the second as I must quickly as possible. I hold that the two questions are intimately related. I admit that there is strong reason why they should be dealt with jointly, but that is no excuse for' advocating delay in the matter of altering our coinage. Whilst it is important that we should deal with our system Otherwise a waste of time of weights and measures, it is still more important that we should place our money system upon a simple and rational basis. Others again urge that until something like to be countena universal system of coinage has been established, which would be the result of some international Conference, it is idle for a small community to attempt reforms of tins character. It is rather singular, however, that those who urge this objection fail to recognise that several international I do not propose to speak at any Conferences have already dealt with the matter, and . that the reform is, nevertheless, as far off as ever. Those who entertain the view which I am now combating seem to imagine that there is some special necessity to place the coinage system of the world upon a uniform basis. They forget that the principal use to which money is put is of a domestic character. It is used by the masses more than by the merchants. So far as merchants and traders generally are concerned, at the' present time they have to conduct their businesses in a way which compels them to adopt practically a decimal system throughout the world. Probably they would find their task rendered a Moreover, several articles have little easier if we adopted a similar system in Australia. It is not the merchant and trader who are most concerned in One or two exceedingly able securing a simple system of money; but",15,Military Legislation To Give Effect To The Recommendations
28,Mr Speaker,Order.,16,Military Legislation To Give Effect To The Recommendations
29,Mr Hume Cook,"I hold that nothe persons who daily have small transactions with the butcher, the grocer, the If by means of this system Ave succeededas 1 am sure we should-in simplifying that branch of trade, and the accountancy work relating to it, we should do much for the people of Australia. Another objection levelled against the Committee's proposition is that we ought in any case to wait until -Great Britain takes action in this direction. It is urged that it would be idle for a portion of the Empire to decimalize its system of currency while the remaining parts failed to do so. As I have said on previous occasions, if we are to delay what we conceive to be desirable reforms until some other part of the world has taken action, we shall always be in the back-wash of legislation. I do not quite understand that attitude of mind which considers no proposition worthy of consideration unless it has been dealt with by some other part of the Empire. character of a progressive people it will be necessary for us, occasionally, at all events, to step out for ourselves, and to say that, although the reform which we contemplate ,has not been carried out elsewhere, we are satisfied, as the result of reasonable inquiry, that it is right and that we should bring it about. If the reform were right we should stand by it, and if it proved to be wrong we should be able to amend it or abandon the proposal; but the suggestion that we should remain idle until the Imperial Government have taken action is one that I cannot accept. There is an excellent answer to those who urge that we should wait until Great Britain takes action, and that we are proposing to make a change in our monetary system so radical that it would materially alter the trading relationships of the Commonwealth with other parts of the Empire. The proposition of the Select Committee is that we should decimalize the -sovereign. The sovereign is the standard of value throughout the British dominions., ancl I am proud to say that it is accepted almost the world over as being at all times worth the value attached to it. That being so. there can be no force in the argument that we should wait for Great Britain to take action in this direction before carrying out the recommendation of the Committee. The great bulk of our business in respect of trade accounts with the rest of the Empire, will be 'based in any case upon the sovereign, and, as we propose to retain that coin, there need be no serious apprehension as to the wisdom of the reform. Australian merchants and traders having busibaker, and other tradespeople. ness relations with firms in Great Britain and other parts of the world, deal with their accounts in such a way that they are simplified at sight. We have large business transactions with the United States of America, but invoices from that country are dealt with in merchants' offices in Australia without any great difficulty. I am informed, on very credible authority, that those who have to dissect these invoices can do so at sight. If that be possible, how much easier would it be for traders in the United States, and other countries where decimal systems are in force, to deal with our accounts on the establishment of a Commonwealth system of decimal coinage? Traders in Great Britain have already to deal with the decimal systems of other countries, and would experience no difficulty from the addition of a Commonwealth system. I feel that the internal benefits to If we are to maintain the be derived from this proposal would be so great as to far out-weigh any external disadvantages that might possibly be experienced. That being so, we may, without hesitation, adopt this proposal, and give to the people of Australia the advantage of a decimal system of coinage. It would certainly enable them to transact their business in a more rational and economic way than is at present possible. The reform advocated by the Committee would not, in my judgment, disturb trade or prejudicially interfere with the operations of merchants and traders. On the contrary, it would simplify their transactions. Some persons urge that if the Committee had recommended the retention of the penny, or the threepenny piece, they might have been inclined to support their proposition. That is a most remarkable attitude to take u p ; because, to decimalize the penny or the shilling, as the case might be, would be to interfere with trade and commerce with the outside world to a far greater extent than the adoption of any other system would in1 volve. The scheme recommended by the Committee is the only one that has ever found favour with the British people. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that the honerable member for South Sydney pointed out some time ago that the system which the Committee recommends has actually been approved by resolution of the House of Commons, and that the British Government propose to deal with the matter as soon as they can dispose of more urgent questions. To decimalize the penny, or the shilling, would be to put us out of touch with British thought and opinion on the subject; whereas the proposals of the Committee are in accord with the ideas of the people of the old country, and would eventually fit in with what I think is likely to be the Empire system. We are not oblivious' to the fact that there are other advantages to be gained from the decimalization of our money. that in connection with this change, we shall mint our own gold, silver, and copper coins and that we shall reap the advantages now secured by the Imperial Treasury from the coinage of the silver used in the Commonwealth. is so large that it represents at present a profit -of between £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year to the Imperial Government. That profit ought to be reaped by the Commonwealth, and would be secured by it if we adopted the proposed decimal system and minted our own coins. which would be gained if we put our decimalized coins into circulation at once would represent something exceeding £1,000,000. The proposition of the Committee is, if my memory serves me rightly, . that that profit should be held as a kind of trust fund to meet any depreciation oC silver, or to pay off from time to time the national debt. should use it save for some such purpose as I have just mentioned; but we should in any case reap the advantages of these savings if we had only the courage to deal with the subject. I do not wish to pose as a mere money-grubber, but I think that the proposition that we should secure the profit of over .£30,000 which, at present goes to the Imperial Treasury, is a sound commercial one. at present take that profit as a set-off against the cost of maintaining the gold standard in Australia. They have asked us to agree to pay the expense of maintaining the gold 'Standardi f we take the profit on the coinage of our silver currency. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The expense of ment, I can inform honourable members that maintaining the gold standard in Australia experts and others who gave evidence be, does not amount to more than £ 2 , 0 0 0 per fore the Select Committee estimated that annum. member for Bourke say that if we coined that the difficulties of the present system our own silver we should save £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a are so great that, in order to master them, year ? is about £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 or ,£36,000 a year, and if the decimal system were adopted. the.whole expense of maintaining the gold currency of this country does not amount to £ 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. There is, therefore, a very wide margin of profit. I take it that we should be prepared to pay the expense of maintaining the gold standard if we secured the profit derived from the coinage of the silver used in the Commonwealth. It is a fair proposition to make, and a responsibility which the Commonwealth ought I take it to accept. The right honourable member for Swan appears rather to doubt the figures I have given, but he can find ample proof of their substantial accuracy in the report of the British Mint Master. If he looks at the reports of the Australian Mints Our importation of silver coinage also, I feel sure that he will find that the figures are as I have given them. He will further find, and it will probably be gratifying to the right honourable member, that the Mint in Western Australia is amongst those which are most profitably conducted at the present time. quantity of silver used in Australia is"" not so great as to give a profit of £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year on its coinage. silver used in Australia is so great that, speaking from memory, the Mint Master of Great Britain is prepared to admit that there is a profit of £ 3 6 , 0 0 0. Surely we can have I do not think that we no higher authority ? Sir JOHN .FORREST -There are charges for freight, and other charges to be reckoned. given make allowance for every charge in connection with the matter. There is a collateral profit to be gained by the decimalization of the coinage which ought not to be neglected by rational minds in the community. The time saved in connection with the education of school children, and in the keeping of accounts, and that kind of work, by the adoption of this system, is valued in round figures, £1,000,000 a year. That is a very large sum, and while I am not prepared to stand sponsor for the statethere is something like that saving to be a child requires to remain one or two years",16,Military Legislation To Give Effect To The Recommendations

35,Mr Hume Cook,"The figures I haveland, that the saving in the school time of children would amount to about a year, having regard especially to the study of weights and measuies. amounted only to one year in the education of children, it would be considerable; and, taken in connection with the saving of time in the keeping of accounts, the advantages stated should be recognised in dealing with this question. I have endeavoured, in a few moments, to answer the objections most prominently stated against the adoption of the system. Such arguments are put forward as, for instance, that if we were to decimalize the'sovereign it would be difficult to deal with purchases that cut into the half-penny and so on. We have the old illustration submitted of so many yards of cloth at n j d . per yard, and so manypounds of butter at n f d . per lb., and we are asked to find the answer in terms of the decimal system. these questions have been given so often that there is no need to repeat them here. I assert that the great reason for decimalizvantage will be secured to the commercial ing money in the Commonwealth is the domestic reason. account keeping in the Commonwealth; it would render calculations more easy for school children and for people who are not well versed in book-keeping. People would be able to carry out everyday transactions with ease, and it would be of very great advantage to the small class of shop-keepers thioughout the Commonwealth. In these circumstances, apart from the profit to be derived from the coinage of our own silver, I again assert that the balance of advantage is so much in favour of the decimalization of our system of money, that I think fication for immediate legislative action upon the adoption of the report of the Select Committee. I feel that we should have some pronouncement from the Government in respect to this matter, and that it should be such as to indicate at once whether there is any possibility of legislation on the subject. If there'is to be no legislation it will be a direct intimation to the members of Select Committees appointed in the future before they go on with their investigations to get an official statement as to whether their labours are likely to be followed by action. I for one will not consent to become a member of any Select Committee unless I have some definite undertaking that the report and recommendation of the Committee are likely within a reasonable time to be translated into Commonwealth law. It is of no use to waste Commonwealth time and money, and the services of honourable members, if no action is to be taken upon the report of a Select Committee. Honourable members are aware that the previous Parliament adopted the report of the Select Committee who dealt with this matter; I have no doubt that the motion now before the House will also be agreed to; andin the circumstances I am satisfied that the time is ripe for legislative action translating these proposals into law. Honourable members who were members of the last Parliament will recollect that when speaking on this matter in 1903 I expressed the utmost sympathy with the object aimed ""at by the Select Committee. I believe that honourable members generally are agreed But the answers to that if we can secure the adoption of the decimal system' of coinage, and the metric system of weights and measures, a great adcommunity as well as great relief given to It would facilitate all children in their school work. The advantages of the adoption of the decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures are so apparent that it appears to me to be extraordinary that nothing has so far been done in the mother country to effect this very much needed reform. I am unable to say that the Government are prepared, at the present time, to introduce legislation in this direction. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bourke to say that if there is no prospect of legislationI presume he means this session-that there will be a discouragement to honourable members to agree to serve on there is ample justiSelect Committees, and to devote a great deal of time-and I submit in this case a great deal of ability, for several members of this Committee displayed great ability-to the elucidation of any subject, and the making of recommendations; but, apart from the possibility of legislation immediately following the production of the report of this Select Committee, it seems to me that a very great deal of valuable work has been accomplished in any case. The position I take up is simply this: In the first place I have had no opportunity, as Treasurer, to consider how far the proposals of the Select Committee will result, first of all in a dislocation of the finances, and secondly, in a dislocation, as I presume there necessarily would be, to some extent, of commercial affairs in",18,Military Legislation To Give Effect To The Recommendations

There is, however, this interesting It fact since the question was last discussed in this House: I am informedI have not been able to obtain the Parliamentary paper--that there is sitting at the present time a Committee of the House of Lords, in connection, not only with the question of decimal coinage, which is immediately under consideration, but also with an alteration in the system of weights and measures.

The sovereign is accepted practically everywhere throughout the world. Therefore, it is of advantage to retain it. I recognise that the florin was an instalment of the decimalization of the British coinage. But the retention of the sovereign entails an alteration of our smaller denominations of coins, if we are to adopt a decimal system. That is the aspect of the matter, that I wish to have time to look into before I commit myself to introduce legislation on this subject. I may add that T intend, in any case, if opportunity serves, to devote some attention to the Question in the direction especially of ascertaining the opinions of different commercial people throughout Australia on the probable effect of, or justification for, an alteration in any degree of our present token coinage. That is the point which seems to me to be most important for the Government to consider. Because, in this matter, although we have the power to legislate for Australia, we shall be affecting to some extent the interests not only ' of private citizens, but also of the States. The instance which I have quoted, of the tramway system in Sydney, has a bearing upon this point, and in regard to many other things it seems to me that' the interests of the States as States are bound up with the present proposal. tion emphasizes the necessity for looking carefully into the effects of the suggested change before the adoption of it as a matter of ordinary legislation. I say at once that if there were any prospect of the British Government taking action within a reasonable time, I should be inclined to take the plunge without further inquiry; but, apart from the practical questions involved in Australia, I do not quite appreciate the wisdom, if it can be avoided, of further differentiating. in the coinage of the different portions of the Empire. The proposal which we are considering does not ask us to adopt the coinage of Great Britain, nor that of Canada, which is another part of the British Empire. A l though it is recommended that we shall take a decimal system, such as they have in Canada, we are to adopt another measure of value as our guide. Consequently, there is a very material departure from any system that at present prevails within the Empire. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The coinage which we propose is English. would be of a very different character from the tokens at present in use, and would necessarily lead to a different system of quotation in merchants' catalogues, and everything of that sort. I admit that catalogues could very easily be prepared in accordance with Our system, and would be understood, just as it is easy enough to-day for a man in this country to understand an American catalogue. Still it takes a little time, and I do not think it wise to have differing systems if it can be avoided. I do not say that the fact of it differing from other svstems in use in the Empire should stand ""in the wav of the adoption of the decimal system, if no other course is open; but we should aim at avoiding these distinctions as much as possible. That is a matter which requires consideration. I quite appreciate the work which has been done by the Committee, ancl I have no desire to imply a reflection upon them by a refusal to introduce legislation at the present time. WhatI said on the last occasion when the subject was debated in this chamber shows that I have every sympathy with the basic principle into which they inquired, and upon which they reported, but I feel it proper for me to in'quire further into the probable immediate effects of an alteration, before committing the Government to the introduction of s That consideraBill, at any rate during this session. I desire the opportunity for investigation which a recess should give, before taking further action. Sydney) I intend to be very brief in what I haye to say on this matter, because I recognise that the honourable member for South Sydney, who moved for the Committee, and who took so much interest ih the question when it was under consideration by that body, has at previous stages placed before this House a very f u l l outline of t h e reasons for adopting the resolution which is now before us.

Australia we have none of the difficulties which Britain has to face. We can quite understand that in Great Britain the alteration of the coinage would be a serious a an to contend against the sentiment which is satisfied with a good solid system of coinage that has existed for generations, and Jwould be apt to look upon a change as almost an interference with the British Constitution. We have there, too, a people less alert to change, and less generally educated, than are our own people. For all those reasons the change would be a much bigger one in Great Britain than it would be here. But I am satisfied that the people of that country regret that the change to a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures was not made when its population numbered only 4,000.000. and its trade was infinitesimal, as compared with the present trade. Recognising this, we should see that our interests lie in the adoption of the decimal system while our population and our trade are small. I quite agree with the Prime Minister that he has many things to consider. He has only recently come into office, and naturally cannot be expected to have given his attention to everything in the first few weeks of his Ministerial career. But an expression of opinion by this House that it is desirable that legislation should follow on the report of the Committee might be passed. directs the Attorney-General to bring in a standard adopted in countries with which Bill. 379 Mr G.

Possibly the Prime Minister may think that in this matter I am the Radical and he is the Conservative. When I am satisfied difficulty. They have there that a proposal, whether it be of a social, large population 40,000,000 and political, or economic character, will effect enormous trade, and they have an improvement, I am always ready to support it, and to face the difficulties that must, for a while, accompany the change. That is why I support the motion.

The British authorities are giving their attention to what I admit is a much larger question, namely, the decimalization of weights and measures. Although the adoption of that system will involve the expenditure of many millions, and will render it necessary to change many of the patterns and looms and the machinery in use in the manufacturing industries throughout Great Britain, the Government recognise the necessity of introducing the reform.

There is a general consensus of opinion that the proposed reform is desirable, but that we should wait. that in view of our growing population and extending ramifications of trade, delay will increase the difficulties of effecting the reform, we must be forced to the conclusion that the sooner it is introduced the better. It has been pointed out by the honourable member for North Sydney that if currency reform it must direction of this proposal. ject has been approached there by several Select Committees and Royal Commissions, and the only scheme that ever had any chance of being adopted was similar to that which the Coinage Committee have seen fit to recommend. The Prime Minister seems to entertain the idea that if we delay action for a few years the question of the reform of our currency system will be taken up by Great Britain. If we were convinced that it would, there might be some reason'for our continued inaction. But I should like to know what the Prime Minister would say if he were asked to postpone some of the Government measures--the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, for example-for a similar reason. I deeply regret that the Commonwealth has not displayed the spirit which was exhibited by the United States so early in its Federal career-the spirit which should prompt us to grapple with [16 JUNE, 1904.] Coinage. 2381 our own problems, ancl deal with them in our own way. Instead of doing so, however, we are continually asking"" How will this matter be viewed in its relation to the Empire?"" When we were considering the question of Australia's contribution towards the maintenance of the British Navy, no member of this House desired to go further than I did. I am prepared to go still further in connection with the proposed reform of our coinage system. If by the adoption of that system we can effect a saving of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 annually, I am perfectly willing to hand over that sum towards the support of the Imperial Navy. But I fail to see why, year after year, we should continue to make a present of that amount to the people of Great Britain, and then quibble about voting an extra £ 1 , 0 0 0 or two towards the do not intend to speak at any maintenance of the British Navy.

Of course if we are to effect the saving to which I have referred, we mustI f , however, we recognise have a distinctive set of coins. This brings us face to face with the question, "" Which is the best coinage system to adopt?"" My answer is that the decimal system is universally recognised as the only one which we can adopt if we are to get the best system. The argument has been advanced that, by introducing the reform we shall dislocate Great Britain ever introduces a our relations with the British Empire. take the Some honourable members who are posThe subsessed of commercial experience surprised me when they advanced that argument. The honourable member for Kooyong seems to think that a system of coinage differing from the present one in its cent, two-cent, or three-cent pieces-coppe r tokens-woul d dislocate our trade relations with Great Britain. The idea is perfectly absurd. Both Canada and India possess coinage systems which differ very markedly from that of the mother country. Although the rupee is ostensibly a 2s. piece, and varies in value from is. i j d . to is 3d., according to the ruling price of silver, business men experience ro difficulty in buying or selling in India.

It would be of no benefit to us if we made our money system accord with that of the rest of the world. the people dissatisfied with the existing system? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The greatest advocates of the decimal coinage system in Great Britain are the working classes, who are constantly signing petitions in favour of its adoption. In South SydneyI have addressed large meetings of working people, who exhibited the most intense appreciation of that system. The benefits to be derived from a universal system of money values are no more worth aiming at than are those which would accrue from the adoption of a universal time system. The only reason why we keep in touch with the British sovereign and the 2s. piece is because they form a part of our history. We do not wish to depart from them in obtaining a new system. We can decimalize our present monetary system with very little disturbance to our current coins. All the objections which have been urged against this proposal vanish when subjected to close examination. Honourable members must recognise that within a comparatively few years there has been a reduction of 100 per cent, or more in the price of almost every article which can now be purchased for a penny. During my own lifetime there has been a decrease of 100 per cent, in the price of postage stamps, whilst the difference in the case of a box of matches represents 200 per cent. The price of newspapers has steadily decreased throughout the world. It is well known that many public men favour a reduction in the price of postage stamps, but believe that the nation cannot sustain the loss which it would involve.

The honourable member for Kooyong urged that the people have not asked for the change proposed. In reply, I would point out that at a conference of representatives of the Australian Natives Association, which was recently held in Melbourne, resolutions in favour of the introduction of this system were unanimously agreed to. Similarly the various Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia have affirmed the necessity for reform, not only in our currency laws, but in our system of weights and measures. I believe that these reforms are coming, and that Australia, in common with other parts of the Empire, will benefit by their adoption. Nevertheless, I hold that our coinage system can be reformed without interfering in any way with our relations.

When we were asked, at 'the close of last session, to deal with the Seat of Government Bill, I clearly intimated that I should vote as well as the information then at my disposal would enable me to do; but that i felt that I was not in a position to properly exercise the duty cast upon me by the Constitution of making a selection. Since then we have been able to place ourselves in a better position, and I am sure that many honourable members, in common with myself, feel that we are now better fitted to deal finally with tlie question than we were at the close of last session. It thus seems to me that there is no ground whatever for the assertion that we have wasted money in this direction, oi that we have unduly delayed our investigations.

The difficulty is that what would be a very reasonable maximum for an individual member of an employees union might be altogether inadequate for an individual member of an employer's union. For instance, a unionist employee may be one of 100 or 1,000 in the employment of an individual employer. might together cease their employment, or might break an award, and a fine of £ 5 or £ 1 0 per head would be a reasonable penalty upon them, and might be just as effective in preventing another offence by them as a fine of £ 1 , 0 0 0 might be as a penalty against an employer. provides for that case. does. one employer, £:r,ooo is the maximum; if there be two, £ 5 0 0 ; and the penalty goes down to £ 1 0 if there be 100. one man may have a very small industry, and another, with 100 men employed, mav have a very big industrv. be well to trust the Court in regard to the penalty. gentleman agree to reduce the amount in the case of the smaller number of employers-say , that if three were concerned, the penalty should be £ 5 0 0 instead of ,£1,000? big mines might be much larger than the interests of ten other mines. the matter which appealed to me. I saw the difficulty of fixing any maximum which would be fair in respect to every class of individuals who might come before the Court. For instance, in the case of an organization of employers it might be but fair that the penalty fixed shouid l e a very large sum. In the case of an organization of employees the penalty might be several thousand pounds, whereas in the case of a single employee it might be a reasonWe think that, on the able penalty to impose a fine ot' only £ 5 for an offence against the lav.

It is a question of fixing a maximum within which we shall be bound to trust to the Court. It is no reflection upon the Court, implies no want of confidence in the Court, and would relieve the Court, to say that, having regard to the offences proposed to be dealt Those employees with by the Bill, we fix a certain sum which shall represent the maximum penalty. I think that upon matters of this kind, which are not technical and not legal-no t technical in the sense of appertaining to anv particular industry-the Arbitration Court as originally proposed by the Bill, being constituted of two permanent members, having experience of business affairs, as well as the Judge, would have been more I do not know that it competent for the imposition of penalties than the Court as now proposed.

The Court first fines the offender £[1,000, and then, if there is reason to believe subsequently that this is not a sufficient penalty the Court has power to imprison him for three months.

Under clause 55, if a person breaks an award, an injunction may be obtained against him, and if he is guilty of a contravention of it, he may get three months' imprisonment. Under these circumstances, a fine of £ 1 , 0 0 0 is sufficient when there is also a possibility of three months' imprisonment. learned gentleman should recollect that the fine may only be £ 1 0 in the case of an individual member of an organization, and the clause makes no distinction in this connection between employers and .employees. nothing to an employer. coupled with the intimation that any contravention of the order mav lead to imprisonment for three months.

For my part I think that there will be few contraventions qf the awards of the Arbitration Court. I believe that these provisions for imprisonment will hardly ever be used. I surmise that it will be a very rare case indeed in> which it will be necessary to enforce them. In the meantime, the maximum provided in We have passed one the Bill is, in my opinion, ample. As to the suggestion to omit a maximum altogether, I do not think the proposition can be entertained for a single moment. since he proposed his amendment. A t first the honourable gentleman said he had overlooked the fact that the amendment omitted 1 a maximum. vey was that I omitted to mention the fact that this was the clause in which it was proposed to omit a maximum. 1 went on to say that there might be a fine of several thousand pounds, and that, so far as individuals are concerned, the clause places employers and employees on the same footing. I do not think that is quite accurate, because it is only where an organiI n other clauses fines zation of employers numbers 100 or more that employers and employees are put upon the same footing.

T h a t is quite right. zation with which the honourable member for Darling is most familiar-as a friendly enemy-ma y number 100 or even hundreds. In any case, I believe that it is undesirable in this matter of penalties to make any distinction between employers and employees. First, as regards maximum penalties^ the Court will be aware of aH the differences, and the suggestion is that, though the Court may be trusted in everyhonorable and thing else, it is not to be trusted in one respect, because of some fear that it will not realize the difference between a rich employer, and, comparatively . speaking, a poor employ^. I know of no case in which Courts are left with I am aware of that. unrestricted power as to penalties. The Statute always fixes the maximum, and sometimes also the minimum, penalty. OrI t is enough if it is dinarily, the maximum penalty is fixed, and it is left to the discretion of the Court to impose any penalty between the maximum and nothing. Surely that is a sufficiently wide discretion. Personally, I could not dream of consenting to the elimination of a maximum. Is it intended that this shall be held up as a weapon in terrorem?

It must not be forgotten that the organizations of some employees are nearly as rich as are employers'. organizations, though the individuals may not be in the same happy position. £ 1 , 0 0 0 as a maximum penalty is high enough for any offence sought to be dealt with in this Bili, ancl, further, it is undesirable to make a difference between the two sides in fixing the maximum penalty.

The side-note to the clause refers us to the following Acts :N.S.W., 37 (7); N.Z., 91; S.A., ; WA., 83S 7 The New Zealand Statute fixes a maximum. Presumably all the other Acts do the same. For a departure from the invariable practice of Legislatures in matters of this kind, some overwhelming necessity must be shown. There is no necessity suggested in this case, except that it is urged that, perhaps, £ 1 0 would not be a sufficient deterrent in the case of an employer.

But the amount of the fine to be imposed ought to be considered independently. The honourable and learned member says that people are law-abiding, and will pay up.

T h a t ' case disposes of the objections which can be urged against this amendment, namely, that it leaves to the Court the determination of the penalty to fit the offence. If the Court cannot be trusted to do that, the immeasurably greater powers which we have intrusted to it under this Bill ought to be severely restricted. I am not shutting my eyes to the fact that To suppose that the in some cases the Bill sets down a certain penalty. But this instance is differentiated from those cases, because what is here contemplated is a penalty to prevent No one says that. persons from breaking an award. That is the mainspring of the Bill. Therefore,, we say to the Court, "" Impose such a penalty as the circumstances of the em-, ployer or the employee or organizations seem to warrant."" tend to oppose the proposal of the Prime Minister to omit the maximum penalty from the Bill. I think it is a very great mistake to do so. In the first place, it is not If , on the other possible, as has been pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, to point to any single Statute in which there is not a limitation of the penalty in some way or another, either in the direction of imprisonment or fine.

That, to my mind, would not be desirable in this connection. I am not arguing on behalf of either the employers or the employees only, because they are equally affected. I say that, as a general principle, we should be very careful not to give undue power to the Judge. hope that the Prime Minister will hold to the clause as introduced. vision for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who is not a member of an organization. vided for by paragraph d.

In the industry with which I have been more particularly connected, there is an organization of employers and another of employees, and there are also a number of employers who do not belong to the employers' organization. those employers always observe the rules laid down by the organization, and would, no doubt, be compelled to observe the conditions required by a common rule; but any penalty for a breach should be made more severe in their case than in the case of the individual employers belonging to the organization, supposing the funds of the organization were insufficient, and a levy was made on its members. The Bill is based on the recognition of collective bargaining, and organizations are'held reI sponsible for carrying out the decisions of the Court. In most cases, breaches by individuals may be,dealt with in the ordinary way. In some cases the Court may make awards which will provide penalties for certain breaches, and I think all we need do is, either to leave the matter open, as the Government propose, or to provide a maximum penalty for organizations and a larger maximum penalty individually for employers who are not members of an organization. The position of an individual employer is very different from that of an individual workman, because an advantage gained by a breach of an award would be the greater in the one case than the in the other. The individual employee really is not concerned, because he could be dealt with under the law affecting masters and servants, though, even if not a member of an organization, he would be subject to a common rule applying to his industry. I have all along been in favour of trusting the Judge, and I think' that if we empower In my him to impose penalties at discretion, the result will be about the same as. if we provide maximum penalties in the Bill. I can hardly conceive of any Judge imposing a penalty up to the maximum which might be named. I recognise that the Provision must also be made general practice in' law-making is to fix a limit, which is to be taken more or less as a guide by the Judges; but the conditions surrounding the proposed prove insufficient, though it Court will be so dissimilar from those surrounding ordinary Courts, that I think we An interjection has can safely leave the Judge to act according to his discretion. If that is not done, I hope that the individual employer who is not a member of an organization will be Our experidealt with differently from the individual employer who is a member of an organization. I should like to know, too, if companies will be regarded as organizations. If so, of course their shareholders will be responsible for any penalty that may be imposed upon them.

That after the word "" organization,"" line 7, the words "" and to specify the organizations or persons to whom such penalties shall be paid,"" not pass, his occupation will be gone. be left out. My object in submitting this amendment is to prevent fines which may be inflicted for any breach of an award from finding their way into the coffers of the other party to any industrial dispute. Ordinarily, fines which are imposed for breaches of the law are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Government, however, propose to extract money from one class, and to hand it Over to the political unions of another class. In short, the clause means that if any employer comrmts a breach of an award for which he is fined, the fine shall be paid into the funds of the local union, which usually works in conjunction with the political labour council. That is to say, the funds of the Labour Party are to be augmented at the expense of the employers. Boiled down, that is what the proposal really means. What justification is there for departing from the usual practice ? Why should not the fines inflicted be paid into the public revenue? The employers' or-, ganizations will not benefit from the fines imposed, because, if a breach of an award were committed by, say, the Shearers' Union, the penalty inflicted could not be recovered. funds. levy on them we shall find that they are "" up the spout."" ed member has had no experience of unions, otherwise he would not make that statement. in Victoria which organized a strike last year.

When, however, the actual facts were disclosed, it was found that it was possessed only of about 2s. 6d., and the strikers have been regretting their action ever since. Penalties inflicted' upon industrial organizations could not possibly be enforced, ancl no sane body of employers would attempt to recover them. Take the case of the Shearers' Union, which numbers several thousand employees. How could a fine be inflicted upon the individual members of that organization? It is absolutely impracticable. The honourable member for Darling smiles. His self-imposed mission when the Bill becomes law, is to travel round the country working up disputes; so that if the measure does able an occupation as is that of living upon other people's disputes. temptible reflection upon the Prime Minister's colleague, the Minister of External Affairs. The honourable gentleman ought to know better than to attack his own colleague. I repeat that, if the Bill becomes law, the honourable member for Darling has expressed his intention of going round the country to work up disputes. If any breach of an award be committed by an unfortunate employer he will be promptly hauled before the Court and fined, and the money thus extracted from him will be paid into the funds of the local industrial union, and used to defray the expenses' of parliamentary labour candidates. No more infamous proposition has ever been submitted to Parliament. Upon no principle of justice can it be defended. It cannot be defended upon any principle of justice, based either upon evolutionary or utilitarian grounds. It seeks to introduce into our legislation a system of revenge, whereby, if a man commits a breach of the law another man shall be able to extract The union has money from him. These fines, I repeat, will be used largely for political purposes. In reply to a previous speaker, the Prime Minister asked, "" W hy should not these penalties be paid to a union, seeing that the Court has no power to award costs?""

The honourable member for Darling has been described as an agitator, who proposes to travel Australia for thf: purpose of stirring up industrial disputes, although it does not appear that, under this clause, he will receive any portion of the fines which may be inflicted for breaches of awards. that, if certain persons were brought under the operation of this Bill, he would soon work up a dispute. wonder my honourable and learned friend squirmed when the Prime Minister spoke of "" living upon other people's disputes,"" because the reference hit him so hard. So far as I have been called upon to interfere in other people's disputes, I have at least made a tolerable living out of them; but I do not know that the honourable and learned member for Wannon has been able to make a living at all. What are the facts of the case?

Wales Court has always exercised its discretion. bers have spoken in a way that would suggest that this provision was unknown in other arbitration measures. It has been in operation in New South Wales, ancl has not given rise to a class of informers, or to the enrichment of a union of either employers or employees. Surely the honourable and learned member for Wannon does not contend that it is necessary to insert in this Bill a provision that would say, in effect, to the Judge that only so much of the fine shall go to the successful party as is necessary to recoup him for his outlay? If that is the sole objection which the Committee have in view, why is not an amendment moved to that effect? But the fact is that my honourable and learned friend is opposed to any portion of the fine being allocated in this way. Although a union of employers or employees might expend £ 1 0 0 in the way of law costs, he would object to the penalty inflicted being handed to it by way of damages. I take it that the desire of the Committee is to prevent any person making a profit or a trade out of the system provided for in this paragraph. of the Government. can be advanced to prevent such an abuse of the provision, let it by all means be submitted.

It bears directly on the allocation of the penalty and the reason why it was so allocated. The President in delivering judgment, said' We further direct that, should eitlier the claimant or respondent be guilty of a breach of our award, it shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £100 for every breach, and that should any member of the claimant union or respondent company be guilty of a breach thereof, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £ $ for every breach. This award shall take operation upon and from Monday, June 2. . . . Though this decision will necessarily throw out of employment the men who have been working for the company at Newcastle and Morpeth since April 10a result which we cannot but regret -ye t it must be remembered that meantime they have been earning wages which should have been earned by the members of the union. In any event one set of men or the other must, unfortunately, be deprived of this particular work, but, as we have pointed out, justice requires that the union men should be restored to their former position, whatever hardships may unfortunately follow. Dealing with the costs, we are of opinion that the company should pay to the claimants the sum of 15 guineas, and costs in accordance with the scale provided in the rules. As we have already pointed out, the members of the union have incurred a heavy loss through the action of the company, and although we do not think the men were justified in refusing to work at all on March 5, yet when thereafter the real dispute arose, as to the terms and conditions on which they should be employed-and that was the real basis of the dispute, the company, in our judgment, unreasonably refused to allow the men to work under a provisional arrangement which in no way would have prejudiced its That, certainlv. is the desire rights, and was to be subject to adjustment by If any suggestion the Court.

It was directed that a penalty of £ 1 0 0 should be paid for breach of the award, and I see no just reason for refusing to allow penalties to In the Newcastle and be dealt with in this way.

I am exceedingly glad that the Minister is doing me the honour of listening to my remarks. On most other occasions on which I have had an opportunity to debate a question with him he has left the chamber immediately after the conclusion of his remarks, and that possibly accounts for his wide acquaintance with the speeches that I have delivered. He credited me with having, on every occasion on which I have discussed the provisions of this Bill, referred to the Shearers' Union. the honourable and learned member could do so. the amendment now before the ChairI mentioned the union, and then only by inadvertence, but on no previous occasion have I done so, and a reference to Hansard will bear out this assertion.

It is a fact that a gentleman who was nominated by the Shearers' Union ran as a candidate against me at the last election. It is also a fact that a third candidate came forward. My honourable friends opposite are not in ignorance of the fact that the third candidate's meetings were attended by supporters of the Labour Party. They went to his meetings up to the day before the nomination, and cheered him to the echo, so that paragraphs appeared in the newspapers describing the magnificent meetings he had. But when they had got the unfortunate man landed with his nomination paper and his money in the hands of the Returning Officer, they turned again and rent him. Notwithstanding their tactics, and their boast that they had got me this time, because they had got a third man cutting into my votes, I managed to beat their man very handsomely. All I ask at their hands at the next election is a fair field and no favour, and if the electors of Wannon should return a labour man then, I must be mistaken as to their political views. We are told that fines do not aiways go to the Treasury, and that they sometimes go to informers. That is just what I desire to prevent. I wish to prevent the creation of a class of spies and informers, men who hang round back doors and endeavour, by spying, to secure a conviction for a breach of the law, that they may partake in the fine imposed. In the. history of all ages there has been admittedly no more contemptible profession than that of the informer.

That is the statement the honourable ancl learned member has made, and on behalf of the Employers' Union, representing a most respectable and intelligent class of people, I If that is not their desire to enter my protest. I think it is most unfair that the honourable and learned member should assume that a class of people who have hitherto always been known as the "" law and order party "" will, under this Bill, be turned into chronic lawbreakers, and will need to be punished so frequently by fines that in future the members of the labour unions will not be required to make contributions to the funds of their organizations, seeing that a sufficient sum will be handed over to them by a friendly Judge of the Arbitration Court to enable them to carry on their work without any necessity for a levy upon their memask. bers.

If it is admitted that the offences by either class will be about equal, and the honourable and learned member for Wannon might be justified in admitting that such a thing is possible, he will see that the Employers' Federation will have as much to spend politically as the other side them to recover. to spend on the return of the honourable and learned member at the next election. which the honourable and learned member has made, I cari see that we are going to win Wannon with our Shearers' Union man next time, because the members of the Employers' Federation, just as the members of other organizations, like a man who will always stand up for them. Humanity, in the average, is very much alike, and it is just possible that there may be some breaches of agreements by employees. If they occur anything like as frequently as those by employers, that political institution, known as the ""Employers' Union,"" will have as much to spend politically as will the Other side. If the objection which the honourable and learned member for Wannon has urged is the only one which can be urged to this clause there is not a very great deal in it. Circumstances occur in connection with some cases which would justify a provision for securing compensation. It is quite possible that a body of employees may put an employer to some considerable loss before he could get the Court to deal with his case, and compel them to carry out their agreement. In such a case, who could object to the penalty imposed going by the way of compensation to the person who has been involved in the expense? ber propose that a new clause should be inserted providing for compensation? anything, I am asking honourable members to support the clause as it stands. I see an objection to the use of the word "" compensation."" because the sum awarded might not always be compensation. think it will be safer to leave the clause as it stands. any reason to believe that the Court in this matter would act unfairly or injudiciously. I am opposed to legal gentlemen conducting cases before the Court, unless with the consent of both parties, who would, in such a case, take upon themselves responsibility for the payment of costs. But where there are breaches of awards, it is. certain that loss will be entailed upon one side or another, and unless we make provision for some kind of compensation, which would mean the passing of a number of new clauses to meet that difficulty, it is better that the matter should be dealt with as proposed by this clause. I do not see why, under this clause, the Court might not order that fines imposed should go to the public revenue, and not to either party to a dispute. poses to move an amendment making that clGcir that is done. I do not desire that these fines should benefit any particular body of labour unions; but, I think, freedom should be left to the Court to do some measure of justice. It is better toleave to the Court to order that the money shall be paid into the public revenue where it is clear that neither party to a dispute has a just claim to it. I feel sure that, on reflection, the honourable and learned member for Wannon will be prepared to withdraw his amendment. ing remarks of the Minister of External Affairs arrested my attention.

I suggest, to meet the difficulty, that, with the consent of the honourable and learned member for Wannon, we might insert after the word ""specifying,"" some such words as the following :the amount which may be awarded as costs to organizations or persons concerned. I wish it to be clearly understood that I think it ought to be permissible to allow costs to either party if there is a prosecution for the breach of an award.

Apparently the honourable and learned member is incapable of coming to a calm decision in respect to anything in which unions are concerned. He seems to have had his epidermis so much injured while the elections were in progress that he has never recovered from the shock.

But suppose that his employees, although the Act enjoins them not to strike, but to observe makes an award, persist in striking. Suppose that in consequence of that action they cause the employer, not only to lose the profit on their services, during the timewhen they ought to have been at work, but that also he is unable to fulfil contracts into which he had entered, and that he istherefore materially injured.

The employees refused to go to work under these new conditions. Under the law, the employers-the Newcastle Company-should have observed the existing conditions, and asked the Court to adjudicate as to whether a reduction of wages and an alteration of working conditions should not be made. The company refused, however, to abide by the central principle of the Act, which provided that no alteration of conditions should be made while a dispute was pending. By that refusal to obey the Act, the company caused these men to lose a certain amount of workTherefore, fifteen guineas were awarded, so as to some extent to reimburse the men for their actual loss. The money was paid, not to any set of informers, as the scene painted by the honourable and learned member for Wannon would cause the Committee to believe, but to the men who had sustained the loss.

They did not deduct the damages from the penalty, because no penalty was inflicted at that time. They fixed the penalty for any subsequent breach of the award, and specified that the f u l l amount of the penalty should be paid to the union which was aggrieved. That is what is objected to by the honourable and learned member for Wannon. He is opposed to the allotment of the fines before an offence has been committed, because persons will probably be encouraged to bring cases into Court with a view to obtaining compensation. old informing system. Avould encourage informers. much prefer to see a provision permitting the Court to allot damages and costs to the aggrieved union to the extent that it thought fit, the balance of the fine to be paid into the Treasury. not. The case quoted by the Ministei does not support his contention, because from was ordered that the penalty to be incurred in the event of a breach should be handed over to the aggrieved union. Even though the payment of £ 1 might constitute sufficient compensation, the union was to receive the f u l l amount of £ 1 0 0 . I think that the objections raised to such a provision are reasonable, ancl that some arrangement fair to both sides should be made. request the attention of the Prime Minister whilst I read this clause-in conjunction with subsequent clauses. Under clause 46, paragraph c, power is given to the Court to fix maximum penalties, and to specify the organizations or persons, to whom such penalties shall be paid. That is the provision which'the honourable and learned member f o i Wannon desires to omit. In paragraph d power is given to the Court to impose penalties, within the maximum previously mentioned, and to specify the organizations 01 persons to whom the penalties shall be paid. Then in clause 52 we find that application can be made to Courts of summary jurisdiction to enforce the payment of penalties. Therefore, under paragraph d, of clause 46 4 N 2 and clause 52, alternative Courts are provided, between which an applicant can make Then they his choice when he desires to recover a penalty. Clause 52 providesWhere any organization or person bound by an order or award has committed any breach or non-observance of any term of the order or award for which the Court has fixed a maximum penalty, any organization or person entitled to the penalty may proceed for the recovery thereof in any Court of summary jurisdiction. 0 In the first instance a maximum penalty would be fixed under clause 46. paragraph c, and afterwards an aggrieved person might apply to the Arbitration Court or to a Court of summary jurisdiction to impose the penalty. The latter Court, however, would have no option but It would revive the to impose the maximum amount. Under section 46, paragraph c, the Arbitration Court could fix the maximum penalty at, I should s a v > ^5°°> a n d provide that that amount should, in the event of a breach, be paid to the aggrieved organization.

It would be better to follow-the suggestion of the honourable ancl learned member for Corinella, and allow the Arbitration Court to fix the maximum penalties permitting the parties to proceed by subsequent application for the purpose of securing a decision as to how the money shall be applied. Whether or not it be desirable to leave that decision to an inferior Court, it is. absolutely necessary that we should allow the Arbitration Court to deal by the Arbitration Court with the allocation of the penalty at a later stage, in order that the amount may be fixed It is not adaccording to the circumstances. As to the proposal that the money should be paid into the Treasury, I should leave the matter entirely to the discretion of the Court.

We wish to draw The' Prime Minister's proposal a distinct line between penalties and damages. For instance, if a penalty of £ 5 0 0 can be imposed, and it can be shown that damage has been inflicted, either on employers or on a union of employees, the whole of that sum might be awarded in damages. But what we object to is the abominable sysI n an Act of Parliament tem of giving a portion of the fine to any informer. If there is one form of greed on the face of God's earth which is more contemptible than another, it is that of the informer who lives on sneaking and obI take it that at the betaining blood money. Under this provision I am afraid that informers would be able to obtain such money, either against trades unions or employers. There is always a fear, if we put it into the hands of any Court to award any portion of a penalty to an informer, or to any body of men who turn informers, that persons will be induced to look round for the chance of informing for the sake of the reward. If means are given to do evil, men will soon be found to seek the rewards of evil. of the New South Wales Act there has",53,Conciliation And Arbitration

That would leave it at the option of the Court either to impose a penalty, or to grant damages, to be paid to either of the aggrieved parties.

In addition to that I am not going to say that it is unhealthy in Kalgoorlie-an y man might readily prefer to accept £ 2 per week, in Melbourne or Ballarat, rather than work at Kalgoorlie at a wage of £ 4 per week. It might pay him better to remain here. That most people do prefer to remain here is proved by the fact that, in spite of the higher wages paid at Kal goorlie, there is not an inordinately large number of people there, but only a comparatively few men of a specially enterprising and energetic character. I think that that is generally admitted. These are the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. I circumstances which now determine the d if ferent rates of wages.

My honourable friend says that the Judge would not make any greater difference in the rate, of wages as between Western Australia and I do not think he will Ballarat than would be marked by the dif I ference in the cost of living. But he is supposing that the Judge would lose sight of all those other factors which cause rates to vary at present. Besides the difference in the cost of living, there are the discomforts which naturally attend the pursuit of one's livelihood in districts where the benefits of civilization are not so ready to hand as they are here. For instance, if I went to one of what are called the inside districts of New South Wales, and found employment on a station, I might be able to earn j Q i per week and my rations. If I went further out, I should probably be able to command 25s. per week, and if I went still further back, Now, the wages close to the border of South Australia, I should, if other things were equal, probably receive still more.

Any Judge who would not do so is certainly not likely to be called upon to adjudicate in these matters. objections which have been' raised by the honourable member for Gippsland would be, to a large extent, disposed of if it were remembered that there is no provision in the Bill to the effect that the Judse shall make a common rule.

If the conditions were so widely different that no fair common rule could be applied, I imagine that the Court would not attempt to exercise its power in that respect.

Possibly, the circummany of the difficulties in connection with this Bill would be overcome if we could at once secure a Judge as superhumanly perfect as the President of the Arbitration Court is expected to be.

That the following proviso be added :"" Provided that the Court may not act under this paragraph except where the products of the industry of the persons whom the common rule is to bind enter into competition with the products of the industry of the parties to the dispute, or of the members of organizations parties to the dispute."" In speaking on this question yesterday I expressed some doubt as to the constitutionality of this sub-clause. I was dubious as to how far we could apply the common rule, and I felt that without some provision being made for its application in certain cases, the B ill would be practically inoperative. it is possible to limit the operation of the common rule to cases in which the conditions are sufficiently similar, or to industries which are sufficiently related, to justify its application. that we should trust the Court. however, that it is the business of the Legislature to direct the Court wherever it-possibly can. 'to have its powers clearly defined. MrM c CAY It would prefer that, upon such delicate questions, the LegislaI again enter ture should, as far as possible, indicate its intentions. There are two ways in which the application of the common rule can be limited by legislative means. One of these is by adopting the method which has been followed in the New Zealand Arbitration Act, and to which I drew attention yesterday. The other way is to limit the operation of the common rule to those States in which the dispute exists which the Federal can do no possible Arbitration Court has been called upon to paragraph decide. For instance, if a dispute extends from New South Wales to Queensland, but no further, the common rule should be limited to those two States. the other States MrM c CAY It might possibly prove unjust, but even where a dispute has extended to two States, and the parties to it have come before the Court, there might conceivably be persons in those States who were not parties to the dispute, but who clearly ought to be bound by the same rule, as applied to those parties. I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of that The limitation. I merely mention the matter in passing, because it seems to me to suggest a possible solution of the constitutional difficulty. In New Zealand there are four industrial districts, and the awards made by the Arbitration Court are confined to the districts in which they are made. They can, however, be extended from the industrial district in which they are made to other industrial districts. The process there is not known as the ""common rule,"" although its effect is the same. The essence of the limitation which my amendment imposes is that the common rule shall not be applicable to cases in which there is no industrial competition. When industrial competition exists, if some competitors are bound by an award of the Court whilst others are not, injustice may arise. We require equality only where On further consideration, I think there is competition. The New Zealand lawrecognises that. involve a long preliminary argument as to whether competition exists? I hold, cult to decide that matter than it will be to determine scores of others with which the Court will be called upon to deal.

Omitting the mere verbiage, the effect .of this amendment will be that unless when an award has been made in respect of, say, New South Wales and Queensland, the Court is satisfied that the persons engaged in the industry there, to whom the award applies, are entering into competition with persons in other States, to whom the award does not apply, it shall not have power to make a common rule. It is only when that competition ultimately arises that, so f a r as I am at present able to see, any justification fo i the common rule can be said to exist.

475,"I T , At Any Rate, Mr Hughes (West Sydney","Ministe rence, is there any case in which persons engaged in a certain trade in a particular place do not enter into competition with persons following the same trade in some other place? I do not know of any. It is obvious, for example, that a boot factory in Brisbane and a boot factory in Perth may enter into competition with one another. If we shut up the boot factory in Brisbane, or did anything tending in that direction, there would be, on the face of it, a greater market for the output of the boot factory at Perth, and vice versa. net what trade we take. to the trade represented by my honourable friend Ihe member for Darling. If the shearing rate were increased in New South Wales and Queensland, so that shearers there got 22s. 66. for shearing ioo sheep there, while in South Australia they got only 15s. or 17s. 66., it is very clear that the competition in the English and European markets might be prejudicial to the persons affected by the award in the two former States. They would, consequently, be unfairly dealt with unless the rule affecting them was extended to South Australia, and the price paid there was pushed up to 22s. 6d., or some corresponding increase of wages was given to the shearers in that State. If it be true that there is not one trade that can be mentioned into which competition, if regarded from that stand-point, does not enter, thei I. ask of what use would the amendment be? industries which come to my mind now as suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corinelia competition does enter, and, therefore, the Court would be justified in considering that it ought to extend the common rule to them. learned member will see that in that case his amendment would in no way restrict the operation of the common rule. other hand, the Court takes a narrower view of what competition may mean, then I say ihe amendment-might be found very prejudicial indeed-to the working of the law, or to any particular industry. BeforeI should be inclined to vote for the honourable and learned member's amendment, or (o embody it, in any words at all, in the Bill, I should like to hear from him or from some honourable member who agrees with him lhat the effect of it will not be, in so many words, to make no difference at all. Tf competition is to be understood in the sense 4i9. in which the honourable and learned membei appeared to refer to it, I am unaware pf.a solitary industrv into which competition does not enter. On the other hand, if the restrictive view of ' competition is to be taken, the Court might construe the words of the amendment in their narrowest sense. It might say-""We are, in this legislation, imposing certain restrictions on human liberty, and those restrictions ought to be most rigidly observed. We shall therefore interpret it in its technical and narrowest It matters sense."" The competition must be effective 01 Let us refer substantial. The Court, in so doing, would be following out a well-known principle ol the interpretation of laws. If that were the course adopted the amendment would certainlv be effective, and I fear it would be allogelher too effective. ' I shall be glad to learn from the honourable and learned member whether the common rule provided for in New Zealand has been operative, ancl with what effect? I understand that it is there a new departure. since 1900. learned member may tell us what have been its effects. Last evening, the honourable member for Richmond quoted Mr Reeves, as saying, in reference to the common rule in New South Wales, that he waited with interest to see the effect of it. I interjected that judging by experience in New South Wales, the common rule was a provision worthy of inclusion in this measure.^ WeI n the case of all the can point to the effects of its operation in New South Wales, and I now ask the honourable and learned member for Corinella what has been the effect of the application of a common rule in New Zealand? It has to be noted that the New Zealand case is not The honourable and on all fours with this, because New Zealand is divided into four districts, and a common rule operative in one of those districts is not If , on the necessarily operative in another. Consequently, the conditions there cannot be compared with the conditions likely to exist in the Commonwealth under this Bill. Under the circumstances, I do not think we can agree to adopt the amendment. I should like to say that if it is intended to be merely a direction or indication to the Court as to how they are to apply a common rule well and good ; but if it is to have the effect of restricting the Court in its application of a common rule,' it would appear to me to be most undesirable.

In New South Wales, where no such restrictions as are suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corinella are to be found in the law, the common rule provision has been applied with a due regard to existing conditions. say frankly, that I know of no other fundamental reason for a common rule than competition. I think that is the fundamental reason. There is, of course, a fundamental principle running through this Bill, that in order to prevent disputes, it is necessary always to have such just and equitable conditions as will do away with the necessity for them. Therefore, apart from competition, it may be a desirable thing to have a provision which would insure eouality of conditions all over the Commonwealth. should determine where a common rule should apply. I ask the honourable and learned member for Corinella to sav in what trade, taking his larger interpretation, competition does not enter, and if he is unable to do so, to tell the Committee what will be the use of his amendment. I ask him also, what has been the effect of the operation of the common rule provision in the New Zealand law, and whether he thinks the conditions existing in New Zealand, where a common rule is rigidly confined by the Act to one of four districts, can be considered in anv Avav analogous tc the conditions which will obtain in the Commonwealth under this B ill . prised that this amendment should be moved. I believe it involves several issues which have not yet been discussed, and, if adopted, would certainly very greatly complicate matters. It would provide great ground for argument, as' to whether the Court had power to make a common rule or not. distinctions drawn as to whether in some instances competition arises. one industry which I do not think islikely to come before the Court, and that is the gold mining industry. able and learned member for Corinella claim that the gold mining industry is a competitive industry in the sense that its products come into competition in different honourable member a bit. places? produced in one place is held to come into ment would naturally raise those questions, competition with gold produced in another. because it proposes that, unless it can be There is a fixed -price for gold according shown that there is competition, a common to its standard value. and learned member could convince any Judge that the gold mining industry in one place in its products enters into competition with the same industry in another, he must be possessed of very considerable T persuasive powers. The honourable anil learned member for Corinella did not, by the way, explain what is the product of the There may be others, but wharf labourers' industry. The honourable and learned gentleman did not mention the gold mining industry, the product of which is gold, which does not always go into the pockets of the shareholders in a mine, who often lose some of their own. gold in carrying it on. Does the honourable and learned member say that the product of this industry enters into competition ? There may be some variation in the prices of silver and coppei, Generally speaking, the Court but I do not think it is claimed that there is a variation in the price of gold. T listened with great interest, but in vain, to find a reason for the amendment. It seems to me that it would create a very great deal of trouble. I have an objection to the Court being directed to base its award upon grounds of competition, or upon the price realized for the products of an industry. My experience has been that the question of wages to be paid in a great number of industries has not really affected the matters in dispute. I can give an i l lustration. We have had from time to time a great number of conferences in connection with the wool industry, which would certainly come under this B ill . It is one ,in connection with which there would be no difficulty in the application of the common rule. The parties concerned in the industry would themselves require a common rule, but for reasons -entirely apart from competition, in not one of the conferences to which I refer, has it ever been claimed that those carrying on the pastoral industry could We have had some very fine not afford to pay the prices asked by the working men's organizations. But the There is amendment now proposed would be a direction to the Court to raise arguments and bring forward evidence relating to the price Does the honorof wool, which we know is regulated by foreign competition.

Though the Royal Commission, of which I was a member, and which inquired into the condition of the pastoral industry, in the worse portion of New South Wales, where hundreds of thousands of pounds were lost by men engaged in the industry, took the evidence of over 260 witnesses, not a single one of them claimed that the wages paid to employees in the industry was a factor in their failures or losses. would appear to me to bring that factor in. Those engaged in every industry that I can think of as likely to come under this B ill , would be prevented from securing a common rule, by the proposed amendment, unless, as the Minister of External Affairs has pointed out, the Court takes the view that there is competition in every industry. In the transport trade, so far as shipping is concerned, competition may be said to exist between is regulate to But they do not have any product; and it may be strongly argued to the Judge that, as they do not produce anything, they clo not come under this clause. It seems to me that no case has been made out, but that we are going to complicate the matter. The real object of the Bill is to deal with disputes that arise not in relation to competition, but in relation to wages and conditions as between employers and employees. The matter of. competition onlyenters into it on the employers' side, where one is undercutting another. But in regard to any dispute that this Court will be asked to settle, competition is rarely a factor, for the reason that the Court would general Intake the conditions existing and wages paid by a, fair-minded employer as a basis for doing away with sweating on the part of an unreasonable employer. The operation of the common rule in such cases will be to rrive something like equality of conditions. The factor which is the main consideration is to see that there is no sweating of human beings. No 'fair-minded employer complains of being called upon to pay a decent wage so long as he is protected against the It raises the question of unfair employer who undercuts him. If the cost of producin certain industries. The industries which are likely to come before this Court are not I never said it had not, affected by that consideration. If, however, the honourable ancl learned member for Corinella considers that the products of the industries affected by this Bill do enter into competition, what is the use of inserting this provision, tangling up the Court, and affording scope for argument and confusion. Tb my mind it only complicates matters, and cannot do any good. No principle whatever seems to be involved, ancl I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment. The amendment commence the consideration of this question by recollecting that.the operation of the common rule takes its foundation rather from the implied necessities of the Constitution than from any express endowment of power. After that preliminary consideration, we have to recollect that the common rule is not asked for within the region of any dispute. We have provided in the amplest manner by definitions that are as wide as any Act can make them, for various ship-owners, but it every kind of industrial dispute in every a"" competition' which they can kind of trade in every possible circumstance; themselves if they choose and whenever a dispute occurs under any of arrive at a common agreement. those varying conditions, the Court is empowered to determine the whole question by an award. The common rule only operates outside the region of dispute-out side the region of challenge. No person has been aggrieved among those upon whom a common rule is called upon to operate. But it is admitted that, apart from the phraseology of this B ill and the terms of the Constitution, it is necessary and desirable to apply the common rule in order to complete the work that is done by awards. The common rule does nothing which an award cannot do. Anything that is excluded from the operation of the common rule is not, therefore, excluded from the operation of this Bill. It only requires that a dispute shall be extended to the new area, and it comes under the operation of an ordinary award. ' So that in dealing with the common rule the only thing we have to take cognisance of is that which the honourable member for Darling has dealt with. At the worse any restriction of a common rule leaves anything it cannot reach to be settled after a dispute. We",64,Conciliation And Arbitration

A common rule, as applied to Federal disputes extending beyond one State, takes on an entirely different character from that which obtains within a single State. to begin with, extends beyond one State, and two States are brought within its operation immediately.

With regard to the seamen, arid possibly the shearers, there may be Australian common rules, but at the present moment I cannot recall any other industry in which it is likely. which has been alluded to, the circumstances of Kimberley, Kalgoorlie, and Gipps'and are so entirely different that we can scarce!v imagine a common rule being proposed that would apply to those three places. under the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, as the Minister of External Affairs has admitted, the essential condition under which a common rule or award is called for, is when there is competition. divided into water-tight compartments, in regard to any particular industry, and an industry in one part could not come into competition with a similar industry in another part, there can scarcely be a reason for asking for a common rule within those divisions. The honourable member for Corinella proposes that competition shall be the test of I lie common rule. The honourable member for Darling has admitted that this does not, on a liberal interpretation, impose any important restriction. additional security to those who may be doubtful about the operation of this measure. It is a small restriction, indeed, but it does give a guarantee. A similar limitation has been in existence in New Zealand for more than three years.

I agreepossible that gold miners might be brought in under the operation of the common rule, in, say, Ballarat and Gippsland, but gold miners in Kalgoorlie and Kimberley could hardly be brought under its operation without straining it. In the same way it might apply to coal miners working under similar conditions. But it certainly would not be wise to have a common rule applied equally to miners in New South Wales, Victoria, and, say, Kimberley. Those are the points for consideration. It seems to me that the mind of the Committee tends in one direction, and that we shall be able to shape an amendment which will be acceptable to both sides,, and at the same time give the public the guarantee, to which I have referred, for what it is worth-and it will be worth something to those in remote places like Kimberley and Kalgoorlie. e rather afraid that the adoption of the amendment in its present shape would go even further than the honourable and learned member for Corinella at present intends.

In New Zealand they had four separate industrial districts, and there was an unwillingness to depart from that plan.

It is not necessary to The organizations of employees prove, to secure the application of a common rule within an industrial district, that there is competition there. The idea of insuring that competition shall be proved before a common rule can be extended beyond the boundaries of the industrial district to which it was originally applied was adopted in New Zealand by way 'of compromise. It was a compromise between the representatives of the Auckland district, which, from the point of view of the other districts, had been recalcitrant, and the other members of the House, who were urging that a general common rule should be applied over the whole of the Colony.
