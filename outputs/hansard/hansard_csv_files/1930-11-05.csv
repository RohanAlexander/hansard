On the occasion to which I have roferred, the late honourable member for Eden Monaro rightly objected to a most scurrilous attack which had been made upon him by the press. I have never endeavoured to avoid the consequences of any utterances I have made in this chamber. I have never tried to side-step a question, and I have never tried to squib. During the war period I was imprisoned for two months, but I did not shirk my responsibility for anything I had done. I have never done so, and have no desire to do it now. WhatI said in the speech in regard to which I have been, misrepresented I am prepared to stand up to to-day.

The incorrect report of my remarks finds favour with the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) because, as a journalist, he has been reared in an atmosphere of misrepresentation.

I submit that the honourable member has not moved a motion declaring any person to have been guilty of contempt, with the result that the House is unaware of the subject-matter of his complaint. . I submit that the honourable member is not acting in accordance with Standing Order 285.

44,Mr Yates,"I shall name the newsprinted aud published, so far as I am aware, by Bonython& Co., of Adelaide, although it would be difficult to say with certainty who are the real owners of the press of Australia. The Advertiser has, perhaps, given this matter more prominence than have the newspapers published outside South Australia, but throughout the Commonwealth various newspapers have indulged in similar misrepresentation. published in Adelaide on the 25 th July, 1930, over the heading ""Repudiation of War Debts Urged"", contains similar misrepresentation to that published in the Advertiser. Queensland newspapers which have similarly offended include the Courier, the Daily Mail, the Evening News, and the Telegraph, of the 25th -July last. In Sydney similar misrepresentation appeared in the Evening News and the Sun of the 24th July, and in the Daily Telegraph Pictorial of the following day. The Herald and the Age, published in Melbourne on the 24th July, and 25th July respectively offended similarly, as did also the Hobart Mercury and the Launceston Examiner of the 25th July. It is part of the propame in a false position. As honourable ganda of . my political opponents to publish throughout Australia that I favour the repudiation of our war debts; but not one honourable member opposite is prepared to rise in his place and accuse me of having advocated such a policy.

In the issue of the Advertiser foltion as has the policy of the Conservatives. lowing that to which I have already referred there appeared a letter from Mr respondent misstated facts was in the Teport W. A. Hamilton, the leader of the Liberal Federation in South Australia, a gentleman who, before his defeat at the last election, represented the district of Torrens in the House of Assembly, and previously represented Bendigo in the Victorian Parliament. Mr Hamilton at one time signed the platform of tht Labour party, which had printed at the top the slogan, "" The Labour party is. the only party which is not a party. It is the nation."" His letter was given prominence on the cable page of the Advertiser, as were also the references to repudiation to which I have referred. Indeed, the Advertiser sought to give as much publicity to the matter as possible, even The Register News Pictorial, going so far as to publish my photograph. I ignored Mr Hamilton's letter, with the result that eleven days later a further letter from him appeared in the Advertiser. A little more than a week later the newspaper correspondent, probably in order to occupy his time during the recess, supplied to that newspaper some items of gossip concerning Canberra. To that letter I replied; but it was published in the Advertiser, not on the cable page, as were the other articles, but under the heading, "" Views and Comments "". That action on the part of the publishers shows clearly that they were actuated, not by principles of justice or fair play, hut only by a desire to malign me and place members profess to be ignorant of my reply, I shall read what I said in my letter to the AdvertiserYour Canberra correspondent again reiterates his libel of me in the Advertiser of Saturday, August 30, and I now demand that a halt be called. He now states:the headings, "" War Loan"" Only a small minority of the members of the Federal Labour Party favour the policy pushed forward by the repudiationista, and notable among these is the member for Adelaide. Mr Yates has shown on several occasions his contempt for the Scullin Government's financial policy, and he may now have the opportunity of leading a repudiation section of the Federal Labour Party.""

My proposal is quite on a l l fours with "" sound banking practice,"" and was proved by Professor Gregory in his Fisher lecture last week, when he said, ""For internal currency the gold standard has ceased to exist, und the reserve banks in the different countries now meet their commitments with notes.'* Therefore, it is idle to say that Australia cannot do the same, or that such a proceeding would lie repudiation. Without mouthing the phrase, ""national and personal honour"" because someone else has said it , repudiation is unthinkable, and would be dishonest, but the continued burdening of posterity with faked credits is equally so, and should be stopped. I have urged a. safe and practical method oi doing this, and I have nothing to apologise for; nor do I desire to retract one word, and notwithstanding the gratuitous advice tendered by your correspondent, I intend still to continue my endeavours to give effect to Labour's platform regardless of the consequences.

WhatI strenuously oppose is the faking of our credits in the manner in whicb they have already been faked. 1 supported the motion moved during the war by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) as an alternative te borrowing. I believe in the principle now. Although this nation has been bled white, I do not for one moment suggest that we should dishonour the obligations to which this country has been committed. WhatI advocate is the prevention of further borrowings. The loans that are shortly falling due should be met out of our national exchequer by means of an extension of credit. By keeping the wheels of industry moving by that means, ultimately the results of industry itself would enable our obligations, both here and overseas, to be met. To-day unemployment is rife.

All honourable members will, I think, admit that we are not trying to run away from public criticism. We are used to it, and have no objection to it so long as it is fair; but when instead of criticism we have a contemptible lie and the distortion of facts, which are given prominence by paid satellites of the Nationalist press to create confusion in the minds of the public and thus strike a blow at the heart of democracy in this country, it is time that this Parliament took action. does not like the facts to be made known. the honourable member were made known, his electors would never return him to this Parliament. criticism ? member, by making that interjection, is showing his stupidity. No one would run away from fair public criticism. The action of the Advertiser, in publishing the statement which it attributed to the honourable member for Adelaide, is most reprehensible. The statement was concocted by the paid writer of a press which is intimately associated with the financial institutions of this country, with the object of creating a psychology to enable these interests to stave off any attack that might be made upon them. With the country in its present perilous financial position, these men should not be allowed to come here and abuse their privileges. They should be compelled to give the public correct reports of the proceedings of this Parliament, and should not be allowed to create a public psychology which will cause the people to uphold the interests which they represent, but. which may be attacked in this Parliament, Of course, one can understand the attitude adopted by honourable members opposite on this subject. They support the press because they support the same interests as the press. They have shown this afternoon, by their interjections, that they are not very much concerned about the misrepresentation and falsehood which the press is disseminating. In fact they are prepared to stand behind it, no doubt because they think they may If they had a spark of political decency in their make-up they would at least remain quiet, and not be so barefaced in their support of the shameful policy which the press has adopted.

The statement that has been published and uttered in many places that the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) and myself have advocated a policy of repudiation in this chamber is false. Any honourable member who, after hearing the speeches 1 have made on financial subjects in this House, or reading the Hansard report of them, could declare that I stand for repudiation would show himself unfit to be a member of Parliament and fit to be an inmate of a lunatic asylum. He would indicate that he had not sufficient mentality to understand, simple English. This Parliament, and all the parliamentary and governmental institutions of this country, should be able to rely upon the press giving fair publicity to the speeches made by their members. All public men, including honourable members of the Parliament, have the right to expect that their utterances, arid the policy of the parties with which they are connected, will be fairly stated in the press of this country.

The newspapers are a big lie from beginning to end. The proprietors of the press must have liars to do their work. If they could not get liars they could not get their work done. Parliament should be protected from cold-blooded liars of this character. The democracy of this country should not be subjected to the danger of assimilating lies every morning. If this Parliament is sufficiently jealous of its reputation, and if honourable members are sufficiently jealous of their rights and privileges, they will support the motion. member tell me whether he regards himself as a hireling? so regard myself. I am not like the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Parliament should be exercised only in Maxwell), who holds himself free to become the hireling and defender of any criminal who has sufficient money to Ijay him. I am paid to uphold principles in which I earnestly believe; I am not paid to appear in court for the purpose of screening any criminal who may have sufficient money to pay me to screen him. That is not my profession. I hope the motion will be carried. is a matter for regret that this subject should have been raised this afternoon, for the people of Australia are anxiously waiting to learn the financial proposals of the Government. At the same time, I can quite understand the feelings of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Oonmonwealth enjoys; but, in addition, Fates) if he considers that he has been gravely misrepresented. I must say, however, that the comment to which he has objected seems to me to be the kind of comment to which we are. all liable as members of this Parliament. The honourable member has moved a motion to the effect that the editor of the Adelaide Advertiser should be declared guilty of contempt, and that effect should be given to a resolution of this House some years ago, under which Mr Speaker may exclude from Parliament the representative of any newspaper which has reflected upon the integrity and good conduct of an honourable member, until such time as the newspaper gives full publicity to the honourable member's reply to the charges made against him. The motion raises the whole question of the relation of Parliament to the pressa very important and interesting subject. Our liberty of speech consists of liberty of speech in Parliament and on the platform, and also in the press. We should be careful to see that we do not allow anything done to preserve liberty of speech iu this Parliament to infringe unduly the liberty of the press. The course which the honourable member for Adelaide desires to be taken should be pursued only in very grave and plain cases. It has to be remembered that only one side of the case has been put to us the honourable this afternoon. The case is ex parte. The other side has not been heard. Paidiament should act very cautiously until the other side has been heard. Speaking generally, this special power of the gravest cases. Al l honourable members of this Parliament are subjected to public criticism, but they have more than an ordinary opportunity to reply to it. 'They are able to reply on the floor of Parliament and to obtain publicity for their remarks in the report'of the parliamentary debates. As a general rule, publicity is also given to their replies in all sections of the press which devote any considerable attention to political matters. Accordingly, honourable members are in a better position to defend themselves than are the general public. They have the right of action for libel if they are damaged in their reputations by any statements published in the press. That is a right which every citizen of the members of this Parliament have an opportunity to obtain publicity for their replies to newspaper criticism by speeches in this House, a privilege not enjoyed by ordinary citizens. It appears to me that the resolution to which the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) has referred would be very difficult indeed to administer. In the first place, its operation would depend upon the view taken by the honourable member concerned as to the character of the",16,Newspaper Criticism Privilege

All of us have opinions concerning press criticism of OUT public utterances. I am accustomed to seeing statements about myself in the press which are entirely without foundation. I have read allegations about myself, particularly in the Labor Daily, which were purely inventions-withou t any foundation whatever, immediate or remote. We all, at times, feel that we have good reason to complain about the attitude of certain sections of the press; 'but are we going to spend the time of this Parliament in discussing all press criticism that may affect our reputation in the eyes of the people? The resolution goes on to state that, if the complaint of the honourable member concerned is accepted by this House in good faith, certain action shall be taken against the offending newspaper. raises a difficult question. pected .to accept in good faith the statement of an honourable member that his chai-acter has .been unjustly impugned by criticism published in the press. Having regard to the differences of opinion that exist with reference to many political questions, and the fact that the application of this resolution will be determined on an ex parte statement, it may be extremely difficult to agree that an opinion of an honourable member on such a matter is justified. The particular complaint of the honourable member is that he is charged with being in favour of repudiation of the financial obligations of the Commonwealth. He declares that statement to be untrue. Others take the view that the honourable member's public utterances, if effect were given to them, would amount to repudiation. It is all a matter of opinion. In this House both views are held. This being so, it seems to me that the complaint of the honourable member is not one that should be dealt with by the extraordinary method suggested, namely, by excluding representatives of the offending newspaper from the precincts of Parliament. I suggest that on the contrary, it is desirable that the whole of the press of Australia should have the fullest opporunity to obtain accurate reports of the debates. No good service would be rendered by excluding the representatives of any journal. itr. Latham. member think that they should publish accurate reports of the debates? proposal of the 'honourable member will not be effective. We can all understand his indignation. All of us have been in a similar position ;on occasions; but it would he a mistake to apply .a motion .passed in 1912 to dea.1 with a similar complaint, .and, so far as I am aware, never put into operation. Surely this.should be taken as an indication of the practical judgment of Parliament since that time. I therefore suggest that the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), having ventilated his complaint, should withdraw the motion, and that we should get on with the important business which awaits this Parliament. We are exhonorable member for Adelaide having been given a full opportunity this afternoon to explain his position, should accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. ( Mr Latham) to withdraw the motion, or agree to an adjournment of the debate. Naturally, the honourable member is jealous of his good name, just as is every other honourable member; but I respectfully submit that he has not proved misrepresentation. The honourable gentleman has made many speeches in this House in support of his policy to inflate the note issue for the purpose of paying off Australian bond-holders. I , and many others, believe that an inflation of the note issue without'the security of real wealth behind it will, ineffect, decrease the value of Australian bonds, and that this amounts to repudiation. member must recognize that he cannot proceed far along those lines. The House is not, at the moment, discussing the merit's of any financial policy. effect of note inflation merely to illustrate the view which an influential section of the community takes of the proposal made by the honourable member for Adelaide. In ordinary circumstances, I should support his motion; but I am sure that if he realizes what note inflation means-I do not think he does-he will see that the Adelaide Advertiser",17,Newspaper Criticism Privilege

We have met this afternoon for a very important purpose. The country is anxious to hear the proposals of the Acting Treasurer to meet the difficult financial situation that confronts us. In the circumstances, the honourable member for Adelaide cannot expect the House to accept his motion. I am sure that all honourable members wish r.o get on with the business of the country. Debate (on motion by Mr I'ENTOKI adjourned. Assistant Minister( Mr Beasley) to say whether he concurred in the following statement made by Mr Lang; now Premier of New South Wales, whom he was. supporting in the recent New South Wales election campaign:Wc promised, and we paid, 7s. (id. a bushel of New South Wales, in regard to hif for wheat. What wo did then we can do now. Cs the honourable gentleman, us the Minister administering the Department of Industry, considering the taking over of the handling of wheat from the Minister for Markets? I should also like fco know how he explains the possibility of paying 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat? honourable member to produce the responsible parties in the press associated with the statement to which he refers, so that we may learn who they are. Latersonal explanation. In reply to my question, the Assistant Minister suggested that, in referring to the hopes held out by the Labour party during the recent election campaign in New South Wales, [ was quoting from unsubstantiated press reports. As a matter of fact, I was quoting from the Labour advertisement published in the Sydney Bulletin on. the 22nd October last, in which, under a photograph of Mr Lang, and over a facsimile of his signature, were given certain extracts from his speeches. The passage which I read, which tbe Minister apparently regards as unsubstantiated, wasWe promised, and we paid, 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat. What we did then we can do afford proper facilities for proof of memnow Mr Lang, at Parkes, Oth October, 1930. bership of a trade union? Clearly, that is not an unsubstantiated report. If what was said by Mr Lang was not definitely put forward in the form of a promise, it was certainly a suggestion that;' if made by a company promoter, would laud him in serious difficulties. fied that what the Premier of New South Wales stated honourable member is rising to a personal explanation he is out of order. Minister for Markets and Transport ( Mr Forde) whether on Saturday last he made a statement, reported in the daily press on Monday in a form whicb was rather difficult to follow, to the effect that the Federal Government had under consideration the granting of a bouuty of 2s. a bushel on wheat ; and, if that is so., whether he proposes any form of collaboration with Mr Lang, the Premier recent promise of 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat ? lished in the Melbourne Herald on Saturday, and again on Monday papers on Monday. rect-containe d an announcement that the Federal Government proposed to pay a bounty of 2s. a bushel on wheat. WhatI said was that the Federal Government, recognizing the parlous position of the wheat-growers, and that it is the duty of all governments to do everything possible to assist them, had convened a conference of Ministers for Agriculture of all the States, and representatives of the interested organizations, to discuss £h# whole future of the wheat industry in Australia. .ARBITRATION ACT.

The news of the tragedy, w h i c h occurred ledge and air experience, the replacei n the e a r l y hours of Sunday, the 5th ment, of which will take many years. October, near Beauvais, France, came as a profound shock to the people of Australia in common with those of other parts of the world. The airship had embarked upon a mission which everybody hoped would prove of great and far-reachand Telegraph Act-Regulation s ing importance. Her voyage lasted but a few brief hours. After crashing into a hillside in France, the machine took fire, and the majority of the passengers and crew perished in the flames, or died, subsequently, from their injuries. Among those who lost their lives were the Secretary of State for Air (Lord Thomson), the Director of Civil Aviation in Great, Britain( Sir Sefton Brancker), and many other prominent officials and persons interested in airship development. It was my privilege to meet Lord Thomson on a number of occasions whilst I was attending the recent Naval Conference in London. 9-Polic e Offences. I conceived for him the greatest admiration and respect, and can, with all sincerity, testify to the loss which Britain and the British Commonwealth of Nations have suffered by his untimely end. Squadron-Leader VV. Palstra, of the Royal Australian Air Force, who was in Great Britain as a liaison officer with the British Air Ministry, was another who met his death when the R.101 was destroyed.

129,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong,Acting,36,Resolution
130,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [4.30],"I'Che disappointment of the high hopes which had been formed of R.101 was a great blow to all who are interested in the navigation of the air. Once again the pioneers have succumbed to the hazards which are invariably incidental to the early stages of new and dangerous enterprises. This calamity, however, will be but a temporary setback; others of our race will press on to secure the mastery of the air. I join with the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fenton) in expressing sympathy with those who have suffered directly as a result of this tragic disaster, and particularly with the widow and child of the Australian officer, Squadron Leader Palstra, whom I knew personally when he was on the staff of the Melbourne University. His death is a distinct loss to Australian aviation. 1 associate myself with the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fenton) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) in expressing regret at the tragic disaster which befell R.101. The passing of many intrepid pioneers of airship navigation, public-spirited men, and eminent public servants, is a calamity not oidy to the British Empire, but to the whole world. Unfortunately, all progress takes great toll of the bravest and best, and probably the development of aviation has taken a heavier toll, proportionately, than almost any other invention. The most recent disaster, however, will merely be a spur to higher endeavour to eliminate all the risks associated with aerial navigation, and I am sure that the most fitting memorial the victims of the disaster will be the thorough conquest of the air. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. WING-COMMANDER KINGSFORD Prime Minister) [4.36]-h y leave I move That this House., having noted with gratification the record-breaking aerial llight from England to Australia accomplished by WingCommander Kingsford Smith, tenders its congratulations to him on his great achievement. Honourable members will, I think, ngree that Wing-Commander Kingsford Smith's recent flight is an event of outstanding importance i i i the history of aviation which merits the recognition of this House. Once again the skill and daring of an Australian aviator have stirred the imagination of the world and enhanced the prestige of the Australian name. It is not, however, the picturesque in Kingsford Smith's wonderful exploit that appeals to us so much as its value as a practical contribution to the progress of the latest and least developed of the world's systems of communication. From its inception the flight was followed with absorbing interest-nowher e more so than in this country. The remarkable progress achieved in its earlier stages gave rise to the confident belief that a new record for the air journey from Great Britain to Australia would be established. The anticipations thus founded were abundantly realised when we learned with pride and satisfaction that, on the 19th October, Kingsford Smith had landed safely at Darwin, having completed his flight within the remarkably brief period of 10^ days. Of all his dazzling achievements this is the greatest and most important. The previous record for a flight from England to Australia was held by an Australian, Mr Bert Hinkler, A.F.C., who, many honourable members will recollect, was the honoured guest of the Federal Parliament when he visited Canberra early in 192S. The man who has now broken that record is another Australian, and this to us is a source of the deepest gratification. The value of aerial transport in bridging long distances in the remote districts of Australia, and in lessening the discomforts and disabilities of life in those areas, is widely recognized and acknowledged, and it is not difficult to visualize the part it must ultimately play in facilitating international intercourse and promoting interThat Australian aviators should be doing so much it demonstrating to the world the potentialities of aviation is an inspiring fact.

Because that necessity has actually arisen we are meeting to-day. The financial and economic position of Australia is now more clearly defined than it was three months ago, and a revision of the budget adopted by Parliament has become imperative. It is now clear beyond all question that the estimates of revenue will not be realized, and that unless other steps are taken the revenue will beseveral millions short of anticipations.

The prospects of increased reciprocal trade with Canada and New Zealand, for example, are very encouraging. It is expected that the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) will confer further with the Governments of these dominions on his homeward journey to Australia. When returning to Australia a few months ago, I discussed the prospects of increased trade with Canada wi th Minister of Canada, Mr Malcolm, the Minister for Commerce,, and other Canadian Ministers. They were particularly favorable to closer trade co-operation bemeasure of employment for our people. tween Canada and Australia, and I have no reason to believe that the present Government of Canada is any less favourably inclined to such a policy. The same desire for increased interdominions trade was manifested by Mr search, and the Commonwealth railways. La Parelle, of the New Zealand Government, in the course of my discussions with him in Auckland. It is pleasing to know that Australian manufacturers are seeking overseas markets, and are encouraged by the prospects. I turn now to the position of our primary industries. The prevailing low prices for primary products and raw ing the problem of financial re-adjustment extremely difficult for us. When we compare these prices with the prices of two years or even eighteen months ago, it will be seen that we must almost double our production in order to liquidate th< same amount of overseas liability. The marketing of our products, in such circumstances, becomes a matter of increasing importance and concern. This is particularly the case in connection with the coming wheat harvest. The Government question of our wheat exports, and hopes to be able to make such arrangements with the State Governments and other interests as will ensure, the position being handled in the best possible way. A conto ference will take place next week with this end in view. Unemployment, unfortunately, is very prevalent. In normal times about 2,000,000 wage-earners are at work, and of that number 1,600,000 are employed by those engaged in industry. The Government is in close touch with those who have big projects in hand and is urging action. All who can provide employment are being asked to proceed w ith their projects and thus help absorb those who are suffering from unempljviuent. Where practicable, the Government will render every assistance. The Government proposes to afford assistance to the shale oil industry.

In the step he has taken, Mr Brookes has been actuated solely by motives of patriotism and a desire to help his country in its present financial difficulties.

Mr Fenton. In common with the peoples of almost all other countries, those in Australia are confronted with serious economic probresolutely and unitedly, I believe we can surer) [4.53] I present the following financial statement, and move That the paper be printed. In the course of his budget speech in July last, the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) referred to the deficits of the preceding three years, which at 30th June, 1930, had accumulated to £6,458,723. He budgeted to balance the accounts of the present year, but said that, in view of the depleted revenues, no additional taxation would be raised this year to reduce the deficit. He then made Parliament must recognize, however, that no During further d r if t in Commonwealth finances can be permitte'd and that the balancing of the budget is an essential step for the restoration of the credit of Australia. The Government proposes to watch the financial position closely throughout the year, and without waiting until the end of the financial year, w i ll uot hesitate to take immediate steps, if such action appears to be necessary, in order to prevent any' serious disturbance in the budgetary position. a policy that had previously been agreed upon by representatives of the Commonwealth and States at the Australian Loan Council meeting held on 10th and 11th June, 1930. At that meeting, when the Commonwealth was represented by the former Treasurer, the Hon. E. G. Theodore, consideration had been given to the general financial position, and the issued the following joint statement:The members of the Loan Council appreciate that the consideration of the financial position of the Commonwealth and each State involves a review of financial policy of each governOur ment, and that it is not the function of the Loan Council to determine, or even suggest, the form which that policy should assume. The Treasurers feel, however, in view of the difficult outlook generally that it is proper and advisable for them to urge upon all governments the need for the utmost economy in regard to expenditures, and also that it is essential that the budgets of the Commonwealth and the States be balanced for the",39,Ministerial Statement Business Of Thk Session
140,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Acting Treaforthcoming financial year. This is necessary not only because of the Australian position, but also because of the serious effect which the continued deficits in the accounts of the Commonwealth and States have undoubtedly had upon the credit of Australia abroad. At ii further meeting of the Loan Council on the 5th-6th August, when the Prime Minister represented the Commonwealth, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:That as the loan policy of the Commonwealth and States is wrapped up with the balancing of the budgets, representatives of the Commonwealth and State Governments should meet in Melbourne on Monday, 18th August, with the object of balancing the budgets. A Premiers' conference was accordingly convened, and, after full consideration of the whole position, the following resolution relating to the budgets was unanimously carried:-That the several governments represented ut this conference declare their fixed determination to balance their respective budgets for the financial year 1930-31, and to maintain a similar balanced budget in future years. This budget equilibrium will be maintained on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia of existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. Further, if during any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure, immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the budgets shall balance. F u r t h e r resolutions r e l a t in g to b o r r o w in g months ago. and other matters were also passed. 1930. No reasonable conclusions regarding the position of the revenue account under the new budget could be arrived at until the results for the first quarter of the financial year were available. results became available early in October, and disclosed a deficit for the quarter of £6,747,000. It will be appreciated that, the multiplying of the quarter's deficit of £6,747,000 by four would not give an indication of the deficit for the full year. On the one hand, interest and sinking fund payments falling due in the quarter were in excess of the pro rata estimate for the year, and on the other hand the bulk of receipts from income tax and land tax will not come to hand until the second half of the year. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the more important figures in the results for the early part etf the year. The actual receipts from customs and excise for the first four months totalled £10,230,000a shortage of £3,003,000 compared with the pro rata budget estimate for that period. If the customs and excise revenue does not improve in later months, a shortage of £9,000,000 may be expected under this heading. The receipts from sales tax amounted to £305,000 to 30th September, and to £385,000 for October. This tax was levied as from 1st August, and the tax on the hulk of the August transactions was not payable until September. Registrations of manufacturers and wholesale merchants have in some cases been' delayed, and there has also been some delay in the payment of the tax. Tlie limited experience of the operation of the fax gives no definite criterion of what the prospective yield for the ful l year will be. The indications are, however, that' there will be a shortage of at least £1,000,000 compared with the estimate, unless there is a revival of trade. The falling off of the estimated receipts both from the customs and excise tariff and from the sales tax shows clearly that the financial depression and dullness of trade have been accentuated since the financial proposals for balancing the budget were determined some four With regard to Post Office, the receipts for the four months totalled £4,426,000. or a shortage of £540,000 compared witli the budget estimate. It must be remembered, however, that the Post Office receives half-yearly payments in December and June for certain services. It is These not expected, therefore, that the decline in revenue of £540,000 for four months will be maintained for the ful l year. It is reasonably certain, however, that the estimated revenue will not be fully realized. The balance of the revenue may be expected to conform closely to the budget Estimates. Besides causing a loss of revenue, the depression has increased the claims for pensions and it now appears likely that an additional sum of £250,000 will be required during the year for invalid and old-age pensions, whilst war pensions will probably absorb £150,000 more than was estimated. The increas? in invalid and old-age pension claims in recent months has been abnormal and can only be curtailed by reducing unemployment. The sum of £400,000 provided in the Estimates for exchange on remittances to London will also be inadequate. When the Estimates were prepared it was anticipated that the exchange pool, to which I shall refer later, would operate from 1st January next and that a limited sum of new. money would become available in London during the financial year. It became necessary, however, to bring the pooling scheme into operation as from 1st September. The rates of exchange have also increased. On the basis of the present rate of exchange, an increase of £400,000 must be provided under this heading. In all, these unavoidable increases of expenditure total £800,000. In view of the total decline in revenue for the quarter and of these increased expenditures, it became clear early in October that the time had come for a review of the budget in accordance with the declaration made by the Prime Minister when it was delivered. The Government therefore decided to summon Parliament and to submit proposals for remedying the position. Before dealing with these proposals, it is essential that I should place before honourable members a brief survey of the present financial position. London Cash Position. The annual overseas liabilities of the Australian Government consist mainly of interest and sinking fund, and amount to about £34/000,000, of which the Commonwealth proportion is £12,500,000 and the States £21,500,000. For years past the Governments have relied largely on overseas borrowings to finance their loan works. For five years to 30th June, 1928, the net increase in overseas debt averaged £30;000,000 a year. The loan moneys thus obtained overseas were in effect exchanged for revenue moneys in Australia without recourse to the banks, and were applied to meet the annual overseas obligations of the Governments. As it has not been possible to raise any overseas loans for new money since January, 1929j our London payments for ifr. Lyons. a considerable time have been met partly by remittances from Australia and partly by short-term borrowing by means of overdrafts and treasury-bills. The overdrafts provided in London by the Commonwealth Bank have been made possible mainly by large shipments of gold from Australia. The short-term indebtedness gradually increased and on the 30th September, 1930, it stood as follows:Short-term Indebtedness in London. Commonwealth. States.

The latest quotation for Commonwealth stock is £75 5s., whilst on the sainc date, New Zealand securities stood at £102 10s. and South African at £100 15s. Towards the end of September, the Australian market showed signs of great weakness, due to the nervousness of holders. The prices of government stocks declined to such an extent that at one time the average yield was about 7 per cetit. This weakness was due to rumours that interest would be specially taxed, and to suggestions of repudiation and default. Immediately after the decision of the Government to call Parliament together and the simultaneous announcement that there would be no special taxation of interest apart from taxation of property generally, the market steadily and progressively improved. Early last week the market again went back, but it has since recovered considerably. Reduced Loan Programmes. I u dealing with the borrowing position, are now passing through, such co-operathe Prime Minister in his budget speech tion is a national obligation. of 9th July made the following statement :It has, I think, been brought home to all of us that the time is long overdue when borrowing abroad should be reduced to a minimum, and that the domestic market should in the amount of the national income. lie relied upon to provide the bulk of the For last year owing to the fall in prices moneys necessary for developmental works. of primary products the value of exports To revert to the overseas market for borrowing on the scale which obtained during tbe (excluding bullion and specie) declined lust, few years even if the market were access£44,000,000 and tlie total decline in ible to us, would be merely postponing the national day of reckoning, and, now that we are facing £70,000,000. that reckoning."" it should be done resolutely and with a fixed determination to arrive at a satisfactory and permanent solution of the problem. In 192S-29 and the preceding three years, the annual loan expenditure of the Commonwealth and the States was approximately £43,000,000. In 1929-30, it was £30,000,000. At the beginning of tlie present year, the Loan Council planned a programme of approximately £22,000,000. Subsequently, it reduced the total to £15,000,000. which was considered the maximum for which funds could be made available. Mr Jjyons. The loan programme of the Commonwealth for 1930-31 as set out in the budget speech totalled £4,127,000. In view of the reduction made by the Loan Council in the total amount to be borrowed during the present financial year, steps are being taken to keep the Commonwealth expenditure for the year within the sum of £2,623,000, whicb is the Commonwealth proportion of the -£15,000,000 fixed by the Loan Council. Loan Conversions in Australia. On the loth December next a Commonwealth loan of £20,000,000 matures in Australia. Of this sum, £2,000,000 can be paid off from the sinking funds. There are also shortages of maturing State loans of approximately £9,000,000. The Loan Council must therefore face a conversion loan of £27,000,000. This' is a large operation, but in the past the Commonwealth has faced much larger issues successfully and there is no reason why this excellent record should be broken; It will, however, require the hearty co-operation of all those who are able to help, even if only to a small degree. In a time of financial stress such as we Reduced National Income. The most important index of the financial position of Australia is to be found income amounted to some For the current year, notwithstanding a good wool clip and the prospects of a bumper wheat crop, there will be a further decline, due to the continued drop iu prices since last year. Wool is now averaging about 9d. per lb. compared with Is. 3d. for the clip last year, and about Is. 7d. for the clip of the previous year, and the price of wheat f.o.b. Australia is less than 3s. a bushel, as compared with about 5s. a bushel last year. The loss from lower export values fell in the first place on the primary producer, and, through his diminished purchasing power, it has permeated tbe whole community and has brought about further indirect losses. Up to the present the chief sufferers from the loss of income are the primary producers, the unemployed, and those in receipt of incomes from business profits which have seriously declined or vanished. General Comments. Before the Prime Minister left Melbourne on 22nd August, for the Imperial Conference, he seriously considered the advisability of cancelling his arrangements so as to remain in close touch with the local positiou. The Government felt, however, that as such important national issues were to be discussed it would be a grave mistake for the Prime Minister to absent himself from the conference, and they are hopeful that the results of the conference will be very beneficial to Australia. In the meantime a sub-committee of Cabinet has been closely watching the position in Australia, with the object of evolving means of improving the general position and stopping the drift of unemployment. The people of Australia have accustomed themselves to a condition of prosperity due in part to high prices for outstaple exports and to the heavy borrowings abroad. Now that the world prices of our primary products have seriously diminished, and the overseas investment market is for the time closed to us, a hick of confidence has developed. The community generally is at present in a state of inertia and is awaiting a lead As savings of £1,000,000 were made before from some responsible authority to restore confidence. Tliat lead should undoubtedly come from the highest representative body in the community, which is the Commonwealth, Government. Tho Government recognizes this responsibility. The first need in present circumstances is that the Government should take steps for the balancing of the budget. Revision of the Budget. It is not possible to estimate with reliability what the deficit on the basis of the July budget would be if no alteration were made. In the light of the results tb date, a deficit of between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000 might be possible if the position continued to drift and trade and unemployment became Avorse. On the other hand, with the restoration of confidence and the revival of trade and employment, a reasonable estimate of the deficit would be between £S,000,000 and £10,000,000. It is on this basis that the Government has approached the task of adjusting the budget. At the Premiers' Conference the Prime -Minister announced that any necessary revisions of the budget would provide firstly for a reduction of expenditure, and that adjustments of taxation would not encroach on the State fields of taxation. The proposals now submitted are as far as practicable in keeping with this declaration. They are designed so as to spread the additional burdens equitably over the whole community without unduly entering the fields of taxation on which the States rely. Savings on Estimates. The estimates of expenditure have been closely scrutinized and it is proposed to make additional savings aggregating £1.230,000, as follows :£ Post Office 500,000 Bounties .. 190,000 Defence .. 30,000 Ordinary services of departments 80,000 Railway's 15,000 Territories 40,000 Miscellaneous works and services and other savings . . .. 375,000 Total estimated savings .. 1,230,000 the Estimates of the year were first presented, the total reduction by administrative savings and economies now amounts to £2,230,000 per annum.

The National Debt Sinking Eund, which was established in 1923 for redemption of Commonwealth debts, was designed to pay off the post office debt in 30 years and war and other debt in 50 years. To that end, provision, was made for the necessary contributions from revenue. By law, sundry other payments have been made to the sinking fund which if continued would provide for paying off the debt in a. much shorter period. The most important of these excess contributions are reparation moneys and half .the profits of the Commonwealth Bank. The payment of these moneys to the sinking fund in times of abundant revenue was desirable, but the continuance of such heavy sinking fund provision in present circumstances would place an undue and unnecessary burden on the taxpayers of Australia. The total amount provided by the Commonwealth for debt redemption in 1928-29 was £6,230,000. £6,422,000 was so provided. present year the provision under the law as it now stands is estimated at £6,850,000. In the seven years since the establishment of the national debt sinking fund,, a total of £43,727,921 has been provided for the redemption of Commpnweallib. debt. This sum is £14,000,000 in excess of the amount required in that period under a sinking fund scheme designed to pay off Post Office debt in 30 years and other debt in 50 years. The debt of Great Britain to the United States of America and the debts of the Allies to Great Britain are being repaid over a period of 62 years. In view of all these facts, the Government considers there is ample justification for adjusting the sinking fund to the original basis of 30 and 50 years. Under this plan, the contributions from revenue will be reduced by an amount equal to the reparation moneys, the bank profits and other excess contributions. amount of the reduction in sinking fund contributions will be approximately £1,950,000 for the current year and the amount which will still be available for Commonwealth debt redemption in 1.930-31 will be £4,900,000. This adjustment does not in any way affect the sinking fund for State debts established under the financial agreement. Customs and Excise. Towards making good the' loss of revenue it is proposed to impose new revenue duties which are estimated to yield £3,100,000 annually. The amount that will be realized from, these duties during the remainder of the year is estimated at £2,000,000.. Mr Lyons. Details of the proposed new duties will be submitted by. the Minister for Trade and Customs to-day. Income Tax. The new income tax proposals relate principally to income from property. The object aimed at is an increase in property taxation, which, with increases by the States, will result in property bearing a fair burden in the plan of budget re-adjustment. In 1929-30, Income from property, broadly speakFor the ing, consists of interest, dividends and rents. The States themselves have no power to tax interest on Commonwealth loans and therefore the Commonwealth is the only authority which can effectively tax income from property, including interest on Commonwealth loans. Taxation of interest by itself is impracticable and would only defeat the restoration of national credit as it might be regarded as a breach of the loan contract. This has already been clearly demonstrated by the abrupt fall in market prices of government stocks in August and September arising from fears of special taxation of interest. AH fixed income from property, including, interest, is in a relatively better position to-day than last year because of reduced commodity prices. In these circumstances, income from property may fairly be required to provide more taxaThe total tion. The Government therefore proposes to increase the tax and to limit the present exemption in the following manner:It is proposed that a super tax of 1\ p.er cent, be imposed upon all incomes derived by every taxpayer (including companies) from property. The present exemption for property income is the same as for personal exertion income,, namely £300, and it vanishes at £1,200. In the case of composite incomes derived partly from personal exertion and partly"" from capital, the exemption is at present deducted as far as possible from property income. It is proposed(i) To reduce the exemption in respect of property income to £100. ( i i) To make tlie exemption vanish when .the taxable income reaches £200: and ( i i i ) In the case of composite incomes, to deduct the general exemption first or mainly from income from personal exertion .instead of income from property as at present. The total increase in income tax from property expected as the .result of these proposals is £1,500,000 per annum. In the budget for the present year, provision was made for an increase of 10 per cent, in the rate of tax <on income from personal exertion where the total income of the taxpayer exceeds £500. It is now proposed to increase the rate of tax in such cases by 15 per cent, instead of by 10 per cent, as was previously intended. The additional '5 per cent, is expected to produce £160,000 additional revenue. Special Income Tax on Salaries. It is proposed to impose special taxation on the allowances of Ministers and inenibers of Parliament and also on those salaries of government employees which exceed £725 per annum. This will be done by means of a super tax calculated on the gross remuneration and payable at the time of payment of salaries. In the case of Ministers the tax will be at the rate of 15 per cent. Allowances of members of Parliament will ibe subject to a tax at the rate 'of 10 per cent. As regards government employees, where the salary exceeds £725, and does not exceed £1,000, the rate of tax will 'be b 10 per cent., subject to the proviso that the salary shall not be reduced below £7.25 per annum. Where the salary exceeds £1,000, but does not exceed £1,500, the rate of tax will be 12£ per cent., but the salary will not be reduced below £900. Where the salary exceeds £1,500, the rate of tax will be 15 per cent., but the lower salaries of the grade will not be reduced below the amount to which a salary of £1,500 would be reduced iby a per cent, tax, viz., £1,312 10s. It is anticipated that this tax will produce £60,000 in a full. year. The summarized effect of the proposals now put forward is as follows:Amount for a Estimates full year. Amount for 193U-S1. £ £ Expenditure reductionsSavings and economies 1,'230,000 1,230;000 Sinking fund adjustment 1,050,000 1,950,000 Total expenditure reductions 3,180,000 3,180,000 iVeie tarnationCustoms and excise . . 3,100,000 2,000,000 Income tax on property 1,500,000 1,500,000 Income tax on personal exertion income 160,000 160,000 Special income tax ou .

With the restoration of confidence and revival of trade it is quite likely the deficit would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £8,000,000 or £10,000,000. The proposals now submitted provide for 'an 'annual benefit to the budget of i£8,'000,000, of which £6,880,000 should be actually reflected in. .the accounts of this year. A -careful survey of the finances has made it clear that it would be quite impossible in a period of eight months so to reconstruct the budget that a balanced ledger could be secured for the present financial year. The most that can be achieved, without undue sacrifice, is to plan the budget on such a basis that when it operates for a full year the Commonwealth will have redeemed its undertakings to secure a ""balanced budget."" The budget of the present year provided for payment <of a special grant of £320:000 to. South Australia. In view of the very serious position of South Australia, representations were made by that State for further financial assistance for this year. The Commonwealth was unable to provide assistance otherwise than in co-operation with other States, and the matter was accordingly discussed at the recent Premiers' conference. As a result a resolution was passed effect to the proposals for the adjustment under which the Governments of the of the budget. The principal measures several States agreed to forgo certain will be those for the amendment of the grants aggregating £850,000, which the income tax laws, the taxation of salaries, Commonwealth proposed to pay them, the amendment of the sinking fund law. and the Commonwealth Government and the grant to South Australia. agreed to pay this sum to South Australia.

The three motions which I have just moved have been introduced for the specific purpose of raising additional revenue. Owing to other tariff motions being before the House, the wording of this customs tariff motion includes items not now being altered, which have to be repeated for drafting purposes. These items are118(B) Roof coverings, &e. 118(c) Linoleums, &c. 197(B) Cutlery (as to deferred duty). 334(F) Writing and typewriting paper (as to deferred duty). I. shall deal briefly w it h each item of goods affected by the increased customs duties provided for. The first of these is manufactured tobacco. The present duty is increased by 2s. 2d. per lb. Oni m ported cut tobacco the rates are increased from 7s. I d . to 9s. 3d. per lb., whilst on the imported plug tobacco the rates are increased from 6s. lOd. to 9s. per lb. The increased duties imposed are countervailing duties, as the excise tariff rates on locally manufactured tobacco are being increased by 2s. per lb. All rates on coffee and chicory are being increased by I d . per lb. The duty, on raw and k i l n dried coffee and chicory is being increased from 3d. to 4d. per Ib., and on roasted and ground, from 6d. to 7d. per lb. The duty on tea imported in packets not exceeding 20 lb. is being increased by 5d. per lb., making it 6d. per lb. A duty of 4d. per lb. is being imposed on tea imported in bulk. Bulk tea was 19th June, 1930; 9th July, 1930; 6th November, 1930, formerly admitted free of duty. Mosi countries in the world impose a revenue duty on tea. GreatB r it a in had such a duty in operation from the 21st May, 1906, to the 22nd A p r i l , 1929. Among other British countries which impose tea duties are the following:Now Zealand -Te a in bulk, namely, pack agus of 5 lb. or over net weight, free, 2d per ib.: tea, n.e.i., 2d., 4d. South Africa -Te a in packets under 10 lb.. (id., 6d.; otherwise, 4d., 4d. British East Africa --4 5 per cent. (appro* i iriately 6d. per lb.). Cold Coast Colony find Ashantee -4tl pui lb. Canada -Te a imported direct from country of growth and production, and tea purchased in bond in United Kingdom, 7 cents, 10 cents; tea, n.e.i., 10 cents, 10 cents. Many countries other than British also impose revenue duties on tea. Among these are Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Norway and Portugal. The Government is therefore not making an innovation in imposing this duty. An increased duty of 10 per cent, is being imposed on lace for attire, lace flouncirigs, & c , the advances being from free, British preferential, and 25 per cent, general to 10 per cent, and 35 per cent, respectively. The rates on carpets, carpeting, floor cloths, & c , have been increased by 5 per cent, from 10 per cent. British preferential and 25 per cent, general to 15 pi-T cent, and 30 per cent., respectively. In retrard to fencing wire of gauges numbers 8 to 14 tlie British preferential tariff has been increased by 52s. per ton. Previously, fencing wire of British origin was admitted free of duty. The general tariff rate of 120s. per ton remains unaltered. With the coming into effect of the increased duty, the payment of bounty at the rate of 52s. per ton will cease. This is in accordance with the provisions of tbe Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act. The bounty paid for the financial year 1929-30 on locally manufactured fencing wire was £114,141. The payment of this bounty will now automatically cease. An increased duty of Is. per lb. is being imposed on filament lamps for lighting and heating, advancing the rates from per lb. free, British preferential, and 2s. general, to Is. and 3s., respectively. The increase imposed on cutlery, spoons and forks is 5 per cent. Fornieidy the rates were free, British preferential, and 25 per cent, general. These will now be 5 per cent, and 30 per cent., respectively. A duty of Id. per gallon is being imposed ou kerosene and other refined petroleum burning oils, n.e.i., irrespective on tobacco manufactured in Australia. of the country of origin. Previously, these were duty free goods. As the duty is so small, the Government expects that the oil companies will be able to absorb it. It should not be passed on to the conThe protection given by the present Gosumers. An all-round increase of Id. per gallon is imposed on mineral lubricating oil, increasing the rates from 3d. British preferential, and 3£d. general, to 4d. and 4Jd. per gallon, respectively. A duty of 4d. per lb. is imposed on crude rubber, rubber waste, masticated rubber, powdered or reclaimed rubber. No duty was imposed prior to the introduction of this motion. To-day rubber is down to a lower price on the world's market than it has been for many years. Rubber imported from any territory of tlie Commonwealth will be admitted free of duty. Rubber of Papuan or British New Guinea origin will therefore still be admitted free of duty, as Papua is a territory and British New Guinea is governed by the Commonwealth under a mandate. Urgent representations have been made Mr Forde. by interests in Papua that they should be given some measure of preference. They believe that these proposals will help them considerably. proportion supplied by those territories? endeavouring to supply the Australian market. A considerable amount of Australian money is invested in Papua and also in New Guinea, where a number of Australian returned soldiers are trying to make a living. The rates on typewriting paper are increased by 10 per cent. On sheets not less than 16 inches by 13 inches, the rates arc increased from free, British preferential and 10 per cent general tariff, to 10 per cent. British preferential, and 20 per cent, general. On sheets less than 16 inches by 13 inches, the rates are increased from 30 per cent. British preferential and 40 per cent, general to 40 per cent. British preferential, and 50 per cent, general. I now direct the attention of honourable members to the schedule of excise duties. An increase of 2s. per lb. is being imposed On hand-made strand the rate is increased from 2s. Id. to 4s. Id. per lb. whilst on tobacco manufactured, n.e.i. the rate is increased from 2s. 4d. to 4s. 4d. per lb. vernment to the Australian tobacco grower of 3s. 6d. per lb. will be retained, notwithstanding these increased duties, because the duty of 2s. 2d. on imported tobacco more than counterbalances the increase of 2s. per lb. in the excise on local tobacco. The excise duty on cigarettes to-day is 7s. 6d. per lb. If cigarettes are made from imported tobacco, which is the usual practice, there is the import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. on the leaf. Cigarettes made from locally grown leaf will escape this impost. The excise duty on pipe tobacco hitherto has been 2s. 4d. per lb. Pipe tobacco made from imported leaf, pays an import duty of 3s. 6d., making with the excise duty of 2s. 4d., a total impost of 5s. lOd. per lb. Manufacturers are producing a fine of the Commonwealth, cut smoking tobacco, in all essentials a cigarette tobacco which is largely used by cigarette smokers. On this tobacco there is an excise duty of 2s. 4d. per lb.,",48,Import Duties

144,Mr Forde,"The producers there are-plus of course tlie import duty of 3s. 6d. on pipe tobacco made from the imported leaf. Many persons in receut years have been discarding machine-made cigarettes upon which the excise duty is 7s. 6d. per lb. and are rolling their own cigarettes from imported leaf, which pays an import duty of only 2s. 4d. per lb. Notwithstanding the increase in excise of 2s. per lb. and in the import duty of 2s. 2d. per lb., the preference of 3s. 6d. per lb. in favour of the. Australian leaf stands, and I am in formed on reliable authority that within the next eighteen months f u l l y half i lie will Australian grown leaf. tection given by the present Government to local growers by increasing the duty on imported tobacco has greatly stimulated tobacco growing in the Commonwealth. Every effort is now being made to develop the industry further. This Government increased the import duties on manufactured tobacco, which includes plug and cut tobacco from 6s. 3d. per lb., imposed on the 22nd August of last year by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett), to 6s. 7d. per lb. then to 7s. I d . and now to 9s. 3d. per lb. It also in creased the duty on plug tobacco from 6s. to 9s. per lb. The margin of protection given to Australian grown tobacco will, we believe, enable the local industry to compete with the imported article. We regret the necessity to impose these increases in the excise duties or any other form of taxation; but we are obliged to iake this course to meet financial difficulties bequeathed to us by the previous administration. examine the figures dealing with unemployment since this Government came into office. Government during its seven or eight years of office made a tremendous mess of tilings which it is now the unpleasant task of the present Government to clean up. The increase in the rate of primage The previous administration had in mind duty from 2£ per cent, to 4 per cent, is not only the development of the Northern imposed in a resolution similar to that Territory, but also the adoption of a more proposed in July of this year.

The .scheme included the appointment of a commission to consider and recommend proposals for the development of Northern Australia and portions of Queensland and ""Western Australia. There were some negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government, which were subsequently broken off by the latter; but the attitude of Queensland towards the proposal was very cool indeed, and despite repeated representations from the Commonwealth, negotiations in regard to the matter did not even commence with that State. Frankly, I Mr Wa.ke.lcv. had in mind were not brought to fruition; If funds had been They neither appointed repreof their territory nor to But if we join with the Commonwealth in the now being experienced by the method of administering the There is no longer justification for the retention of a highly paid commission to advise the Commonwealth Government on the development of that portion of Australia. Up to date the commission has produced three reports, of which the previous Government took no notice; at any rate it certainly did not act upon any of the recommendations contained in those reports. The bill proposes to abolish this expensive and cumbersome form of administration of the Northern Territory, and to revert to the previous system. I regret that hitherto we have been able to do hut very little for the territory.

Before deciding on the action contemplated in the bill, I took the opportunity to interview as many persons as possible in connection with the method of administration now in operation in the Northern Territory. I appointed Messrs. French and Brown, responsible officers of the Auditor-General's Department and the Public Service Board, to investigate the present method of governing the Northern Territory, and, after a very careful examination, they recommended a reversion to the system previously employed. The consensus of opinion of residents in the Territory itself is apparently in favour of the action now proposed to be taken. Tho Northern Australia Act was responsible for the division of the Territory into North Australia and Central Australia. This division has brought about anomalies and difficulties, particularly in regard to the administration of land matters. It has added considerably to the cost of administration. Where formerly one ordinance was sufficient to cover the whole of the Territory, two are now required. pated saving in administrative costs? who conducted the investigation to which I have referred are of the opinion that a saving of between £12,000 and £13,000 per annum is likely to be made; but I am not so optimistic. After we have arranged for certain lands and works officers to be taken over by the new administration, I anticipate a saving of between £8,000 and £9,000 per annum. likely to be paid to the members of the Salaries. ling ExExTotal. commission ? what arrangements will be entered into £ £ £ between the Commonwealth Government, 2,281 332 235 2,848 and the members of the commission; but 0,321 300 1,096 8,277 1,183 444 8,421 8,004 as their appointments expire in August of next year/ if any compensation is 2,630 2,058 27,550 awarded it will not be any great amount. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. of the commission was the maintenance and operation of railways, subject to the terms of any arrangement made between the Minister and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. Upon the abolition of the commission, the Railways Department will, in all probability, maintain and operate those railways. Another duty of the commission was the construction and maintenance of roads, excluding the area comprised in the town of Darwin. That work will now be carried out by the Works Department, which will take over as many of the officers of the commission as are necessary to carry on those duties in North and Central Australia. Other duties were the erection of telegraph and telephone lines, and water boring and conservation, which will now be allocated to the Works Department. The construction and maintenance of cattle and sheep dips, and the imposition and recovery of charges for the use of such utilities will ne carried out by the Central Administration. There will be an administrator at Darwin and a deputy administrator in Central Australia. The latter will be given certain powers to carry out routine work, particularly with regard to land matters. As I have already pointed out, during the existence of the commission it was particularly difficult to further anticiprimary production activities because .of the sparse population and the consequent poor mail facilities.

157,Mr Blakeley,"Among the dutiesAlice Springs greater powers with regard to routine administration, the man on the land will benefit. The commission also had power to recommend and report upon the construction of railways in North Australia, to recommend the construction of public works in relation to ports and harbours, and to submit to the Minister schemes for tbe development of North Australia. That body issued its reports to the Government and did quite a lot of work with regard to preliminary surveys and traverses of roads and railways in North Australia. In 1927-28 some £21,000 was spent on railway surveys, while £6,628 was expended on similar work in 1928-29, and £450 in 1929-30, together with approximately £4,754 on road traverses, making a total expenditure of £32,837 for that type of work during the time the commission has been in existence. The tragedy of the whole ""thing is that after the roads had been traversed, the surveys made, and preliminary steps taken with regard to railway construction, it was found that no money was available to establish the proposed services. Personally, I think that coincident with railway development from the South Australian side to Alice Springs there should also have been railway development and construction from the Queensland side. ""While the North-South railway would pierce and go through the Barkly tableland, a line from the Queensland border, at a point somewhere about Camooweal and going straight across, would traverse the length of that extremely fertile country, which has such a high annual rainfall. the development of that area must originate from Queensland, rather than from Alice Springs. death knell of the North-South railwav. lines of communication would be of great benefit to the territory and to Australia generally. Already the connecting link with Alice Springs has proved its value, particularly with regard to the transport of cattle. The last season .has been a very gratifying one, and a large number of stock have travelled over the line to the southern markets and brought very high prices indeed. It is thought that eventually Alice Springs and the country in the vicinity of that locality will become a fattening area for the cattle which are brought from the Westralian side of the far north. With a continuance of the existing good seasons, the cattle would fatten on the land surrounding Alice Springs and quickly become suitable for the market, where they would bring high prices. It has been apparent, during recent months, how quickly that country becomes rejuvenated and transformed into fine grazing territory, even after a drought of five years. Some are of the opinion that the Government will save £12,000 or £13,000 a year by the abolition of the commission. I think that the saving will be nearer £8,000to £9,000 a year, and I hope to persuade the Government to make that money available to develop the pastoral industry in North Australia by the sinking . of wells and bores, especially along stock routes, where water i8 at present not available in the quantity or in the localities desired. Such facilities are' particularly necessary if the sheep industry is to be developed in the Territory. Portion of the saving will also be expended upon dips. The Territory is troubled with buffalo fly as well as with tick, and the fly especially is causing a good deal of trouble. So much is that so, that the Queensland Government has practically closed its borders against the entry of stock from the infested areas. Any money spent upon dips, and for the eradication of tick and buffalo fly will be well invested. The Government has not overlooked the development of mineral prospecting I believe that ultimately in both North and Central Australia A t present, there are from 70 to 100 men, subsidized by the Government under the Precious Metals Prospecting Act, combing North and Central Australia -for precious metals. The majority of these I believe that both men are experienced prospectors and bushmen. They procure a couple of camels and water tanks, make out west or north, as the case may be, and do not return until their food supplies are depleted, when they again visit civilized centres in order to replenish their supplies. Their activities in that rich metalliferous belt have already located some very fine silver-lead propositions, which, unfortunately, cannot be developed",56,Second Reading

Because of the lack of roads transportation costs are very high, and capital is at present, rather shy about going into that area to assist mining development. Upon the abolition of the commission the administration will revert to that of pre-commission days, as I have intimated.

I have endeavoured to show that it is not of much use maintaining a costly administrative and developmental commission if no money is available to finance the schemes which it submits to the Government. I have pointed out that some £32,837 has been expended by the commission on preliminary work which could not be brought to fruition because of the lack of funds. not apply to the new administration? be doing that kind of work. As an illustration of the cost of the commission I point out that salaries alone account for £22,062. years ? a half years. Travelling expenses amount to £2^530, and other expenses £2,958, making a total of £27,550 during the commission's term of office. That body has supervised administrative work that was previously attended to by an administrator, a small staff, and the Public Works Department. Road maintenance and construction, and the construction and maintenance of buildings and dips have always been carried out in the past with a smaller staff and at lower cost than by the commission. If money is available for expenditure in North Australia it should be invested in dips, wells and other mediums which will help practically to develop the country, rather than on developmental and road and railway schemes which cannot be put into operation 'until the financial position of the country improves cousiderably. In view of the expenditure incurred by the commission in preliminary work of the natutv to which I have referred, it seems to the Government and to me wasteful and costly is to continue a body which was originally intended to be a developmental commission, when the necessary money is not available to put its schemes into operation. I do not think that the commission would have been appointed had it been thought that the Westralian and Queensland Governments would refuse to work with the Commonwealth Government, even in the matter of appointing State Commissioners to cooperate with the North Australia Commission in the development of schemes applicable to their respective borders. The Queensland Government, as a matter of fact, has treated the matter very coldly, and has merely acknowledged the first letter that was addressed to it.

Under the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act, a bounty is payable on, inter alia, iron and steel, plate and sheet, galvanized, whether corrugated or not, so long as it is manufactured in Australia. The rate of the bounty was originally £2 12s. a ton. increased by acts of Parliament to £3 12s. a ton from the 1st January, 1928, and to £4 10s. a ton from the 1st January, 1930. By tariff proposals which operated from the 20th June, 1930, the duty on galvanized iron which entered Australia was increased by £1 a ton. In accordance with section 3 of the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act, which requires that the rate of bounty shall be decreased by an amount corresponding to increases of the heaviest importers. Section duties of customs, a reduction of £J a ton was made as from the date when the duty was increased to that extent; that is, there was a reduction from £4 10s. a ton to £3 10s. a ton from the 20th June, (< -) obtains entrance or re-entrance into 1930.

The company has given an undertaking that there will be no and immediate increase in the price of galvanized iron, and, before any increase is made, it is prepared to throw its books open to a representative of the Commonwealth Government, in the person of a qualified accountant, who will first satisfy himself that the proposed increase is justified. The reductions in bounty to which I have referred did not affect the Australian manufacturers of galvanized iron in regard to the competition which they had to meet from overseas, because the reduction of the bounty was offset by increased duties on imports. In SepThat was tember last, however, the Australian manufacturers-the branch company of John Lysaght, of Great Britain-foun d that, owing to the general falling off in demand for their product due to the prevailing depression, together with the competition of imports from overseas, chiefly from England, they were no longer able to carry on.",59,Second Reading

The company was manufacturing 28,000 tons of galvanized iron a year in Australia when the Australian consumption of galvanized iron was approximately 120,000 tons. In order to meet the Australian requirements it installed sixteen mills at a cost of £700,000, and it is nowup an Australian industry capable of able to produce sufficient galvanized iron to meet the whole of Australia's requirements. While the company was producing only 28,000 tons of the 120,000 tons used annually, it was importing galvanized iron from England. Instead of continuing that policy, however, it went to the expense of putting in another eight mills, so as to produce an extra S0,000 tons annually. It is estimated that, during the present year of depression, approximately 70,000 tons of galvanized iron will be sufficient to supply the needs capacity of the present works it will, if of the Australian market. If the Government had to pay a bounty of £3 3s. a ton on 80,000 tons, an expenditure of over £240,000 would be involved. A bounty of £3 3s. a ton on even 28,000 tons would require the expenditure of nearly £90,000. to provide that money. knows that there has been no increase in the price of galvanized iron. Furthermore, owing to the reduction in the price of zinc, which is lower now than for many years, and to lower costs of other necessary materials, it is possible that the price of galvanized iron can be reduced. The zinc used in the manufacture of galvanized iron by Lysaght's is produced in Tasmania. The steel bars are obtained from the Newcastle Steel Works, which in turn obtains its iron ore from Iron Knob, in South Australia. This is, therefore, an Australian industry. It is giving direct employment to 900 persons, and is providing indirect employment for probably three times that nivmber. Therefore, having regard particularly to the present state of the national finances, the Government was justified in coming to an arrangement which would relieve the Treasury of the payment of over £200,000 by way of bounty, and yet enable the company to carry on and furnish employment. It has to be borne in mind that the company requires annually 70,000 tons of steel, 11,000 tons of zinc, 3,500 tons of acid, and 200,000 tons of coal to meet Australia's requirements; while the number of employees engaged in supplying these wants is very considerable. It is better to help a company that is prepared to increase production, and build providing employment for Australian workmen, than to continue a policy which has resulted in a reduction of output, aud the dismissal of workmen owing to the competition from overseas. If the company were unable to carry on, thousands of persons would be thrown out of employment at Newcastle and elsewhere. The company has definitely decided that should the demand for galvanized iron become at any time greater than the the embargo remains in force, extend the plant to whatever size may be necessary to supply the whole of Australia's requirements. After the fullest investigation of the position, Cabinet decided that the situation would best be met by prohibiting, for the time being, the importation of galvanized iron, and at the same time ceasing to pay the bounty on the Australian product during the term of the prohibition. that be? hibition has not yet been fixed; but if the prohibition be lifted an adequate duty should be imposed to enable the industry to carry ou. This policy combines the advantages of-(1 ) at once providing employment for a considerable number of persons affected by the stoppage; (2) keeping in operation an important industry which it has taken many years to establish in accordance with the protectionist policy of the country; and (3) restricting imports to the advantage of the balance of our overseas trade.

How can Australia meet its interest payments and other charges in London, amounting, in the near future, to £36,000,000, and continue to pay for the imports which some honourable members opposite would like to see pouring into the country, even though our own industries are languishing? A further advantage of the arrangement is that it will effect a considerable saving of expenditure, and will thus contribute towards balancing the budget. bounty paid on galvanized iron during 1.928-1929 was approximately £90,000. This year it would have amounted to considerably more. Before the prohibition was decided upon must recognize that the Government has the whole position was gone into done the best thing possible by the taxthoroughly with the manufacturers-John payer, by the workmen employed by John Lysaght (Australia) Limited-and to enLysaght Limited, and by the public sure that the interests of all concerned generally. were amply provided for, certain undertakings under seal were given by the manufacturers. The matter was disadjourned. cussed between capable officers of the department, and a representative of the company,, who. adopted throughout a very reasonable .attitude. It was agreed that there should be no increase in price of galvanized, iron, and that if a prohibition were imposed, no demand would be made nnder the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act for any bounty on galvanized iron manufactured in Australia. The company's undertaking is in tliese terms:That in the event of and during the conPrime Minister) [8.44] I movetinuance of a prohibition issued under the Customs Act in relation to the importation of galvanized iron, we agree to make no claims at any time against the Commonwealth Government under the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act 1922-1929, in respect of bounty on galvanized iron delivered from the works or factory during the period of said prohibihave considered this evening and some of tion of importation, except in relation to a quantity of approximately 4,500 tons of galvanized iron at the Newcastle works or factory at the date of suspension of operations on 27th September, 1930, such quantity to be subject to verification by the Customs Department at Newcastle. The prohibition was issued on the 7th October, 1930, and the amendment now proposed to the act is necessary to enable bounty on galzanized iron produced in Australia to be withheld during such time as the prohibition on importation is in operation. The Government is satisUr. Forde. fied that it is pursuing the best course in the circumstances. If the bounty payments had been continued it would have involved the Treasury in the expenditure of about £100,000 which could not be paid without a great,deal of inconvenience. Nine hundred workmen would have been denied employment if the company had not re-opened its factory, and the stoppage of manufacturing would have affected other industries also. The effect would have been felt as far away as Iron Knob in South Australia, where the iron The ore is obtained. We have heard a great deal from honourable members opposite of the need for cutting down expenditure. The Government now proposes to save over £100,000 by this step alone. Any one viewing the matter with an open mind That the House do now adjourn.

201,Mr Fenton,"From present into wheat export that is being held simultaneously, it may be necessary to adjourn the House until Wednesday next. On the 3rd June last the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) informed the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) that he would make available to members the report of the committee of experts appointed by the League of Nations to inquire into the subject of the international regulation of whaling. The report is nowavailable, and I have had a copy placed in the Library where any honourable member may peruse it. the Acting Prime Minister give the House some information as to when honourable members are to have an opportunity to discuss changes have a far-reaching effect on the community, and the alteration submitted to-night is about the tenth brought down by the present Government. Over a year has elapsed since the first of the recent alterations was made: surely this Parliament is entitled to determine what taxation is to be imposed upon the people. The statements made concerning recent alterations are such that the matter sbould. be debated in this House at the earliest opportunity. I refer particularly to the duties on glass and timber. Parliament should lose no time in getting down to bedrock with regard to the tariff. Since the House is adjourning early been appointed under section 68(9)c of tOMiight, I am taking this opportunity the Public Service Act.

The Acting Treasurer has referred to-day to the savings that have been effected in this department. This is how they are being made. These men were classed as temporary employees. Others who could have gone to the front, but elected to remain behind, are now permanent officers of the department, while ex-soldiers are thrown on the industrial scrap-heap. The 36 men to whom I have referred, some of whom are partially incapacitated, have 74 dependent children. The number of unemployed has grown from 12 per cent, to 20 per cent, since the present Government has been in office,. Many of the men to whom I am particularly referring are partially incapacitated, and unable to follow their tariff alterations? These old trades. Having been taken into the Government Service, they have learned a Dew job. How are they to find other employment at such a time? If these dismissals effected direct economy, there might be some slight justification for them, although, personally, I see very small reason for the action taken; but these men were in receipt of only the basic wage.

205,Mr White,"Yes; but, under thereceives a pension. honourable member sacrifice both his legs for a sum less than the amount fixed as the basic wage for an ordinary labourer? The pensions paid to incapacitated ex-soldiers have no relation to the matter which I am discussing and are in the nature of a war reparation. If the Government is looking at it in that light, and considering whether the men it is dismissing are in receipt of war pensions, it is taking an extremely unfair view. As I have said, 1,429 returned soldiers have been dismissed from the Postal/Department, and nearly as many more have been discharged from the Public Works Department. If there were no alternative, the Government might be justified in saying that retrenchment of a temporary character was necessary in order to economize. But .arc there not alternatives? The men who were receiving £4 13s. 6d. a week in the mail room have been replaced by men from other branches-permanen t know nothing about the work, and are being paid up to £6 a week. Thus the Government is securing less efficiency than before for an increased expenditure on wages. Since rationing has been introduced in the Defence Department among staff-officers and sergeant-majors, surely it might reasonably be adopted in other -Government departments, instead of -throwing returned soldiers aside. nearly every instance these men are buying their homes through State institutions, and they have numerous dependants. Wouldi t not be infinitely fairer to introduce a system of rationing in the department ? Every loyal public servant realizes that, in some of its new proposals for the owing to the drop in price levels, and the unparalleled unemployment, the time has como when he must accept a cut in his salary. Mouths ago in this House, and before this Government accepted the policy of a reduction of parliamentary salaries, I suggested that they should be reduced, and the Opposition made a proposal accordingly. The Government has agreed to a reduction of members' salaries, but it refrains from making'any cut in the wages of the unionists connected with the Public Service AssociaI suppose that he tions. I believe that every loyal public servant would agree to a reduction in his salary rather than that returned soldiers should be sacrificed because of their misfortune in being classed as temporary employees. The Government should be strong enough to say that it would ration the departments all round, so that the men to whom I have referred might continue in employment until better times come. Some months ago, when the Government withdrew the policy of preference to returned soldiers in the Public Service, the returned men throughout Australia objected to its action, and the Opposition unanimously opposed it. The Prime Minister eventually altered his decision, and agreed to give the soldiers the preference that they deserved; but the present action of the Government suggests that ex-soldiers are to be thrown piecemeal, instead of on a grand scale, upon the industrial scrap-heap. I ask the Minister to explain his action and to consider the re-employment of these unfortunate men. deplore the fact that, not only returned soldiers, but also other employees in the Post Office are being dismissed. A number of these employees, many of whom I am personally acquainted with, have their homes half paid for, but these will be sacrificed. The Government will have to look for a new method of governing the country, and that very shortly, in In order to prevent the wholesale dismissals that are taking place. I am hopeful that the necessary action will be taken at a very early date, and that some honourable members opposite, who are deploring the dismissals that have been made for some months past, will support the Government purpose of finding money to help keep these men employed. will be supported. of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) was a member of a government that dismissed hundreds of returned soldiers from the departments.

210,Mr Mcgrath,"The Deputy Leaderwas not prepared to do anything that might injure the Nationalist Government then in power. The late Government, in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Trade and Customs, had given 1,400 returned soldiers notice of dismissal, when the present Ministry took, office, but the Postmaster-General( Mr policy of the last Government. He himLyons) cancelled those orders for dismissal gone since. compelled such action. promise of work for all? promise will very shortly be fulfilled. The Labour Government will have fallen down on its job if it does not bring about a big improvement in regard to employment. number 20 per cent. The figures have increased month by month. is true; but the policy of reduced wages and longer hours of employment advocated by the party opposite, would accentuate the problem. The difficulty is that we are producing too much. There are returned soldiers, and other armies of unemployed in need of rations and boots. Could not the Defence Department's factories easily turn out hundreds of blankets and boots? something wrong with the social system when so many members of the community are compelled to go without necessaries of life. that Labour will come forward with a policy that will result in a strong attempt to solve this terrible problem. I deplore the fact that not only returned soldiers, but many other workers are being dismissed. Thousands of young men who were not of military age even when the war ended, and therefore could not have enlisted are being dismissed; they too are deserving of consideration. I would that the Postmaster-General could accede to the request that returned soldiers should be retained in the positions they have filled satisfactorily for years past, but I know his difficulties, and I cannot sit silent while he and the Government are charged with initiating a policy of sacking returned soldiers. missal of returned soldiers was the policy of the Nationalist-Country party Ministry. cannot honestly say that that was the self cannot believe that. returned soldiers were dismissed by the last Government; their eight years of service in the department did not count. The previous Postmaster-General( Mr about the Gibson) made the blunder of holding examinations for cadet mechanics and the department was filled with boys who to-day are qualified and experienced. To provide work for them returned soldiers have to be dismissed. changed yet? for cadet mechanics has been held since the present Government assumed office. It has realized that too many boys were being taken into the department for whom employment had to be found when they became qualified. That could be done only by dismissing returned soldiers and others whose employment was semi-permanent. If the Postmaster-General can see his way clear to retain the services of returned soldiers and others who have received notice of dismissal, and even reThere is employ those dismissed by the previous and present Governments, I shall be glad. I am hopeful warmly endorse the appeal to the Postmaster-General by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), and regret that the honourable member for Ballarat the plea without making an attack upon the last Government. I admit frankly that many temporary men in the Postal Department and other public services who became redundant were put' off from time to time by the last Government; but there is a vast difference between laying off returned soldiers at a time when employment was relatively normal and dismissing them to-day when there is no reasonable probability of their securing work.

224,( Mr Mcgrath) Did Not See Fit To Support,"for theni. By appealing to the Postmaster-General or the Deputy-Directors of Postal honourable members have helped many men to get employment. there are no openings for the men who have been displaced. particularly on behalf of the 36 men who are being dismissed from the mail room at the General Post Office in Melbourne. As the honourable member for Balaclava has said, all are returned soldiers. I doubt if one of them will be able to obtain outside employment, and there can be no real economy in the national interest in smashing up the homes of these men, and, in a material sense, destroying their families. course, money must be saved in the government departments, and I appeal to the Postmaster-General to institute a system of rationing employment which will enable the services of the threatened men to be retained. It is almost incredible that if a plea were made to the 300 or 400 men employed in the mail room they would not agree to a certain loss of time in order to help the 36 men who served their country during the war, and are now being deprived of their livelihood. One case that has come under my notice is that of a returned soldier with ten years of service in the mail room. In all but the technical sense he is H permanent servant of the Commonwealth. He has five children between the ages of two and twelve years, and his homo is partly paid for. He qualified as a permanent officer of the department, but failed in the final medical examination because of partial deafness, due to shellshock. That was an absurd disqualification for the work of mail sorting. Now lie is classed as a temporary employee, and is one of the 36 selected for dismissal. If the Postmaster-General would take action in regard to this matter he would experience no difficulty. He should impose rationing arbitrarily; but, if he is reluctant to do that, I hope he will assure the House that he will plead with the permanent employees to share their employment with their fellows in this distressful time. I beg of him at least, to reconsider the dismissals retrospectively for a certain time with a view 'to Mr Gullett. re-engaging those whose services have been dispensed with during the last few Services, I and other months. To-day, had intended to raise this matter, for I am sure that, amongst the various ghastly I appeal surprises which honourable members received to-day, were the answers to questions relating to the number of dismissals from the Public Service in recent months. I very much regret that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) saw fi t to carry this matter into the arena of party politics. that have been delivered on the Opposition side but endeavours to gain a party Of advantage ? an issue that is above party politics, and there was no suggestion of party tactics in the speeches delivered by the honourable members for Balaclava ( Mr White) and Henty( Mr Gullett). When 20 per cent, of the bread-winners throughout the Commonwealth are out of. employment, honourable members surely have hearts and brains big enough to place the interests of country before those of party! On the 7th May the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), in the course of a statement in the House on the subject of preference to returned soldiers, saidThe conditions in contracts will, therefore, be that preference shall be given, first to returned soldiers and sailors, and, secondly, to members of trade unions. This will also apply to employment and dismissals in the Public Service. To-day dismissals are of more concern to the returned soldiers than are new appointments. The circumstances under which the Government was forced to face the issue of preference to returned -soldiers must be fresh in the memory of honourable members. But sufficient consideration does not seem to have been given to the reasons why returned soldiers are merely temporary employees. Men who could have gone to the war, but remained behind, .filled the Public Service during the years 1914-18, and when the soldiers returned the best that Parliament could do for them was to give them temporary employment. Many of them have been temporary for ten or twelve years, and now, when the axe falls, they are the first, to feol it.",65,Adjournment Business Of The House Interna Tional Regulation Of Whaling Discussion Of Tariff Amendments Postmaster General S Department Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Payment Of Overtime HMAS Canberra Training Of Midshipmen

That is their reward for having served their country in its lime of peril. Those who did not take the risk of going overseas were appointed permanently to the Public Service. tinued under various governments; but it is of no advantage to seek to allot the responsibility for it. The chaps who went io the other side to serve their country in a larger sphere than the Public Service a re now being thrown on a glutted labour market. promise made by the Prime Minister on the 7 th May last, I suggest ihat the Ministry should give effect to ihe recommendation of the Publio Accounts Committee in its report on temporary employment, that section 84, sub-section 9, paragraph c, of the Public Service Act should be put into operation. That paragraph provides for preference to "" returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed continuously for not less than two years but have not passed the prescribed examination, and in respect of wjiom the Chief Officer certifies that their duties have heen performed in a satisfactory manner."" It is not too late for the Government to take action in accordance with the recommendation of t lie committee; if that is done the returned that information is correct, but I can soldiers can take their chance with the other permanent employees in the Service. In this way relief would be afforded to a large number of men who rightly feel that they are not being fairly dealt by. After a decade of continuous and satisfactory service, chaps who did something in the Great ""War are being sacrificed by the Government because of afinancial and economic depression which, I believe, is only temporary. Rationing of work has been carried out in other branches of the Public Service, both Commonwealth and State. This Government instituted it in the Defence Department, and peculiarly enough, it affected the returned men and not the civilian employees of that department. It app'ears to me that this policy of retrenchment is to apply only to returned men. The Ministry should adopt the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee and make the returned men who are left in the Service-and there are not many of them-permanen t employees; it should give them at least an equal chance with those who remained at home during the war, when rationing of work or retrenchment is to take place. I appeal on behalf of ex-service men who are temporary and not permanent employees of the Public Service, only because they served their country overseas. The point which I am submitting for the consideration of the Postmaster-GeneralI n accordance with the is founded upon information which I have received from Sydney and upon which I am basing a question which will appear on the notice-paper at an early date. .1 mention it now because the question of the dismissals of returned soldiers and others from employment in the Postal Department has been raised. I have been informed that since the beginning of September last, about 700 returned soldiers have been dismissed from the Postal Department in New South Wales. At the same time, I am told that on Sunday, 12th September last, 300 permanent men were paid overtime rates at a cost to the department of some £600. I do not know whether the Postmaster General is in a position to say whether hardly expect that he would he aware of it unless it had been especially brought under his notice. I ask. that inquiries be made into this matter. While I recognize that sometimes a special rush in respect of a particular mail may meaD that overtime has to be worked by permanent employees, I submit that every effort should he made to so arrange the work of the department as to afford men who would otherwise not be employed an opportunity to earn some money. I have no wish to take part in certain recriminations which, I am sorry to say. have been used in .the course of this discussion, although I could say something in answer to what has been said by the honourable member for Ballarat",66,Adjournment Business Of The House Interna Tional Regulation Of Whaling Discussion Of Tariff Amendments Postmaster General S Department Dismissal Of Returned Soldiers Payment Of Overtime HMAS Canberra Training Of Midshipmen

233,"( Mr Mcgrath). I , Therefore, Content","myself by merely asking the Postmaster General to consider this matter of overtime with a view to seeing whether it is possible to employ some of the temporary men instead of working permanent men overtime. wish to support honourable members who have spoken about the dismissal of returned soldiers from the Public Service. My appeal to the Postmaster-General is for the limbless men in particular. It was only this afternoon that the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) brought under my notice the case of one of my constituents living at North Bondi. He is a limbless man, who this week received notice of dismissal from the Works Department. He has an excellent record and yet he is being dismissed. If there is any section of the returned men who should be kept in employment, it is the limbless men and I should be quite prepared to forgo, not merely 10 per cent., but 20 or 30 per cent, of my salary, Honourable members know perfectly well as a parliamentarian, if by so doing I could prevent their dismissal. A man who has lost a limb or is blind in one eye reason is that loan money is not availhas not much chance of obtaining work. I realize the difficulties with which the Postmaster-General is faced, but I urge him to try to do something for the limbless men. I rose principally to ask the Minister for Defence a question. Now that HMAS. Canberra is not to be sent home to join the British fleet, I wish to know how it is intended that the midshipmen who were to travel to England by that vessel shall receive their training. It is an essential training and I wish to know whether the non-despatch of this vessel will in any way detrimentally affect the training of our midshipmen? General and Acting Treasurer) [9.21] I shall make inquiries into the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). Of course, the policy of the post office at the present time is to dispense with overtime as far as practicable, and to exercise economy in every direction. In regard to the question raised by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and other honourable members let me say that no one regrets more than I do that returned men in the Postal Department or Public Service generally should be dismissed. When I took office, I found that the programme of works provided by the previous Government, and the amouut of loan money made available, would have entailed the dismissal of 1,700 men, mainly returned soldiers, soon after Christmas. I was concerned about the position, and, with the backing of the head of the Postal Department, I strongly urged the then Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to do something for these men. While"" it was very difficult to find any additional money at that time, he made special efforts on their behalf, and was successful in making available sufficient to enable us to keep them employed practically to the end of the filnlancial year instead of to the end of the calendar year. So that we did, by our special efforts, provide employment for these men for another six months. that there are two reasons why we cannot continue to employ them. The first able. As I pointed out in my statement to-day, we are cutting down the total Commonwealth expenditure in respect of the works programme of all departments to £2.623,000. Not so long ago the. post office, alone, could have provided for a works programme costing £4,000,000. dismissal of men engaged in the Works Department is inevitable. these men employed. Only returned soldiers are affected because they received preference of employment. But now that their work has come to an end, they must, be dismissed. We have done everything possible to keep them employed. To-day, we cannot raise the necessary money for that purpose. Eveni f it were available we could not profitably expend it, because the demand for postal services is decreasing all round, and, where a few months ago we could have expended money to provide facilities for the people, to-day their provision would be unjustified.

It is too late in the day to raise this question. As has already heen pointed out, returned men have been dismissed in the past because their services were no longer required. They are being dismissed to-day and no one regrets that more than I do. Our present financial position precludes their minister the law, and any member of the employment. How can we attempt to balance the budget for the year if we keep all there is to it . If Parliament is prein employment men whom we cannot proporly utilize? We cannot exercise economy if we employ two men where there should be only one man. Honourable members cannot have it both ways. It has been suggested, as an alternative to dismissal, that the work of the Public Service should be rationed. The Government did institute rationing for temporary hands in order to keep them employed as long as possible, but their employment is now at an end. There are no works to be carried out.

I am quite prepared now to go into the whole matter with the departmental heads to see whether something more cannot be done for these men, but the fact remains that I am obliged to administer the act as I find it.

""We have done everything that we can possibly do to avoid dismissals. If any other suggestions can be made they will be carefully considered. for Defence) [9.31] -In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) with reference to the stopping of the Canberra from going to Malta for exchange duty, I only wish to say that the whole matter was governed by financial considerations. The policy of exchanging vessels has been followed, in the past, and naval ratings and officers have been sent to the Old Country for experience. ""We have no money for that purpose at present. It would have involved the country in considerable expense to exchange the Canberra for the Shropshire. We should have had to pay the salaries and wages of our. officers and men overseas, and with the heavy exchange rates at present obtaining the cost would have been much greater than under normal conditions. It might be suid that the men on the Shropshire would be spending their money in Australia, but their remuneration is on a much lower scale than the pay of our men, :iud the Government felt that it was not justified in putting the country to heavy expense in this connection under existing circumstances. There would, of course, also be heavy expense in connection with oil fuel, and other things. While the policy of exchanging ships is good its continuance could not be justified under present conditions. ment propose to train midshipmen, if they are not sent home. MrA GREEN -They get a very good training in Australian waters. Next month a number of them will be sent on duty near Tasmania, where they will comae into contact with the men on a couple of New Zealand boats. The rubbing of shoulders with these men will not be costly, and will be beneficial to both services. Question resolved in the affirmative.
