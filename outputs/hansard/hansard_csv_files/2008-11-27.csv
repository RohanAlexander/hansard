Thursday, 27 November 2008 ----Forrest Electorate: General Practice Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.30 am)-I wish to speak about the shortage of doctors in the south-west of Western Australia, particularly in my electorate of Forrest. We certainly have a distinct shortage of doctors, even throughout the rural towns and communities. It is an issue that comes through my office on a regular basis. I actually have people ringing my office to see whether I know where they can get a doctor’s appointment. It is not unusual for people to wait between two and five weeks, and sometimes more, to see a doctor. In fact, some people have been looking to see a doctor outside their immediate area. June Foulds from the Greater Bunbury Division of General Practice has advised me that the latest statistics show that Bunbury’s ratio of GPs to residents is one of the worse in Western Australia. Bunbury is a regional centre for the south-west and it is a regional health centre. It is a regional campus for health. Its postcode does not always reflect the numbers of patients that are drawn from other areas, which often makes it difficult when assessing the various ratios. In 2006 the city had a ratio of one doctor to every 1,612 people, which is well above the national ratio of one doctor to 1,172 people, according to the Primary Health Care Research and Information Service. That is over 27 per cent above the national average. The Greater Bunbury Division of General Practice Chief Executive, June Foulds, has said that the district is at least 11 doctors short of what is required. We have many doctors who need to work part time and we have some who are particularly loyal. We have one very senior aged gentleman, Dr Manea. He is an icon. He is part of the region. I would say that Dr Manea would be in his 80s. He is completely devoted to his patients and will not give up practice while those same patients do not have an alternative doctor to see. The shortage of doctors is significant right throughout my electorate, certainly not just in Bunbury. Potentially 30 per cent of the patients that are seen by Bunbury doctors come from outside the Bunbury 6230 postcode area. That is the situation for health care in my electorate. Sydney Electorate: Lord Howe Island Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.33 am)-I want to report to the Committee about a recent rescue on Lord Howe Island. Lord Howe Island is part of my electorate of Sydney. One of my constituents, Pam Goyen, a resident of Lord Howe Island, wrote to me about an incident, which was also reported in the marvellous local paper, the Lord Howe Island Signal. Climbing Mount Gower is a serious challenge. I can show you the view from the top of Mount Gower. It is an all-day walk. It is one that I have done, and I must say there are parts of it that are quite terrifying. One part of the walk is along a ledge. This article describes it: Ledge is an overstatement, so is Jan’s 50 centimetres. There’s a rope attached to the cliffside on the left and I’m told to use it for safety but my hands are sweating and I fear I will slip. To my right, as far as the eye can see, is the ocean, where the wind swallows your screams; beneath me, a cliff that plunges hundreds of metres to the sea. MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Matters Of Public Importance
260,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,"Recently a woman who was on her return from this walk slipped and broke her leg very badly and was losing blood. She was in a party led by an experienced guide, Jack Shick, with an assistant guide, John Trey. I have climbed the mountain with Jack Shick and indeed he is a marvellous guide. They were able to apply first aid and stop the bleeding. But it took 25 wonderful people, including the relieving doctor and nurse, to walk back up the mountain and stretcher this woman down in the dark on a slippery, muddy track. I cannot tell you how difficult this track is for people who are able-bodied, but carrying someone else down the track is indeed a phenomenal act of bravery. Not only was it dark and muddy but there were also strong winds and part of the track is literally only wide enough for one person, with sheer cliff falls down to the ocean and the sharp rocks on the other side. Lord Howe Island is a small remote island. As Pam Goyen said: Over there you’d have a rescue helicopter and all that goes with it but this was done by manpower and God’s grace. The air ambulance cannot land on the Lord Howe Island airstrip after dark-it is not lit-so another visitor to the island chartered a small aircraft and had this woman taken back to the mainland for medical treatment. It was a marvellous rescue, a tribute to the islanders. I would be happy to support nominations for bravery awards for all of those who were involved in the rescue. I should also add that the government has recently provided $560,000 in funding under the Caring for our Country grants scheme for the eradication of rats and weeds, which was much needed and well received by the islanders of Lord Howe Island. Young People in Nursing Homes dear to my heart and one that has been an issue for me ever since I came into this political career. It is the issue of young people living in nursing homes. I have a particular nursing home in my electorate called Carrington, and I have been out there on several occasions and visited these young people who have been through the mill. They are living in this nursing home with a lot of very elderly people. They are being cared for. It is true that they are living their life in a wheelchair or in a nursing home bed, but they are still young on the inside. They are people who have fallen off horses and cracked their skull on the ground; they are people who have been in car accidents, motorbike accidents and even had swimming accidents. As a consequence of all of that, they find themselves in wheelchairs and in nursing homes because in New South Wales there are no other facilities available to them. There is an organisation called Youngcare which is doing phenomenal work up in Queensland. It was set up for this very purpose. These young people need support and care but they also need stimulation from other young people and young surroundings. For that very reason I took a number of these people out to Oran Park Raceway in the bus that was provided to us. They spent the day out with me and they watched the motor car races out there. That was their first outing like that-doing young things, getting involved with things that they still had an interest in-in all the time that they had been there, and in some cases we are talking about four to five years. I call on the New South Wales government to please address this issue. SinceI came into this job, I have had numerous people, including federal ministers, come out and have a look at the situation in New South Wales. Whilst there have been commitments by the federal government to provide funding for beds, that has not been followed up by state government supMAIN COMMITTEE",137,Constituency Statements
261,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (9.36 Am),"TodayI rise to speak on a subject which is veryport and consequently those beds have not been provided. I call on this House to address this issue, for people to be more aware of this issue and for us as a nation to work with the state governments to come up with an answer for these young people so that they may have a more fulfilled life. Just because they are in a wheelchair, just because they have had an unfortunate accident, does not mean they should be consigned to a life without stimulation as far as their mind is concerned. They should be able to watch young programs, listen to the music that they like to listen to and be able to experience some things that will give them an improved quality of life. Port Adelaide Electorate: Dolphins ures, alongside our football teams, of the electorate of Port Adelaide-that is, our dolphins. Some years ago the Rann Labor government declared the Port River up to the Gawler River, I think, a dolphin sanctuary-the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary, which is home to about 30 bottlenose dolphins and visited by hundreds more dolphins. It is the world’s first such sanctuary in an urban environment. I recently met with Dr Mark Bossley, who has been studying the Port River dolphins for some 20 years and is the regional managing director of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society of South Australia, to talk to him about the possibility of a dolphin interpretive centre in Port Adelaide. The sanctuary is regularly patrolled by government rangers, but dolphins are still needlessly suffering, often due to carelessness by people who use the river and due occasionally, I have to say, to some malice on the part of humans who think it is fun to attack them. Dr Bossley believes that education is the next extension of the sanctuary in order to provide real safety and security to the dolphins that live in the river. The society is currently preparing a feasibility study for an interpretive centre in Port River, and I know that such a centre would promote further awareness of the sanctuary and provide visitors with information about these complex and fascinating creatures-their intelligence, their teamwork, their communication abilities and their sociability. Visitors to the centre would be able to learn about the extraordinary dolphin Billy, a wild dolphin who spent a short period of time at a marine park that used to exist in Adelaide called Marineland where he picked up some new tricks. Honourable member interjecting-Free Billy! which is actually a trick not known to dolphins in the wild. Once released into the wild, Billy set about teaching other dolphins in the river how to tail walk. I am sure people will remember, particularly those opposite, the phenomenon of moonwalking in the 1980s. I am sure those opposite did that at various discos. This is the dolphin equivalent of moonwalking and Billy has been teaching it to some of the dolphins in the river. By using displays such as the dolphin’s eye view of the river people can form an emotional connection to these mammals and an understanding of their behaviour. As I visited the river with Dr Bossley we also saw a new calf, the only new calf born in the last three years, who is called Hope. Seeing Hope the calf dolphin and the other dolphins there I could not do anything but wholeheartedly support the society in its bid to create an interpretive centre in Port Adelaide.

As the Deputy Prime Minister announced in this place yesterday, the receiver of ABC Learning Ltd has identified that 656 centres will continue to trade as normal in 2009. That is obviously good news, but I fear for the future of those centres listed on the ABC website as being ‘subject to further operational review’. In the electorate of Gippsland, there are three centres at Sale, one in Lakes Entrance, one in Maffra and one in Morwell which are listed in this category on the website. I am reassured by the words of the minister and the receiver that this does not necessarily mean these centres will not be operating in 2009, but we can expect a further announcement within a week. This is an incredibly complex and difficult issue for all concerned. Of course we are all concerned about the quality of care and level of service provided, particularly in our regional communities. We need to provide these services in an affordable and accessible manner to allow parents to have the flexibility to be involved in the paid workforce. My thoughts are also with the many loyal staff, who are concerned about how they are going to pay their own bills if the worse happens and centres close in Gippsland next year. I congratulate the minister for being very upfront and keeping the parliament informed on this issue with regular statements. I have already written to the minister and sought some assurances on behalf of the staff in Gippsland in relation to their entitlements. NowI seek the minister’s support for towns in my electorate that may lose their only childcare centres in 2009 without any opportunity for replacement services to be developed in the meantime. I do not believe it is the government’s job to continually bail out a failed business, but there is an obligation to provide an essential service where a market based model has failed. It has been a very easy target for the current government to attack the previous administration for allowing ABC Learning to become too big; but I think it is always easy to be wise after the event. Gippslanders are not interested in petty political point-scoring or the blame game when it comes to the provision of childcare services, particularly in our regional areas, where the options are often very limited. The government says it has a taskforce in place which is working with the receiver and it does sounds promising, but Gippsland families want a guarantee that there will be somewhere for their children to be safely cared for in 2009. I urge the minister to remember the small country centres that are caught up in this issue. If there are no alternative service providers, the government must act to guarantee services in the future. I am urging the minister to continue to work with the service providers, both the commercial service providers and the not-for-profit sector, in Gippsland and to work with the local communities to ensure that we are in a position to develop local solutions to this problem. The bottom line is that we must have these services available to regional families in 2009, and I am committed to working with the government to ensure that happens.

Awards such as these say thank you to those who work tirelessly to develop and improve in their chosen field of endeavour or interest. There are eight different categories of awards to be won and they include: primary industry, volunteering, press events and tourism, disability achievement, environment and sustainability, outstanding achiever, economic development and tourism business enterprise, and community of the year. This gives us the opportunity to recognise all the different achievers in our community. I am pleased to be going to these awards at the invitation of one of my very special towns, the community of Rossarden and Gipps Creek, two delightful spots high up in the Fingal Valley almost on the slopes of Ben Lomond. It is a magic spot with people with enormous energy and spirit, so I am very proud that some of them are finalists on Saturday night.

Budget were going to get a government that was very much in the responsible Howard-Costello mould, one that would know how to manage the national economy and one that would know how to steer the Australian $1.1 trillion economy in tough economic times, they were sadly mistaken. I certainly knew that the people of Ryan were not going to risk their constituency with a Labor member and they very kindly and very generously returned me. I want to say ‘thank you’ in the parliament again and to honour their confidence and their faith. We have today a significant, indeed profound, economic challenge ahead of us-one that requires genuine leadership, one that requires expert leadership and one that requires leadership that has, as its central features, courage and expertise. But we find, of course, in the new Prime Minister and in the new Treasurer, both from Queensland, leaders who are way out of their depth and really do not know what they are doing. I know that the people of Ryan will be deeply concerned that the government appears to be taking the budget into deficit. I want to take my constituents to a comment by a very distinguished public commentator, one who has been in and around politics for decades. I refer to the Editor-at-Large of the Australian, Paul Kelly. Yesterday he made the following very profound and very insightful remarks.

I think this sentence more than any other I have heard goes to the heart of both the challenge facing the government and the ineptitude of the government. Families across the country, including families in Ryan, do not want their budget to go into deficit. In 1996, when the Howard government was elected, it confronted a $96 billion black hole. That was a significant amount of money and it took nearly a decade to right it. We fear that generations of Australians will pay the price very deeply. (Time expired) Hindmarsh Electorate: Cypriot Community to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Cypriot community in South Australia. Cypriots were first recorded in Australia in the 1850s. They were mainly Cypriots who came to Australia as gold prospectors. But after the British takeover of Cyprus in 1878 more Cypriots arrived, with many working their way to Australia as crewmen on British ships or coming on British passports. The first significant arrival of Cyprus-born immigrants began after World War II, in response to the politically unstable homeland. Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960, but in 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and displaced nearly half of the island’s total population. This caused increasing numbers of Cypriots to migrate to Australia, with the community almost doubling in size. In my electorate, for example, there are well over 2,000 people who identify themselves as Australian Cypriots. I am pleased to say that the Australian government continues its support for a UN resolution for the peaceful resolution and reunification of the island. We recently saw the appointment of Alexander Downer as United Nations Special Envoy to Cyprus. I would like to congratulate Mr Downer on his appointment. I had the pleasure of meeting with him to discuss some of these issues, and I am sure that he will do all he can to ensure a peaceful resolution and a peaceful reunification of the island soon. As we celebrate this significant anniversary this weekend, the Australian government will be continuing its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and for achieving a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem. The Republic of Cyprus has resolved that any actions which are contrary to binding UN Security Council resolutions in Cyprus should be avoided. The primary goal of the President of the Republic of Cyprus, His Excellency Mr Demetris Christofias-whom I have had the pleasure of meeting on two occasions-is for a just, viable and functional solution to the Cyprus problem in accordance with UN resolutions on Cyprus, international and EU law. The President’s initiatives have led to the resumption of fully-fledged negotiations under the auspices of the UN Secretary General. The aim of Cyprus is for a solution that will reunite the territory, the people, the institutions and the economy of the country, restore and safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Cypriots, and terminate the occupation. The Republic of Cyprus believes this can be achieved in accordance with the agreed basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation-as envisaged by the 1977-79 high-level agreements with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions-with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship and a single international personality. The Republic of Cyprus hopes that foreign troops are withdrawn and that Turkey, with whom the key to a solution lies, will show the necessary political will and constructive approach in light of the direct negotiations currently MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Constituency Statements

For instance, illegal settlers, guarantees and the withdrawal of occupational troops from the island are fundamental issues that Turkey has to deal with. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Grandcare federal member for Swan last December was at a Christmas event for Grandcare. Grandcare is an organisation that helps grandparents who are put in the position of having to look after their grandchildren. Sometimes the situation arises because the child’s parents have died. On other occasions children have been removed from their parents because of parental problems with alcohol, drugs, violence or divorce. Either way, suddenly having to raise a child can have significant lifestyle and financial implications for the grandparents. I ask members present today to imagine the impact that suddenly having to take on the responsibility for a child can have on people thrown into this position. Without an income other than a pension and beyond working age, grandparents often struggle to cope. Grandcare assists in many ways. It acts as an advisory group and makes grandparents aware of the benefits available, such as fostering assistance. Many grandparents are unaware of the existence of extra support, believing that it is simply a duty of theirs. Grandcare also helps fundraise. On 14 DecemberI shall be attending the Ascot Rotary Club’s Christmas sausage sizzle at Burswood Park. Christmas food baskets will be given to grandparents, created with the generous support of the Rotary Club and charitable organisations such as Foodbank in Welshpool. Food baskets will also contain Christmas goodies to help lift spirits over the festive season. Grandcare has an extraordinary group of supporters, like Gwen and Michael Evans from the Ascot Rotary Club, who help to raise money. Social events last year helped raise approximately $1,000. A three-day campaign at the Swan District Football Club helped raise $2,000, and the Rotary Club of Ascot has donated a commendable $2,500. It is reassuring to live in a community where there remains a remarkable spirit of volunteering and donating to charitable causes. Aside from financial support, grandparents often need emotional support. Community events organised by Grandcare help to provide this. Next year, one of the outings planned will take 28 local grandchildren on a trip to Point Walter. This will provide a break for the grandparents while also being a fantastic opportunity for the grandchildren. Grandcare is a particularly important issue to me as it involves fostering. In my first speech, I said that, although I welcomed the apology to the Indigenous population earlier in the year, I was concerned that the apology disregarded the good that can come from removing children from abusive and neglectful situations. It was disappointing to see on page 1 of the Australian on Monday, 24 November an article entitled ‘Aboriginal foster generation exceeds stolen generations’. The article referred to a figure of approximately 4,000 Aboriginal children in New South Wales state care. I agree with Stephen Hagan of the Centre for Indigenous Knowledge at the University of Southern Queensland, who said that those children at risk must be removed from their homes. I hold this opinion from my own experience. In this spirit, I urge governments across Australia to make sure the children are removed from at risk situations and I encourage as many families in Australia as possible to consider becoming foster parents.

268,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.54 Am),"The first official duty I undertook after I was declared theBlaxland Electorate: Cabramatta culinary delights. It is a very busy shopping district in my electorate, but it is a community that has had to endure a lot. In the mid-1990s, Cabramatta had a reputation for drugs, crime and gang activity, scaring many families and shoppers away from the area. The fear of crime has now waned. Shoppers and families are returning to the area in their thousands and community pride and enthusiasm have returned. What Cabramatta desperately needs now is more car parking. Cabramatta is facing another challenge in the coming year. The planned southern Sydney freight line will run right through the middle of the town. It is a very important piece of infrastructure for Sydney and the country. It will help get freight off Sydney’s roads, but it does come at a price for the people of Cabramatta. It will split the town in two, separated by a fourmetre noise wall, having a big impact on the community and especially local businesses. Cabramatta is a resilient town. It has been through worse than this, but I think that we as a government and a parliament have an obligation to minimise the impact that this freight line will have on the town of Cabramatta. That is why over the course of the last year I have made representations to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts for a compensation fund for Cabramatta to compensate for the impact that the freight line will have on my local community. The fund would provide support to help the town continue to thrive; it could help provide things like additional car parking. It is something positive that a project like this can do for Cabramatta. That is what I told the minister for the environment when I led a deputation from Fairfield City Council and the Cabramatta Chamber of Commerce to see him in May and when I organised a site inspection in July. In August this year, Minister Garrett announced that the Australian Rail Track Corporation would be required to fund a $2 million community amenity offset plan as part of the approval for the freight line. The plan is now before the minister for approval. The ARTC has proposed a $2.8 million plan, with $750,000 for parking in Cabramatta. That is good, but it is not good enough. I would like to see the majority of the fund spent in Cabramatta-and spent on car parking. Whatever the minister approves, there will be more money for parking in Cabramatta, and that is a good thing. Some of the $1.3 million that the federal government has given Fairfield council to fund urgent local community infrastructure should also be spent on car parking in Cabramatta. Car parks are expensive. Just putting one deck on the Fisher Street car park, providing an extra 60 spaces, will cost more than $2 million. Fixing the car parking problem is going to require the support of all levels of government. Fairfield council has to stump up. So does the state government. I know Fairfield council is considering seeking funding from the federal government’s $50 million Strategic Projects Fund. Whether it is through this fund or through future programs, I am keen to work with council and state government. We all have to work together to get more car parking off the ground in Cabramatta to help a thriving little town that needs a bit of help, a town that is getting back on its feet, a town that will be hit hard by a project that will help us all.

269,Mr Clare (Blaxland) (9.57 Am),"Cabramatta is a thriving town, full of life, colour andMurray-Darling River System Dr STONE (Murray) (10.00 am)-This week in the debate on the Water Amendment Bill 2008, Minister Penny Wong raised the issue of Labor’s disastrous water buyback scheme for the Murray-Darling Basin. Minister Wong said, ‘Dr Stone does not mind water purchase as long as it is only in New South Wales.’ As the member for MurrayI have, of course, long condemned and totally opposed the Rudd government’s $3.1 billion water buyback scheme, where they claim they only buy water from so-called ‘willing sellers’. Labor’s water purchasing policy, where they first committed $50 million and then have multiplied that by many times to $3.1 billion since they entered the farmers’ water market, has completely distorted traded water prices. Drought-stressed farmers trying to buy water to keep their orchards and vineyards alive or dairy farmers trying to save their pastures or finish a crop have been totally priced out of the market. By whom? The government, who have raided the market by having such deep pockets-$3.1 billion. Can you imagine the impact on prices? I have condemned Labor’s water buyback policy since it was introduced. It is a stupid, naive policy which is doing nothing to add environmental flows to the Murray but is doing a great deal to ensure that rural communities can never recover from the drought. They simply no longer have affordable water access. Of course, Labor is refusing to put on-farm watersaving investment into the system. Certainly, Labor has said it will put investment into state owned infrastructure, but, when it comes to helping farmers do such things as invest in subsurface irrigation or centre pivot-type sprays, the Labor government has walked away. Even worse than the buyback scheme, of course, is the north-south pipeline. Here is a project funded by the Victorian government which is to take up to a third of the Goulburn system water available in a dry year and pipe that water to Melbourne for their potable and nonpotable use-for example, for car washing and toilet flushing. I can tell you that there is no environmentally, economically or socially responsible rationale that can be used to justify this project. It amounts to criminal damage to the Murray-Darling Basin, whose main Murray tributary is the Goulburn River. It also devastates the water dependent food-growing economy of northern Victoria. This is a serious problem that should be addressed, and I ask that Labor does that. Great Ocean Road place on the agenda a looming issue in my electorate-the threats to the operation of the Great Ocean Road. I want to put on the table the need for resources to be made available to protect against immediate climate change threats and for the establishment of a special fund for this purpose. The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia’s three great environmental and tourism assets, which are generally referred to as the rock, the reef and the road. The Great Ocean Road is an economic engine room of the Surf Coast region and, of course, is a major contributor to the Geelong and Colac-Otway regions. Today, the Great Ocean Road is under threat. Modelling I have undertaken using a professional cartographer shows that, with projected sea level rises over the years to come and storm surges, at least 14 different parts of the Great Ocean Road may be breached. Following on from this work, the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment are undertaking comprehensive studies looking at vulnerable areas along the Great Ocean Road. They are studying the ocean floor off the Great Ocean Road to see where storm surges may hit hardest MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Constituency Statements
270,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.03 Am),"I would like to take this opportunity toand are crossmatching this with low-lying areas of the road and the coastline. This will give us a very accurate picture of the level of risk as well as the vulnerable areas along the Great Ocean Road. The threat of high sea level rises to the Great Ocean Road is, however, a foregone conclusion. When these rises will occur is just a matter of time. My purpose here today is to try to think ahead of the game and signal the need for resources to be made available to address the trouble spots. I am suggesting that one way to do this is to establish a special Great Ocean Road fund so that when problem areas arise they can be addressed immediately or, more importantly, we can do the work ahead of time in the trouble spots to reinforce the road where needed. The road services many, many thousands of people, particularly during the peak holiday seasons, and we need to make sure that we have got the resources to ensure that the Great Ocean Road is protected as we move ahead. If we do not put the resources on the table when we do have these flooding events, particularly those related to climate change, then I think many, many businesses will be at threat. Mr Ernest William ‘Grumpy’ Evans tending the funeral of Mr Ernest William ‘Grumpy’ Evans, NX176692, who served in the 58th and 59th Battalion in Bougainville and also in the occupying forces in Japan. Grumpy, as he was known to his family-that was the name that his grandchildren gave him before they were able to pronounce ‘grandpa’-was a true and great Australian. He was a very ordinary man, a very humble man. It was a great privilege to attend his funeral. You could see in the life of Grumpy the lives of many Australians. He shared a very similar experience to that of many Australians. He enjoyed a loving relationship with his wife, Una. They had three children, who they raised together-Garry, Bob and Jennifer-and they had wonderful grandchildren, who paid such moving tributes to him. The reason I particularly refer to Grumpy today is that Grumpy’s passing was a very unfortunate event. He was the victim of a cowardly and callous attack outside our local St Vincent de Paul shop in Caringbah, and that matter is currently before the courts. At his funeral, there was no mention of this attack because the family wanted to honour and remember Grumpy himself, the man and the great Australian, a veteran and someone who has loved and served his family. Grumpy worked at the Kurnell oil refinery for many years and he was also a butcher. The funeral was a celebration of his life. It was great to be part of that with the family and the community in the Sutherland shire and to honour a man who, in his passing days, experienced some terrible violence which brought back many horrific memories of his time in Bougainville. It is an absolute disgrace that a man such as this should have to go though such a horrible period in his last remaining days. It was just so moving to see the family, in a real act of grace, being able to see beyond that terrible violence and focus on the true essence of Grumpy. He was a man who loved his grandchildren deeply. He was a man with a great sense of humour, who was known for many practical jokes-mainly at his grandchildren’s expense! They all gathered together on that day and shared in that and laughed about it and at the same time were able subdue the very real rage that I am sure they had for the incident that sadly and most probably ended up taking his life.

Blair Electorate: Storms which affected South-East Queensland from 16 November to 22 November. They have affected my electorate of Blair, which is based in Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley, terribly. In South-East Queensland we have had two fatalities that we know of. We have seen people’s lives devastated. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage has been sustained at schools, businesses and homes. People have spoken to me at my mobile offices. I have driven around with Senator Joseph Ludwig and Councillor Andrew Antoniolli from Ipswich City Council and looked at the devastation to bridges-the One Mile Bridge and the Three Mile Bridge, for example-and the railway line at Booval. It will take a long time for my electorate to recover. I pay tribute to the Rural Fire Brigade, the SES, the more than 700 Australian Defence personnel who worked tirelessly around the clock and the businesses that supported them. For example, the Ipswich International Hotel provided breakfast for people. There was support from Ipswich City Council Mayor, Paul Pisasale, and the Lockyer Valley Regional Mayor, Steve Jones. All the councillors have pitched in. There has been tremendous communitarian spirit shown by the people of my electorate. The Insurance Council of Australia has activated industry arrangements for the coordination of recovery efforts, and to date about 1,800 claims have been registered in South-East Queensland to the value of $175 million. I commend the federal government for providing an additional $500,000 to match the contribution of the Queensland government to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal for activation under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. That recognises 13 local government areas for the purposes of personal hardship and distress grants. Three of my councils are in that area. Assistance has been given to adults and children who have been affected-$1,000 for adults and $400 for children. I have been to the community disaster recovery areas; I have been to the centre. I also commend the Red Cross. About five people came up to Ipswich from the Bendigo Red Cross to help. They did not have to, but they did it because of their communitarian spirit and affection for their fellow Australians. I pay tribute to the people who did that. I commend governments at all levels, the community in South-East Queensland and the people across Australia who have helped our area.

273,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (10.12 Am),"I had the privilege of attending the General Sir Johnattendance at these awards, and this was strongly supported by the Speaker as well, who was there to recognise the particular achievements of these young Australians. The General Sir John Monash Awards are not limited by age, gender or academic field of study, which makes them unique. However, they recognise and promote something in young Australians which is very important-that is, in a global economy they promote our ability to lift our best and brightest young people and make them internationally competitive in a sustainable way within our own country. Hopefully they return and provide us with benefits in a whole range of disciplines. They are a remarkable group of young people who provide an enormous diversity of disciplines in areas that they are working on. For instance, some of the people who were there this year were from crucial areas like viral pandemics, biotechnological approaches to sustainability, biomedical research, law, risk management, water and environmental law, engineering for earthquakes, natural disasters, policy development around refugees and mass population movement. It was an incredible experience to meet these people and understand what they seek to achieve through their education. I had the privilege of meeting Shaun Lin Yow and his family from my own electorate. He has first-class honours in a Bachelor of Commerce degree and received the University Medal from UNSW. He is going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is studying the application of public policy for managing the economic consequences of demographic change. I think that is something that all members in this place would agree is a vital area in an ageing population and with the demographic challenges that we will face in the future. Mark Schembri from the neighbouring electorate of Greenway-and the member for Greenway was also present-has a Bachelor of Veterinary Science degree and is working on viral pandemics. He explained to me his work at the Easter Show in Sydney every year. It is the biggest gathering of animals in the country at any one event. All of these young Australians are fantastic people and their education is very important. Mr Colin McDonald QC Mr Robert Grey Madam Deputy Speaker, a parliamentary secretary has limited opportunities to participate in the debates of this House, so I trust you will excuse me for trying to compress two matters into three minutes. The first I raise is that next week Colin McDonald, one of the barristers representing the Bali nine, will be present in Parliament House and will be giving one of the Library lecture seminars, and I would encourage all members to participate. Colin McDonald and barristers such as Julian McMahon and the other team represent the best aspects of the Australian independent bar. I commend them for their work, and I would encourage members of this House to consider re-establishing the cross-parliamentary grouping against the death penalty that was established in the last parliament on the instigation of Cameron Murphy of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, because we have a very substantial case of advocacy to make for the universal removal of the death penalty. The second point I raise concerns a petition that I have lodged on behalf of my constituent Robert Grey, a former wing commander and senior Air Force officer in Tasmania. Mr Grey still has not received a substantive and satisfactory explanation for a decision under the former government a long period of time ago that adversely affected him. He has petitioned the House, amongst other matters, to the effect that, except in actual conduct, the rules and prinMAIN COMMITTEE",147,Constituency Statements

His petition is countersigned by two other very senior military personnel, Air Commodore Gary Bates, former Director-General of Aerospace Combat Systems, Defence Materiel Organisation, and Air Vice Marshal Peter Criss, a former Air Commander Australia. This House, the parliament and the government as a whole have been made aware of deficiencies within the disciplinary system within the military and have made substantial improvements, but there are some outstanding matters including that of my constituent Wing Commander Grey. The petition that has been tabled draws attention to that matter, and I hope ultimately he receives an explanation or an apology for the conduct which he was subject to. Australian Learning Communities Network Inc. edge an organisation within the community that is working towards a goal that I hold very dear-that is, the creation of a culture of lifelong learning within our communities. I am talking about the Australian Learning Communities Network Inc. This organisation recently held its national conference in Adelaide. When I was Mayor of Gwydir Shire Council before entering this place it was my honour to be Chair of the Gwydir Learning Region. The Gwydir Learning Region is a body with similar aims to the Australian Learning Communities Network. Through a partnership of stakeholders, including education, business, local council and local community, the Gwydir Learning Region has established itself as a wonderful example of what can be achieved in growing a learning community. Local communities, especially in regional and remote areas, can benefit greatly through focusing the available resources in a coordinated manner to address local skill deficiencies or other social needs through existing programs such as school based traineeships and apprenticeships, through encouraging adults to enter or re-enter training to enhance their skills or simply through making opportunities available for our aged and other disadvantaged segments of our population to participate in activities to allow them to socialise. The pivotal factor in this equation is the role that local government can play in facilitating this learning community culture. The enhancement of each community through learning should be seen as a core business of local government, especially in areas devoid of established learning institutions. This was certainly the case within the Gwydir Shire, which is very much a learning organisation. From my own experience with the Gwydir Learning RegionI also witnessed how this learning can strengthen a community. People who come together to learn-and to help each other learn-provide a great service to their communities and to each other. I have seen this within the Gwydir shire, where this emerging culture of lifelong learning has seen many mature-age students acquire new skills that they have been able to use to benefit the communities in which they live. The Gwydir Learning Region model was praised in a recent independent evaluation, where it was found to provide individuals with the opportunity to advance their education, develop new skills, achieve social and economic goals and pursue pathways that might not have been available to them previously. However, the benefits extend beyond the individual. From the point of view of economic and regional development, it was found to MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Constituency Statements
275,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (10.18 Am),"I would like to take this opportunity to acknowlrepresent an innovative approach to aligning skill development with local employment needs, and in doing so create a sustainable future in rural New South Wales. Since my association with the Gwydir Learning Region began I have seen many students take on, and then excel in, a diverse range of professions, from aged care to IT. As a result, these communities have seen a significant expansion in their skill base, which has in turn had a direct affect on their ability to build their commercial potential. In my own community I have seen mothers attending the same class at Warialda High School as their sons and daughters and people with very minimal education themselves finally going on not only to fulfil very important roles in the community but also to help their own families through being able to earn a proper income. For many years Mr Jim Saleeba, from the Albury-Wodonga area, has championed the importance of learning communities. Jim has recently retired as the chair of the Australian Learning Communities Network, but he is still very much involved in promoting its aims. Jim and his fellow board members give their time to this cause without any expectation of reward beyond helping the various communities around Australia that desperately need this attention to coordinate learning to improve their quality of life. The Australian Learning Communities Network receives virtually no government funding yet its goals hold the key to the success and regeneration of many of our communities. I sincerely hope that this government recognises the need to fund programs that allow the growing network of learning communities to thrive and to encourage more areas to take up the challenge-it is worth the effort. Lindsay Electorate: Samuel Morris Foundation undertaken by the Samuel Morris Foundation, which was established in March 2007 to provide assistance to families of children suffering from severe disabilities following neardrowning accidents. The foundation was set up by Michael and Jo-Ann Morris of Cranebrook in my electorate, after their then two-year-old son, Samuel, suffered a near-drowning incident in the family’s backyard pool. Water safety issues have been highlighted this week with the backyard swimming pool tragedy involving 21-month old twins, Ethan and Matthew Hill, of St Huberts Island. Ethan died and Matthew is fighting for his life. We extend our sympathies and best wishes to all those affected by this tragedy. In Samuel’s case, he had been playing in the backyard with his older sister when he managed to shake free a 1½-metre section of the pool fence. He made his way into the pool, and by the time his sister had raised the alarm Samuel had already stopped breathing. With the help of his mother, some quick-thinking neighbours and emergency services personnel, Samuel was revived. Samuel-now five years old-has been left with severe hypoxic brain injuries, meaning he can no longer walk or talk and requires constant care and specialist treatment and equipment. Samuel is a fighter and a source of inspiration. His injuries are severe, but I have seen first hand his will and determination. Samuel is currently in Westmead Hospital preparing for surgery next week and I wish him and his family all the best.

276,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (10.22 Am),"I rise to acknowledge the important work beingder-4 age group, with backyard swimming pools, followed by lakes and dams, as the most common locations for these drowning deaths. But even these statistics do not reveal the less reported near-drowning accidents, which are much greater in number than drowning deaths. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s research has found that the great majority of near-drowning incidents are experienced by children younger than 15, and many of these are under four. It is these families that the Samuel Morris Foundation works to support. The foundation fundraises extensively to help families of children suffering from hypoxic brain injuries resulting from near-drowning accidents with the heavy financial burden of the specialist equipment and therapies that these injuries require. The foundation works closely with Royal Life Saving and won this year’s Patron’s Award for the most significant contribution to water safety with a focus on an underrepresented group at the New South Wales Water Safety Awards. Samuel’s story is one the Morris family has been working hard to ensure is not repeated. As parents, we all need to heed the message of water safety and be vigilant when our children are near water. I congratulate the Samuel Morris Foundation, and in particular Michael and JoAnn Morris for their outstanding contribution, and I look forward to continuing to work with them to promote the message of water safety. Mayo Electorate: Mr and Mrs Goldner worthwhile cause. As the parent of two young children, drowning is one of the biggest fears you are ever likely to have. I welcome and support his remarks. I rise today to talk about two of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Goldner, whom I raised in question time on Tuesday. Mr and Mrs Goldner, for those who are not familiar with the case, were retirees. They were hard working small business people all their life who ran businesses in the north-eastern part of Adelaide and had recently retired and bought a block of land on Hindmarsh Island on which they sought to build a house to live in. They purchased the land some time ago and engaged with a builder, which of course, as we will know, in recent times has been difficult because the construction industry has been so busy. They started building midyear, had the slab laid and were moving the timber to the site. They had their money invested in a short-term cash management account, a low-risk account, not one seeking high rates of interest but a place to hold their savings until they had to pay the builder. Unfortunately, the week before they were due to pay the builder their accounts were frozen. They were frozen because of a mistake made by the Treasurer in implementing his bank deposit guarantee. These people are struggling and the builder, who is owed a lot of money, potentially has to lay off staff. It is an extraordinarily difficult situation for all concerned, and I urge the Treasurer to remedy the situation. I was disappointed, to say the least, with the response that I received when I inquired of the Treasurer of this issue in question time. This was a mistake, the Treasurer did not speak to the Governor of the Reserve Bank before he made this decision and he did not think through the consequences of this decision or of the innocent victims such as the Goldners. It is time that the government admitted the mistake. The opposition has supported the deposit guarantee all along. In fact, it was the idea of the Leader of the Opposition. We supported it with a capwhich, interestingly, is the Reserve Bank’s position. I urge the Treasurer to reconsider what he MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Constituency Statements

I urge the government to do something to help my constituents, the Goldners. Maribyrnong Electorate: Mr David Cunningham Services) (10.28 am)-I believe in the vital importance of people with disability being able to participate fully in our community, including our workplaces. Along with the Minister for Employment Participation, we are developing the National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy. The benefits of work for people with disability and for the workplaces are immeasurable. Mr David Cunningham is a case in point. Mr Cunningham has cerebral palsy and a passion for reforming the disability sector-a passion I share. He is in his late 20s, he has partial visual impairment and is in a wheelchair full time. He calls my office regularly and deals with my very professional staff to bring to my attention issues affecting people with a disability. Mr Cunningham is keenly interested in the Rudd government’s social inclusion agenda and was pleased to be able to share his views directly with the government during his local national disability strategy consultation. He and I both know that Australia requires a long-term view on how to empower people with disability and their carers. He says that people with disabilities need encouragement and there need to be options for them in the workforce and decent employer attitudes. When Mr Cunningham’s carer father died in August this year, his son paid this moving tribute: My father was a real trooper in the true sense of the word, just like so many other carers across the country like him. He made every sacrifice possible for the overall benefit of me and my brother. Recently, Mr Cunningham was offered a job as a personal assistant for a disability sector organisation and is now doing reception and administration work two days a week. David says the organisation he works for looked at what he could do and not at what he could not do. ‘They did not look at my disability,’ he says. He is proud the organisation recognised his skills and hopes that other employers will give people with disability a chance. Mr Cunningham has been doing voluntary work for 10 years. He says that voluntary work sometimes is not recognised but that it is a great way for people with disabilities to contribute to society and it is great for the organisations. David has always contributed to our community through his advocacy work. Now, with paid employment, he is contributing even more fully. Everybody benefits. Mr David Cunningham represents what I think is the true goal of disability reform in this nation. Impairment is a function of living. It can be acquired through birth, through a catastrophic injury at work or in a motor vehicle accident in the blink of an eye or through the natural ageing process. What disables people with impairment are the attitudes of the community. Australians are not malicious but they are unaware, if disability does not affect them, of the impact that it can have on people’s lives. I think that what Mr David Cunningham and so many other hundreds of thousands of people with impairment who are endeavouring to participate in the economy and society demonstrate is that when Australians can look beyond the impairment to the whole person then in fact we will achieve the real goal of disability reform, which is an equal go in life for all Australians regardless of impairment.

278,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sInfrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Committee Report Debate resumed from 24 November, on motion by Ms King: That the House take note of the report. that none of my comments are said with any rancour or lack of respect for my Labor colleagues. I think sometimes we tend to politicise committees and we should not. I have immense respect for my Labor colleagues, but, with the greatest respect to them in this particular instance, I think that they have written their report to an agenda rather than to what we received in evidence. We did not receive evidence that would have justified a number of things that have gone into the body of the report. Wherever we went in Australia with this inquiry into the funding of local and regional community infrastructure, one thing stood out-and that was that there was no criticism of the program itself. There was criticism of the administration of the program by the departmentsuch things as the slowness of getting applications dealt with, rising costs while applications were being dealt with and puerile questions being put to ACCs or proponents of programs, and those sort of puerile questions indicating that either the department did not have a knowledge or an understanding of the region where the particular project was going or alternatively-and I am reluctant to say this-they were trying to slow the process down. One project in particular that stood out was a very elaborate playground that included access for disabled children and road safety training areas for kids on bikes. That project had been going on for over six years-not all through the department, I might add. There was a lot of preamble work done on that project in the community. I attended lots of meetings in the early days of that project when it was to be located near the olympic pool. It is called the Lake Ellen project, being located near Lake Ellen in the Baldwin Swamp environmental area of Bundaberg-a beautiful area. One of the issues that slowed the project down and nearly cost the project its Commonwealth funding, because at that time the government was going to cancel those community projects that did not have contracts signed off-and I congratulate the government on going back on that and allowing those projects through-was the fact that the department wanted to know whether the Bundaberg City Council was a fit and proper person to run the project. That should be a given. When someone says to me, ‘Oh, some funny things happened at Wollongong’-come on! We have all these local authorities across Australia; to try to drag out Wollongong to make all the other local authorities look suspicious is just puerile. This report is not supported by the evidence. I remember that at the meeting in Toowoomba, which I chaired, I asked the question: what are the criticisms of the Regional Partnerships program itself? I repeated the question. There were no criticisms. In fact, the member for Gilmore, who was sitting next to me, said something like, ‘Oh God, you’re game.’ But I wanted to hear what people had to say about the program. Almost everywhere we went there was not a criticism of Regional Partnerships. There was certainly criticism of the way it was administered-mainly, I might say, by the department. In fact, very few of the witnesses made any reference at all to the audit report, which I thought they would. I thought MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Constituency Statements
279,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.32 Am),"I would like to preface my remarks today by sayingthere would be a lot of argy-bargy around the Australian Audit Office report and there was not. There was very little. AfterI said, ‘At every meeting we went to there was praise for this program’, one or two of my colleagues said to me, ‘Well, there are a lot of ACC representatives there and they would say that anyhow.’ Come on! Look at all those ACCs-57 or 58 of them across Australia. Most of them were very well conducted; certainly the ones in my area, Wide Bay and Central Queensland, were outstanding over the years and the chairs of those committees ended up on various Commonwealth reference groups because of their leadership. Are we seriously trying to say that all those voluntary people-engineers, doctors, accountants, farmers and union representatives-who all had busy lives were going to come and prostitute themselves in a concocted or confected scenario? Because the ACCs wanted the program, what these people said was suspect? That is a terrible slur on all those voluntary workers across Australia for the last 12 years. Remember, this program in its genesis was a Labor program, continued by the Howard government. It was a good program. I am not saying that every project was good. There are always failures in this. There is a risk factor when you have a program as extensive as this. If you want to look back to the previous programs of the Hawke and Keating governments, there are plenty of failures there too. Have a look at some of the outrageously indulgent RED scheme projects. Some of them were just so wasteful it is almost unimaginable that they could have got through. Then there was the final employment program under the Keating government: the figures showed up after the event that it was costing $100,000 a client to get these people supposedly into jobs. For $100,000 you could have bought someone a business. So do not say to me that, because there were a number of failures in the Regional Partnerships program, suddenly it was deficient. Nine-tenths of these projects, or even a higher proportion, were very good and, in my opinion, some of the ones that failed were underresourced. They were not indulgent in the sense that they had too much money and they were throwing it against the wall. The one I would cite is the Beaudesert to Bethania railway line. I could never see that being done for $5 million; that was probably a $15 million or $20 million project. It was a good concept-it was to link the people from around Beaudesert in south-eastern Queensland into the suburban rail system of Brisbane and, in turn, into the city. The concept was also forward looking, and the principle involved in it will probably be a term of reference that the minister gives this committee to look at in the future: how do we get rail services out to outer metropolitan and country areas? So it was a good concept, and there were others. I have been in regional development for over 20 years; I know the field well. Some of the things that have been put into this report are the complete antithesis of good regional development. Regional development must be holistic. You must take the community, its resources and services on the one hand and you must take its means of production or its manufacturing base on the other hand and make sure that they work in harmony and work together. Tourism is a further overlay over that. You pull one of the components out and you get a lopsided community engagement. The other thing with regional development is that you must have a sense of ownership. That is absolutely vital. You cannot just impose government structures on people in country areas and get a result-it just does not happen. We have had examples of this over the years, especially in Victoria. Once the state government or the federal governMAIN COMMITTEE ment pulls its money out, the whole regional development organisation falls over. For 12 or 18 months or two years nothing happens and then you get another model and work it up. The way it should be done is by involving the community. For example, development boards should be in every town. They should be funded by, firstly, the local business community, which should pay a subscription; secondly, the local authority; thirdly, the state government through the department of state development or whatever it might be called in each state; and, fourthly, the Commonwealth government. It should be run by a board of local people. The best models in Australia have had that structure. Regional Partnerships or the ACC model came very close to that. But the model that my colleagues are suggesting will be much less than that because, in my belief, there is going to be far too heavy an emphasis on local government. I was ambivalent about assessment panels, and my appeal to government members is that they realise that if assessment panels are largely federal, state and local government and do not have those core people who understand how regional areas work then the whole system will not work. The very criticism of the department in this fiasco is that people in the department-and there is clear evidence of this-did not understand how things worked in the country or the scope of the various projects. If you are going to have an assessment panel that is set up roughly the same way, you are going to have a repetition of that lack of engagement. I am saying: if you have assessment panels, make sure that they contain businessmen, accountants, engineers-people who have an on-the-ground understanding. The other thing I would say is: do not try to run this program through state offices. I suggested in my dissenting report that we should have three regional offices in Queensland, three in New South Wales, two in Victoria, two in Western Australia and one each in Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The reason for that is that every two or three ACC or, as we are going to call them, RDA regions could be clustered under that regional office. There should be field officers, I agree with the report, but the field officers should be confined to that part of the state where they have knowledge and engagement. If you do not do that, you are going to have remote decision-making processes. So if you want to look at field officers, yes, I agree with having them, but I think it should be contingent upon them being in regional offices in regional areas. For God’s sake, don’t try to run this thing out of capital cities. I acknowledge that the parliamentary secretary has closed some of the capital city offices and I congratulate him for that, but I think he must replace those with a goodly number of regional offices. I put in my dissenting report how I think this thing should be structured. I do not think there was a Sustainable Regions Program; wherever we went, people were saying that there needed to be a model like that where the proponents do not need to find 50 or 60 per cent of the money but, rather, 10 or 20 per cent. That is for deprived regions in endemic drought or unemployment or whatever it might be. We have another report to come and I have got a lot more to say about it. I am passionate about regional development. I think my colleagues have got it wrong and I will continue to pursue this matter well into the development of the program. bution. I know, as he said, he is very passionate about regional development and has been involved for a long time. That was certainly made clear in the committee work that we did. I applaud him for flying the flag of regional development. It is interesting that this interim reMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Committees
280,Mr Raguse (Forde) (10.47 Am),"Firstly, I thank the member for Hinkler for his contriport of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government came about because of issues raised in the audit report and a whole range of other inconsistencies. In fact, the member for Hinkler did refer to the electorate of Forde by way of talking about Beaudesert Rail, and it was certainly my experience that that was a project that went badly wrong. Without a doubt, over all the inquiry and the different projects we looked at, it was one that had been reviewed to death, so it was not a case of us going through that again. But can I tell you it was something I had direct involvement with at one stage simply to try to resolve the issues on the ground. Again, I thank the member for Hinkler for his contribution, because in a lot of ways he has had to take a lot of hits from the media and different areas of government because of some of those projects that went wrong. His area has gained a lot from these projects and programs, and it says something about having a local member or other people on the ground who can assist in the implementation of projects. This interim report looks at a number of ways and suggestions about how we might in future roll out these funding programs. I think that is really the essence of this. I do not want to get too political in my statements today, other than talking about Beaudesert Rail and some of the issues that occurred there because I think we will all learn from that project. The report on funding regional and local community infrastructure provides proposals for the new regional and local community infrastructure program. In context, this new infrastructure program does relate to hard infrastructure-the sorts of things that the member for Hinkler has spoken about. The Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and local government committee was asked by the government to examine the Australian National Audit Office’s performance audit of the Regional Partnerships program and to provide advice on new funding models. The hearings garnered a wide range of views about the previous program and a replacement program. One thing that came across was that the communities maintain the view that they need support from the government. Infrastructure is vital for communities to remain vibrant and to be able to deal with the increasing pressures of growth-the community halls that we build, the parks children play in, the pools during the long hot summers, and public spaces that contribute to the community and outer-community regions. We know that the previous system was broken. Some on the other side might not have that view-certainly not the member for Hinkler, from the statements he made-but I have just explained where and how this program can work if we manage well the replacement of the previous program. Let us look at recommendation 1 from the committee report: The Committee recommends that the government establish well defined and clear objectives for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program that sit within an articulated Commonwealth Government regional development policy. How we structure and manage these types of programs is very important. This recommendation is one of the most important with regard to the Regional Partnerships program. I think the previous government started to have a meltdown and there was a breakdown of the process. Occasionally, of course, there was political outrage and there was certainly concern from the media and the opposition at the time about what was going on. I think those of us who have had direct involvement with the Audit Office would say that they perform a very important MAIN COMMITTEE function. The report was certainly an indicator of a whole range of things that just were not taken into consideration. An example is in the seat of Forde. While the Beaudesert Rail project dates back to 19992000, it really had a meltdown by 2001, so it was a process over a period of time. I will give you an example from the recent election campaign-recent being a year ago now. I was of course a candidate for the seat of Forde. There were promises being made all over the place under the banner of the Regional Partnerships program. It is certainly a difficult thing for a new member to come into a community and find that a particular expectation had been developed during the campaign. As we looked more closely at the promises, we saw that they certainly were not valid; they were, in the truest sense, pork barrelling. I do not want to politicise my statements today, but clearly it was an example of something that was used as a lever in the election campaign. We know it happens, but it was clear on the ground. I am still working with the community to get some future resolution on particular projects. One project concerned a community precinct in Jubilee Park, which is a major park in the centre of Beaudesert; the park was to include ultimately a hydrotherapy pool. Of course, hydrotherapy pools around the country now are becoming of major importance to people with certain health problems. They are certainly very, very important pieces of community infrastructure. There were letters that said the pool was confirmed, that it was going to happen. Those claims were baseless and the community were of course very angry that baseless promises had been made. As the new member, I basically drilled down and found out that they were baseless and then I had to inform the community that the pool was not going to happen and discuss how we were going to resolve it for the future. Another project was on Tambourine Mountain: the Zamia theatre, which was a project that had been undertaken by the local community. A historic theatre had asbestos issues and, on the basis of the asbestos, the building was kept stable until such time as there would be funding to go towards its upgrade. They stripped the theatre of everything-its internal walls, every piece of asbestos-on the basis that they were to get funding to renew and renovate this building. Of course, that was another promise that was made and not ever going to be delivered on. When you look at a community like Mount Tambourine, you see that they value such pieces of infrastructure. The theatre is now inoperative two years down the track; it now is a shell of a building that will probably need extensive dollars. Of course, the longer it sits, the more money that will have to be spent to bring it back to what was a very important piece of community infrastructure, one with certain historical value. Again, it is something that I am dealing with in the electorate. I am hoping that we can resolve such issues with the rollout of the new programs and the fact that we have had the Australian Council of Local Government bringing groups together, that we have local government involved in the process. It is certainly one of the recommendations that we have put forward: that councils should have various ways of accessing funding. Importantly-and I spoke about this yesterday in the House with regard to nation building, and we are going to talk about it again in fact-Labor governments are very much about the future, about having a vision and about nation building. Yesterday I used examples in the field of education showing that, from the Whitlam era through the Hawke-Keating era and now into the Rudd government, our vision for an education revolution is very much built on nation building. There is the soft infrastructure and the social infrastructure that we put in place, but MAIN COMMITTEE these programs for funding community projects are very much about providing the hard, physical, infrastructure. I know the opposition continually talks about us making false promises; they throw out catchphrases and say that we are hairy-chested about our promises. The reality is that we are nation building, and this is another component of that. We fund communities directly by engaging as many of the stakeholders as possible. Local government councils on the ground are certainly a major part of the way that we were looking at rolling out this particular program. It is very important to understand what we have done as a government. The very first, historic meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government was about bringing local government to the table to start talking not only about how we might put in place a particular fund like this but certainly about all of the other opportunities we have to utilise the three tiers of government. We are now talking about the three ‘spheres’ of government. It is really about making those tiers of government more efficient. The role that local government will and should play in community development-and certainly in infrastructure development-is very, very clear. If you look at Queensland, you see that there was a huge amount of political fallout over the council amalgamations, where we took 157 councils and turned them into about 73. It was historic, it was a mammoth task and of course, as you would expect, it raised a lot of concern in the communities. Interestingly enough, it is very much in line with how we fund local infrastructure, how we put projects into place. Local government is very much a part of it. People used to say and have said to all of us, ‘Why do we need local governments? Why do we need state governments? What does the federal government really do? Why can’t the federal government have involvement at different levels?’ The reality is that there have been constraints on how we do that. Local government is an area of interest to us of course; we understand that there really does need to be some reference within our Constitution to local government and the role it plays. The three levels of government are here now-and I am sure they will be here for a long time, irrespective of what anyone’s desires may be. It is about efficiencies. I will give an example regarding the local government amalgamations in Queensland. We have all heard people say that we have too many politicians. People who do not engage with politicians do not quite understand what we do. That is a shame and that is probably something we need to manage a little bit better. Certainly in my state of Queensland when you say to those detractors, ‘How do we reduce the number of politicians?’ no-one can really tell you how to do it. But I note the efficiencies gained through the local government amalgamations. In Queensland there are now 770 fewer politicians because of the amalgamations. When you talk to people about maintaining the three spheres or tiers of government, you should also note that we can build efficiencies and we can allow the implementation of funding sources like this to have direct benefit on the ground. Local government is very, very important to us. Less than 12 months into the amalgamations, Queensland is dealing with that. This is about funding programs that are in place with local government through our new dialogue. By bringing everyone to the table we can roll out a whole range of infrastructuresocial infrastructure as well as the physical infrastructure that we are talking about here. I mentioned before the example of Beaudesert Rail-and I said I would give some examples. It was a project that was well conceived. For the area, it was going to mean major tourMAIN COMMITTEE ism activity. But you had very aged rail infrastructure that had been closed for 15 years at the time. It had been closed for a whole range of reasons but certainly there was a need for ongoing maintenance. There were 40-odd timber bridges and 40 kilometres of not very good track. One of the reasons that rail line was never modernised was that it had some very hard bends, with soft foundations put in place in the 1860s. The state government at the time looked at that corridor to upgrade it as a normal rail service, and at that stage it was looking at something like $60 million just to put a basic service in place. Five million dollars went to the Beaudesert Rail project-$5 million to get a historic rail system up and running! If you do the calculations it would be almost $5 million a year simply to maintain what was an ageing piece of infrastructure. In fact, it got to the stage where local government and state government came to the party-of course Queensland Rail still had some role to play in that particular corridor. Within the first couple of years, local government spent, in kind and in cash, far more than the $5 million that went to a project that was going to establish a rail. The 12 months of establishing the project-upgrading, renovating buildings and platforms and even putting a steam engine in place-simply gobbled up most of the money. In fact, this particular organisation was pretty much insolvent by the time it was due to open its doors. While the particular rail ran for a period of time, we had much community anger because there were creditors who were owed large amounts of money. In fact, not only was all the money spent; there were creditors of probably $6 or $7 million unpaid. So this particular rail was never going to succeed. In the end, the creditors lost 85 per cent of the dollars when the administrators finally ruled everything out. There was so much anger in the community that the rail could not continue because there was a series of small sabotage activities against the rail-bridges getting burnt. It created an enormous amount of community anger. That really is an example of projects that go badly wrong. TodayI commend this interim report because I believe it is on the right track in terms of how we should better engage with local government. We should better engage federally directly on the ground to be able to fund programs but we must certainly have some very legitimate processes in place. On that basis, I commend this report to the House. that the members of the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Committee put into undertaking this inquiry. I also acknowledge the role that the federal government has in promoting development in regional areas. I will be brief but I would like to highlight, from my experience in local government and in regional areas, some of the recommendations in the report that I believe may not end up giving the results that have been hoped for. I will also discuss the fact that the Regional Partnerships program has become very much a political issue. Unfortunately, quite often what is said in the House and what has been found here in evidence is quite different. I would like to mention the extremely unusual event of the government putting the member for New England on the committee just for this inquiry, obviously with the intent that he be the main attack dog for a witch hunt on Regional Partnerships. What the member for New England has said in the House and in other places about Regional Partnerships there is no evidence for or any comment about in this report. The transcripts of the hearings that were held-the very few inquiries that the member for New England actually bothered to attendMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Committees
281,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (11.01 Am),"I would like to acknowledge the time and the effortdo not match his rhetoric elsewhere. The member for New England is going to have to put up or shut up. Possibly one of the most successful examples of a regional partnership is in his home town of Tamworth and it is operating very well. That is the regional equine centre that is now attracting events of a national and international standard into that area. His comments have been particularly unhelpful in this whole process. There is one other thing I would like to comment on. I have had discussions with the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, the member for Brand, on the idea-and it comes through in this report-of a partnership with local government. My background is with local government and quite frankly I welcome that direction. Local governments are in tune with the communities; they do know how to spend that money. I can remember the member for Longman speaking in the House about the rorting of Regional Partnerships. The Regional Partnerships program that came through my local government area included things like putting disabled access in a community hall that is 40 kilometres from the nearest town. We got $120,000 as part of a $600,000 project for a medical centre so that, when the current doctors move into retirement, the remote community around Warialda can have a walk-in, walk-out medical facility. That is hardly rorting. I understand the process and that there was an election going on, but I think that, once we get away from the heightened atmosphere of an election and we start to work out how we are going to develop Regional Partnerships and other regional projects, we need to make sure that we do not get caught up in the rhetoric but rather look at the facts. To finish on the subject of local government, last week the council mayors visited Parliament House. That was well received-that money will be well spent in the communities in my electorate. I acknowledge that, but there are a couple of things that worry me. One is the idea of too close a relationship with the state governments. In the projects that we did and that I dealt with, we almost had to fudge the figures for the state government because of its lack of contribution. It was more of a lead weight than an active partner in the process. SoI encourage the federal-local relationship. I think that getting too tied up with the state bureaucracies would have a wet blanket effect on this. we speak not as lawyers. I am speaking here so that, hopefully, my contributions will be helpful to the process of this committee. WhatI am saying, if you would like me to rephrase it, is that the New South Wales state government did not carry its weight under the previous program. One thing I would like to discuss is moving away from partnerships with individual organisations. Minister Albanese has displayed great mirth and merriment speaking about this in the House. He mentioned a particular project in my electorate in the town of Walgett. From memory, it was a pet food facility and unfortunately it failed. He was having a great old time talking about putting money into this project in Walgett that failed. Let me talk about Walgett. Walgett is one of the most disadvantaged communities in Australia. Walgett has the largest ratio of Aboriginal people to European people of any community in Australia and is really struggling for employment opportunities for its residents. Of course a project that was going to employ people in a place like Walgett is always going to be on the edge. If we wanted to make sure that all the projects we funded were secure, we would have them in the CBDs of MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Committees
282,Mr Sullivan,You didn’t really just admit to fudging the figures?,160,Committees
283,Mr Coulton,"No. I come to this place from a background of local government, wherethe capital cities. Of course a project at Walgett is going to be under some sort of stress-and the fact that it happened in the middle of the worse drought in 100 years did not help. There were a whole range of reasons why it did not succeed, including the lack of grain for this facility. But that does not mean that we should not try. I believe an obligation of government is to assist with the creation of sustainable and long term industry in these disadvantaged areas-and private enterprise is the right way to do that, whether you like it or not. We can put in as many government backed programs as we like, and, quite frankly, the government does put a lot of money into Walgett. The Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service is one of the most switched on and efficient organisations I have ever had any dealings with. It provides a wonderful backup to its community in the services it provides. But, ultimately, if we are going to develop these communities, we have to assist them. We cannot move these people somewhere else. That is their home. So we need to bring something out to where they are to enable them to live with dignity and to have the opportunity of employment. In doing that, there is always the possibility that these projects are going to fail. I realise this is an interim report but I encourage the committee, as it looks into this further, to not discount the employment possibilities in encouraging businesses to start up, particularly in remote areas. As we go through this process we really need to be careful that we have something that works. If we put a process in place that has so many checks and ties in it that it is absolutely impossible for any mistakes to be made, projects will be so bound that they will be ineffectual. I agree with the member for Hinkler’s comments that there needs to be a large number of people from the communities involved, because there needs to be some kind of ownership. I understand that from my period as the mayor of a regional area. When the community has ownership of and a belief in their future, something will happen. Something that is brought in from afar, even with the best of intentions, is destined to fail. I welcome the work of the committee, and as you go through to the final report I encourage you to look at those other possibilities. Do not be frightened of bringing in something that has the possibility of failure. If they have the ability to be successful, those are the long-term projects that will help these communities. In the just over 12 months that I have been in this place, one of my frustrations is that we deal with complex issues in very simple terms. Certainly I hope that the rhetoric we have seen in the House and the rhetoric we have seen from Minister Albanese is seen as just that-political grandstanding-and that the real effort of community development steps away from that and looks at what is really going to work for regional Australia. hard work of and the significant contribution that has been made by the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in the preparation of this interim report. I am very pleased to follow on from the member for Parkes. WhilstI do not agree with everything that he said, I certainly acknowledge that he is one of the people in this place who are great advocates of the potential of and the opportunities that can be realised and delivered upon by local government. I know that his background in local government is something that has held him in good stead in making a contribution. Much has been said already in this debate about the Regional Partnerships program, and even more has been said about it in other places. I do not wish to pick through the entrails of that program; I think others have done that much more competently than I could ever aspire MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Committees
284,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (11.12 Am),"I rise to take note of and to acknowledge theto. But I make the general observation-and I think this is an observation that is confirmed in the committee’s interim report and indeed in the consultations that led to it-that there seemed to be a fairly loose set of objectives that that program was seeking to achieve. ‘Loose’ might be a euphemistic description; when we look at the process that was applied to applications, we see that ‘loose’ would not do justice to the reality of what occurred. I think that that has been acknowledged, and certainly the recommendations that are set out within this report go a long way towards tightening up the process for any future regional and local community infrastructure program, which I think is a great thing not just because it will deliver greater confidence in the program but because it will deliver greater accountability in terms of where taxpayers’ dollars are ultimately being spent. I want to focus in on a couple of the committee’s recommendations. The one I want to begin making a few comments in relation to is recommendation 4, which reads: The Committee recommends that local government be the auspice agency for applications in a region with a requirement that local government contribute (whether by way of capital, maintenance or operational funding). Not-for-profit organisations that do not require a local government contribution would require a letter of support from local government and then be able to apply directly. I speak in support of that particular recommendation. I know that the quality of the contribution made by local government right across this country can sometimes be varied in nature, and there is no question about that. There are some councils that are performing better than others. Notwithstanding that, I think that due recognition should be given to the fact that, as elected representatives within their local communities, councillors and aldermen are representing the interests of their local communities and often are the best way of ascertaining the true sentiment of local communities. They are accountable because they, like us, are elected and are therefore accountable to the people. I think that that extra layer of accountability, which comes in the form of local government elections in those areas where they do occur, ensures a degree of robustness and accountability in those organisations. I speak very much in support of recommendation 4. I note that the committee’s report actually foreshadows and contemplates the fact that there was to be a gathering of local government mayors from right around this country with the Prime Minister and various ministers. It was timely that this interim report was handed down in advance of that, particularly given the announcements that were made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. I note with great interest and also with great pride the fact that the announcement that was made in relation to the $300 million for regional and local infrastructure will deliver, out of the first $250 million which has been allocated to various councils, just over $1.7 million to the Penrith City Council, which is the local government authority within my electorate. That is very promising to see. I note in particular the special attention that this initiative has paidand it has been a very long time coming-to those local government areas that are in highgrowth areas. Through my previous involvement with local government, having spent nine years on the council at Penrith, I know that a number of the growth area councils had identified that the usual formula that is used in the financial assistance grants process does not always take into account some of the factors that impose greater costs on local government authorities in areas where there is greater growth and a more rapid rate of growth than others. MAIN COMMITTEE The National Growth Areas Alliance was formed in recognition of that particular reality, and I note that the Penrith City Council is one of the member organisations of that peak body. I welcome the component that was built into the allocations that reflects the growth component of those councils. I also welcome the announcement of the $50 million fund for strategic projects. I am doing everything I can to encourage my local council to make applications in respect of that fund. We are in a time where we can make a contribution towards stimulating not only our local economies but our national economy. We all understand the importance of that, given the impacts of the global financial crisis. But, apart from delivering those benefits, I think that there are some great local projects in my community that would benefit from funding under that particular proposal. A meeting occurred that involved the mayors from around the country: the Australian Council of Local Government. The formation of this body was an additional element, a new dimension, to the Federation. We all know that the Federation, which was basically enshrined in the Constitution back in 1901, reflected some different realities to those that we deal with today. The states were very much enshrined in that process. Today we see much of the hard work, when it comes to service delivery, being delivered on the ground in local communities by councils, particularly councils that are large and have a greater capacity to actually deliver in these areas. Notwithstanding what we have in the Constitution, the official document as it stands at the moment-and we all understand how difficult it is to amend that document-the Rudd government I think very wisely has sought to embrace local government and commits not only to seeking constitutional recognition of local government but also to dealing very closely with local government and improving opportunities for a direct relationship between the national government and our local governments. Of course, this is something that has been very much supported by Labor governments in the last 30-odd years. The Whitlam government was the first Labor government that began the process of having a direct dialogue with local government, with the establishment of untied grants directly to local government. We saw both the Whitlam and the Hawke governments put to the Australian people a referendum to grant constitutional recognition for local government. What we have seen since then-and I acknowledge in this regard one of the things that the Howard government did; I think it was one of the better decisions that they made in the time that they were in office-is the establishment of the Roads to Recovery program. That builds upon the commitment that had already been established and enunciated-the direct relationship between the Commonwealth government and local government. I note that in present day terms we have some $1.75 billion being made available by the Commonwealth government to local government authorities under the Roads to Recovery program. Mr John Cobb-And they love it. They love it because of the massive demands on local authorities when it comes to maintaining their local infrastructure. Roads are only part of the equation. Certainly, when it comes to roads and other forms of infrastructure, local governments have many obligations and many liabilities, but they do not necessarily have the capacity to raise the funds in order to adequately address and maintain those obligations. In addition to the direct assistance in the MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Committees
285,Mr Bradbury,"They do love it. I acknowledge the honourable member’s interjection.Roads to Recovery grants, we also have funding in the order of $1.9 billion that goes not directly to local government through the Grants Commission process but through the financial assistance grants that are made available by the Commonwealth. I note that there was some criticism at the time the Australian Council of Local Government meeting was held, but I want to reflect on the comments of the mayor of Penrith, who I should note is an independent mayor and would probably describe himself as a conservative, having previously been a member of the Liberal Party. He made some very favourable comments in the Western Weekender on 21 November 2008. He said: “This is keeping a promise made by the Rudd Government to have direct discussion with councils right across Australia. The PM announced it would become an annual event because he believes in direct dealing with local government,” … The article goes on to a few more flattering comments: Believing the trip to Canberra was worthwhile, Cr Aitkin now hopes to present ideas that were discussed on the day to his fellow councillors. “It’s been a wonderful experience to share Penrith’s journey with mayors from across Australia and also to learn about some of the marvellous projects delivered to each mayor’s respective cities, some of which I will follow up and see if Penrith would like us to go down the same roads,” … He also noted that the council was well and truly underway in its efforts to draw up a hit list of projects that could be funded with the $1.7 million that had been allocated to Penrith City Council by the Rudd government. I note that the council was already in the process of considering those projects, and next week the council will formally determine its list of priorities. There are some very worthy projects on the list in the business paper prepared by the council. From my background on the council, I know that many of these infrastructure projects, particularly the refurbishment of neighbourhood centres, are very much needed. The capacity and the funds to deliver them has been something that has prevented local government from being able to do what they would like to do in order to present the facilities that their communities need. This funding is one down payment, one step, in the process of providing the council with the wherewithal to do that. In my community, the council is looking at the Ridge Park Hall, the Arthur Neave Memorial Hall, the Namatjira Neighbourhood Centre, the Emu Plains Community Centre and the Quarterdeck, which is co-located with the Penrith Swim Centre. These community facilities will either benefit from or are proposed to be the beneficiaries of the new investment in local infrastructure coming from the Rudd government. The Penrith Senior Citizens Centre will be fenced, and I know that that has been an ongoing issue. Victoria Park in St Marys-which is a tremendous park with a lot going for it but which does need a little bit of work in order to restore it to its once grand state-is also a proposed beneficiary of these works. As well as numerous other playground replacements and equipment upgrades, the funds will also supplement the proposal for the Cranebrook Skate Park, which ended up falling short of funds. The project costs for that park exceeded what the council was able to deliver on the original estimates, largely because community consultation with the young people in the area demanded facilities that were of a higher quality in some respects. Hopefully, those enhancements will be delivered as part of this program. In conclusion, I note that this is the direction that the report sets out in terms of future funding for regional and local community infrastructure. I think that it is a direction that has the MAIN COMMITTEE support of the community, and that it is the right direction. I am sure that, with the continued resourcing that this government will commit to these projects, we will see local government authorities right around this country having an even greater capacity to deliver for their communities. (Time expired) ment by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. This is a report about country and regional Australia and what can be done to help deal with social issues around employment and how to help the various communities, the youth in those communities and, in the past at least, how to help commercial entities increase job opportunities, production or whatever it might be. I speak as someone who did not go to the hearings but who did go to two of the review sessions held by the then ACCs-now called Regional Development Australia. The ACCs were instructed by the government to hold public hearings in their regions into what was thought of the program run by the former government, a program which has since been cancelled-and they did. I attended one of those sessions in my region and another outside of my region. WhatI am told the committee heard sounds very much like what I heard in the two sessions I attended, but that certainly does not tally with what is in this report. In fact, people who did attend those hearings tell me that the report does not reflect what was said at those hearings but that the dissenting report from the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, does reflect what was said at those hearings. You have to assume that this is simply a government, on the one hand, taking an opportunity to beat up on the Regional Partnerships program while, on the other, trying to justify what it wants to do in the future. It wanted to get rid of Regional Partnerships because it was one of the most popular programs I have ever seen a government introduce. As I go around the electorate of Calare-my new electorate, which I am very proud to represent; it is an area close to my old one but which now takes in Orange, the eastern side of Blayney, Cowra and Cabonne-the thing I get asked about the most is, ‘How can we get money to help the PCYC and the local hall? How do we get money to do these things?’ I have to say to them, ‘Look, I am sorry, there used to be a program specifically designed to help provide seed money in conjunction with local communities et cetera, but that has gone, that has been wiped.’ Some of the recommendations coming out of the report are fine. I do not have any great issue with there being less scrutiny on projects. Instead of the amount being $25,000, as it used to be, it will now be $50,000 on projects. That is fine; I do not have an issue with that. WhereI have an issue is when it is categorically and heart-warmingly said that we must not have any commercial projects involved. I think I heard the member for Parkes, which used to be my electorate, say that the projects-and it is very true because I have seen it-that are the most long term, not short term for six months, are commercial projects. There is no doubt about that. Sometimes there is a need to help a commercial project, which is job oriented, get going. A recommendation has been made that funding be in rounds. If it is only the smaller funding, I guess that that is okay to an extent, but the minute you put up, say, a three-month round with a limited amount of money then it becomes a very competitive thing. The reason we had flexible and open rounds-in other words, without a time limit; it was actually a three-year program which was rolled over-is so you do not ask a town like Tibooburra, for example, which is no longer in my electorate but has wonderful people, with 150 citizens and very few MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Committees
286,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (11.27 Am),"I rise to speak on the report presented to parliaresources, within a space of three months to have to compete in a round of $1 million or $100 million on the same terms as Orange, Sydney or any other huge population. Any town or city is huge compared to Tibooburra, I can assure you. White Cliffs is not much bigger and is almost as far out. You are asking them to compete for seed funding and all these various things which they want to have. They cannot possibly have any failures or have rules set for them. How do 150 people compete with 40,000 or with six million or with even a million? It means that, from day one, you are saying, ‘Don’t worry about the remote or the disadvantaged communities; they can compete on the same terms and in the same time frame for the same amount of money as the big places where they have got all the resources to come up with the idea and to find the money.’ Of course they can’t compete. It is not designed as the original Regional Partnerships program was. The idea will not be to help those in the most disadvantaged and remote regions to do something for themselves. PerhapsI can be a little bit generous now and offer some advice: if you want to be serious about it, don’t put this into a series of rounds because you will disadvantage those who are in remote areas. The more rules you put around it the more you will disadvantage them. They cannot compete. Don’t shake your head, Mr Sullivan. South Wales in a round cannot compete with the big ones. It is a fact. I will go back to the debacle surrounding all this in the first place. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, has been very disparaging of the previous government and of the National Party, in particular, over Regional Partnerships. He accused us of rorting the program and of terrible things. Yet this is the same person who had not been the minister for more than five minutes before he rorted big time a program about noise abatement and Mascot airport. He gave $14 million to a school in his own electorate but outside the program, so just to the one school. He did not even increase the region in which people could apply for the noise abatement funding, which I believe would have added something like $250 million-an enormous figure-to the whole program so that everyone else who was just as far outside the current program as this particular school in his electorate could have been included. He just gave it to that school. He did not make it available to anyone else. Without commenting on that any further, I say I do not think he of all people is in any position to throw stones or anything else. Anyone who went and listened to people talk about this program would point out, as I think the member for Hinkler might have said, the people were not upset with anything except perhaps the time it took the department to do the processing. They were not upset with the program, they were not upset by the fact that it was commercial and in fact they were very supportive. EveryoneI heard at the two hearings I went to was very supportive of the commercial aspect. All saw exactly what it did in providing jobs et cetera. They were very appreciative of the fact that it was flexible enough to allow Tibooburra to compete with the bigger towns, be they on the edge of Sydney or in the central west. I am here in this parliament to represent the seat of Calare in western New South Wales and its country people. As well, I do see myself as being a member of the Australian parliament, not just as somebody from west of Condobolin in New South Wales. I think we have all got a responsibility. I believe I very much have a responsibility in that way to the taxpayer of AusMAIN COMMITTEE",165,Committees

288,Mr John Cobb,"I know a town of 150 people in the most remote location of Newtralia. I have a duty to equity, and I have a duty to seeing the taxpayer’s money well spent. I think the member for Parkes said something to the effect that if you do not take any risk, you actually do not have any gain either. As for the old program, I think that, yes, we could have mucked around with the edges and made it better. But basically its aim was to give regional people an opportunity to help themselves. I would ask the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to stand up in parliament and say which PCYC, which medical centre and which community hall we should not have helped. If there were any failings in that program they were far outweighed by the good that it did. The first two medical centres in Australia that were helped by this were actually both in my electorate-not under my hand, and I was responsible for this program at one stage. The Cobar and Narromine centres were the first two, and they set a benchmark that went right around Australia. These were medical centres in areas that did have a problem attracting doctors and did have a problem putting records in one place. It has all done so much and set a standard for what can be done by common sense and by not having rules so rigid that a community is unable to access funding. That is what has been so good about it. As I said, I have no great problem with some of the changes they want to make, like doubling the amount before you get to the stage of having to do the full process to make it quicker et cetera. That is fine, possibly even common sense. But I would beg those responsible, if we do get a program in the future-and, if we do, I will bet it is just before the next election, but no-one will actually get any money before the next election; I will guarantee that too-to not make it impossible for small towns. Do not make it a program that puts a council or a region in Sydney on an equal basis with a small, remote town in the electorate of Kalgoorlie or Lingiari. And that is another thing-as somebody who used to be involved in this program, I can tell you that, in fact, applications made from Labor electorates basically had a success rate equal to any other. In fact, if any area was down on the success rate of applications, I think it was our own, but there was virtually no difference between the success rate of applications out of Labor electorates and the success rate of any other applications. The fact that there were far more regional electorates in coalition hands-there certainly were in those days-than in Labor hands meant that of course more projects were successful in our electorates. After all, it was based on helping regional communities. For the sake of people in the future I would beg the government to focus on being flexible enough to allow the small towns an opportunity not to have to compete with cities or large towns. I think that was one of the beauties of the previous program-it had the flexibility. It allowed them to do it and it did not mean that everything had to be run to a particular rule that disadvantaged them. things about debates in this place is that it is a kind of hit-and-run situation. People stand and make their contributions and then depart. It is a shame to me that less than 30 seconds into my contribution all the speakers from the other side and my own side who have preceded me in this debate have fled the chamber so that we cannot have a conversation. I think that, particularly in a chamber of this size, to be able to have a conversation about matters like this is far better than doing set-piece speeches-’I’ll present my case, you present yours and we’ll beg MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Committees
289,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (11.42 Am),"I have discovered that one of the disappointingto differ.’ Given that the member for Calare is gone, I shall revert to the format that I had previously decided to follow and talk about the matters that he raised a little later on. First of all, I say right from the outset that I reject absolutely the suggestion that was made by the deputy chair of the committee and first speaker on this debate today, the member for Hinkler, that the government members were working to an agenda in relation to this inquiry. That is entirely false and needs to be rejected absolutely out of hand. This is an interim report; it is not a final report. I am interested that the member saw fit to introduce a dissenting report and to make some alternative comments in the body of the interim report given that this interim report came about because, in its response to the global financial crisis, the government had made a fairly clear indication that it was considering funding local governments-and we saw that come about at the event involving the mayors that took place at Parliament House last week. This report was developed in a reasonably interesting environment. For example, there has been plenty of talk about the area consultative committees, ACCs, and the new body, Regional Development Australia, or RDA. In the context of us considering this report, we were not aware-and we are still not aware-of exactly what form RDA, the successor to ACCs, would take. We do not know that all ACCs are guaranteed to become RDA organisations. We do know, though, that throughout this process-and the member for Calare mentioned attending two public hearings conducted by ACCs in and near his area-they were engaged in a process parallel to it to try and determine, through the minister’s office, what RDA would do. While we were engaged in the quite clear process of looking at a program that had been absolutely slammed by the Audit Office in order to develop a program of integrity for introduction next year, there was this additional process going on on the side. Then, through our process, the ACCs turned up in force to argue their case for retention and to be left in charge of the dollars. ACCs were established as organisations that looked after employment programs, and they were very, very successful. They got an additional role in relation to the Regional Partnerships program, they got a sniff of the dollars and that is what they then considered would be their justification for existence. This report would not have been possible without broad cooperation from members of the committee-including Mr Neville, who ultimately introduced the dissenting report. I would like to particularly mention the chair of the committee, Catherine King, and the committee staff, who worked very hard to bring us to this position-in particular, Michael Crawford, the inquiry secretary, and the research officers, Susan Cardell and Dr Brian Lloyd. All the staff of the committee office are very vital to those of us who work in the committees and they ought to be acknowledged for the work that they do on every occasion that we stand on our feet. The report was based on a series of roundtable meetings and site visits. Not all of the members of the committee were able to attend all of the hearings. I was able to attend hearings in Toowoomba, Cairns, Darwin, Bundaberg and Canberra. There were also roundtable meetings in Perth, Launceston, Ballarat, Shepparton, Dubbo and Nowra. We heard a range of views. The member for Hinkler mentioned earlier a view that he picked up at Toowoomba. I was listening to the same people and heard perhaps with different ears, but in that hearing I heard a plea from the local government people that were in attendance that they needed to not have their program priorities taken over by ACCs, who develop projects with community groups and then come to the council for the matching partnership funding. Some of us live in MAIN COMMITTEE small areas or have lived in small towns. I should say to the member for Parkes that I listened as he mentioned Walgett at length because Walgett is one of the towns that I have lived in in my life. I listened to what he had to say, and I think pretty much everything that he had to say in regard to that town was accurate. We are knowledgeable on this side of the chamber about a number of things that you assume that we are not knowledgeable about. Mr Chester interjectingout some cheerios to my cousins Tommy and Stewart Evans. NowI will have to get in touch with them to tell them that they have been mentioned in the national Hansard. There are a couple of major thrusts in this report, and the one that we have been hearing most about from members opposite today is the recommendation that commercial projects be removed from this program. Each and every one of us understands the value of commercial programs in the development of regional areas. The dissenting report from the member for Hinkler says that we have said no to commercial programs but what we have said is, no, not under this one. We then went on, in recommendation No. 7, to recommend that the government establish a particular program to look after the commercial projects within a department with expertise in this area. Commercial projects represented eight per cent of the money given out and, although I am not sure that I am accurate, probably a hundred per cent of the rorts. I believe that one of the reasons that was able to occur is that business decisions were being made by bureaucrats in departments without business expertise. has been-and I have stated it and you can read it in Hansard-that regional development is not possible without economic development, and regional development is not possible without social development. We are not asking the community infrastructure program to provide police stations and hospitals. Those things are done by departments, or state governments in both of those cases. These kinds of community assets are developed and provided by departments with expertise in that area, and it should be the same with the development of business programs. I visited Bundaberg, the member for Hinkler’s headquarters, and went to three businesses that had received funding from the Regional Partnerships program, one of which had received one bunch of funding and then did not get the next. First of all there was a business that had relocated from Nambour with the assistance of that program to set up a business packaging cane mulch and selling it through various places like Bunnings Warehouse. I think they received $1 million from the Regional Partnerships program. The banks would not look at funding this business until they got the government money, yet this is the same business that, in the course of this season, put $2 million into the pockets of cane farmers in that area by buying the trash off their properties. If that is not a decent business plan well supportable by banks I do not know what is, yet the banks hang out to get that Australian government $1 million so that, if their assessment is wrong and things go bad, there is $1 million of government money that they already have to help them recover their losses.

But, yes, I believe it is worthy of support, but not through a group of people in a department inappropriate for business. If we get the business portfolios looking at regional business, at least we are getting them out of the city and understanding the differences and how people should be supported. We talked at Bundaberg about the form of government money to businesses. This money was all grant money, and it was: ‘Thank you very much. Here’s a nice cheque in the bank. Do what you like with it.’ One fellow, not from Bundaberg but from another place I visited, sold his business not long after he got it going. Okay, the money that the government gave provided ongoing jobs for people in that business, but a nice little wedge of it went into his pocket, and he was not at all embarrassed about that. In Bundaberg we discussed this with a number of people who had received commercial business grants through this program. They are not necessarily greedy and indeed saw that there was a reasonable case that, if somebody sold their business having received funding through this grant program, they ought to be required to pay money back to the government. They saw that low-interest or no-interest loans which, at a certain trigger point, could be repaid to the people of Australia would be just as valuable to them. They did not think that the government necessarily owed them a living. They want to work for their money-that is why they are in business. People in business want to work for money, and this program in some instances was really giving them an opportunity to be lazy. I have only got a short time left, so I will not talk about the issues around local government being the primary auspicing body. I think they have been well canvassed. Members opposite, many more of whom have local government experience than members on this side, would understand the reason that that needs to be so. I am very happy with that particular recommendation. I went out and made quite a deal of ground in that regard. One of the problems with the funding rounds, as mentioned by the Member for Calare, was the time it took for people to get decisions-for example, sending another letter out because next week they might get a better application than the one that is sitting in front of them and not be able to deal with that one because they have given the money to a lesser project. If you have got funding rounds, you can set timetables. In Toowoomba, we heard from the Queensland department of sport that when the round closes, the department has 14 days to have the information on the minister’s desk and the minister has to sign off in 10 days after that. If you are an applicant, you should know when you are going to be told and when you are going to get the money. We heard horror stories of people waiting for three years. I just want to mention the remarks of the member for Parkes about the member for New England being on this committee. This is just another example of the National Party sticking the boot into an Independent who they cannot beat in the polls. The member for New England sought to be on this committee for this inquiry, and he does have expertise in this area. This is a government that will embrace and work with the Independent MPs.

Anyway, the process had not beenlook at what the Independents think of you guys, read the member for Kennedy’s evidence at the hearings in Cairns. He gave you a proper bucket. community infrastructure interim report and the dissenting comments by the member for Hinkler. I do take up the commentary from the member for Longman, who I thought made a very constructive contribution to the debate, though he could not resist in the last 30 seconds giving the Nats a spray on the way through. I think there are many positive aspects to the report, just as there are many positive aspects to the previous Regional Partnerships program. I do fear that, in its desperate attempts to trash the legacy of previous government, the new government has shown a willingness to perhaps throw the baby out with the bath water when it comes to the Regional Partnerships program. I am not suggesting for a second that members of the committee are that way inclined, but there are some opposite who have shown perhaps a willingness during the heat of an election campaign to go a little bit too far. As the member for Parkes indicated, now that we are 12 months into the new government, I hope that cooler heads will prevail and there will be a real emphasis on ensuring that regional development projects and initiatives with the support of local communities do get undertaken in the future. I will take up the comments from the member for Hinkler, who submitted his report with a great deal of respect and reluctance. The member for Hinkler has an enormous amount of experience in regional development. While I am a newcomer to this place, I am a strong believer, as is the member for Hinkler, in the committee system and working together to achieve better outcomes for all Australians. I know he was reluctant to submit his dissenting report, but he did so in good faith and I believe he made some very pertinent points. The member for Parkes also referred to the Regional Partnerships program, basically appealing for people to understand and let the facts speak for themselves. There was an overwhelming amount of good that came out of the Regional Partnerships program. In my electorate of Gippsland, without running through every project that was supported, I think there was some enormous good done in my community with projects like Lifeline Gippsland with its $1.9 million centre. It received $550,000 of federal government funding. For those who do not understand the work of Lifeline, it provides an absolutely critical service in Gippsland, providing counselling, information and referrals for those contemplating suicide and that type of thing. That particular project was very well supported in my electorate, as was the Churchill and district community hub, which received $880,000 for redevelopment of the town centre of Churchill-one of the most perhaps disadvantaged communities in my region with very high unemployment rates and in need of a major commercial centre redevelopment. That and other projects were funded through Regional Partnerships. One of my particular favourites, for which we saw funding from the state Labor government as well as the Regional Partnerships program, was the paddle-steamer Curlip, which will be launched this weekend. Volunteers have built a replica of a paddle-steamer, and it will be plying the Snowy River this weekend for the first time. It is an enormous achievement by the people of Orbost, a community that has been knocked around by some, particularly, state government decisions in relation to resource allocation in the timber industry. This Regional Partnerships funding-and it was supported by state government funding-has been incredibly important to the people of Orbost and the wider East Gippsland region in terms of promotMAIN COMMITTEE",170,Committees
295,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11.57 Am),"I rise to speak on the Funding regional and localing the tourism industry. There was a Gippsland Immigration Wall of Recognition, which received $40,000 funding, in the town of Morwell. It recognised the enormous contribution that migrants have made to the community of the Latrobe Valley over the past 120 years, and it is a fabulous project. I note that the chair of the committee is the member for Ballarat. I notice that Sovereign Hill in Ballarat, an outstanding regional tourism attraction, received $500,000 for its Chinese village. It just reflects that the Regional Partnerships program did fund a very diverse range of projects. It had flexibility and it was innovative, and that was one of the strengths of the program. I note that the Funding regional and local community infrastructure report raises some of the issues that have been raised by other members in relation to the administration of Regional Partnerships, and I am happy to concede that there were some negative findings in the audit and that some aspects of the administration of the program have been criticised. But I completely reject the commentary from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, who has gone as far as claiming in this place that former ministers were corrupt. I think the minister is developing an unsavoury reputation for this type of grubby politicking. Yesterday he defamed the character of the former mayor of Port Macquarie and claimed that he had been sacked for corruption. He has made similar allegations about ministers involved with the Regional Partnerships program. I think that it is an outrageous slur from a minister who cannot help playing the man, and I really think he needs to take a cold shower, settle down a bit and realise that there are members on both sides of the House who actually want to get on with the job-in particular with Regional Partnerships or regional development initiatives. There are people who want to get on with the job and start delivering for their communities, and the minister himself would be well advised to do that. It took him 12 months to finally announce some funding for regional development last week. That was well received, I accept, throughout regional areas, but it did take 12 months. The minister should spend more time on those positive and practical applications of his skills rather than playing the man and making false allegations of corruption without any substantiation whatsoever. It reflects poorly on him and on his side of politics. The member for Hinkler made a dissenting report. I read the dissenting report and the interim report, and I think there is a lot of good in both of them, but there are two aspects of the reports that I want to concentrate on. They deal with the recommendations regarding the grant sizes and the approval processes and also the recommendations on the exclusion of for-profit entities from this program. I would like to start with recommendation 6, and I quote from the report: The Committee recommends that the new Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program exclude applications from for-profit entities. I note the contribution from the member for Longman in this regard, but I am afraid that we are going to have to agree to disagree on this one. At a time of rising unemployment, when job opportunities, particularly in regional areas, are going to become tighter and tighter, I believe that seed funding can really make a difference to these commercial entities, and I think it is a mistake by the committee in this case to recommend that the funding not be provided to for-profit entities. It is not just my opinion; it is also one that is shared by the member for Hinkler, who I believe has demonstrated, with his vast experience in regional development before entering this place, his breadth of knowledge. It is also the opinion of the former VictoMAIN COMMITTEE rian Minister for State and Regional Development, now Premier of Victoria, the Hon. John Brumby. I would like to quote from a media release from the Premier when he was Minister for State and Regional Development, from 30 October 2006: A $300,000 Bracks Government grant will trigger a $21 million expansion of Patties Foods Bairnsdale plant creating 100 new full-time jobs … The minister, who has never been one to hide his light under a bushel, went on to say: This expansion by Patties Foods is a major investment for East Gippsland that will allow the company to export into other new markets, especially in the lucrative US market, for its range of savoury pies, pasties, and sausage rolls. He went on to say: … the Regional Investment Initiative was a key part of the Victorian Government’s agenda to drive prosperity and growth across provincial Victoria… I have not always agreed with the honourable Premier of Victoria, but in this case I feel I must. Patties Foods is one of the great companies in regional Victoria and in East Gippsland. I will just say for the record that the former chairman of the company, Richard Rijs, has been a great contributor to regional development through his involvement with a group called Champions of the Bush, which is a successful lobby organisation, based primarily in Victoria, where regional companies have invested their own money-about $10,000 each per year-to support regional development and to encourage state and federal governments to invest in regional communities. Richard Rijs, as the former chairman of the board and ongoing member of Champions of the Bush, has been a great champion of regional communities. Some of the commentary from the member for Longman was that it is difficult for governments to pick winners, and I accept that. There have been some mistakes made in the past and I am sure there will be some more in the future. As the member for Hinkler says in his comments, to exclude ‘commercial development is a denial of the stated role of the department itself, Regional Development Australia’. The focus on community and social infrastructure is not something that I oppose at all, but I believe that the committee is being unnecessarily restrictive in this recommendation by excluding commercial operators from applying in the future. Providing a helping hand to existing or new operators to establish ventures in regional areas is a valuable use of taxpayers’ resources if used appropriately. I accept the need for checks and balances, which is a point that has been well made by members opposite. The government has had no hesitation in putting up about $6 million to bail out the car industry, and I believe it is serious about regional development. It will provide a funding stream for commercial developments to access in the future. I appreciate that the committee’s report in recommendation 7 supports the establishment of a regional industry grants scheme under another department, but I believe that scheme rightfully belongs with the new Regional Development Australia. In any case, I am not convinced that the government is committed to providing funding in relation to recommendation 7. I believe this program would lose its local input and focus if the commercial aspect was taken out of the grants scheme, and I support for-profit enterprises being able to apply for funding. I also take up the committee’s recommendation 13, regarding the sliding scale of complexity for forms and information requirements. I think it would be an excellent move to streamline the application process. If it is at all possible to go further in the future, I would urge the MAIN COMMITTEE committee to consider some type of smaller community grants scheme-a quick grants scheme, for want of a better phrase-for the not-for-profit sector. We have a problem in our smaller regional towns in that, if you apply for a small amount of funding, it almost becomes too onerous to bother. If communities raise dollar-for-dollar funding for projects up to $20,000, they demonstrate that they are committed to the project. I would strongly advocate a low-paperwork scheme of some description. The type of work carried out with that type of program would be upgrading community halls in small country towns, upgrading or establishing playgrounds-which have a regional tourism focus in themselves-and improving sporting facilities. I accept that you will need to maintain the accountability factors that go with it, but I think we need to actually start trusting some of our local communities a lot more. If the local community groups and the not-for-profit groups have the capacity to raise $5,000 or $10,000 themselves for a worthwhile community program, I think we can develop a quick grant type of scheme to assist them to undertake that type of work. I make one point, though, in relation to improving sporting facilities, and this links into other discussions about excessive use of alcohol and responsible service of alcohol. We have a major problem in country communities in that the only avenue available to some of our country sporting clubs to raise funds is selling alcohol. We can preach to them as much as we like about the responsible service of alcohol and encouraging young people to pursue healthy lifestyles but, unless we are prepared to put some money in to help these footy, netball and cricket clubs, the way they make their money will be over the bar. We are going to need to support them in the future and I think this grants program is one opportunity to do that and to really support these small local communities. Regarding the approvals process, I believe that we need to make sure we have a focus on developing local solutions to local problems. I take up the views of the member for Hinkler again on support for local development boards, views which were echoed by the member for Parkes and also the member for Lindsay in his commentary about the success of the Roads to Recovery program. One of the great successes of that program was the local buy-in-that we have trusted local people to understand their local area, to develop their own practical solutions using their common sense and to set their own priorities in their communities. The Roads to Recovery model is a very good model for us, particularly when looking at smaller infrastructure projects. I believe there are opportunities to involve local government more in that regard, and I encourage the minister to involve local government directly in the $300 million program announced last week. My only criticism of that program is that it needs to go two, three or four years further into the future to give these councils some surety that funding is on the way. The backlog of projects is always going to be there-you can invest as much as you like in regional infrastructure but there is always another project waiting around the corner. The minister made a good decision in relation to that $300 million project. It was well received in my community, and the only hesitation we have is that we would like to see some surety of investment going forward. Just in terms of local input and ensuring that local communities are engaged in the process, once you get your local communities involved in setting the priorities and achieving the funding you will find that the local communities will actually leverage off the available funding and turn 10 bucks into 100 bucks very quickly. They are very good in small country communities: one bloke will have a truck and the other bloke will know someone with a bobcat MAIN COMMITTEE whose cousin is a painter whose mate will put the whole playground up for a slab of VB. That is the type of leveraging you will get out of country communities. They will put in a lot of in kind community work for you and use their resources for the benefit of their community once you have engaged them and ensured they have some control over how the funding is allocated. In closing, I would like to acknowledge that the Regional Partnerships program did an enormous amount of good for country areas. I would also like to put on the record the support for the area consultative committee, particularly in Gippsland, where the staff and the board members have unfortunately been caught up in this whole debate. I join the member for Hinkler in raising some serious reservations about the report and urge the government to abandon the politics completely and just get on with the job at hand. In saying that, I am not seeking at all to reflect negatively on any of the individual committee members. I believe they have been put in a difficult situation where the heat of an election campaign has flowed into a report, and now we really want to get on with the job of doing some good for regional areas I commend the committee at many levels for the work they have done with their interim report. As I said at the outset, there are many positive recommendations in the report. As an interim report there is always room for improvement. I urge the members to have the courage to possibly take risks in their final report and support the potential growth in regional communities. I also join with the member for Parkes in calling on members on all sides to ignore some of the rantings and ravings we have seen by the minister in relation to this and focus on the important job at hand. I believe the committee will focus on the important job at hand and that they will ignore the minister, because he is actually going through the process of discrediting himself with some of the ranting and raving he has been going on with in parliament of late. I wish the committee well with their deliberations and look forward to supporting them in their efforts to invest in the future of regional communities. Australia) (12.12 pm)-The Funding regional and local community infrastructure report is outstanding. It comes about as a consequence of a number of issues. It comes about because of the need to refocus and realign public policy in the area of regional development. It comes about because of the unfortunate negative consequences of the three-volume, 1,200-page audit report from the Australian National Audit Office which was released in November 2007. The report, which the member for Gippsland would do well to read, was constructed for the former government. It was a report constructed by the Australian National Audit Office at the time of the former government; it was a report to the former government. It was simply outstanding that the former government was prepared to consider the operation of this program via the Australian National Audit Office and, furthermore, to accept the recommendations of the ANAO. Over the course of the past 12 months, regional development discussions in this parliament have tended to be inspired by members opposite in the context of defending the almost indefensible decisions that were made by ministers of the former government to support political regional development-to support projects that were frequently for private enterprise, that frequently had not passed competitive neutrality tests and that frequently were questioned in the broader community, and they mostly lost taxpayer money. It is unfortunate that it has proven so difficult for members of the former government to put the past behind them. I wish MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Committees
296,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northernthey would-I encourage them to do that-and look to the future through this outstanding report. The outstanding report comes about because the members of the committee who produced the report are simply outstanding members of parliament. Catherine King, as the chair of this committee, brought to focus her significant experience in Ballarat, in the broader community and in watching and participating in the regional development debate over the course of the last decade. A very good friend of mine, Paul Neville, brought to focus both his participation in the former government and his concern to see regional development in his own community. There was also a valid debate around the role of private enterprise and for-profit organisations in the receipt of funding for regional development. Jodie Campbell, Darren Cheeseman, Jason Clare, Joanna Gash, Brett Raguse, Don Randall, Andrew Robb, Jon Sullivan and Tony Windsor are all members of parliament with significant interests in this debate and are all members of parliament whose desire was only to get the best possible result. The interim report is in my view the best possible result. If we look through the recommendations of the interim report, we see recommendations that have integrity, recommendations that will strengthen how regional development and the local community infrastructure program can work into the future. Recommendation 1 reads: The Committee recommends that the government establish well defined and clear objectives for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program that sit within an articulated Commonwealth Government regional development policy. That is absolutely valid, absolutely necessary, and stands in contrast to the way in which former governments have operated in this area. In that, I do not simply refer to the government led by former Prime Minister Howard; the previous Labor government also stands condemned for the way in which it approached many of these regional development issues. Recommendation 2 reads: The Committee recommends that the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program retain the option of establishing sub-programs to direct funding to strategic priority areas or applicant groups. That is something that is worthy of consideration, something that the government will take seriously. Recommendation 3 reads: The Committee recommends that the new Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program: cover all regions of Australiait willemploy a partnership model … It will. The partnership model structured under Regional Partnerships at its best is simply outstanding. There were many projects that were funded under Regional Partnerships that were simply outstanding. We should not be blinded by the three-volume, 1,200-page report that found significant shortfalls in the administration of the program, found significant political interference in the expenditure of taxpayer money and found significant unexplainable decisions. These include decisions to fund, for instance, an ethanol plant that did not exist and a community railway facility which had not made an application and which subsequently burnt down. There are legitimate questions, but some outstanding projects on the part of outstanding community groups, producing outstanding results, came out of the many hundreds of millions of dollars that were expended through this program by the former government. MAIN COMMITTEE The committee also recommended that ‘local government be the auspice agency for applications in a region with a requirement that local government contribute’ to the projects. It is the view of the government that local government has a valid, important and organic role to play in allocations, in decision making and in prioritising in local communities. In the past we found that some projects had been supported by area consultative committees but were not supported by local government. On some occasions hundreds of thousands of dollars-or millions of dollars-went to fund pieces of infrastructure, and local government then had the ongoing maintenance costs, salary costs or staffing costs of projects which were not on local government priority lists. Why is that important? It is important because local government is actually transparent. It is important because local government is answerable to local communities. It is important because local government is accountable. Area consultative committees were not always accountable to local communities. Recommendation 5 reads: The Committee recommends that the Government consider: establishing a quarantined sub-program of funding to which community organisations, with local government support, only can apply; or where feasible, requiring that a set percentage of applications put forward by a local government area be from community organisations. We will look at that. I am not quite sure how that will work, but I look forward to exploring how we can make recommendation 5 work. Recommendation 6 has been commented on significantly by members opposite. Recommendation 6 reads: The Committee recommends that the new Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program exclude applications from for-profit entities. We will accept that recommendation. That recommendation is there because we wish, through this program, to support initiatives that are for the benefit of the broad community through community organisations and not through for-profit organisations. I am absolutely delighted that in recommendation 6 the committee recommends that the government consider regional industry grants as a separate stream under another department-it has suggested the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research-when looking at how for-profit granting should take place. I know the member for Hinkler has spoken many times in this place about an outstanding commercial enterprise in his area, Auschilli. I am very aware of Auschilli. I am aware of it because I have read and understood the application. Frankly, when I look at Auschilli or when I look at an avocado producer’s request for funding for a shed in the south-west of Western Australia, I see some outstanding requests for funding by for-profit organisations which would have a significant regional impact. There is no doubt about that. But there is equally no doubt that the process of assessing Regional Partnerships applications, considering competitive neutrality, considering the transparent expenditure of taxpayers’ money, was not appropriate through the Regional Partnerships model. That was the conclusion of the Australian National Audit Office; that is the conclusion of the government. As we move closer to 2009 and to the possibility, though we hope not, that economic circumstances will become significantly tighter in 2009, that we will see increased unemployment and that there will probably be damage to regional communities, though we hope not, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, it may well be necessary through Regional DeMAIN COMMITTEE velopment Australia to deliver labour market programs. It may well be necessary through Regional Development Australia to deliver programs which support communities during this difficult time. It is my hope that Regional Development Australia in its new incarnation will be equal to that task. However, it will not be the function of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program to fund programs that are for-profit organisations. Recommendation 8 says that the committee recommends that the government consider more formally charging RDAs with a role of assisting applicants to develop their expressions of interest into an application. That is an outstanding recommendation; the government will have pleasure adopting that as part of the role and function of RDA. The recommendation 8 further argues that the department: … could undertake this role utilising either a regional field officer in each region or an officer allocated a specific region from either the national office or a regional office … . I am enthusiastic to make the connection here between Regional Development Australia and the local communities that it represents as organic as possible. I think it is essential that RDA be able to assess its community in a way that allows it to support applicants to literally help develop expressions of interest and to form communities of interest around particular ideas for government funding. I think recommendation 8 is particularly strong. Recommendation 9 reads: Should the Government wish to pursue the option of having regionally based field officers … collaborating with local council and community groups to identify opportunities, priorities and partnershipsand there are a range of recommendations in that which I will have to take on notice and in the fullness of time consider how recommendation 9 may be implemented. Recommendation 10 refers to regionally based field officers again. I place that in the category with recommendation 9. Recommendation 11 reads: The Committee recommends that the Government consider developing a centralised assessment process for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I think this is essential. I am pleased to see the former minister has entered the chamber. I know the difficulties which the former minister had in assessing and watching decisions being made in this area. I hasten to make the comment that there are many very good decisions that were made to support community organisations. The ones that were less good have been adequately highlighted by the three-volume 1,200-page report of the ANAO, which was commissioned in the time of the former government and which reported to the former government. Members in this chamber have seen, over the course of the last week, the government announce its $300 million program at the local government conference here in Canberra. It is important that, as members look at how that $300 million has been earmarked for expenditure, there are clearly transparent indicators in how that money is being spent. Every local government area received a $100,000 allocation. Growth councils, which are an identified group of councils, received a growth component. The balance of the allocation was made on the basis of the states’ financial grants granting processes. This is transparent, clear and of outstanding value to local government. The general reaction to this kind of transparent process has strengthened the government’s resolve not only to ensure the involvement of local MAIN COMMITTEE government in the new program as it goes forward but also to ensure complete transparency in the way in which these grants are both announced and considered by the government. We announced, in the course of the last election campaign, the now government’s Better Regions Program. This was constructed by the former shadow minister for trade and regional development and member for Hotham, Simon Crean, in a way that ensured that the then opposition could match in local communities, in some way, the significant regional development efforts of the then government. This program and these projects are in the process of being rolled out as every single proponent and project recipient is confirmed in their project. As every project is confirmed for funding, we will put the project on the departmental website. Every dollar spent through the project will be transparently declared publicly on the departmental website. The first project, which was the painting of the Ben Chifley engine, is already publicly available and on the website. parties generally support the government’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Councils are obviously keen to obtain whatever money they can for local infrastructure and, as a former council chairman, I know how welcome those payments will be. However, the new program has missed some opportunities and I hope that those gaps may be filled by the government sometime in the future. The coalition spent between 1996 and 2007 $30 billion on regional and rural programs that built infrastructure, improved social and economic opportunities and created jobs. One of the many programs that emerged to deal with regional disadvantage was the Regional Partnerships program. This program has been criticised by many from the luxury of living in wealthy capital cities but it was successful in helping to grow country towns and disadvantaged communities right through the nation. More than 1,500 projects were approved under the Regional Partnerships program during its four-year life, at a cost of about $350 million. It was a popular program and it delivered results. One of the best elements of the program was that it also levered local community investment. For every dollar provided through the Regional Partnerships program, funding of $3 to $4 was contributed by other funding partners. So local businesses in communities were able to invest in projects and it gave them a great sense of community ownership. They were locked in to making the project a success. Not every project was as successful as was hoped and some taxpayers’ money was lost. However, if a project was so financially solid in its own right then it did not need government support; it should have been supported and funded by the normal banking sector. This program was about helping make financially achievable the projects which otherwise would not have been possible. For that reason it was able to break through and deliver community infrastructure in ways that otherwise would not have been possible. There has been criticism that somehow or other it favoured coalition electorates. The fact is that the coalition held most of the regional seats. But the approval rate for electorates was this: of projects submitted in National Party electorates, 70 per cent were approved; 72 per cent were approved in Liberal electorates; 69 per cent were approved in electorates held by Independents; and 72 per cent were approved in electorates held by Labor. So there is no evidence that there was any kind of special political patronage. The approval rates for projects, from whatever electorate they came from, were broadly comparable. MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Committees
297,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of the Nationals) (12.27 pm)-The Liberal and NationalThe Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government takes great pleasure in throwing scorn on projects. He is one of those who has the luxury of living in a wealthy city, and he does not have an understanding of how important some of these projects can be in small regional communities. It is important that there be a program available that helps the most disadvantaged. We have to be careful in designing a new program that, because of all its accountability requirements, it is not only accessible by wellskilled grant applicants-the professional grant receivers-but also accessible by those poor communities that actually need help in the development process of the project and that it is managed effectively in the weeks and months during which that project is being undertaken. It is very important that we do not just look to the high achievers to receive funding from a program like this. If it is going to be really useful it should include those who are underachievers-those who are at considerable disadvantage. They are the ones who need particular help. As time is limited I will make only one more point. I do think it is disappointing that the for-profit sector is being excluded from the government’s program. If we do want to rebuild regional economies, we have to attract new industries and new projects. Some financial support to create jobs in those disadvantaged communities can do much more for them than painting the hall, even though we like that community infrastructure. It can be more important than the construction of a new tourist information centre, although that in itself can create jobs. We do need to be looking at the overall strength and depth of an economy. By providing support and seeding funding for new industries, we are actually permanently building a new economy and making those regional communities better able to support themselves. I strongly support the comments of my colleague the member for Hinkler in his dissenting report to this inquiry. I do believe that there is a role for governments to support these kinds of projects to help get communities working again so that they can permanently care for themselves in the years ahead. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Fadden Electorate: Mortgage Stress liament that the Gold Coast suburb of Helensvale in my electorate is suffering the worse mortgage stress of any suburb in the entire nation. As reported today in the Courier Mail by the housing editor, Melissa Ketchell: The report by global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings found the number of people more than 30 days in arrears of their mortgage payments had increased to 2.13 per cent-up from 1.88 per cent over the six months to September 30. The 90-day default rate had also increased, from 0.73 per cent to 0.97 per cent. Helensvale was by dollar value the worse suburb for delinquencies with a staggering 7.78 per cent of the total value of mortgages 30 days or more in arrears. The article continues: The Gold Coast and upmarket Vaucluse… joined more working-class suburbs in southwestern Sydney to be named the areas most suffering from loan defaults. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Committees
298,Mr Melham (Banks) (12.32 Pm),I move:,180,Adjournment
299,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12.32 Pm),"I am deeply distressed to have to report to the parMore than 840,000 residential mortgages, valued at $140 billion, were outstanding at the end of September, Fitch Ratings said in its report “Australian Mortgage Delinquency by Postcode-30 September 2008”. It said interest rate rises in late 2007 and 2008 were to blame for people falling behind in their loans. Fitch Ratings said it expected the rate of defaults across the country to increase as households dealt with Christmas costs and an expected rise in unemployment. … … … Report author Ben McCarthy said the most significant changes had been seen in the suburbs of Perth and southeast Queensland … According to the article, he went on to say: “As long as people keep their jobs, serviceability has actually improved and mortgage performance should remain good.” My great concern for the people of Helensvale, in the middle of my electorate, and indeed all of those mortgage holders in my electorate, is that the government has forecast that unemployment will increase by 200,000 people this financial year alone, to five per cent, and to 5.75 per cent in the following year. The impact that that increase in unemployment will have on mortgage holders in Helensvale, with 7.78 per cent of them already in arrears, could be devastating. The Helensvale and northern Gold Coast area has already been badly affected by a range of the economic mismanagement we have seen. Twenty per cent of staff at the marine precinct in the northern part of Fadden have been made redundant or lost their jobs. It began with Riviera Marine, with over 250 job losses, and moved on to Telwater; Maritimo followed. Some argue that it started with the genie out of the bottle, an inflation monster wreaking havoc. The government sought to denounce the Howard-Costello legacy for purely political purposes, and all it did was to force interest rates up. At a time when the rest of the world was reducing interest rates and taxation and increasing spending, this government did the opposite in a war on inflation, the first of 11 wars that have not assisted. This was the government’s response to an economic crisis in which other governments across the world have taken measured, conservative, well-considered, well-modelled responses. Unfortunately, the SwanRudd government is now known as the only government on the planet whose response has made things worse. The government moved on to unlimited bank guarantees, which have affected many people in Fadden, because the result has been 270,000 Australians who have had redemptions of money frozen in cash and property management accounts because of the market distortion of the unlimited guarantee announced on 14 October. It would be dreadful if that unlimited guarantee was made simply because the government wanted to practise one-upmanship on the opposition leader, Mr Turnbull, who had announced only two days previously that $100,000 would be more appropriate, as that is where the rest of the developed world were pitching their bank guarantees. We are now heading for a budget deficit. Some argue the budget is already in deficit. The community of Helensvale, already in mortgage default, cannot handle more bad economic news, and I implore this government to make sensible and reasoned decisions. MAIN COMMITTEE Pensions and Benefits Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.37 pm)-I am going to talk about good news. The good news I am going to talk about is the simple fact that pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners who were ignored by the previous government-wife and widowed pensioners; people on partnered, widowed and bereaved allowances; veterans affairs service pensioners; veterans income supplement recipients; Commonwealth seniors health card holders; veterans gold card holders who are eligible for seniors concessions allowance; and carer allowance recipients-will all be receiving a much-needed payment just before Christmas through the Rudd government’s economic stimulus package. The economic stimulus package will provide $4.8 billion to assist age pensioners, veterans and disability support pensioners and carers. This is a far cry from what the previous government did. The previous government did not listen to the pensioners. After all, the then Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs took a recommendation to cabinet that pensioners should be paid more money, but it ignored his recommendation. It has taken the election of the Rudd Labor government to actually deliver to pensioners. First, we increased the utilities allowance to $500 a year; that is indexed, unlike the previous money that was paid to pensioners. Pensioners receive the same amount as do self-funded retirees, so that is an acknowledgment that pensioners were doing it hard. We also looked at the way pensions were indexed and put it in a more favourable light for pensionerssomething that the previous government ignored for the 12 long years it was in government. For 12 long years it sat on its hands and did nothing to assist pensioners and elderly Australians. In addition, from 1 January next year pensioners will be able to use their travel concession cards to travel anywhere in Australia-use of the cards will not be limited to the state they live in. Following the one-off payment that they will receive on the fortnight commencing 8 December, pensioners will look to the government for further remuneration from 1 July next year. The Harmer review has been taking submissions and will make recommendations to the government. The government will deliver a long-term solution for pensioners. What does this mean for the people that I represent in this parliament? As well as the payment to the pensioners there will be one-off payments to families in receipt of the family tax benefit A. In the electorate of Shortland, there will be 42,724 people who benefit from the Rudd government’s economic stimulus package. There are 11,144 age pensioners partnered, 7,454 single pensioners, 89 wife pensioner partnered and one in the category of a bereavement allowance. As for carers, we have 2,768 on the carer allowance coupled and 1,091 on carer allowance single and there are in excess of 1,000 on carer payment, coupled and single. There are 11,133 families who receive family tax benefit A who will benefit. All up, as I said, there will be 42,724 beneficiaries. The Rudd government is a government that listens to the people and it knows that families are struggling. The Rudd government has been in power while we have had two percentage points decrease in the interest rate, unlike under the previous government when the interest rates only went one way-up. The Rudd government has listened to people and will deliver to them before Christmas when they need extra financial support. MAIN COMMITTEE Greenway Electorate: Richmond Road Richmond Road to dual carriageway from the M7 to Richmond. I am sorry to say that I need to rise and speak about it again because there have been not just more fatalities but a number of accidents on that road since then. In that short time there have been two major accidents. One was fatal and the other involved a B-double truck, a 12-tonne rigid truck and three other vehicles. Thankfully, no-one died in this particular accident, but emergency services spent more than an hour cutting people from the wreckage and a 42-year-old male remains in a critical but stable condition. He has a family, people who care for him, and responsibilities. Back in November 2006 the NSW government announced details of the program to upgrade Richmond Road. The improvements included an upgrade of the following intersections: Richmond Road and Garfield Road, Richmond Road and St Marys Road, Richmond Road at the roundabout intersection of Knox Road and Quakers Hill Parkway-it is a wonder that somebody has not been killed at that intersection-and Richmond Road and Northern Road. That was two years ago. The only roadworks underway-they have begun; they are not finished-are the Knox Road roundabout and the intersection at St Marys Road. Two sites from a very limited list of upgrades announced two years ago are not good enough. Upgrades of intersections alone, while welcome, are not good enough; they are just temporary solutions. The only solution, one that will deliver some safety along Richmond Road, is to make it a dual carriageway from the M7 ramp all the way through to Richmond. This road has been full of tragedy for nearly 20 years and it is just worsening. The number of fatalities and the number of accidents are increasing. In 2007, I spoke in parliament about Richmond Road. I said then, and it holds true today, that if this road were located in the middle of Sydney, or maybe in a marginal state Labor seat, the New South Wales Labor government would have committed to upgrading it fully by now. But the New South Wales government is broke. It is a basket case. Its economic mismanagement means that problem roads like Richmond Road will continue to hurt people and put more strain on emergency departments, emergency services and the broader community. How do families cope with the loss of a loved one, with the long-term care required for a seriously injured person’s rehabilitation, with the loss of income, the future plans postponed or never realised? Only seven kilometres of Richmond Road’s 34 kilometres are dual carriageway. The remaining 27 kilometres from the M7 overpass are single lane, yet this road has seen a massive increase in vehicle movements, including truck movements, as people take advantage of the M7. The New South Wales government might say the cost is too high to upgrade the whole road to dual carriageway. I say the cost to the community is far higher not to do so. I call on the New South Wales government and the Rudd government to invest desperately needed infrastructure funds to upgrade Richmond Road. If they fail to do so within a reasonable time, the people of Western Sydney will have every right to feel betrayed and ignored. Worse, their safety will continue to be compromised until this road is fixed. HMAS Sydney Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (12.47 pm)-Some time ago a lady in her eighties came into my office in Launceston. She wanted to know what was happening in Tasmania to commemorate the historic discovery of HMAS Sydney off the coast of Western Australia. She wanted to know because her brother had been aboard the light cruiser on that fateful day in 1941 when MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Adjournment
300,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.42 Pm),"Three weeks ago I spoke on the need to upgradeits fate collided with that of the German raider Kormoran. Mary Bailey and her sister, Rita Mulligan, felt their brother and the 35 other Tasmanians lost on that day deserved recognition. I agreed and that is why, in conjunction with the Naval Association’s Alex McNeil, a federal government grant was applied for and provided. The Naval Association received $3,000 to stage a memorial for those who perished on HMAS Sydney. I had the pleasure of attending that memorial on 19 November. As you are no doubt aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, and as has been well documented, there were 645 men on HMAS Sydney who lost their lives. Thirtysix of them were Tasmanian. It is impossible for us to understand the pain families and loved ones have gone through over the years and the uncertainty, for so long, of not knowing where their brothers, fathers or uncles actually died. I pay tribute to their enduring commitment. I pay tribute also to the commitment of their loved ones who served on the Sydney and, indeed, those hundreds of Tasmanians who gave their lives in the many theatres of the Second World War. Isolated though Tasmania is, as a state we have a fine tradition of service. Men and women have, and still do, serve our country with professionalism and pride. The death of a loved one during wartime is a difficult thing to comprehend. The tragedy of the Sydney was doubly compounded by the mystery surrounding its exact location. I do not doubt that the discovery of its watery grave in March this year, more than 6½ decades after its engagement with the Kormoran, provided closure for some and reopened old wounds for others. The Second World War was a bloody and drawn-out conflict fought on the seas, in the air, across deserts and jungles and in all four seasons. It cost the lives of more than 1,100 Tasmanians. They were prisoners of war, airmen, soldiers and, of course, seamen. Their sacrifices and the sacrifices of those they left behind have made indelible marks on our collective psyche. For their selflessness we are grateful; in the face of their bravery we are humbled. The discovery on 17 March of HMAS Sydney laid to rest one of our country’s most enduring maritime mysteries. It provided those left behind with a final resting place for those who perished-a final resting place some 2.5 kilometres under the surface. There are many touching stories from the Sydney, but one I heard at the memorial service in George Town has stayed with me. A lady, who I will refer to as Barbara, grew up in Tasmania and later moved to Sydney, but not before she met and fell in love with a young man, who I will call Tommy. This young man was firm friends with another lad, who I will call Cyril, whose father, like Tommy’s had returned a very changed man from the First World War. These two young men and their respective girlfriends were enjoying being young and in love when a war, which seemed like a long way away, broke out. In July 1940, Cyril enlisted. Tommy tried to follow but his father, who, you will recall, was a veteran of the First World War, would not have it. So Tommy jumped on a cargo ship to Melbourne and joined the Navy. Fate saw him drafted onboard HMAS Sydney. His letters home to Barbara told of a young man determined to prove himself able and worthy of serving on this fine ship. He was looking forward to the war being over and returning home to Tasmania to start a life and a family with Barbara. Given that he was enlisted away from his home, his family had no idea he was aboard the Sydney when she sank, nor was Barbara even formally notified-she was, after all, only his girlfriend. But Tommy had sent her a photo before he sailed and told her he would be back. Tragically, he never returned, but Barbara would forever have his photo and she carried it with her all her life. Barbara married almost three decades after Tommy’s death and it was a MAIN COMMITTEE happy marriage, although she carried a torch always for her first love. Barbara died about 18 months ago, before the Sydney was found. This is just one example. It is but one heart breaking story of a life forever changed by war, forever changed by the sinking of HMAS Sydney. I would like to congratulate those whose tireless efforts, commitment and, for some, obsession led to the discovery of the Sydney. I would like to thank sisters Mary Bailey and Rita Mulligan for bringing to my attention the role played by Tasmanians on HMAS Sydney, and also Alex McNeil for his efforts to honour the Sydney’s crew. As a federal government, we have demonstrated a commitment to remembering and honouring those who lost their lives on the Sydney, and that is something which I believe is vital for any government to do. With this in mind, the government has permanently protected both HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran under the Historic Shipwreck Act 1976. For more than 66 years the fates of the Sydney and the Kormoran had been the subject of much public speculation and heartache, and the finding gave the opportunity for closure for many families and friends of the crew. We have now made these measures permanent under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, prohibiting the damage, disturbance or removal of the vessels and their relics and requiring a Commonwealth permit to enter the sites. Grey Electorate: Wind Farms which is taking a large hold in my electorate of Grey. In the next 10 years South Australia will generate 20 per cent of its electricity by wind power, much of this within my electorate. I was recently at the opening of the Snowtown wind farm by TrustPower, a New Zealand group which has invested heavily in the area. There was a fantastic crowd at Snowtown that day for the opening. The crowd gathered around one of the blades off a generator which the company has put on permanent display there. For anyone who has never been anywhere near a wind farm, it is quite an eye-opener and an awesome experience to walk underneath this blade and see how big it is. I encourage people in my electorate to drop in and have a look. It will become a great tourist drawcard for Snowtown. Wind farms do not come without some penalty. I have quite a bit of contact about this in my office and there are people who believe that they mar the landscape, but I think that is something we should live with. There are others who believe that the lighting regime on the wind towers is an extreme interference to their lives. I have quite some sympathy for this. In some places around Hallett, Yankalilla and now around Snowtown, we are seeing wind farms go up on both sides of a valley. People sit outside on summer evenings, as they have always done, on their back porches looking out. The lights are quite strong. They flash in unison and are in full view. If you are down in a valley below a wind farm, they are at about 10 or 15 degrees on your horizon. Some people claim that it interferes with their mental health. HoweverI think it is something that they should not have to put up with. I would not say that if I could not think of a solution, and I can. The Commonwealth Aviation Safety Authority are currently looking at the guidelines on wind farms. The simple solution is that the wind towers should be shielded below the 180degree plateau from the top of the tower-this means about 400 feet for the wind tower, so it is still under the lowest safe flying altitudes. Anybody flying an aircraft at night would clearly MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Adjournment
301,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (12.52 Pm),"I rise today to speak about the wind-farm industry,see these lights as they approached the towers, but those who sit below the level of the tower will not see the lights. We also have extreme intensity on these lights and they are situated on every second tower, at least. I think both of those regulations should be considered, in so much as many of these wind farms are very remote from aerodromes. As modern aeroplanes all now fly on a GPS navigation system, there is really not much excuse not to know where the hills are and to be flying below a safe altitude, which certainly anyone flying at night would not be doing. As a holder of a private pilots licence with a night endorsement I can certainly tell you that is not my practice. While this may seem to be an issue that might not concern a lot of people, it is a concern for those who live around the wind towers. The wind farms are unashamedly good. They are good for our economy, they are good for the environment and they are certainly good for regional employment. They are a great example of regionalised industry, of taking industry out of the cities into the regions and supporting local communities. SoI fully support them. But I do think those that take issue with the lighting have good grounds for complaint. I have written to CASA about this and I have spoken to the local media in my electorate, and I am following it up. There is also some interest from the Broken Hill region. Most of you would have read in the paper a plan for a 600-tower wind farm at Silverton. If this regulation should come back before the federal parliament I hope that members of this House would not just push it away and say, ‘What are they worried about a few red lights for?’ I think it is an issue of importance to these people. As I said at the beginning, it is an issue that we can do something about. It is not hard to fix and we should do so. Braddon Electorate: Projects siduously with us to support any legislation coming forward on the mandated renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 to aid the wind development in his electorate. I return to parliament this week after a busy week back at home and a rewarding time in my electorate of Braddon. There have been a few major achievements in recent weeks, one of which is also a pet project of the member for Bass, who is graciously in the chamber at the moment. It was quite satisfying to be able to tick off some important projects just a few weeks before the major milestone of a year in government. The first of these is something that has been more than a year in the making, and was the result of just a little nagging directed toward our Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, the very honourable Senator Carr. I refer to the launch and opening of Tasmania’s $12 million Enterprise Connect centre based in Burnie, which Senator Carr carried out quite admirably on 6 November. To launch what is a state-wide service, we were the guests of Geoff Parker and his excellent staff at Australian Weaving Mills in Devonport, one of the innovative companies which has seen the potential benefits of Enterprise Connect and grasped it with both hands. Why did we fight so hard to see Enterprise Connect come to Tasmania and my area? Simply because I could see a great benefit to the state in having this centre, to build on what is a remarkably innovative region, the north-west coast of Tassie. This has been borne out by interest from companies like Australian Weaving Mills, who are a success story as one of the MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Adjournment
302,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.56 Pm),"I know the member for Grey will work asgreat survivors of Australia’s manufacturing sector. Enterprise Connect offers some real expertise in so many areas, and through the new Burnie based centre Tasmanian businesses can tap into that knowledge wherever it is in the country. It will also allow other centres and states to take advantage of Tasmania’s renowned innovators and share some of our knowledge. The delivery of Enterprise Connect was followed up on 14 November by the announcement of $10 million for the patient transport assistance plan for Tasmania. I was pleased to represent the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, to announce the Rudd government’s funding, which was combined with the Bartlett government’s major revamp of patient transport, in what I am sure will be a significant improvement for people at a time when they are in real need. The whole area of patient transport was constantly put to me before and during the election campaign as a vital area of concern. This was not just in terms of accessing appropriate forms of transport, assisting with the costs and having equipment to assist disabled and challenged patients using aircraft, but having access to accommodation when required to travel to receive medical assistance and treatment. Under the transport initiative, the Rudd government will provide up to $3 million to acquire additional patient transport vehicles in the north-west, north and south of the state; up to $3.1 million to establish low-cost patient accommodation in Burnie; up to $90,000 for upgrades to the Spurr Wing accommodation complex in Launceston in the electorate of Bass; up to $2.72 million to purchase new IT infrastructure and software to improve communication and coordination of patient transport and accommodation across the entire state; up to $300,000 to upgrade Queenstown Airport in the electorate of Lyons to ensure safe patient transfers; up to $20,000 to purchase appropriate patient transport and lifting equipment at Wynyard Airport, particularly for those who come from King Island or who have to access it from the west coast; and up to $770,000 to implement new ‘telehealth’ initiatives to reduce the necessity for patients to travel to receive health care. I was back here in the nation’s capital last week for the announcement of $1.721 million in extra funds for the seven councils in Braddon, part of the government’s $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Some of the nay-sayers, particularly from the other side, have questioned this injection, but I have been in close contact with a number of the councils in my region and encouraged them to look at projects they can bring forward. They are thrilled to have an extra pot of money to put into some of their local infrastructure. The latest money for councils comes on top of $3.65 million in the next instalment of financial assistance grants in my electorate. The funding for the councils is one way the Rudd government is acting to stimulate the economy and protect against the uncertainty that grips the world at the moment and the Australian economy in general. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.02 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Indigenous Communities (Question No. 364) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 20 October 2008: (1) Has a permit been required to visit Hermannsburg in the past, and will a permit be required to visit Hermannsburg in the future. (2) Will the Government implement a system which allows Northern Territory communities to opt out of the permit system. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Before the commencement on 17 February 2008 of certain changes to the permit system under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response legislation there was a legal requirement to obtain a permit to enter Hermannsburg. However, the community at Hermannsburg has had an informal arrangement that allowed members of the public to visit the community store, art centre and heritage precinct without needing a permit. Under the current legislation permits are not required to enter and remain on common areas of the community. Common areas is defined by subsection 70F(20) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Upon passage and commencement of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008 it would again be a matter for the community, through traditional owners and Land Councils, to decide on the public access arrangements for Hermannsburg. (2) The Aboriginal Land Act (Northern Territory) has a mechanism under section 11 that provides for Aboriginal land, including communities such as Hermannsburg, to be declared an open area or a road to be declared open. The mechanism allows for the Administrator of the Northern Territory, on the request of a Land Council, to declare a town open: 11. Open areas (1) The Administrator may, on the recommendation of a Land Council, declare by notice in the Gazette, an area of Aboriginal land or a road to be an open area or open road, as the case may be. (2) Where a declaration is made under subsection (1), a person may enter and remain on the area of Aboriginal land, or use the road, described in the notice without obtaining a permit. In addition, subsection 5(8) of the Aboriginal Land Act (Northern Territory) allows for the temporary waiving of permit requirements: 5. Issue of Permits (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4, the Aboriginal Land Council for the area in which an area of Aboriginal land is situated or the traditional Aboriginal owners of an area of Aboriginal land may, by notice published in a newspaper or broadcast over a radio station, waive the requirement for a permit to enter the Aboriginal land or use a road bordered by that Aboriginal land specified by the Land Council or the traditional Aboriginal owners in the notice for the period or periods specified in that notice and the requirements of section 4 shall not apply over that area, or in respect of that road, for that period or those periods. Australian Defence Force: Diabetes (Question No. 392) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in writing, on 12 November 2008: In 2006 and 2007, how many members of the Australian Defence Force were diagnosed with: (a) type 1 diabetes; and (b) type 2 diabetes. Health Data Systems within Joint Health Command is unable to capture data for 2006 but is able to provide data for 2007. (a) 2007: 10. (b) 2007: 22.",186,Adjournment
