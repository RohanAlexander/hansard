Let us look at the way the tax has been The thing that is probably most disturbing structured. The Government has tried to say to most Australians is that they clearly that one can have a 30 per cent tax rate, in remember that this Prime Minister in the terms of one of the essential elements of our position of Treasurer strongly advocated a package, but that 30 per cent tax rate only broad-based goods and services tax as an applies over a fairly narrow range. The essential part of tax reform. In fact, part of Government does not lower the bottom tax the Government's argument in the last few rate from 20 per cent at all; we lower it to 16 days in this Parliament has been that we. do per cent. The Government has 30 per cent not need a GST in order to reform tax. I thmk from $20,700 to $40,000; we have 30 per it is important that we go back and have a cent from $20,700 to $50,000.

I think it is also imporThat is another clear-cut statement that it is tant to recall some of the other arguments that essential to have a package approach which the then Treasurer used in defence of that includes the goods and services tax. Similarly, position which go to the very heart of what he said: has been the basic character of his performance in recent days. He said, for example, Some of the switch in the burden of tax from incomes to consumption is desirable. Why? So that in June of 1985: crippling marginal rates can be brought down. I think there is increasing recognition of the need for a substantial package of reforms as the only The only way we will get lasting reform in way of providing lasting solutions to the serious terms of the reduction of those crippling deficiencies in the tax system. All of us, especially marginal tax rates is a package that includes those in positions of influence have, I believe, an the goods and services tax. There has been important duty to ensure that the debate on taxation quite a lot of focus on tax avoidance in recent remains on a higher plane. We must all recognise days. The Prime Minister made this statement that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice, and we should realise on that subject in June 1985: that some people will be trying to do just this. It Without a consumption tax, the fiscal dividend would be all too easy to let the discussion collapse from avoiders and evaders is zero. to the lowest common denominator.

To see the extent of the pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve hypocrisy of this man, it is very important to such long overdue change. look at some of the arguments he used in defence of that position. For example, in June That was a very hard hitting statement made of 1985 he said: on that occasion by the then Treasurer.

They sought legal entered into between the Commissioner of advice. That legal advice said, 'You will win Taxation and the pool builders were legal and if you take this to the High Court.

So they made an agreement with moral obligation to uphold that agreement. the Commissioner of Taxation-it was a valid The Treasurer has a moral obligation to agreement-which, in effect, said, 'We will uphold that agreement. not collect any more tax from our clients All that was required was for this Bill to be because we can't compete if we do, but we split into two pieces and for the sensible will take part of our earnings and send it to amendments that had gone through in the you in escrow and you give it back when the Senate to be accepted in order to make viable High Court makes its judgment'.
