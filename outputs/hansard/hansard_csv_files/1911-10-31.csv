Speaker, If Your Attention Has Been Drawn To Certain Statements In Last Night's Herald Regarding The Cost Of Refreshments Served' To Honourable Members ? Is The Information Correct, And, I F So, Is It A Fair Average State' Ment, And Was It Given With Your Consent? Been Drawn To The Newspaper Article Re","ferred to. The matter is one coming, not under my control,.but under the control of the President, as Chairman of the HouseCommittee. On my mentioning the subject to him he was good enough to instruct the secretary of the Committee to supply me with a statement, from which I learn that the total expenditure during the month of November last year on wines, beers, spirits, &c, was £ 6 y 5s. 6d., and the daily expenditure for twenty-seven days, £ 2 os. xod. The expenditure per head, distributing it among those who, according to the newspaper article, have access to the refreshment rooms, namely, 112 members of Parliament, id Hansard officials, ioofficers, and zo journalists, would be 3fd., or, distributing it amongst members solely, Sid. It should be pointed out, however, that in addition to those named in the article as consuming liquor, there is the large number of visitors who frequent the House, and from time to time are entertained by honourable members. actual expenditure by honourable members on alcoholic liquors in the month specified', did not exceed, on the average,' i j d . per' man per day, and if the average were taken for a period of a year, it would not be more than a small fraction of a penny. The newspaper article would make it appear to the average reader that the refreshmentsconsumed on the premises are not paid, for by honourable members, but members and others pay for all that they get. you any objection, sir, to having a report prepared, and laid on the table, showing the accounts for the past twelve months, and ign.

In view of the fact that he has now told the House that he cannot intervene, would he mind stating why neither Government can do anything, and how the matter stands exactly ? already stated in reply to the honourable member for Richmond. An industrial dispute now exists between persons employed in handling cargo in ships in New South Wales; and, until the same dispute extends to some other State, the Federal Arbitration Court is not clothed with sufficient authority to exercise its compulsory jurisdiction. It has exercised its power under section I6A, which was introduced into the Act last session, by calling the parties together; but it has no power to compel them to settle the dispute. Yesterday, under its powerswhich are doubtful-it called persons from other States in order to prevent an industrial dispute. That action was also taken under section I6A.

Officially, I know nothing about the President's name. I am not ignoring the dispute; but I do not see how it concerns the House to know the President's name. I have already stated that there is a dispute, which is in direct breach of an agreement entered into. What more can I say? is filed at any time, has the Federal Government power to intervene in the case of that agreement being violated? cannot under its statutory limitations take power to intervene except in an "" industrial dispute."" To the extent that a breach of an industrial agreement involves the creation of an "" industrial dispute,"" it has jurisdiction; otherwise, not. ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he is aware that in previous elections returning officers and poll clerks related to each other have been appointed to the one polling booth?

I was not aware of the existence of any such relationship, but we shall endeavour, if possible, to see that relatives are not appointed to act in respect of the same polling booths. the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is correct, as reported in the newspapers, that the Divisional Electoral Officer-the Surveyor-General-and the Registrar-General of Western Australia have been appointed as Commissioners to redistribute that State into Federal electorates, and, if so, what time is likely to elapse before they make their recommendation. missioners have been selected, and their formal appointment now awaits Executive action.

Whether, viewing the magnitude of the number and amount of the sums standing to the credit of the Loan and Trust Fund, he does not think that the time has arrived when Estimates and Appropriations should be annually submitted for the approval of Parliament, providing in detail for the amounts to be drawn from these funds during the financial year? 3. Whether this, is not the procedure adopted in the States for many years? orable members questions are as follow:1. Yes. The amount of £1,829,524 was charged to Special Appropriations during 1910-31 and credited to Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund and to Naval Defence Fund in equal proportions. The whole amounts have already been appropriated by Acts Nos. 4 and 18 of rgro, and there is no necessity to resubmit them to Parliament. 2. There is no Commonwealth Loan Fund. asked the Minister of External Invalid and Old-age Pensions Account and the Naval Construction Account there is no necessity for an annual appropriation, as Parliament has already voted the amounts. As regards the ordinary Trust Fund Trading Accounts, such as the Defence Clothing Material Fund, I do not see any advantage in submitting annual appropriations to Parliament. 3. With regard to Trust Funds, it is not the practice of the States to have annual appropriations. The only exception which I am aware of is in Western Australia, where money received from the sale of Government property is placed to a trust fund and annually appropriated.

Otherwise, I can assure the Prime Minister that there will not be, with our concurrence, a moment of unnecessary delay with regard to this very important measure. I had the misfortune, owing to a visit of the Governor General to Ballarat, to be absent on Friday last when the discussion on this clause proceeded, but, so far as can be gathered from the newspaper, there was certainly no prolongation of the discussion on this side. in which the Act has been rolled over by the High Court, we ought to take a little to dissociate ourselves.

100,Mr Deakin,"It is sufficient for usin connection with this, or, in fact, any other measure ; but it is encumbent upon us, in so serious a matter, to make it clear that not only do we criticise the principles of the Bill, but call attention to quite a number of very serious doubts as to the legitimacy of these proposals as they are now framed. not quite gather from the Prime Minister whether the urgency to which he referred is made all the more extreme in view of the industrial difficulty which is taking place with regard to Inter-State cargoes in Sydney-whethe r an amendment of the Act is necessary in that connection. General says that this industrial ciifficulty has nothing to do with the Commonwealth ? former member of the Arbitration Court in Sydney, who is naturally an authority, says that this measure if passed will have some bearing on that dispute? gather the purport of the Attorney-General's replies to-day. I can assure the honourable member for East Sydney, who is laughing at the honourable member for South Sydney, that this is a matter with which the latter is qualified to deal, as he has sat on the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. able member to deal with the clause before the Committee. I am dealing, sir, is a special appeal by the Prime Minister to the Committee as a whole. whether the honourable member for South Sydney has been in or out of an Arbitration Court has nothing to do with the clause. were going to make a remark of that character, and I would point out that my only reason for saying what I did in regard to the honourable member for South Sydney was that, in my opinion, a very severe attack had been made upon him in the laugh of the honourable member for East Sydney. However. I shall pass that over. Nothing that the Prime Minister has said alters for one moment, it seems to me, our responsibility to carefully examine this measure. I have not been speaking upon it up to the present time, so that it cannot be charged against me that I have been endeavouring to obstruct its passage; but I do say, in the most unqualified way, that the Opposition will neglect its duty if , because the Prime Minister has made a general statement of that character, which might lead us to believe that it had some application to the solution of the trouble in Sydney, it does not examine the measure with proper care. Unless that insinuation, was intended by the right honourable member, I fail to see why he should have risen, to speak as he did. As far as I can see, the position-as regards urgency for the Bill is exactly the same to-day as it was on Friday. I think it was very unfair, indeed, very disingenuous, on the part of the right honourable member to make the statement which he did, especially in view of the disclaimer of the Attorney-General as to the applicability of the measure to the industrial dispute proceeding in Sydney. I assume that the honourable and learned member, being president of the union in trouble in Sydney, probably knows a good deal about the matter. It may be possible, of course, that he, as president, is slightly biased in the direction of believing that as Attorney-General he had no responsibility for quelling the actions of the union. the Sydney branch, but of the Federated branches. the whole does not comprise a part! I think that I shall not again accept my honourable friend as a person with a judicial mind, or qualifications, if he can hedge on a statement in the way which he has just attempted. I do not propose to furtherdiscuss the question at the present moment. I deeply regret the Prime Minister should have endeavoured to mislead the Opposition into believing that this measure had some applicability to the disturbance in the industry over which the Attorney-General presides. Minister has said is inconsistent with the facts in any way. ister said is not inconsistent with the facts, certainly what the Attorney-General said at question time must be inconsistent with them.

Honourable members on this side will earnestly criticise the measure without wasting time. far as I am able to follow the argument of the Attorney-General he considers that it is possible for him to transform the present Act while remaining within -the scope permitted by the Constitution. If that be so, I should like to be informed in what way he can enlarge the jurisdiction so as to justify the procedure proposed in regard to craft industries. The Attorney-General will admit that the governing words in the Constitution are ""conciliation"" and ""arbitration,"" and he will recollect that arbitration has been defined by the High Court. He agrees that the principal Act can be put into operation only by judicial proceedings, yet to begin with he brushes aside the hitherto accepted definition of ""industry."" is the accepted definitionI say to the contrary. man has said that there is some doubt as to its meaning, and he can quote judicial authority for that. until the High Court found it. doubt whether that definition in the Act goes to the full extent which is authorized by the Constitution-that was the honourable gentleman's point. gentleman contend that we can ignore the definition of "" industry "" ? note is "" industrial dispute "" extending beyond the boundaries of a State; we can only have control over such, no matter what we do. member say that an industrial dispute can exist in which no "" industry"" is concerned, using the word in the stricter application ? dispute can take place in connection with the relationship between employer and employee as such-that must be an industrial matter. member say that it will be possible, under the proposal made for craft organization, for employers to be effectively and properly represented at the Court, and that there is machinery to that end? brought by any craft, necessitate a separate subdivision, so to speak, of employers associated ? than a rigid insistence on organization on the basis of "" industries"" does to the workmen. ber admits that ""industries-"" at present contain many crafts? thing of the sort, but, as a matter of fact, it is so. man admits the fact, but denies that he admitted the fact. is saying that I said a lot of things.

The point is that we have "" organizations "" established under the guidance of judicial decisions on their basis as "" industries,"" by which employers and employed have been enabled to settle their disputes. Now many of the decisions cover large industries which might hereafter be subdivided into quite a number of crafts. Does the honourable member contend that, within the limits of the Constitution, it will be possible to maintain that scheme of organization under judicial decisions, and yet introduce under neath, above, or side by side with it a different form of organization in which the employers and employed are differently grouped, and in which, in many cases, it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to arraign the different employers associated with the crafts? it is proposed to avail ourselves of the organizations which are existing, and which have existed from the beginning of trade unionism. zations which may be formed on the same lines ?",22,Commonwealth Bank Bill

174,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorthat, in attempting to deal with this one industry, the Court has had to make awards dealing with different crafts. I am able to speak with knowledge in this matter since I have appeared for the masters and officers, for the engineers and for the wharf labourers, two cases being heard by the -one Judge, and one in the local Court. In each case the award was made without reference to the circumstances of the other persons engaged in the industry. If you say that all these persons are to join on the basis of one industry and not by way of -crafts, what are you going to do? Are you going to make water-tight compartments, so to speak, inside the industry? If you are, you will not gain anything at all, because it will lead to a multiplicity -of organizations. The organization will have to come before the Court just as if it were on a craft basis. The only argument put forward by my honourable friend, in support of that course is that, by following it an award would be given to cover the industry, the employers and the employee's having something in common. As a matter of fact, they must have something in common; otherwise this Statute wouid not apply. I want here to trace the whole matter very briefly from its genesis. An"" industrial dispute "" is the basis of our power; and whatever else an industrial dispute is, it must be something in regard to an industrial matter between persons who stand in the relationship of employer and employed. So far we are right. That being the case we have to consider, from a constitutional stand-point, not what "" industry "" means, but rather what "" industrial dispute "" means. It does not matter whether "" industry"" has a narrower or a wider meaning than ""industrial dispute;"" in neither case can we extend our power. ""Industrial dispute"" is the bedrock; and to that key we set our composition. If we go beyond that, it does not matter how we attempt to deceive ourselves, we are no ""forrader."" An ""industrial dispute""that is to say, a dispute about an industrial matter between an employer and employee"" -^-can obviously be created, whether the -employee' is grouped with his fellowemployes upon the basis of an industry, or the basis of a craft. We have seen quite lately-indeed , we may see every day -dispute s threatening, or taking place upon the basis of a craft. The recent agricultural implement-makers' dispute related to an industry. All the crafts were bound together; blacksmiths, engineers, turners andfinisherswere all in one. There the industry was co-terminous, as it were, with the persons employed therein. But if the Amalgamated Engineers had a dispute a hundred industries would be immediately involved, since, in this age of machine-production, the industry which does not depend upon steam, is very rarely found, and is not very important. A dispute amongst them goes to the very root of the whole industrial system in our midst. One clearly sees, therefore, that an industrial dispute may arise in a matter which does not come within the definition of "" industry "" as it now stands in the Act. An industrial dispute between Jones and his employer does not concern the community, because Jones can go away, and Smith can come in his place. But when there are 5,000 or 6,000 Joneses, or other persons, involved, the community is affected. In this connection we have to remember that the statute we are amending is not one to benefit an employer or employ£, except as a means to preserving industrial peace. It is an Act to promote the public welfare. A dispute can arise between an organization or union of craftsmen and employers, and we must provide for that basis of organization. It is useless to say to the Amalgamated Engineers, "" You go and organize on some other basis -o n a basis different from that which you have followed for the last fifty or eighty years."" They would not do so. There are the honourable traditions of their organization to consider; and neither they nor the engine-drivers, nor the trolleydrivers and draymen would consent to organize on another basis. We have, therefore, to take advantage of the existing organization. To what extent is an employer inconvenienced or treated unjustly? If he has a dispute with his employees, what does it matter to him whether it is settled upon a craft basis or on the basis of his industry ? If there are many different crafts included in his industry, then there must be as many inquiries as there are crafts, and he is not called before the Court any more than he would be if the matter were on an industrial basis. I speak now from experience, and I take as an illustration the shipping industry, with which I am fairly familiar. The same men who are holding up their end to-day in the Court against the seamen have to meet the wharf labourers, the engineers, and the masters and officers. They settle the dispute so far as one class is concerned, and then they have to face another. That cannot be avoided. The employer has to deal separately with each different kind of craftsmen, otherwise there cannot be a proper inquiry by the Court as to what is a fit and proper award for the employees' services. What we are trying to do, therefore, is simply to take advantage of existing organizations in order lo facilitate the business of the Court, and to right a wrong that now exists. There is at present no remedy for 20,000 men in this country who desire to seek a peaceful method of redressing their grievances. I would refer the Leader of the Opposition, by the way, to a number of cases reported in the New South VVales industrial records, the awards in which do not comprise the whole of the persons employed in the industries. the Electrical Trade Union versus the Railway Commissioners, as well as others. T wish only to say that we intend, under this Bill, to enable organizations to do under the Commonwealth Act what they have always been able to do under the State Act, and what it was thought they had a right to do under our legislation. I come now to the question as to the use of the word "" avocation,"" or "" vocation."" I do not pose as a philologist, and I want to be quite sure that the use of the word "" avocation "" does what we desire. "" Vocation"" is defined in Webster's New International Dictionary asA calling; a summons; a call; sfecif. : a convocation. . . . state, business, or profession. On the other hand, "" avocation "" is defined asA calling away; a diversion; . . . slate of being called away; diversion of attention; that which calls one away from one's regular employment . . . customary employment; vocation; usual pursuits. . . . It is synonymous in one of its senses with ""vocation."" I think the word ""avocation "" is particularly suited to the purpose we have in view. ""Vocation,"" as distinguished from "" avocation,"" means that a man has, so to speak, a call from Heaven. We speak of a clergyman having a vocation-h e has a call for the church-bu t ""avocation"" is a calling away from the spiritual and higher to the baser things of life, and it is because of that that "" avocation"" is particularly applicable to mundane pursuits. I prefer it ; and as it is synonymous, in no case is there any harm done. I hope that this clause will be accepted by the Committee without a protracted discussion. rejoinder to the Attorney-General must be put very briefly. Referring to certain highly-organized industries in which there are important subdivisions of employment, the honourable and learned member says very naturally that the same employers are brought before the Court to answer each of the applications of those whom they employ. That is true. I desire him, however, to realize that his argument cuts both ways. l t is just as much in favour of our proposal to maintain the present industrial procedure as it is in favour of the new craft procedure. Then again, it seems to me that while the Attorney-General's argument is applicable to particular industries, such as shearing, shipping, and some others, it is not appropriate to a number in which we must deal directly with the industry as a whole, if justice is to be done, in regard to operations nominally the same, the occupation really differing in its methods, its responsibility, and its skill, and perhaps conducted in different portions of this great country. It is sufficient for my argument to remind the Attorney-General that, granting him all that he has contended, he has not shown that the same ends as he desires cannot be attained by the existing industrial means, and within existing conditions, as to any industry,, within the words of the Constitution "" industrial dispute."" I venture to suggest,, therefore, that, although by this addition A calling to a particular he may be facilitating, and even in some cases cheapening, the process of obtaining partial or local awards, yet those additions will probably require, in many cases, to be dearly paid for. Eveni f the procedure be constitutional, and does not imply such a disorganization of the existing system as. may put it out of work, yet on the other hand, as several different proceedings are brought within the shipping industry' against the same persons, who must abide by the awards in regard, say, to the engineers, the officers and men, and the stewards, it is plain that the craft difficulty is already being met, and settled, in large industries of that kind. No reason has been shown for making this alteration in our Act, unless it be that there may be some, but not necessarily much, extra expense in a few cases, and some difficulty also. There will, however, be far less expense in the long run, far less confusion, and far less delay, by maintaining the system based upon industries, instead of introducing the system based upon crafts. It appears to",25,Commonwealth Bank Bill

177,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat) [4.27],"M yme that, when the remarks of the Attorney-General are read, they are just as much in support of the view which I have again submitted as constitutional and practicable, as they support his own view. The Attorney-General again spoke of there being no remedy for 20,000 men. There is a remedy. It is not necessary for the engineers of engine-drivers to abandon their unions because they operate through different industrial organizations in connection with different trades. There is nothing to prevent each of them putting forward their requests for precisely the same terms wherever the conditions and the work are of the same character, or for varying them if there is anything exceptional in a due degree. member say that two engine-drivers out of a hundred employees in an industry could adequately present their case before the Court? of a number of other men of the same grade, could be put forward in connection with awards already been made in the greater industries. In view of the kind of work they do, and the circumstances in which they are engaged, their claims must be practically the same as those of their fellows in other industries who have already obtained awards. Their claim is simplified immensely, and the ""dispute"" diminished at once. claim for any one who is not in its ranks. long as they are in an organization. They may contend that the terms which have been obtained, either by another union or another organization in which there are engine-drivers already fix the rates for their similar class of work. Why should not the same conditions be required? The employers would be practically out of court at once if they opposed such a claim. constitutional or not, will practically The case would be practically settled before it went into Court. All that would be necessary would be to have the old award in this relation amended and put on record and registered. How could the employers resist? Take the case of men driving engines in the mines at Bendigo, in the mines of the West, or in the coal mines of Newcastle. difference in the conditions, such as the extra cost of living in the West, would be taken into account. But here is your basis already prepared: When once you have engine-drivers paid a certain rate for working eight hours, you can derive your other amended wages and conditions deduced from it in the easiest possible way. When once you establish your bases of arbitration bringing these crafts and others into line with their branches in the great existing industries, so far as payment is concerned, the road by which they arrive need not affect their unions, or their organizations, for trade purposes. All that is necessary is to relate their new terms to those of industrial organizations already under the Act. Once fix certain work with certain hours for ceitain pay, and that, with minoradditions meeting the difficulties of particular localities and circumstances could be applied all over Australia. would have to be under two or more awards. award, other subordinate bodies would come in and get their awards, with whatever modifications were necessary. With this system once thoroughly established, amendments made necessary from time to time by changes of general or special circumstances will not be frequent. I doubt whether, even if its constitutionality be established, this short cut which the Attorney-General is advocating is, after all, shorter than the main road. The Government are raising, not merely legal, but administrative difficulties. It is certain that they are raising grave constitutional issues for no real gain. On the contrary, it is quite possible that results just as good, and probably better, could be obtained more speedily and more cheaply from the existing method without running any constitutional risks whatever. [4.35] -My point all along has been that the proposal to bring all these crafts under the control of Federal law, whether it be break down of its own weight. I do not think it will at all achieve the results at which the Attorney-General is aiming. It means, to begin with, that if decisions are to be given upon the basis of handicraft, as well as upon the basis of industry-and the Attorney-General has told us that he aims at making both of them relate themAny substantial selves to this Court, either as alternatives or both together, as the case may most conveniently be-thes e decisions must necessarily be complicated and inefficient, or, on the other hand, you must have the",27,Commonwealth Bank Bill

The most highly and efficiently-organized craft of them all is only 50 per cent, organized, according to the speech of its secretary in this Chamber. getting the benefit of the award. is what the honourable member said. He wanted this Bill to compel the other 50 per cent, to organize. I should not so much object to that if 1 could afterwards see a working award, but for the life of me I cannot. The Attorney-General himself admits that the principle of differentiation must be applied to these awards, and that that differentiation must be along geographical and climatic lines. It seems to me that in saying so much he admits the full force of the contention that the States would control these matters better than the. Federation can ever do. dous a task that they cannot do it even in a State. Did not the honourable member hear Judge Heydon's statement that his Court was breaking down-that the work was too much for him to do even in his own State, to say nothing of the whole of Australia? The statement made by the honourable member for Cook tbe other night disposes of the whole of the Attorney-General's contentions. says he wants to do in the Federation exactly what is being done in the States. Here is the effect in the States, according to the Judge himself, in the Railways caseI must seek out some simpler road with regard to Boards that has been followed hitherto. I was in great hopes that the measure submitted by Mr Beeby to the House would have resulted in relieving me of this, but the mass of Boards, the overlapping, the dovetailing, the variety of interests that are put before me when applications are made-the thing is becoming overwhelming altogether. Altogether overwhelming in a State! Yet that is the system which the Attorney-General wants to make Federal. If it is overfurther the principle of differentiation and whelming as applied to a State, must it grouping. But there is no provision for not be more completely overwhelming, if machinery under this Bill. There is not that is possible, when applied over the whole of the Commonwealth ? argument was that tbe States could do it better. Apparently they cannot do it at all. cannot do it, is the Federation likely to do it better? difficult. don says his Court is overwhelmed, how is the honourable member going to compass the work Federally by means of Judge Higgins? those remarks of Judge Heydon? made lately in connection with a case in which one of the railway unions applied for a Wages Board. The matter was quoted by the honourable member for Cook in his very clever speech the other night, as follows :The presiding Judge, in that case, heard Mr Warton, for the Tramway Union, Mr Black, secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Mr Sullivan, secretary of the Moulders Union, Mr Irons, secretary of the Bricklayers Union, and Mr Millard, secretary of the Labourers Union. They all appeared to object to the constitution of the Board to deal with certain groups of tramway men. The Judge further saidThis very thing is an example. I have two unions, first of all, to deal with, a thing which is really quite outside my proper duties, dealing with the claims of different unions in the same industry. Then a number of different industries appear, and tbere are a number of existing awards, some have expired, some have not; some Boards have expired and their awards are in existence; some Boards have expired and their awards have expired also. The thing is The Attorney-General becoming a mass of confusion. I shall have to devise some scheme, which I shall inform the industrial world of, by which the thing shall be simplified; it is getting too troublesome and complicated. That is precisely what the Attorney-General wants to engraft upon the Federal Arbitration Court.

Once you depart from the idea of a Federal dispute as a basis, you enter into a mass of confusion that is bound to occasion extreme difficulty. Confusion has already been caused in a State where the machinery is, I suppose, more perfected than is the case, perhaps, in any other State, and where the grouping principle has been taken as far as Labour representatives could take it. Men who are specialists in these matters, and who have applied their intellects to the solution of the problem for the last ten years, with all their efforts to in which that very thing is being tried. simplify procedure, have simply produced a state of affairs that has led Judge Heydon to say that he is overwhelmed. against the Federal Arbitration Act altogether. means. It is an argument for decentralizing control-for linking up the Federal machinery with the State machinery. But it is not an argument for taking control away from the States and centralizing it under the jurisdiction of one Judge. It is humanly impossible for one man to do the work that he is being asked to take on. Mr Justice Higgins has more than he can do now with eight or nine industries; and what, I should like to know, is he going to do with hundreds and hundreds of groups and organizations and industries? The whole aim, as it seems to me, is, to establish a statutory organizing agency, if T may so put it. The Government are going to compel the organization of more and more of these group industries. In other words, they are encouraging the making of disputes rather than the settlement of them. Only this week a case is reported in the Worker which brings out this point very clearly. One comrade, the secretary of the Rural Workers Union of New South VVales, writes to the secretary of the United Labourers Union of South Australia. I understand that there has been some little friction between them, because one organization has been trenching upon the other's domain.; retary of the Rural Workers Union in New South Wales, approaches the secretary of the United Labourers Union of South Australia.

The clause validates, as far as it can validate, the registration, and its action is retrospective. How far it goes I should not care more precisely to say, but it does go as far as we intend to make it go, if we have the power, so that it will validate the registration of any union whose registration has become invalid simply by reason of the fact that it was a craft organization, and not an industrial one. We want to insert the words "" purporting to be,"" because they seem to include a class of registrations which may have been omitted under the clause as it stands. as I am concerned it is purely a question of phrase. I think that it is an ambiguous and doubtful phrase, and that the Attorney General might easily find one more express and explicit. However, that is for him to consider. that, in principle, the clause is justified in the peculiar circumstances of the engine drivers' case. I do not think that, in many cases, such a clause would be justifiable, because it is really retrospective legislation. To my knowledge there are only one or two cases of this class in Australian legislation, but I think that this particular provision is justifiable, because a large number of industrial agreements depend upon organizations, and it would be a great pity if they were invalidated simply because some employers denied the registration. As regards the actual drafting, I do not think that the insertion of the words ""purporting to be"" is necessary, because, in the first line, it is actually described as a registration, and, in the second line, it is stated that it is not a registration. At the present moment it is assumed to be a registration, although an invalid one. registration was not a registration, and, therefore, the association would not come amendment, but the clause seems to me to be somewhat contradictory. I do not think, however, that it will make any practical difference if the words are inserted. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

I put the view that the clause, as it stands, is quite ineffective for the purposes which we have in view, and that honourable members on both sides should stand together in the endeavour to see that no man is penalized or prejudiced in any way by reason of his accepting the invitation extended to him to become a member of an organization. I put the matter in that broad way because it may be thought that in strengthening section 9 there is an effort being made by a member of this House to unduly penalize employers. We cannot make the section too strong, so long as it is directed to discourage employers or others from penalizing persons desirous of joining an organization ; in other words, from taking advantage of the general provisions of the Act. Section 9, as proposed to be amended, readsNo employer shall dismiss any employee fiom Ii is employment or injure him in his employment or alter his position to hjs prejudice. We should go so far as to say that, for the reasons mentionedNo employer shall dismiss any employee^ from his employment, and no person shall injure such employee or other person in his employment.

I think 1 have pointed out that a person may refuse to give a man employment for the reason that he is a member of an association or organization, or that he wishes to join one, or induce other persons not to give the man employment for the same reasons. We should say that these reasons are not to operate or to be allowed to operate, in the minds of men against persons who wish to join organizations. Section9 as it stands says that no employer shall alter the position of such a man ""to his prejudice."" The injury may be done to the man by his employer, not by altering his position to his prejudice, but by refusing to alter his position, or by altering the position of others over his head. Again, the person who is injured may not be a member of an organization, but he may wish to become a member of an organization or association, and it may be held out to him before he is employed as a threat if he becomes or proposes to be a member of an organization or association, that he shall no longer be qualified for employment. We know, and honourable members who come from Queensland will be able to bear out my statement, that this is done openly in connection with the Australian .Tramways Association. So far as the Queensland branch is concerned, the company lays it down as a condition that no person shall hold himself out as, or do anything to indicate that he is, a member of an association, and no person shall get employment if he proposes to join an association. . It is done also in connection with the Melbourne Tramway Company. They exact undertakings from men before tbey are employed that they do not intend to join the Austrago on passing legislation, and inducing persons to enter organizations for the purpose of settling industrial disputes, and dealing in a more efficient manner with industrial troubles, while private individuals and companies are to deliberately and publicly penalize men for going into the organizations. I should say that honourable members on both sides would be quite willing to strengthen this section. company referred to is soon going to die 1 that company should not be encouraged to flout the laws of this Parliament. I use the words "" holds himself out "" as a member of an association, because, in connection with the Brisbane branch of the Tramways Association, the men are forbidden to wear any emblem or medal which will indicate that they are members of a peacefully disposed organization. bad ! distinctly good if the scope of this law is as honourable members opposite declare it to be. The men to whom I refer had a medal struck and proposed to wear it, but they were forbidden to do so, and the medals were seized as contraband on the persons of the men while at work. therefore, suggest that, in view of this contemptuous treatment of our law, we should lay it down that any man may freely and openly hold himself out-and , indeed, is doing good work in holding himself outas a member of an organization.

I do not say that it is possible, but I have endeavoured to draw the amendment in such a way as to prevent persons, whether employers or not, from injuring persons, whether employees or not, by reason of the latter being members, or intending to become members, or advertising themselves as members, of an organization or association applying to be registered. It is for others to suggest objection, but any there may be will be found to the wording, and not to the spirit, of the amendment, which is eminently fair, in view of our desire to encourage men to join associations. I say this with the f u l l knowledge of the fact, which is frequently overlooked by honourable members opposite, that it is not the employees, as a general rule, who have been in the habit of flouting Commonwealth industrial legislation, but that the persons who have shown themselves, not only hostile, but have received such legislation in a spirit of rebellion, are the employers. the employers refused to carry out? that the employers have actually refused to carry out any award.

262,Mr Brennan,"I can assure the honby that I am prepared to stand, having regard to the records of the cases heard in the Court. However, that is a little outside the proposed amendment, which I commend to the sympathetic consideration of the Attorney-General and the Comm it tee ney-General) [5-27] The amendment seeks to more effectively protect the emiployes than has been found to be the case -under section 9 of the Act. It is perfectly true that certain employers do penalize their employees and prejudice them in their employment. One organization waited on me during the last six or eight months and furnished me with a copy of a notice which was displayed in a prominent place in certain depots announcing in an unmistakable way some of the consequences which would follow any attempt to join any other than a certain organization, which was, and is still, I believe, under the management of the employers. In addition, representations were made to me by certain honourable ynembers disclosing a similar state of affairs in another State. I j i my experience, only one conviction has been obtained under a similar section under the New South Wales Act, and that was in the case of an employer who admitted, in a moment of inexcusable aberration, that he had dismissed an employee because he was a unionist. such an admission from an employer is infinitely harder than getting 6 oz. to the ton from an exhausted reef. We have to consider human nature as it is; and the question is whether we can, by any means at our disposal, effectively compel an employer to make no difference in regard to the man who is a member of an association to which the employer, rightly or wrongly, has some objection. That is one point, and another is that the Constitution effectively delimits our powers. the honourable gentleman's a-.nendment. learned member for Batman, in moving this amendment, has nought rather to exhaust the possibilities of action on the part of the employer than to gather the potentialities of the position in a general clause. what did you do?"" and so on. Is an emI incline to the opinion that the clause, as before the Committee, covers quite as much ground. The effect, whenever one enumerates particular cases, is to omit other paropenly to sack him for the very reason for ticular cases, which did not at the time occur to one's mind. There is another point to which I would draw the honourable member's attention, and it is this. He proposes to provide that no. employer shall exact a promise or undertaking from any employee as a condition of employment not to become a member of an association or organization or prejudice him in his application for employment. I admit that this is a bog or maze, and that we tread with difficulty and amazement in every winding avenue through it. But one thing has been made perfectly clear, and that is that, before the Court can have any jurisdiction at all, there has to be an industrial dispute which must extend beyond the boundaries of one State, and which must have relation to an industrial matter between an employer and an employee""-no t a person who may become an employ^, but a person who is de facto an employee. I am not going to say that that is not subject to modification, but I do say that an application for employment is entirely outside the relationship of employer and employee. In connection with a State Court, the position, of course, would be entirely different, but until a man becomes an employee, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has no jurisdiction. I will not mention any State in particular, but let me say that in a State other than this, there is, at the present time, an organization of employees that is not recognised by the employers, who are continuUsually, of course, exacting ously pursuing tactics in regard to it, calculated to provoke a breach of industrial peace. Some honourable members know very ivell that that is a fact. This-Court is perfectly powerless to do anything at all in relation to such a case unless there is an industrial dispute, or something has occurred to give the Court jurisdiction. Nothing that is in the Statute, or can be put into it, can give the Court jurisdiction in respect of a matter in connection with which it would not have had jurisdiction, if there were an active outburst of industrial hostility. SoI say that, in regard to this matter, we have to keep clearly within our constitutional powers, and we have to remember what human nature is. A man seeks employment, and the employer says, "" Are you a member of the union ?"" The answer is, "" Yes,"" and the employer then says, "" All right j where did you work last; ployer going to be so destitute of imagination and all resource that, having one hundred reasons for sacking a man, he is going which he would have to pay ^ 5 o when he t",34,Carty Salmon Where Then Is Orable Member That I Never Said Anything

But we know that'he is a very resourceful person. This legislation has been'in force now for ten years, and the only conviction under the section has been that of one employer at''St. Mary's, who admitted that he sacked a fellow because .he belonged to the union. And he said, "" Lwill sack all the rest."" The Court and-everybody in it were so astonished at this outburst of unnatural candour that the lowest possible -fine was imposed, and the defendant, was-sent-away almost rejoicing. T am inclined to. think, however, that there is one phrase of the amendment which covers more than may be covered by the clause, as it stands. . The section, if amended, as proposed by clause 5, would provide thatNo employer shall dismiss any employ^ from Iris employment or injure him in his employment or alter his position to his prejudice by reason merely of the' fact that the employee is -an officer or membei of an organization, or of .an association that has applied to be registered HS an organization or is entitled to the. benefit two things which struck me as possible reof .an industrial agreement 01 award. The Bill proposes to amend the existing section by inserting: after the words ""or injure him in his employment,"" the' words ""or alter his position to his prejudice."" That is to say, to fail to promote him, or to disrate him, as the case may be. It is conceivable thaTThat 'does not cover everything, -and the honourable member proposes to provide for that by inserting the words "" of injure, him in any way whatever."" I think that is a drag-net phrase which cover's -everything. that it may destroy the whole clause. We can put that into the Bill, without invalidating the measure. ' I do not' know that the clause would be inoperative, in so far as it was constitutional. Clearly the Court would never say that the Legislature -deliberately intended to go too far The phrase might not, however, cover any more ground than is covered by the clause, as it stands... This is-all-that could happen to an employ^ He might, lose his-job; he -might lose promotion, or benefits; he might not progress as rapidly as he ought, and he might in short, work in the shadow instead of the sun of his employer's approbation. This is what might happen, putting it into words; and I wish' honourable members to consider whether there is anything that is If the employer not covered by this phrase. The employee' may not be dismissed; he may not be injured ;' he may not be prejudiced. If we He would' never give 'us any add these words proposed by the honourable member for Batman,'"" injured in any way whatever,"" I think we have got it I do not see anything further that could be done.. In my opinion, the section as amended by the Bill does cover all those cases in which, taking human nature as it is, there is the remotest possibility of -our being able to effectively protect the employee. For that reason, I ask the honourable member for Batman not to press his amendment.' If , upon consideration, 'he thinks that the words to which I ""have specially ' referred will strengthen the clause, I , personally, shall offer no objection to their insertion. MrW H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [5.40]. -The Attorney General has pointed out : some of the difficulties in connection with the amendment, and I wish to refer to one or two others. I have not had an opportunity to read it, and it is a rather complicated amendment. There are one or sults of its adoption which I should like to bring under the notice of the honourable member for Barman. One of the proposals made is that'no employer shall not merely alter, but refrain from altering, .the position .of an employee"" by reason-.of the fact,-riot merely that he .is a .member^;of an organization or association, h'lrt that:.he seeks to become . a member of .an'organiza : tion' orassociation. I ask.' honourable members to imagine fpr n moment -the'kind of prosecution that would take place under such a provision. John Jones, an ' env ploye, brings .a prosecution against his employer under this -amendment^ and sets out the following offence : -That the employer refrained from . altering-' his position,-.'he being a'person who was'seeking.'to obtain admittanceinto an association -That -is rather a strange thing to make the' matter a criminal offence Jones'comes before the Court and 'is asked, "" What do you 7 complain of ; are you not in tlie same position as before ?'' The answer is, ""Yes, that is justwhat I complain;of.."" The Court then says, ""You are still-employed, and still paid, and that is. what you complain of-why ? Is it because you are a member of an association?"" The answer is, "" No ; because I am thinking of becoming a member of an association. My",35,Carty Salmon Where Then Is Orable Member That I Never Said Anything

267,.',"Mr HUGHES I do not think so.employer has refrained in consequence of that^-though how' he found out what I was thinking about, I cannot say--fro m altering my position."" I am inclined to think that that would be a very difficult matter to prove. But the honourable member for Batman gets him out of that difficulty by throwing the whole of the onus of proof on the defendant. The defendant would, first of all, have to show that there was"" no opportunity of which he could have availed himself to better Jones' posi-' tion; or, if there was, since he did not know that Jones was seeking to become a member of an association, he could not have refrained from altering Jones' position because he was seeking to become a member of an association. Could honourable members imagine anything more ridiculous to put seriously before a Court of Justice and particularly a Court of Criminal Justice, as a means of carrying fhis legislation into effect? I appeal to the honourable member for Batman to reconsider this proposal, because he appealed to honourable members on .this side to join with him in .doing -what I suppose is the desire of every one, and that is to prevent the penalization of men because rhey belong to a union.. not.. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am prepared to assist the honourable member in any reasonable attempts with that object, in the full and cordial expectation that he will assist lis in passing equally drastic proviclause, and I agree with the honourable sions against boycotting on the part of employees. But our laws should be such as can be carried' out. As the Attorney-General has shown, the present provisions have not been effectual, and, I think, cannot be made effectual. You cannot make a criminal offence depend on something in the mind of an employer or employee, no matter what language ""you employ. To attempt to give effect to such provisions would bring about prosecutions such as have never yet been heard of or dreamt of in any Court-of Criminal Jurisdiction. It is easy to say that the onus of proof should be on the defendant. thrown, on tlie defendant in connection witli certain cases, especially in regard to Customs offences. But when a man imports goods, he knows all about them, having the invoices and other papers, and it is reasonable that, the Crown having made out a prima facie case on some'points, the dufv should be thrown on the defendant of making the whole position clear. I do riot think' that the honourable member has fully considered the effect of his amendment. [5.48] I should like to see the workmen effectively protected in fhis regard, but how it is to be done I do not know. I do not know any form of words which would prevent an employer from dismissing an employ^. That could be done even' if the honourable member's amendment were carried. I agree with the last speaker that if you put too much into the clause you are likely to defeat the object in view. I know a man who was promoted to a position carrying a higher salary who did not rest until he got back to his old job. be promoted to get rid of them.' which I refer the promotion was a genuine one. H.ad the man remained in ihe higher position, he would have become unfit for work, because the nervous strain was too great. It could be said that that man was injured by his promotion, and if he had been in a union it could have been urged that his position had been altered to his prejudice. Elementary justice requires that both sides shall be treated alike, and. protected as far as possible, but the clause as it stands is as effective as we are likely to make it.. I cannot pretend to be able to discuss the legal aspect of the amendment or of the member for Flinders that it is possible to push the proposal of the honourable member for Batman to a ridiculous length. Undoubtedly, however, employers attempt to interfere with and penalize employees who are members of organizations, ind the clause as it stands does not prevent that. Men in the employment of the .Brisbane Tramways Company are to-day being offered inducements, and threatened .with loss of position and employment, to get them to leave the organization to which they belong. The onus of proof has been threaten them here. They sack them every dav in the week. have had to resign from the Tramway Employes Union in Brisbane because they were told in unmistakable language that unless they did so they would lose their employment.

If we are going to say that men shall not cease work because their employer is a member of the Employers Federation,we should not allow employees who are members of organizations to be interfered with by their employers. One effect of this legislation will be to drive both employers and .employee's into federation.and I can conceive nothing better calculated to bring about industrial peace than the existence of strong toria, but we did not test it, because tbe organizations which can discuss with each other, or before an impartial tribunal, the terms and conditions under which work should be performed. If the employees require preference, the employers should be given preference, too. But there is nothing in the clause to place an employer under any. disability because he has attempted to induce his men to leave their organization. Inducements are being offered to men to leave an organization and to join another which is under the wing of their employers. Nothing is more likely to lead to industrial trouble, and I hope that the result of such conduct will be industrial trouble. If men are robbed, threatened, or intimidated to induce them to sever their connection with an organization, trouble will continually occur, and there can be no hope of industrial peace. Some provision should be inserted, penalizing the employers who endeavour to draw men away from their organizations, or to induce them to join organizations financed, supported and encouraged by the employers. shall not press the amendment. The honourable member for Flinders has pointed to the legal labyrinths into which we may be led by the proposed amendment, but that does not get over the fact that there are many obvious cases, apart from the exceptional ones to which he referred, which would be met by the proposed amendment. ,The Attorney-General referred to the words "" by reason merely,"" arid put the view that a man is absolved who dismisses an employee for the reasons stated in the amendment together with others. If an employer has merely to show that, although membership of a union was one reason for the dismissal of an employd, there were others, or one other, to be free from liability to a penalty, the provision is waste paper, but I direct the attention of the honourable genpeting and conflicting interests.

It has always seemed to me that the best we can do in this regard is to declare as closely as possible what the majority of the members of this Parliament consider to be fair treatment as between employer and employed. We want to see some substantial justice done to any one who is injured, and I think it is the duty of the National Parliament to say what, in its opinion, would be the good conduct of a good citizen on either side. Having regard to our limited power, I do not think we can do any more. proved to be insufficient. particularly in mind the statement made by the honourable member for Brisbane that certain employers may desire to draw their employees away from the ordinary trade unions into unions or organizations formed by themselves. They might partially succeed in doing that, but I do not believe tliat any thinking man considers that such an effort could ultimately be successful, Organized society in these days is such that there are two conflicting interests, and those two conflicting interests will either come together in organized bodies, and deliberate with an impartial Judge between them, who will settle their differences Mr W.

302,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"AttorAct in what way this or that section has failed to be effective. We thus find out its weaknesses just as we ascertain the shortcomings of an engine from the man who drives it. That is what we have done in this particular case. honourable members are aware, was inserted in' the principal Act last year, and it has proved, without exception, the most valuable in the whole scheme of the Act. But the question is : "" How far does it go ? "" During the recent sugar dispute, the question arose whether the Court could, Under section I6A, summon before it those persons who were having a dispute. There was at the time no dispute within the meaning of the Federal Act. It was a State dispute. It could not be said tliat there was a probability of it extending, but there was a likelihood of the consequences of the dispute being taken up by other industries. In that case the dispute, whatever it became, would extend, and, as a fact, it did extend. Thus, the wharf labourers declined to handle the sugar. When it was handled by persons other than members of the Wharf Labourers Union, it came down to southern ports, and then the trouble became an Inter-State dispute. Under section I6A whom could tbe fudge summon, and at what stage? section I6A. ber knows that his answer would convey to the lay mind something entirely foreign to the real meaning of the section. Could the Judge, for instance, summon the honourable member for Flinders? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. did. I contend that he could do nothing of. the sort. As a sensible man, I am sure he would not do it if he could. Does ""any person"" mean any person in the country ? Mr W. H . IRVINE I should have -thought so. much like to hear the honourable member argue against that interpretation. Every word has to be interpreted according to tlie subject. ""Any person"" cannot mean any person irrespective of his position, callI take the words in section I6A of theing, or vocation. It must mean any person who has some relation to the industrial dispute. The Court is not to be made a Court for the settlement of all cases, nor is every citizen to be dragged by it from one end of Australia to the other' Mr W. H . IRVINE -In the original section, the power is to be exercised for preventing as well as settling an industrial' dispute Section 16 (A), as of the Court is tied up in the settlement, of industrial disputes. We cannot say, "" Notwithstanding that we cannot deal' with the question, we will haul you in,""' meaning, by ""you,"" ""any person."" Limy opinion, any person"" in the section,T means any person whose connection with the dispute is not so remote as to put him> in the position of the ordinary public. The amendment is to enable us to bring in persons whose interests are such as it indicates. The most dangerous feature of industrial trouble is what is known as thesympathetic strike. The ordinary strike to: settle a grievance can be dealt with; but: one cannot deal with a sympathetic strike, because the people in it have no dispute 1 with their employers in the ordinary sense of the word. The question is, "" Can they be hauled before the Court?"" We want, to make it perfectly clear that they can be. I hope the honourable member will not: think the wording of the clause redundant. Evidence has shown pretty clearly lately that, owing to the President's interpretation of the section, he was, in a manner,, handicapped. Since this is, as it were, a voluntary jurisdiction, and since there can be no better or more expeditious way of settling anything than by bringing theparties face to face, without lawyers or outsiders of any sort, and letting themargue it out, we ought to give them every encouragement to come together, and' should clothe this jurisdiction with every power which the Constitution allows. Attorney-Genera.l has not gathered the point I submitted. I suggested the omission of the following wordsnot only persons engaged in or connected with an industrial dispute, but also any person engaged in or connected with any dispute relating ' to industrial matters (whether extending beyond the limits of a State or not), and related in any way to an industrial dispute; and also includesWhat is left includes all that the Attorney General is aiming at.

308,Mr Deakin (Ballarat) [6.21],"Thetomey-General, however, takes the view that "" any person "" in that section means some person who is either a party to the dispute or connected with the dispute. If there is any ambiguity about the original section, the amendment, of course, removes it, so that really the difference between ourparty to the dispute to pay to any other selves and the Attorney-General is only a matter of language, and does not amount to much as a matter of substance. I think the original section meant just as much as the amendment does. The Attorney-General thinks not. If he is right then, of course, this provision, or something like it, is necessary.

I am not sure whether that is qualified by this amendment. counsel's costs for the future? I merely draw attention to this as a matter of drafting, because it may be modified by the section to which I refer. The Attorney General might consider whether there should not be some limitation upon the costs. This might be prescribed by regulation, for instance. In some applications of a minor character the costs ought to be fairly small. What is generally done at present in civil proceedings is to have a scale fixed by regulation, and as such, of course, it is subject to review by Parliament. With a view to having some limitation upon the amount that may be recovered, I suggest to the Attorney-General that the words ""as may be prescribed"" should be inserted after the word ""costs.""

The honourable member for Angas contended that it was essential for the sake of consistency to insert certain words in proposed new section 17(A).

Under section 55 of the original Act two employers may form an organization for the purpose of registration. This clause has to 'do with persons of whom cognisance will be taken by the Court. The memorandum which has been circulated by the Government explains that the intention is that the Court shall have cognisance of all industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization, of industrial disputes which are certified to the Court by the Reassociation, but that there is no provision gistrar as proper to be dealt with in the public interest, and of industrial disputes with which any State industrial authority, or the Governor in Council of a State, requests the Court to deal. I wish to extend the same right to an individual employer as individual employees can get through their organizations. For instance, take the case of a. firm like J. C. Hutton and Company, which carries on the business of bacon-curing in different States. It an employer who does not belong' to an might be an utter impossibility for a firm like that to belong to an organization of employers, though it employs hundreds of .hands in different States. The employees might decline to submit a case to the decision of the Arbitration Court. The employer, as an individual, would not be able to submit his case. I think that such an employer should have a right to the protection of the Court. It is to give them that right that I move the amendment. ney-General) [7.55] I am not quite clear as to the honourable member's object in. submitting this amendment. As far as I can make out, nothing would be gained by it. A plaint can be submitted to the Court not only by an organization,"" but by an employer as an individual. any association of employers in, or in connection with any industry employing in the aggregate 100 employees may submit a case. There is nothing to stop any employer from talcing advantage of that section. association of employers. member mean to say that there is anything the jurisdiction of the Court. in the Act to prevent one individual employer from registering? Act which authorizes him to register? there is, but what is to stop him ? ' I do not think there is anything. What particular object is the honourable member endeavouring to attain? -What the honourable member for Moreton says is that there is no provision to enable a single employer, who may have a dispute with his employees, to register as an organization, and submit his plaint to the Court. The honourable member points out that section 55 provides for the registration of an to enable one person who employs a large number of individuals to register, and to come under the cognisance of the Court by filing a plaint. The definition of "" industrial dispute,"" which has been struck out, covered any dispute as to an industrial matter arising between an employer and an organization of employees. That contemplated a dispute between employees and one employer. The honourable member wants association to be able to go before the Court with his plaint. What the honourable member is asking the Attorney-General to do is, I take it, to look into the matter, and to give.an individual employer the same right as an association of employers has. It seems fair that it should be given. Under section 19 of the Act, the Court is to have jurisdiction over industrial disputes sent before it by the Registrar, industrial disputes brought by an organization on a plaint, industrial disputes referred to the Court, and then compulsory matters.

It is fair to ask that if one employer who is carrying on an industry in several States fulfils all the conditions, and there is an industrial dispute-the evil with which we want to grapple-h e shall have the right to file a plaint and go before the Court. If the Attorney-General will look at section 19, he will see that the Court has cognisance of industrial disputes which are submitted to the Court by an organization by a plaint. Buti f he will look at the definition of "" organization "" in section 4, he will find that it means an organization registered under the Act. What is such an organization? It is an association of employers, and not one individual employer. Perhaps the Attorney-General will promise to consider the amendment if he cannot see his way to accept it, because, in my opinion, this is a necessary power to take in the measure. ney-General) [8.4] I see now the point of the honourable member for Moreton.

If the honourable member will not press his amendment here, I shall give him an opportunity, if I do not agree with him., to test the feeling of the Committee on section 55, which, in my opinion, is the proper place to put it in. I want to look into the amendment to see that, if made, it will not be superfluous; otherwise, I shall be very glad to agree to it. ' accept the assurance of the Attorney General that he will give us another opportunity of considering this matter, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment. I would ask the honourable and learned gentleman to look at section 19 of the principal Act, and consider whether the amendment will not fit in there, seeing that that section deals with persons whom the Court recognises as having the right to bring a dispute before it.. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. no doubt that a very wide power is taken in proposed new paragraph d of section 19, but I do not feel inclined to object to it It provides that wherever the President has held a conference, he may send the matter on to the Court. I think tliat we have forgotten this fact, that since paragraphs a, b, and c of the section were drafted in 1904, we have extended the definition of ""industrial dispute"" to cover threatened or probable disputes, so that now if there is merely a probability of a dispute and a conference is held by the President, he can send that on for investigation at once, as if it were an ordinary dispute. This is a very wide power to give; but personally, I do not see how one can reasonably object to allow the President to do what a State authority can do. The widening of the definition also affects the earlier sub-sections.

The Registrar may inform himself with great pains and particularity. He may not have the means to inform himself, and yet his certificate is to suffice. It may be ex parte. I presume that the Attorney-General has a special reason for vesting this exceptional power in the Registrar. ney-General) [8.9] -If the honourable and learned gentleman will look at the judgment in the Engine-drivers' case, he will see why this amendment has been proposed. On page 285 of the Argus Law Reports we readThe Registrar's certificate that any dispute is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State is an evidence that an industrial dispute is in existence. Section 21 cf the Act readsA certificate by the Registrar that any dispute relating to industrial matters is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State shall be -prima jacie evidence that the fact is as stated. The Court strictly defined the power of the Registrar in this direction, and by no statement, evidence, or act of the Registrar could a dispute which was not an industrial dispute be made one. The object of this clause is to take a power with which the Registrar can be properly clothed. no doubt that under section 21, as proposed to be amended, the Registrar's position will be a very important one. have to decide on some facts as to whether a dispute exists or not. At present, as a rule, a certificate would only be given In cases where no other evidence at the time was available and the fact was notorious. But surely the same rule would not apply to the extension of the dispute; in other words, that where no evidence was available, a certificate could be given of the existence as well as the extension of the dispute. We must assume that the Registrar will go on some facts which will justify a prima facie impression. If such is the case, considering the extent to which the work of the Court is developing, he will have very important and responsible duties to discharge. might be well to consider what his position is to be in the future. At present he is an officer of the High Court, and simply holds the subordinate office of Industrial Registrar. That has, I think, been his position from the start. When I looked into his position some twelve months ago, it struck me that if the work of the Court had to be increased, we ought to think of appointing this officer straight out as the Industrial Registrar, at a salary corresponding with the great responsibilities and increased duties cast upon him. I have incidentally referred to the matter now because I have observed that on the Estimates a sum of ^600 is allotted for the position. I suppose that the Attorney-General intends to at once appoint an Industrial Registrar, perhaps to attend to these duties only, whose salary and position will approximately correspond with his responsibilities. But even then he will be below the status of similar officers in the States. am glad to emphasize from this side of the House what has been said by the honourable member for Angas with regard to the increased powers, and the vastly increased duties, which will, in the future, fall on the Registrar in respect of, and irrespective of, this Bill. I express the strong hope, following the lead of the honourable member for Angas, that the position will be classified, and the salary made commensurate with the work to be performed. We have the anomaly that in New South Wales the Deputy Industrial Registrar is a public officer, receiving a much larger salary than his principal at the Seat of Government, and I hope ad vantage will be taken of this Bill to have the salary fixed by the Governor General in Council. He will the Estimates for the Registrar. one of ^410, and another of ^600, and, though I am not quite sure what the duplication means, I am afraid that the sum allotted to this officer may prove to be iC4io.

348,Mr Deakin,"And in this form?Under section 31 of the Act, an effort was made to discourage litigation, and reach a -conclusion as speedily as possible, making the decisions of the Court final. That, of -course, has been a vain hope. I do not suppose that any Act has led to more litigation, with more decisions upset. It is clearly in-separable from the Constitution, as it now stands, that there should be this clashing of jurisdiction. We have not the power to make this Court final in the sense that the Parliament of England, the Parliament of ""New South Wales, or the Parliament of ""Victoria would have in respect of such a 'Court. But where we have the power to -create a Court whose award shall be final, we propose to make this amendment so that neither by writ of prohibition nor by mandamus can decisions be quashed or -called in question. There are two possible -errors into which the Court may fall. It may fall into the error of excess of juris-diction, owing to some limitation imposed by the Constitution, in which case -nothing that we can do can help the situation-it is a fatal error. Then the Court .may fall into the error of excess of statutory power, where we have not given some power we could have given if we had thought fit, or did not do all we intended lo do. The Court will, of course, bring to the consideration of questions, in its juriscan-is simply that the intention which he -diction, that judicial care that is the prachas now announced to make the Court absotice of judicial bodies ; and it has to be the final Court to decide whether it has ex-ceeded its jurisdiction, where, and only where, it is in excess of the statutory power which this Legislature could have conferred -on it, but did not-and that, whether we intended to do so, and did not, or whether we did not even intend to do so, provided we had the power to do it. In the State of New South Wales, the Courts have been -clothed with power to make a final decision which cannot be disturbed by any Court; .and we propose to do that here, so that a deand the way in which the whole clause cision cannot be upset on a mere technicality. eternal litigation on mere technical points. The Engine-drivers' case is one in point. If the Court had had the power to make a -decision that could not be upset by any writ of prohibition, its decision would have -stood despite the fact that the Statute did not confer the power on the Court to do this thing. The Court gave its decision, believing it had the power; and, therefore, since, of all the cases that have come before the Court, at least half have been upset, owing to errors created by the shortcomings of the Statute, we propose to cure these errors once for all. This is done in a fashion which will commend itself, I am sure, to every reasonable and sensible person. The Justice of the High Court who is now acting as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is one of those men who would have to decide in any case how far he should go, or howfar he should not go, in any particular. Behind every human system is one man : after all, there comes a point where we must say, "" That is the man to decide."" We ma/ say that we will appeal to a man who sit s with two or three others; but behind every system' is a man. It is merely a question where we shall stop; and we propose to stop as the clause provides, believing that this will discourage litigation, and tend to the speedy settlement of differences. I say, emphatically, that this provision will make the Court extremely careful in what' it does, considering that on its shoulders will rest the final settlement. For the rea: sons I have given, and for others that are obvious, I hope the Committee will accept the clause. point-whic h I think the Attorney-General will .not see, for I feel convinced that he lute master in its own domain always was' the intention, and is the intention still.. Why does the honourable member persist in framing his clause in such a way as to' suggest that the idea is, not only to make the Court master in its own domain, but to make it what it can never be, the judge as to whether it has exceeded its own domain or not? Why will he not express himself in the clause in such terms as to put the meaning beyond dispute?

354,Mr Glynn,"Yes, and it is the rejudgment here, and none of the Judges,to the Court by the Statute is concerned. In all the cases the ground was the same, tbe question asked being, "" Was there an excess of jurisdiction or not?"" At page 21 of the second volume of Commonwealth Law Reports, it will be found that the Chief Justice pointed out that no Act of Parliament can take away from the High Court the right, by prohibition, to decide whether an inferior Federal Court had exceeded its jurisdiction. Whether that jurisdiction was exceeded by going beyond the Act, or did not exist because the Act was not within the constitutional powers of Parliament, was a distinction that was not made in the judgment. The Chief Justice saidBefore dealing with the important question of law, raised in this case I will dispose of the passes upon the field of another, and does preliminary objection taken by Mr Arthur that prohibition does not lie to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. objection is based on two grounds. First, it is said that a prohibition is within the language of section 31 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, which enacts that "".No award of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in .question in any other Court on any account whatsoever."" In Clancy's case (1) This Court had to deal with same point raised upon identical words in the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act of 1901, and we held, in accordthat that power is given by the Constituance with a uniform line of English decisions, that such an enactment does not extend to cases in which a' Court of limited jurisdiction has exceeded its jurisdiction. A Court of limited jurisdiction might exceed its jurisdiction by going beyond the authority vested in it by a competent Parliament, or by attempting to pursue an authority purported to be vested in it by an incompetent Parliament. In each case there might be excess of jurisdiction. Mr the High Court shall have original jurisdiction. Justice Barton and Mr Justice O'Connor expressed the same view in practically similar words. Mr Justice Barton saidI agree that prohibition as distinct from ororable members know that if this, power, dinary appeal lies to this Court in respect of decisions in excess of jurisdiction pronounced by an inferior Federal Court, including the Arbitration Court. Mr Justice Isaacs differed in one respect in regard to the nature of the prohibition. He held that this Parliament could, by appropriate words, divest the High Court of the power to issue a prohibition in a case of that kind, but that it had not in fact done so. The majority of the Court, three Justices, held that the right of prohibition could not be taken away from the High Court with regard to any excess of jurisdiction by the Arbitration Court, or any inferior Federal Court. What were j 1 the reasons ? They were twofold. First, with regard to the power that the High Court has to prohibit any Court from exercising jurisdiction in excess on the ground that the Act under which it is constituted is unconstitutional, a majority of the Court held that that was necessarily inherent in the High Court. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes. Honourable members will see why. In every case where we have a twofold sovereignty divided between Federal and State Parliaments, that is to say, in every Federation, we must have a line of demarcation between the Federal and State authorities. We have two bodies to deal with, and where one tresan act, it is as if it were not done. We The must, in such a case, have some judicial authority to say whether it is the law or not. That is an inherent power. With regard to constitutional questions, there must, therefore, be an inherent right in the High Court, as being vested with the Federal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, to determine that point in the long run. But the Justices went on to decide tion, and not merely by necessary implication, but expressly, in section 75. That section of the Constitution, amongst other things, provides thatIn all matters(v) In which a writ of mandamus or prohibition ' or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth, The right, therefore, to issue a prohibition to an inferior Court is a power vested in the High Court by the Constitution. Honvested in the High Court by the Constitution, is not expressly stated by the Constitution to be subject to the power of Parliament, it is absolutely vested in the High Court, and is not subject to the power of Parliament. that Parliament should have no power at all? Mr W. H . IRVTN.E -Parliamen t has complete and unlimited power within the . range of its own authority. There is nothing to control it. The High Court cannot control it. No one can control Parliament acting within the range of",47,Carty Salmon Where Then Is Orable Member That I Never Said Anything

356,Mr West,"I s it not rather an anomalyits own authority. But where it purports to act outside the range of its own authority, it does not act, and some tribunal has to determine that that is so. For that purpose, it has been held that the Constitution itself gives the High Court the right to issue a prohibition. The other question is whether that right to issue a prohibition which the Constitution gives the High Court applies to the second case referred to, where a question of excess of statutory jurisdiction arises. This point has not been expressly decided. Whilst admitting that the second proposition which the Attorney General puts forward has not yet been the subject of any decision, there are certain reasons why I venture to express a doubt as to his proposition. It is as to whether, assuming the Act to be constitutional, but assuming that the President of the Court has gone beyond the statutory powers, this taking away of the right of prohibition will have any effect. The Attorney-General says that in such a case it will. I am not going to say that it will not, but I shall give some reasons why I think it is very doubtful indeed. In the Boot case, to which I have referred, the Judges pointed out that the Act purported to take away the right of the High Court to issue a prohibition against an order made in excess of jurisdiction by an inferior Court, but the Judges made no distinction between an excess of statutory, and an excess of constitutional jurisdiction. based their decision upon a previous decision of the Court in Clancy's case in New South Wales. When we look at Clancy's case, we find that there was no question there of excess of legislative jurisdiction, because it was under an Act of the Parliament of New South Wales, and that Parliament had no such limits as we have. The Parliament of New South Wales had passed an Arbitration Act, had created an Arbitration Court, and had provided in just the same terms that awards or decrees of that Arbitration Court should not be called in question at all in any Court. bition"" and ""mandamus"" mentioned in the New South Wales Act? What was the date of the Clancy case? Mr W. H . IRVINE -It was decided in 1904. The words of the Act wereA proceeding in the Court shall not be removable to any other Court by certiorari or otherwise, and no award or proceeding of the Court shall be vitiated by reason of any informality or want of form, or be liable to be -challenged, appealed against, quashed, or called in question by any Court whatsoever. The word "" prohibition"" would add nothing to that. The words of the section, as I have quoted it, are absolute, and are absolutely general. Legislature made an amendment by which prohibition, mandamus, and certiorari were inserted. Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not think that that provision has ever come before the Court. Court; but it came before the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not know the case. The words in the Act. and in the New South Wales Act, are wide enough to cover prohibition, injunction, mandamus, or any other like procedure, the phrase "" liable to be quashed "" embracing every means of putting an end to a deoree for which there is not jurisdiction. The question in Clancy's case was not whether those words were sufficiently wide, but whether they could give the effect intended, and take jurisdiction away from the Supreme Court. The question was not whether they did nominally take away jurisdiction, but whether they could actually do so. The High Court held that they could not, because it was not possible to take from that Court the power to determine whether the decrees of an inferior Court were in excess They of jurisdiction. On page 197 of the report, it is laid down by the Chief Justice thatTo hold in the face of these provisions that section 32 prevents the Supreme Court from checking any excess of jurisdiction would be in effect to give the inferior court unlimited jurisdiction. For this reason I have no doubt the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to grant a prohibition. It is extremely difficult to put forward adequately on the floor of this Chamber arguments dealing with difficult legal questions; but I venture to assert that the use of the word ""prohibition"" will have no effect whatever if a constitutional objection is taken, and if the objection is taken that the Court has exceeded its statutory jurisdiction, the decisions in Clancy's case and the Bootmakers' case also seem to make it clear that it will have no effect. The point itself has never been actually decided, but it is a pity to make it appear to the public that we are attempting to curb or limit the jurisdiction of the High Court to control inferior Courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction.

Is it wise to create -a Court of limited and inferior jurisdiction, and by an indirect and irregular .method to, in effect, give it unlimited juriscisions. It may be wise to say of such a diction?

However wide the jurisdiction of a Court, it should be confined within that jurisdiction. To say to a Court, "" You have a -certain jurisdiction, and as much more as you choose to take, because there is no one to question the exercise of your powers,"" is to take a course which has rarely been taken, and, in taking it, Parliament abdicates its function as a Legislature in favour -of the Court which it creates. tion apply to any law limiting the right to appeal ?

363,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat) [8.56],"II should like the Attorney-General to explain the purposes underlying the clause. As a rule, if a case comes before a Court on a plaint, the issues are submitted, and the party who has to answer knows exactly the nature of the case that has to be dealt with, and the evidence that can be called. The clause is a further extension of 38B, and its effect is to provide that, after a plaint has been submitted, the Court, in making an award or order, shall not be restricted to the specific relief claimed by the parties, or to the demands made in the course of the dispute, but may include any matter or thing whicli it thinks necessary or lieve that the settlement of those differences expedient for the purpose of preventing or settling a dispute. How do these matters come before the Court? First of all, they come before it by virtue of the plaint, which is filed, and secondly, by virtue of a sees clearly that the parties have not claim made during the hearing of a case while the parties are there, and the evidence can be called. We are now going a step further and declaring that the Court is not to be limited either to the demands made in the original plaint, or to those made by the parties during the hearing of a case, but that the Judge may go further and say, "" I am going to decide something else which, in my opinion, is necessary to settle this dispute."" What is that "" something else "" to be? It must be somematters that arose during the hearing of thing that is going to affect the rights of the parties on one side, or the other, because it may be included in the award. It must mean either that some one is going to get less by the order of the Court, that some one is to fulfil conditions that he may not care about, or that the employer is to do something. All these matters will apply to both sides, and there is an element of danger in allowing something to be included in an award which has not been raised by the plaint or by the parties durothers. I think this is perfectly fair. When ing the hearing of a case. I should like the Attorney-General to give an explanation of the particular circumstances which necessitate such a wide power being conferred. I see no objection to the Judge dealing with all the matters in a plaint, or is to give him power to settle anything that with anything that may arise during the hearing of a dispute. For instance, additional matters may arise during a hearing, and the plaint can be amended to meet them. I believe it is right to provide for such a thing as that. We are considering this question in the same way as we should consider the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court, and want this Court to have every elasticity arid power to deal with anything that may arise during a hearing. Thisprovision, however, goes very much further, and I should like the Attorney-General to explain what hardship has arisen tonecessitate it. torney-General) [9.4] -It is well knownthat the causes of industrial disputes are not always those that lie upon the surface, and., also, that the parties to a dispute do not always understand the causes of economic disturbances. A body of men, employers or employees, might come before the Court, might state their differences, and bewould promote industrial peace, whereasthey might promote industrial war. If anintelligent impartial man, with a judicialframe of mind, listening to all the evidence, touched the master-key, and that, unless it is touched, they will be at loggerheadsagain, is he not to have power to do anything? Is he simply to have power to patch up the trouble, and send the parties: out in a way that will invite fresh disturbance? In the Broken Hill case His. Honour went outside the plaint. He foundit necessary to do so, and the High Court: pulled him up. the case, and with which the parties could' deal. I do not object to that; it is quiteright. and there are cases where the Court itself sees in the course of the hearing matters, that come within its jurisdiction, and ought, to be settled. The President of the Court is there to settle the disputes brought before him, and to prevent the occurrence of we were-talking about extending preferenceto unionists we were told that we were limiting the judicial discretion of the Judge, and rendering his office, a merely quasi judicial one. What we propose now to do he may think is outside the plaint, although clearly inside the dispute. [9.7] -There ought to be some elasticity in a Court like this to settle disputes and to prevent them arising, but it occurs to. me that this clause goes very much further.

For instance, in an Inter-State mining dispute I take it ;that it would be quite competent for the President of the Court to say that an eight -hours, from bank to bank, rule should apply -to the industry, and be a condition necessary to the insurement of peace.

I agree that the Judge should have large powers -and great latitude in regard to anything affecting the dispute that has to be settled, '-but in this provision there are no words of limitation. Under it the President of the -Court is not tied up by any plaint, nor by the demands of the parties, but anything tfhat they may choose to bring in while a -dispute is in process is a subject upon -which he may give a decision.

This clause enables the Court to provide for its appointment by the parties or otherwise, and the word "" determining "" will not confer upon these Boards any subordinate legislative powers. The Court has not those powers, and therefore cannot delegate them. The word "" determining "" is to be understood quite apart from the meaning attached to it in connection with Wages Boards, where it is used as synonymous with the decision of a Judicial Court, or as meaning a statutory declaration of conditions and rates of pay in a trade. from the Attorney-General that the Boards of Reference appointed by the Judge will have no power to make final determinations, but will only have power to make recommendations to the Judge or to carry out some instruction given by him ? not the point raised by the honourable member for Darling Downs. The word "" determination "" since the establishment of Wages Boards has attained quite a distinct meaning.

Whether or not an appeal could be made under the award of the Judge from the decision of that Board of Reference would not be material, because, whichever party would not agree to the award would have to come before the Court as the result of an application by the other party for penaltiesunder the award.

387,Amendment (By Mr Hughes) Agreed',,53,Carty Salmon Where Then Is Orable Member That I Never Said Anything
388,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang).,"The object of this amendment is to serve the same purpose as the provision which was inserted in section 55 of the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as followsAny of the following associations may, on compliance with the prescribed conditions, be registered in the manner prescribed as an organization. Provided that no such organization shall be entitled to any declaration of preference by the Court when and so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. And further provided that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization so long as its rules or other binding hands of the unions. decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. This is. or purports to be, an industrial Bill, and takes no apparent cognizance of political organizations. ever, many organizations which, while ostensibly industrial, are much more political than industrial in their character. It was recognition of this fact by Mr J. C. Watson, the ex-leader of. the Labour party, and by other members of the same party, that led to the decision of the House to exclude from participation in the benefits of fhis particular class of legislation those organizations which had political aims, or whose funds were used for political purposes. At a later period, however, that very wise provision was knocked out of the original Act. I desire to restore it in another form, so that the Court itself may have the power to cancel the registration of an organization when it is shown that its funds are used for political purposes, that its members are required to subscribe to certain"" political conditions or platforms, that its aims are political, or that its members are required to sacrifice their freedom of conscience and free will, and bind themselves to support political candidates of any special colour, or to subscribe to funds for the purpose of furthering political organization, or to subscribe to newspapers which have for their object propaganda work in connection with the party organization. ""or if any of its members are seen talking to Labour politicians?"" not propose to add anything in the nature of what the Honorary Minister suggests. I want the public in general to know it if theseorganizations are created, or their funds are used, for political purposes, under the guise of industrial aims. If these are political organizations they should come out into the light of day as such, and should not be made the subject of this paternal legislation. I might give a number of cases in which persons, on joining unions, were bound' hand and foot to do certain things of a political character, quite irrespective of whethpr those things were in conformity with their political views. Thev bound themselves to support candidates for Parliament who might or might not hold views entirely opposite to theirs. They had to give up control over their consciences; in fact, they gave themselves body and soul into the tions asked their members to do that? just said that I do not want to go into such There are, howparticulars, but I can do so if the honourable member desires me. save time, I refer the honourable member to speeches by Mr T.

Union one of those organizations? one of them. The Australian Workers Union was very much in evidence on that occasion. Case after case was cited to show that this sort of thing was done, and that all kinds of practices were resorted to by certain organizations, with the concurrence of the then Leader of the Labour party, supported by other leading members of the party; as a consequence of which a clause was inserted'in the Bill which afterwards became law to exclude organizations which resorted to such practices from participation in the benefits of the measure. ney-General) [9.33] It is a source of satisfaction and pleasure to me to welcome a little effort of this sort which we had thought that circumstances had so utterly demolished beneath the relentless wheels of juggernaut that it was too flat ever to gambol round the legislative halls again.

It is an effort to sap the virtue of the measure before the Committee, and practically to declare that there shall be no industrial peace, so far as concerns any organization that dares to spend a penny, of its money to secure industrial rights by legislative means, no matter how much the country suffers. Suppose that there were two men fighting in the street, and because they had elected to spend their money in a certain way the oolice were called off and told, "" You must not interfere with those men, because they are outside the pale of the law."" In this instance the Courts of the country are to be told, "" You must not interfere with a union that is fighting for the employers if it has spent any of its money on political purposes. Let such a union kick up as much row as it pleases; we only interfere with unions that do not spend money in that way."" That is what the amendment amounts to. cannot accept it.

General who was the president or secretary of an Employers Federation, his position would be as invidious as that of the present Attornev-General. That is a thing which should not happen, because, in my opinion, it is distinctly against the public interest. I believe that my proposal will meet with the approval of many supporters of the Government. ney-General) [9.571 -This afternoon the honourable member for Richmond' asked me whether the agreement to which he referred had been registered, and I told him that it had not been. I certainly was under that impression; but it appears, from what I have just been told, that the agreement was registered on Fridav last. 1 have not been so informed except by honourable members on the other side. The honourable member for Richmond must take my word that I thought that the agreement was not registered. within thirtv davs. lished in all the newspapers that the agreement has been registered. ment, I , and those associated with me, all of whom but one or two are members of Parliament, have done all that men could do to induce this branch of the Federation to stand honorably by the award. I have not hesitated to say publicly in a newspaper which circulates in Sydney, as well as elsewhere, that J thought the basis of our industrial evolution must be the honourable observance of agreements; and I say so now. I assuie honourable members that whether the agreement was registered or not would not affect the jurisdiction so far as concerns the Courts having power now to do anything with the men, excepting under section I6A. The honourable member says that it is not in the public interest for members of Parliament, either of State or Commonwealth, to be office hearers in any organization under the Act. AllI have to say is that ihe honourable member does not seem to realize that our organizationI am speaking now of the Labour party-is so inseparably entwined with the various industrial organizations all over the country, that, in effect, he says that no member of an industrial organization shall enter Parliament, or, if he does, his counsel, advice, and assistance shall be no longer at the disposal of the If we had an Attorneyorganization to which, perhaps, he owes his political existence, or to which, at any rate, he has devoted the better portion of his life. Men on this side may be mistaken, and no doubt they, like all of us, occasionally are. I am perfectly sure, however-and I have had some experience of the matter-that strikes are not fomented by members of Parliament, or men who believe in our organization, as we practise and preach it here, but by men, in very many cases, so widely differing from the views that we advocate that there is nothing, not even a similarity of sound, between us. I do not hesitate to say that some of our most virulent and unrelenting opponents in political life are men that the honourable member, apparently, would rather place at the head of associations than ourselves. For my part, I have been associated with this organization since its inceptionI found them unorganized, and I organized them-and I say that no man has ever lost a day's work through me. I am unable to accept the amendment of the honourable member. 1 should not have spoken in this strain but that the honourable member's contradiction of what I said this afternoon made it necessary for me to explain precisely the conditions under which I spoke. I do not know that I am called upon to say any more, except to assure the honourable member, this Committee, and the country, that my opinion, and the opinion of those associated with me on the Council, is, and always has been, that an honourable agreement ought to be observed. -It was not my intention to speak on this Bill, because 1 desire to see it passed as speedily as possible. But the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Richmond is such as to compel me to say something, as I happen to be the representative of the Waterside Workers of Tasmania. What happened when this unfortunate strike came about? We immediately met together, and consulted with the President of the organizationa man who has done more for industrial peace in Australia than any honourable member opposite, any other member of Parliament, or any individual unionist throughout the continent.

What did I do in compliance with the views of the Attorney-General? I went to Tasmania, and in HobartI saw the president of the union and at Launceston the secretary of the Launceston branch ; and I venture to say that I did something towards preventing the strike extending into that State. The men there, I hope, have every confidence in me, as the men, as a whole, have confidence in the Attorney-General. Is that not doing something for industrial peace? This is drawn from me; I had no intention of saying it, but when I hear honourable members opposite talking about members of Parliament bringing about strikes, and so forth, I feel compelled to defend myself. I , like the Attorney-General, desire industrial peace; and we have entered, on behalf of the unions, into an honourable agreement which, as we had no hesitation in. telling them, ought to be kept. The influence we were able to bring to bear, I trust, prevented the strike extending throughout the length and breadth of Australia. tion of honourable members who pretend, or say, that they desire industrial peace. If the honourable member for Richmond is sincere he ought to withdraw this amendment, which is an insultto members of Parliament who use their brains outside this House in their efforts to bring about a better state of affairs in the industrial world. Honourable members will admit that the experience and education we gain here-some , I admit, from honourable members opposite-mak e us better able to deal with those who represent the organized capitrial dispute within the meaning of the tal of Australia. We hear nothing from honourable members opposite about this organized capital, although they are continustrike shall take place. I shall say no ally admitting to us that capital is organized, and will be withdrawn if we do certain things, notwithstanding that such withdrawal would paralyze industry in Australia. If there is justification for organizing capital, and withdrawing it under certain circumstances, surely the employees, and those who are associated with them, are justified in meeting together and deciding whether they shall enter into an agreement which may or may not prevent a strike. If members of Parliament can assist in this work why should they not do so? The agreement referred to was brought [74]2 about by the ship-owners' representatives meeting the workers' representatives across a table; and during the whole six weeks of the negotiations not an unkind word was spoken. The result was an agreement unanimously accepted by the unions 1 reoresent and satisfactory to the ship-owners. Is that not good for the country ? I hope that, under this Bill we shall, at no far distant date, be able to settle all industrial disputes at the conciliatory table. tion Court. valuable, because, if we, or the employers, ask for too much, an appeal can be made; and when we know that there is that final tribunal both sides are careful. The amendment is one that will be disastrous, not only to the trade unions, but to those who represent the organizations of the capitalists. wish to say anything about the direct object of the amendment, because it appears to me to be a matter for the discretion of honourable members, rather than for parliamentary prohibition. I understand, howIs that not worth tbe attenever, that the industrial agreement referred to to-day is registered; and I incidentally call attention to the definition of "" industrial matters'' which includes any claim arising out of an industrial agreement, and also the definition of "" industrial disputes "" which includes any dispute as regards industrial matters. It might, therefore, seem that a dispute as to a claim under an industrial agreement is a dispute within the meaning of the Constitution. If , for in^ stance, one side demands performance by the other it may be that there is an indusi Act; and if there is, then section 6 of the Act comes into force, and says that no more, because there may be two interpretations, but as the Federal jurisdiction has been spoken about, I thought it better to call attention to these definitions. If one of the obligations of the agreement is to perform work at a certain rate; and if there is a dispute as to that, it seems possible there may be jurisdiction. Proposed new clause negatived.

In the circumstances, it is considered advisable to omit paragraph d of clause 7, and to deal with the matter in clause 3, the interpretation clause. That is the reason why it is proposed that these two clauses should be reconsidered. On two previous occasions when the Bill was under consideration, the honourable member for Swan expressed a fear that I am sure that the under the Bill the Government might be liable, in case of an accident occurring to a ship because of a light going out.
