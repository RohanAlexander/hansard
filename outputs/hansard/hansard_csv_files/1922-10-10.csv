According to the Age, the Commonwealth Defence Department contains 34,000 employees, and that of Great Britain only 145,000. But had a fair comparison been made, like being compared with like, Australia would have been shown to have in her Defence Department only 9,784 persons, and Great Britain 392,978.

I make this suggestion to meet the point raised by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) in regard to the taxation of the incomes of the New South Wales and Victorian Cricket Associations. be "" of public benefit."" ing clubs make a profit. whether the Treasurer 'could meet in any other way the object I have in view. The New South Wales and Victorian Cricket Associations are now taxed on any profits made in connection w i th matches held under their auspices. When an English Cricket Eleven visits Australia, a certain amount of profit is made, and is spent during years in which there are no international matches. The InterState matches, as a rule, do not pay. matches such as those between Victoria and New South Wales pay ? I could understand a match between Victoria and say, Tasmania, not paying, but some of the other Inter-State matches ought to yield a profit. the Inter-State matches in any one year they seldom pay. They usually result in a loss, and that loss is made good out of the profits derived from the international matches. When these Associations have -any surplus funds they distribute them amongst the various clubs to help them in forming or improving their grounds. No profit is distributed amongst shareholders, so that in the circumstances the imposition of income tax simply reduces the amount that could be used in the direction I have mentioned, and is to. that extent a limitation of sport. By means bf the entertainments tax we get a certain amount of revenue from the Cricket Associations. desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. ( Mr Bruce) the position of the Sydney TradesH a l l and Literary Institute, which was built and ie supported out of the funds raised by the Eight Hours Demonstration Committee. There is no possibility of any dividend being paid by either the H a l l or the Library Committee. The Library is for purely reference purposes, and is perhaps one of the best of its kind in Australia, yet income tax has to be paid by the TradesH a l l and the Literary Institute. There are thirteen trades halls in Australia, but that in Sydney ia the only one which pays income tax. The income tax paid last year amounted to JE490. The Taxation Commissioner says that he has no option but to impose the tax in respect of the But most of the racincome of these institutions since the money is handed over to the TradesH a l l A lot of them do not. and Literary Institute Committee by tha do not know Eight Hours Demonstration Committee and then goes back to the trustees of the land or the mortgagee. I endeavoured last year to induce the then Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to meet this case, but owing either to bis stupidity or my own, or perhaps because of a littl e dullness on each side, I could not make him understand what I wanted. If the funds of the Cricket Associations are to be exempt, surely those of the Sydney TradesH a l l and Library, which are Surely Inter-State carried on in the public interest, should be treated in the same way. The present debt on the Trades Hall and Literary Institute is between £17,000 and £18,000. The object of the Institute, as the name implies, is a good one. I cannot get the Commissioner to agree to exemption of its income from taxation. He states that there is a provision in the Act that makes payment of the tax compulsory, but he realizes that the position is an anomalous one. I desire to give notice of an amendment which I think had better be considered in connection with clause 23, which relates to deductions. The amendment is to add to the deductions there set out the following new paragraph: Tn the case of an athletic sporting hody or association not carried on for the purpose ol profit or gain to the individual members thereof, sums proved to the satisfaction of the",16,Administration The Income Of Any Society Or Associa

There is no personal gain by any individual members of the organizations.

Honourable members will realize that the teaching of young people to swim is amost laudable object. pay income tax at present? are performing a great service to the community, and it is not fair that their income should be taxed. I do not know whether such bodies would be covered by the amendment of which the honourable member for Parramatta has given notice. involved. exempt from taxation? I desire to supplement the representations made by the honourable member for Adelaide. I was very much surprised to hear that the proceeds of exhibitions by swimming and life-saving societies were subject to Federal taxation. In my opinion there is no form of entertainment that is more deserving of favorable consideration at the hands of Parliament. These bodies are rendering a distinct service to the community, and the value of that service has been proved on numerous occasions when the lives of people have been in danger. Every inducement should be offered to young people to acquire the ar.t of natation. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to give an assurance that in future the Government will forgo any taxation with respect to these clubs or societies. -Does the Treasurer think it practicable to discriminate between cricket and football associations? I cannot see the difference between one and the other, for a purpose of this kind, and I should like to know whether the Minister has consulted his officers on the point. port honourable members who ask that clubs who carry on sport for the benefit of sport itself, and do not distribute profits to individuals, shall be exempt from taxation. is difficult to discriminate between sporting bodies. Some distribute profits toindividuals, who are 'prof essionals, and in other ways for the benefits of members.

64,Mr Bell,"L agree with the honorfits OF receipts should be taxed, especially as already pointed out by ihe honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden), they are already taxed through the Entertainments Tax Act. If we tax theso so-called profits, we really draw too much from the receipts of sporting bodies. Why should it be necessary to tax tbese sporting bodies at all, since in regard to companies we have decided not to tax at the source, but to tax the individuals who derive benefits from the distribution? [11.42] I shall deal first with the poin.t raised by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) with regard to exempt income. I do not think there is any difficulty in this respect, or any necession, particularly with regard to the case sity to insert further words. Sub-clause 2 of clause 14 deals fully with income that is derived by way of interest on certain specified securities, and it is made perfectly elear that the income is exempt when it comes into the hands of the shareholder. According to clause 16, which deals with what is considered as assessable income, ex-Australian profits are removed out of the sphere of taxation in the hands of the shareholders. The point as to accretions of capital in the hands of a company is raised by clause 16, and I propose to submit an amendment which I think will meet the position. As to sporting associations, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) proposes to deal with them under another clause as a matter of deductions. considerable discussion, and I think I ought to say a word or two now in regard to. the suggestions made. The Government cannot accept any amendment, because we do not take the view that sporting associations are so essential, or require such encouragement in this country, that special provision must be made for their exemption under an Income Tax Assessment Bill. The sporting instinct is fully developed in this country, and sporting associations receive all the necessary support from the community; indeed, some of our critics say we have gone a great deal too far in this direction. This Bill does, in fact, exempt the incomes of certain associations formed with other objects than that of sport. We provide that societies or associations established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of science, art, and literature, and not carried on for profit, shall be exempt. swimming clubs not scientific? ber can bring such clubs within the definition of "" science,"" he need not bother about -making any amendment in the Bill. Such associations as I have just referred to are considered by the Government as necessary and worthy of assistance and encouragement in Australia; but in regard to sport, we take an entirely different view. The Government are not prepared to make a specific exemption in the case of sporting associations. This question was considered by the Royal Commisof the New South Wales Cricket Association referred to by the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden) and the honourable member for Parramatta. Afterconsidering the matter, the Royal Commission came to the conclusion that they were unable to see sufficient grounds for recommending the exemption of any suchbody. The Commissioners, in their report, sayIt will be noted that no associations whose principal object is the encouragement of sport are at present included in the exempt list, and wa are unable to see any sufficient grounds for recommending the inclusion of any such body. deductions. question of deductions directly. The question now is whether these sporting associations should be exempt from income tax, as are societies for the promotion of art, science, and literature. The Royal Commission also dealt with the point raised by the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) that these sporting associations already pay the entertainments tax. The report of the Royal Commission saysA side issue introduced into the question is that the public pays Entertainments Tax upon entrance money to such cricket matches. This, however, does not appear to us to affect the question. The amount obtained through the Entertainments Tax is paid by individuals, and the association is merely the channel through which the amount of tax reaches the taxation authorities. Not at any stage does the amount so paid enter into the real revenue of the association.",18,Administration The Income Of Any Society Or Associa

Everybody will admif that an association of men who give their time, including Saturday afternoons and evenings, for teaching young boys and girls to swim, is performing a great service to the community. I think it will be admitted that the members of such associations duty the value of which cannot be overestimated. It is true that these associations conduct swimming and life-saving displays, at which a charge is made for admission. That is the only revenue which they derive, apart from any small amounts they are able to collect from individual members, or others who may give donations. taxation at present? the work they are performing cannot be classified as sport.

110,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Treasurer )later, but in fairness to bim I will-make it quite clear how far I propose to go. IfI accepted the amendment which he has moved, it would be a little more far-reaching in its effect than tbe amendment which I shall move myself. The difficulty which the honourable gentleman is trying to get over is that a company might in a certain year dispose of a property, which is capital, at a profit, and that profit would be an accretion to capital. If the company paid a dividend, part or the whole of which came out of the profit on the sale of the property, it would be taxed. In the hands of a company there is no question but that the accretion to capital is not taxable, but when it reaches the hands of the shareholders it becomes taxable. Let me explain the reason why the Bill was framed with that provision. We have a tremendous number of complexities in our Income Tax Act. We do two things in order to try to give absolute justice. Where a company pays a dividend, part of which is derived from profits earned outside Australia, we exempt from taxation those profits in the hands of the company, and we give to the individual shareholder in his own income tax payments a proportionate exemption based upon the proportion of the profits earned overseas and in Australia. In the case of a dividend which is paid partly out of interest upon Commonwealth non-taxable securities, we give the same exemption to both the company and the shareholder. In doing that great administrative difficulty is involved. every case where a company pays any dividends out of profits earned outside of Australia, the portions of its profits earned outside and inside Australia have to .be determined, and the proportion applied to every individual income tax assessment. The same procedure has to be followed in respect of any part of a dividend that is paid out of interest upon Commonwealth nontaxable securities. We might have a company with 3,000 or 5,000 shareholders, and it might earn profits both inside and outside Australia. portion of its business might be a. very small fraction of the whole. Let us suppose it was a tenth, although, unfortunately, these fractions never fall into those happy decimals, but are always most complicated. When the fraction has been arrived at, it has to be followed into the 3,000 or 5,000 returns from the sbareilr. Brvoe. holders. A man's dividend might only amount to £5, but he would have to be allowed an exemption. If the company had also paid part of its dividend out of interest on Australian non-taxable securities, which might only represent £1,000 out of £100,000, it must again be followed through every taxpayer's assessment, and the man who receives his £5 dividend would have another appalling fraction worked out to determine the dividend he should be taxed upon. If the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman were agreed to, it would introduce another complication of that character. It would mean that every time a company paid the smallest fraction of its dividends out of an accretion of capital arising out of a profit on the sale of a capital asset, we would have to do another of these sums and follow a complicated fraction through thousands upou thousands of taxpayers' returns. The cost would be very great, and I suggest that it would be almost a hopeless straining after equity. We propose to give the exemption on any part of the profits re-tained in the hands of the company, and we would willingly give it to the shareholders if there was not this appalling administrative difficulty in the way. There is one justification, 1 think, for taxing the shareholders, and it is based upon the principle of capacity to pay. I have listened to many arguments in regard to bonus shares, and the one which carried the most force was In that the holder of a bonus share has received nothing except a piece of paper, and that he has. no capacity to pay. But in the circumstances with which the amendment deals, the shareholder has every capacity to pay; he has received the taxpayer's dividend, the money has reached him, and the Commissioner only asks for a small proportion of it. Therefore, there is nothing to be said in favour of inserting this proposed extra refinement of equity. But, to meet the position without creating those appalling administrative difficulties which I have indicated, I The non-Australian shall later propose an amendment, under which, where a company pays a dividend or bonus, wholly and exclusively out of profits arising from the sale, of capital assets, the member or shareholder shall not be liable to taxation on that dividend or bonus. That will go a long way to meet the trouble which the mover of the amendment has mentioned. I ask him to be content with that, and not press his amendment, in view of the grave and serious difficulties that it would create. Amendment negatived. fore the Treasurer moves a further amendment, T should like to draw attention to a matter that arises out of the proviso to paragraph b:Provided that where a company derives inland woiild object that it meant a loss come from a source in Australia and from a source outside Australia, a taxpayer shall only be taxable on so much of the dividend os bears to the whole dividend the same proportion that the profits derived by the company from a source in Australia bears to the total profits of the company. The proviso states the theory of the law, but not the practice. I know, as the Treasurer probably does, that the assessment of companies having head-quarters in Australia and doing business in other countries, is one of the most ticklish problems of companies' taxation. Judging from conversations I have had with him, the Commissioner feels bound by law and practice to administer the existing section, which the proviso repeats, in a way that I think is very unjust to individuals and companies who are reaching out for this beneficial trade, and, in many instances, is destructive of their efforts in that direction. I am not prepared to move an amendment, because that could only be done after consultation with the accountant mind that has beeu dealing with these issues; and I have not been able to do that. ber is dealing with the determination of what is ancl what is not a profit made in Australia. the point by this instance: A manufacturing company doing business in Australia exports goods to New Zealand. In the Dominion it has to make an income tax return, upon which it is assessed, and pays, on what the Now Zealand assessment regards as a substantial profit, a very heavy rate. If the company were not taxed on that portion of its profits which has been assessed in New Zealand, when it is included in the Australian balance-sheet, all would be well; but the Australian assessment includes the great bulk of the amount that was assessed and taxed in New Zealand, and thus over a considerable area of its profits, the company pays taxation twice. avoided by a reciprocal agreement. to get.

I think the Commissioner would be willing to accept a proposition which, whilst safeguarding the revenue, would give justice to exporting houses. procedure is based upon the Commissioner's reading of the law rather than upon the wording of it. argue that. It would not be fair to say that the Commissioner is taking too rigid a view of the law. The Act should be altered aud some practice adopted which, instead of penalizing those engaged iu this trade, would invite them to embark upon it. I urge th% Treasurer to see if he cannot insert some amendment satisfactory to the Commissioner which will stop, as far as possible, this objectionable practice of double taxation, or if it can* not be stopped altogether, delimit it by Statute law in a way which will bind the Commissioner. The matter is well worthy of the Treasurer's personal attention in consultation with the Commissioner and his assessing officers, because this is a trade that may, in the future, mean a great deal to the prosperity of Australia.",23,Administration The Income Of Any Society Or Associa

A great deal of heart-burning arises in regard to another form of assets which has hitherto been included by the Eederal Taxation Commissioner, viz., the equity in perishable stock. The equity in Wool and Wheat Pools are other assets over which the owner has no control whatever. The wheat is entirely out of the hands of its owner and under the control of the Commonwealth, which might hold it for ten years. During that period of control the owner does not comunjust. It would be infinitely better if mence to enjoy the money, and his equity is an unknown quantity. Could not the Treasurer insert a clause to provide that the tax would only be levied upou realization? It is only right that the Government should not enjoy its income until the producer himself is in that happy position. We have had distinct evidence of hardship in connection with this particular matter. sioner may estimate the equity in a property of a taxpayer who, however, may not realize the amount of the Commissioner's estimate, but because of the estihands of the taxpayers? mate the taxpayer's income is increased, and under the graduated scale he may be called upon to pay a very heavy tax. If subsequently it is discovered that he has not been able to realize the amount of the estimate he is entitled to a refund, but unfortunately this refund is at a lower rate of the income. Treasurer in all sincerity to help the primary producers in this matter. The recent revision of the Tariff waa in the interests of the primary producers, and this is another way in which some consideration may be shown to them. Much of the produce that would be involved in the consideration© of this problem is perishable. fruit. stances it may become rotten before it can be marketed, and though the Department makes a refund it is, as I have shown, on a lower rate, and the taxpayer suffers a serious injustice. be the amount paid? the inequity of the present practice circle that income tax must be paid lies. is in my mind. There may be a certain equity in a pool, amounting to £2,000, which results in an assessable income being increased from £4,000 to £6,000, and the rate of tax iucreased from 14d. to 30d. in the £1. Suppose that estimate of £2,000 equity is not realized, and a refund has to be made in the following year when the profit may only be £1,000. Well, the tax on £1,00C is only a few pence in the £1, and so the refund would simply be deducted at that rate. The Department may have collected at the rate of 40d., and may refund, possibly, at l i d . The system is there were some provision in the Bill to allow of assessments being made on realization. The same position arises in connection with the 10 per cent, retention money in wool. As honourable members well know, when the appraisers set to work to appraise the wool, on a basis of 15$d. per lb., they allowed for possible mistakes, in appraisement, and, accordThe Commisingly, held back 10 per cent, as a safeguard. Isi t unreasonable to ask that the Government should wait for the tax until that 10 per cent, is actually in the there. position. It would be a convenience to taxpayers if in items like these the collection of the tax were allowed to remain I ask the in abeyance until the taxpayer himself was in enjoyment of the wealth upon which he has been assessed. But, no; according to the practice of the Department it is seized upon, and in many cases the application of the law works a cruel injustice upon the taxpayer. I rise to support the view stated by In some cases it may be the honourable member foT Swan( Mr Owing to unforeseen circumProwse). The point he has raised is a burning question amongst primary producers.

126,,"Mr STEWART (Wimmera) [12.36].but I impress upon tbe Treasurer ( Mr upon it , but do not ask him to pay, as Bruce) tlie necessity, for some alteration in the existing state of affairs. As primary producers we go to the expense of producing wheat and wool or any other commodity, and it is unjust that we should be taxed in respect of any' portion of it upon its prospective value. I think the Treasurer clearly understands the point I am endeavouring to make, and on behalf of the primary producers, I ask him to see if, in consultation with the officers of the Department, some more equitable scheme cannot be devised than that we have had imposed upon us during the past few years. I understand that the honourable memalready intimated his intention of submitting certain amendments with regard to income taxation on live stock, which we shall have an opportunity, of considering later. Meanwhile I support the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) and the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr spect of such moneys are held by the Stewart). We object to the practice of the Department requiring us to furnish returns showing the produce on hand. The wool-grower, for example, has to show what wool is on hand, and likewise the grain-grower, what grain may. bo in store, although in a number of instances the taxpayer knows that, owing to deterioration, he will never realize the estimate. The practice of the Department is grossly unfair. A deduction might be allowed later on for the actual loss of material, but we do not get a reduction in the rate, and I hope that the Treasurer will find it possible to cut out of the schedule altogether produce that is carried over. Produce carried over cannot be dealt with in the way that capital can be handled. A man carries over his produce from one year to the next with the object of realizing on it in the following years. If he is able to realize the Commonwealth gets the benefit of the tax upon it , and when he does not it is not fair that he should be taxed in respect of it . ber advocate dealing with it on a cash basis ? what I suggest. When a man realizes on his produce, let him pay income tax the Department now does, upon a great body of produce on which he does not realize at all. deterioration of produce sometimes takes place. In many ways a primary producer is hit most unfairly under the provision toi which I refer, and for which so far as I can see there is no reason. I ask only for justice for the man who produces these tilings. He is quite prepared to pay income tax in respect of them when he realizes, but he feels it is unjust that he should be called upon to pay ths actual tax upon them, and at the higher rate, when he does not realize upon them at all. [12.43] I am sure that the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) will recognise the injustice of the case that I propose to put before him, and which has to do with the taxation of the retention moneys in connection with the Wool Pool. In thousands of cases all over Australia the notes in rebanks or by the auctioneers who havo made advances to the persons concerned, and if they had been distributed the actual recipients would not have been liable to pay income tax in respect of them. Their losses have been so great that they would be exempt. Asi t is, although they have had to lodge with the bank or others who are financing them their retention note9,, they are calledupon to pay income tax in respect of such moneys. honourable member. Does he suggest that .the retention, moneys in respect of wool should not be taxed at all? that the recipient or person entitled to such moneys should pay income tax in respect of them only when he actually receives them.

He is compelled by the Commissioner to value that produce at the market rate at the time, but if all the production of that season were put on the market at once, the value would be reduced considerably. There might be no market at all for some products, and still the producer has to pay tax on the estimated value. That is unfair, and a great hardship on the producer, who has no money to pay the tax, or even on which to live, and has to get an overdraft. Many of us have to pay on so-called assets which we do not possess, because we have not realized. One objection to the suggestion that we should pay on a cash basis is that there would be an accumulation of profits for a number of years, and the taxpayer woidd be compelled to pay at a very high rate in one season. But if , under the law as established by this amending Bill, the income is averaged over a period of years for the purpose of fixing the rate, I can see no further objection from the point of view I have just mentioned. I have thought a good deal about this matter, and have discussed it with various authorities, and I have not heard any good reason why we should not defer the liability to be taxed until we have realized on the products of any one season. [12.54] -The questions raised now are very wide, but I should first like do deal with two side questions-thos e having reference to wheat equities and wool retention moneys. The Commissioner has brought wheat equities to account in the year in which .the wheat is put into the Pool. Wherei t is the case that the certificate received is saleable without restriction, there is no very serious hardship, but where there is restriction, as I understand is the case in Western Australia., the position is a little more difficult. throughout this discussion about wheat equities, for example, is that they have to be brought to account at the time the wheat is put into the Pool, or the cash brought to account at the time it is received. what the honourable member says is all we have to determine the year when every he desires is that a man is taxable in each single thing should be brought to account; year upon his income for that year, and and on the existing basis that year is the that income is interpreted to mean the profit that he has made. But throughout our income tax law we have adopted the system of bringing the year's assets to account. Presently we shall deal with the question as to whether these assets should be so brought to account-that is the broad question raised by the honoring). At the moment, whether honourable members agree with it or not, profit is arrived at by bringing to account the assets at the end of the year, and the wheatequity is undoubtedly an asset; it is the same as wool which may be on hand, but has not been realized; the same as if the wheat that the certificate represents was still in possession of the producer. Both of these are brought to account in the year of production, and, ta be logical, the year when the equity should be brought to account is the year when it is put into the Pool-the year of production. people who advocate that the tax should only be paid when the money for the produce sold is received. people! am pointing out to the Committee that that is not the basis on which our taxation laws are framed and administered. question in a moment; I am at present dealing with the question of wheat equities on the basis of which the law is now framed and administered, and trying to point out that if we accept that basis the proper year to bring the equities to account is the year when the wheat is produced. members will agree that that is the position; they may discuss afterwards whether that be the Tight way or not.

163,Mr Bruce,"I think 'honorableyear of production. Therefore, under the existing system, the proper practice is to bring the wheat certificate to account in the year of production, so that the rate of tax paid will be the same .as that paid by a man who holds his wheat or his wool and has to bring it to account. That is the only point I wish to make with regard to wheat; I shall deal in a moment or two with the -question whether the present method is right or wrong. ""With regard to wool retention moneys the position is that those amounts are deferred payments, .and all that has-to be determined is what is the proper year to include them iu income. Nobody is suggesting that those amounts' should be entirely exempt from income tax-the question is what is the proper year to bring them to account. view of the ©apartment, and from my point of view, I would rather lump the amount into each assessment, and have done with all the trouble. But, surely, if we are to give justice, which we strain and over strain to give, the proper year, again, to bring these retention moneys to account is the year in respect of which they were earned. . Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.80 p.m. twospecific cases which have been raised, and which turn, to some extent, on the question of values to be taken, particularly in respect to the assets of primary producers. I have tried to slij.v that if we have to bring wheat equities* and wool retention moneys to account on our present basis of assessing for income tax, the proper and logical thing to do is to bring them to account in the year of production. NowI come to a very much broader question, namely, the basis upon which income tax should be assessed, dealing particularly with the position of primary producers. There are several sides to this question, but there are some broad advocates who go the whole way and say that the proper basis of assessment for the primary producer is the cash basis. They hold that he should pay only in respect of actual moneys received in the year of receipt, and that there should be no bringing to account of assets at the end of each accounting period. Those honourable members who advocate that method have some support .outside this Chamber, but it is very limited indeed. cause I am certain that no one in this community has had the views of the primary producer put before him more often or in more detail than I have had iu the past six months. advocates outside the ranks of the primary producers. point in a second. I have heard the views of a great number, and for the moment I will confine the issue to the primary producers. I claim that, for every advocate of the system of a cash From the point of basis, there are ten who advocate the system of bringing assets to account at the end of every year. pressing the views of the big pastoralists? say, with perfect justice, that I am expressing the general view of most classes. Now, dealing with the two different bases, we must always remember that if we do not bring a thing to account at the end of its production, whether it be wool, wheat, or natural increase, we have no entry on our debit side against the value of that wool, wheat, or natural increase when it comes to be sold; and the inevitable result is that when a period of prosperity follows a period of difficulty, and large sales are effected at satisfactory prices, the incidence of the income tax upon the individual concerned is excessively hard. not regulate that in their sales? the kind. Sales are directed mostly by necessity and opportunity. who has big capital resources behind him can choose his moment to sell; but the small man with no resources is governed only by necessity, and those who are a little more fortunate are governed by opportunity.

174,Mr Bruce,"I agree that the man-adoption of the cash basis system; but now they wish they had never heard of it, and would willingly part with it . Only yesterday the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) pointed out the very facts which I am now indicating; and suggested what seemed to me an almost brutal method, namely, that we should give taxpayers the option, and let them learn by bitter experience that a cash basis would be disastrous toi them. But the course suggested by the honourable member is not the duty of a taxing authority. The duty of the State is to try to devise what appears to be the most equitable basis upon which taxation can be levied. that. differences of opinion as to which is the most equitable basis to adopt. different effects upon different sets of people. very grave danger of inequity to any class of taxpayers by imposing a basis of taxation, it has no right to allow the tax to be assessed in that way. As I was responsible for advising the Cabinet as to which system should be adopted, I felt the gravest doubt with regard to the application of a cash basis, not because it might prove detrimental to the revenue, but because it was likely to be dangerous to the individual taxpayer. I could not recommend such a system. Coming now to the method of bringing to account at the end of every taxing period, it is sometimes said that it causes very grave inequities in its application, and from the way in which examples are quoted it might be supposed that when a man has brought something to account, and then sells, it is no benefit to him at the time of bringing it to account. Take< the case of natural increase, upon which there has been some discussion. Having brought it to account as is required to be done at the end of the taxing period of production, and in that way having increased one's assets against his debits, when the new taxing period is commenced it is brought to account as a debit, or as a setoff against the individual's assets in that year. It . is very naturally pointed out that some of the assets thus brought to account may subsequently never be realized upon, owing to drought and its consequent mortality; but as against that position it must be remembered that at the beginning of the accounting period in which that asset is lost, the individual had brought into account the value of his natural increase as a debit, and as it has disappeared in the period he has no corresponding asset to bring into account at the end of the year. Thus he is relieved to a very substantial, extent from the results that follow upon any disaster that has fallen upon him. tax upon something upon which ho has realized nothing. all seeking subsequent period in which, because his assets have disappeared, he has not an opportunity of realizing, he is allowed to show those assets as a debit against the amount which he had taken into account as assets at the end of the period. of low values. is shifting his ground. on. something which he has never enjoyed. I can show cases where thousands of pounds have been paid in income tax upon calves not one of which have lived. is quoting a case which is very often put forward, but if he does bring it forward he should, in fairness, go on to point out that in the year following the period in which the calves were brought to account j -heiiowner would show as a debit the value upon which he had had to pay tax in respect of them. Thus he would have that asset on his debit side, and, having lost it, he would not have to bring it to account on his credit side. Consequently any profits he might have made in other directions would be reduced by the debit he was allowed to bring in in respect of the tax already paid in the previous year. I have no desire to overstate the case, but I want to show that there is something to be said on both sides of the question in relation to this method of bringing to account at the end of every taxing period. It has been suggested that natural increase regarded as a specific item is an. accretion to capital, and should not be brought to account.

The proposals which the Government are now submitting in regard to this very difficult question of how we are to bring natural increase to account in no sense meet the case of those who are advocating a cash basis for income tax assessment by primary producers, but I think they very f a i r l y meet the difficulties stated by those who, although they are prepared to accept the annual bringing to account of assets, nevertheless consider that they havo suffered considerable hardship by the basis hitherto adopted. three modes of bringing natural increase to account. One is that we should bring it to account at market value. deals with the point raised by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett""), who asked why there was any distinction between trading stock, which is not live-stock, and live-stock. difficulty in regard to assessing at market value is that it is practically impossible to work out what is the market value for natural increase in a continent w it h the extent of Australia, and containing sc many people placed in such widely varying circumstances. is that we should bring natural increase to account at any value the owner cares to put upon' it . The third suggestion is that there should be a prescribed value by the Department. that which now exists allowed. value is fixed by the Department. A fte r giving a very great deal of attention to this very difficult problem and getting all the assistance I could, I was faced with the difficulty that each school of thought seemed to advocate a different thing and heartily condemned the ideas of every other school. Eventually, as a compromise, this system was devised, and I think it more or less meets the position. We are maintaining the prescribed value, but instead of fixing only one value, we axe allowing a maximum value and a .minimum value; the la.tter will be a quarter of the maximum, which, when gazetted, will probably be something lessI think the contention is than the existing value. Between the Natural maximum and the minimum, the taxpayer may select his own value, but after he has made a selection,, he must stick to it. I think that is a fair compromise between all the ideas which are held by different classes of taxpayers, and is a reasonable solution of a very difficult problem. mean that the taxpayer must throughout the subsequent years stick to the valuation he has made? member will realize that if a man were not compelled to adhere to his original value, he could, by varying his valuation There are every year, show that he had made neither a gain nor a loss. This applies only to natural increase of stock. Purchases will be brought to account at the This purchase price, if they can be identified. I admit quite frankly that the basis contained in the B ill does not meet the claims of those who say that only the cash basis should be employed, but I think it The is in accord with the views of the great bulk of the primary producers. With regard to valuations generally, a cash basis in connection with all businesses is quite impracticable, and I know of none who suggest that this basis should be taken for income assessment in business The next suggestion generally throughout the Commonwealth. The Government have tried to solve a very difficult problem by dealing with natural increase of live stock on the basis indicated, and by dealing with trading The last system is stock on the three different bases set out ° "" in the B ill .

The honourable gentleman has expressed a great deal of sympathy with the small farmers, and he must know the long hours they work and the little time they have in which to keep proper accounts.

189,Mr Prowse (Swan) [ 2 . 4 9 ],"I haveon the actual receipts from their produce. Primary products are, to a large extent, intangible assets. The taxation law is being revised ostensibly in the interests of the primary producers, but it is remarkable that the amendments axe more for the benefit of other than primary producers. The Bill seems to be designed to protect the rights of companies-and other big interests, and when we,, who represent the primary producer, ask for consideration for. him, the Treasurer tries to make it appear that we do not know what we are talking about. The terrible graduation of rates and the forcing of the primary producer to bring to account intangible assets in the shape of perishable products, such as potatoes and fruit, place an intolerable burden upon the taxpayer. Often he has not commenced to enjoy the income upon which he is taxed, and he has to borrow money with which to pay his taxes. The Government will not wait for its money until the primary producer has been paid for his produce. The Treasurer said that if that were done the farmer would put himself in "" Queerstreet"" by showing too many sales in one assessable year; but the farmer has control of his affairs, and he can regulate his sales as the growths occur. It is suggested that if his expected receipts have been over-estimated, if the market f alls, or if the weevils or mice get into his wheat, a deduction may be made in his next year's return j but already the farmer has paid his taxation in hard cash on an income which he has not enjoyed. will admit that the taxpayer gets back something in the following year. missioner of Taxation in Western Australia made a desperate attempt last year to inflate the accounts of primary producers in a way that meant the payment of many thousands of pounds of taxation upon stock which they had never realized. Not only were there the ordinary profits on sales, but, in addition, a lot of dividends from Pools had come into that year; and, iu order to make the incomes bigger, the Commissioner looked forward by estimating the equity in the unsold wheat. When taxation is made burdensome in this way, the Government cannot be said to be acting in the interests of primary production.' unfair in suggesting improper reasons for the Deputy Commissioner's action. assessments were made on a cash basis in previous years, and equity in unrealized assets was not brought into account. But as soon. a3 the Commonwealth and the State agreed to collect through the one authority, the Deputy Commissioner in Perth, presumably acting under instructions from the Commissioner, brought equity into account in connection with both Commonwealth and State taxation. Whatever might be his motive for loading up the incomes for that year, I know that an intolerable and unjust burden was placed upon the primaiy producers, who had to pay a vastly increased amount of 'taxation. We are told that if the equity was not realized in the year of assessment a claim for a refund could be made. East year was pretty good, but the refund might be taken off a year of losses in which no income tax would be paid, and already the farmer may have paid 30d. to 40d. in the f l in respect of an income of which he had not enjoyed a farthing. Farmers do not employ accountants to keep their books, but they are as straightforward as are other.people in the community. As .a -rule, they practically allow thc banker to regulate their affairs. I know of instances in which men brought into account assets that were not taxable and the Department did not inform them of their mistake, but collected upon what was really not true income for the year. is suggesting that the Department deliberately and improperly took taxation that was not due and did not inform the taxpayer, he is making a statement that is quite wrong-""and very improper. under the notice of the Treasurer. The officials seem to assume that the taxpayer is trying to rob the Department, and they spend a tremendous amount of money in queries into this, that, and ithe other thing.

The farmers have not been conceded the simple average for which they asked. We are asking that simpler methods of taxation shall be adopted in the taxation of primary producers. The present system is so complicated that they have to employ accountants to make out their returns, and the fees so paid by them very often amount to more than they have to pay by way of income tax. They are obliged to employ accountants because of the great difficulty involved in bringing into account the in tangible items to which I have referred. of the fawners do not pay any income be about 150,000 wool-growers in the tax. to the trouble of furnishing returns.

A t the time that my accounts closed I had not received the money in question, and did not know whether or not I would receive it , since this 10 per cent, is retained by the Wool Pool to cover mistakes.

He is in a very difficult position in dealing with the question of the taxation of live stock on hand and produce carried over, and it is our duty to give him every possible assistance. I invite his attention to the position of those who three years ago paid £ 3 per head for their calves, whereas calves to-day are worth only about £ 1 per head. Then, again, three years ago lambs were worth comparatively nothing, whereas to-day they are fetching a big prico. Is a man to be taxed over the three years' period on the basis of the present-day value of his live stock ? If so, the position will be very serious. What, again, is to be done in respect of the valuation of cross bred wool, which a good many small farmers are growing? I know of several farmers who have had their cross bred wool in their sheds for the last two years, and have not even baled it . How can such o wool be brought into account? No ono knows what it will realize. may be said with respect to wheat that has been stacked in various parts of the country, and, in many cases, has been ruined by weevils. Still another case calling for attention is that of the cattle men. A little while ago magnificent beef all over the Commonwealth was practically going to waste. market for it until the Government recently came to the rescue of tbe industry, with the result that the position has been somewhat improved. I hope that the Treasurer will not call upon any taxpayer to pay income tax in respect of has actually realized upon it . When a taxpayer has sold his produce and got the cash he can pay. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) twitted the Treasurer with being better able to deal with the business of a warehouse than with the business of the primary producer; but I know that the honourable gentleman has sufficient intelligence to enable him to appreciate the position of the primary producer. It is undoubtedly a difficult one. In my own electorate, in the early part of this season, hundreds of acres of potatoes were not even dug up, because the price obtainable for them was only £2 10s. per tona price that would not pay for bagging. Six months later potatoes were fetching £10 per ton in the market. How is the Department to deal with these variations in prices? If the Treasurer does not protect the producers, the producers will not protect him and his Department. Barley last year was realizing 6s. or 7s. per bushel; to-day it is worth only about half that price. Thousands of bushels of barley are stacked. How can the farmer who has large quantities of barley on hand pay income tax in respect of it until he has realized upon it? It would be wrong to tax him on the basis of last year's prices. Milk is also greatly decreased in price. No Treasurer could properly assess the primary producers in respect of stock held over. The Department should wait until such stock is realized, when the owners will be able to furnish a proper statement of their income. I hope that the Treasurer will deal very carefully with this matter, and that he will agree that taxpayers should not be called upon to pay income tax in respect of stock or produce on which they have not yet realized. When such stock or produce has been sold, the owners will be proud to pay income tax in respect of The same it. In conclusion, I congratulate the Treasurer on the information with which he has supplied us in regard to this Bill, and am pleased to tell him that throughout the country he is looked upon witb the greatest respect.

In order to meet the point raised by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) with regard to thc caee of distribution, by the liquidator of a company oral of capital assets, I am slightly amending the proposed amendment as printed and circulated. move That after sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) the following proviso be inserted :-""Pro of the statements made a moment ago by vided also that where a dividend or bonus is paid wholly and exclusively out of the profits arising from the sale of capital assets, a memof the argument of the honourable member or shareholder shall not be liable to tax on that dividend or bonus."" Earlier in the day_ I explained this matter very fully. I think I have met the objection which has been raised, and, therefore, shall not discuss it further'. Amendment agreed to. posedThat the word "" profits"", first occurring in paragraph (i>), sub-clause (ii), be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" assessable income "". should like to know exactly what is the effect of this sub-clause. carefully, and yet., I am scarcely able to get "" the hang of it . "" Doesi t apply only to current year's profits? [3.16] -The effect of the sub-clause is to exclude all distributions in the shape of bonus shares, with one exception; that is, we will uot allow a company to take advantage of the provision with regard to bonus shares to evade all taxation on its profits. We allow exemption in respect of bonus shares provided the income has been brought to account as nondistributable and the company's flat Tate of tax has been paid on it. Once the income has been brought to account, and the tax has been paid, then bonus shares may be issued. All that the clause does is to see that a dishonest company does not take advantage of the provision with regard to bonus shares, and avoid taxation by capitalizing and issuing its profits in the form of bonus shares. thc revenue? 1 move That the following new paragraph be inserted after paragraph (b) :"" (bb) for the purposes of computing profits, perishable products or live stock shall not be taken into account until realized upon "". I do not desire to traverse all the arguments that havo been placed before the I Committee, because there already has been much discussion on this measure. 1 I do wish, however, to reply to some the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce). The whole ber in connection with the taxation of live stock is the argument of the dealer as against the breeder. He has told us that thore are two distinct schools of thought in connection with livestock and the natural increase; and there are simply because there are two distinct types of men on the land. tion I was referring to. breeder, who is the mainstay and the backbone of the industry, and there is the dealer. To the dealer the natural increase is of no moment; he buys in the I have read it cheapest market, aggregates his stock, and sells it in large numbers in the dearest market. Naturally he does not care in the least whether or not the natural increase is taken into account; his whole concern is as to how he buys and sells, and he has no interest in the other phase of the matter, and he naturally advocates that system of taxation which he thinks best ""suits his book."" But the breeder is the man responsible for the upkeep of the whole industry. Very often, under present conditions, he pays tax on what he has never realized on, and ho never gets a refund of tax paid in connection with stock lost. I admits that the Treasurer is correct when he says that the breeder balances this to a certain extent in his subsequent returns; but he has paid on what he has never realized. He is out of pocket, and often has to pay higher rates than he would if he had been allowed to pay on a cash basis. operates the other way, and the dealer is the man in whose favour it operates",35,Administration The Income Of Any Society Or Associa

Some time ago, beby O'Mullane"" on the sale of his settlement fore the present Treasurer took office, I lease, and is arrived at by deducting £2,770, submitted a case to his predecessor ( Sir representing Joseph Cook). That case I now desire Thc tax in respect of this .amount which is to place before the present Treasurer in now claimed is £1,597 14s. order to show what hardship is inflicted on many men who are developing Ausin 1919, not 'because he was tired of work, but tralia.

'If, however, a as amended by section 8 of the Act No. 18 of man has a leasehold in the back country, 1918, and it is on the strength of this conThe man who is only a dealer positionThe facts are that O'Mullane after numerous for settlement lease No 1911/1 of ' 5,739 acres situate in the parish of Benbarba, it on, and at the time of selection was infested with prickly pear, and, altomanaged to improve the place very conduring the first six years of his residence, during which time he borrowed In about 1917 few stock to pay off the 10 per cent, mortand effect some further improvements to heavily improve the place, and on the 24th May, 1919, he sold the said settleto the purchaser, and by him mortgaged back to secure half of the purchase money, rebalance being paid to his mortgagees. has now been assessed by the Deputy the value of the improvements from the total purchase moneys, viz., £8,608. We might say that O'Mullane sold this land he strained his heart working on the property, and had to sell it, because prickly Now, the Taxation Commissioner contends meaning of sub-section (D) of section 14 of Income Tax Assessment Act 1915 to 1918, struction of the section: in question -that the assessment iu question has been made -So far as we arc iiwarc, there is no section in thc Federal Income Tax Acts to provide the profits on the sale of real estate shall be deemed to be income, although such a provision has been specially made in regard to State income tax for this State. In any case, however, the said Act provides that thc profit on the sale of real estate was only applied where the real estate has been sold within five years of its acquisition, that is to say, is designed purely to make the income of land speculators liable to income tax. There is not, however, any like provision in the Federal Income Tax Acts, and if it had been the intention of the Federal Legislature to make the profits on thc .sale of real estate taxable as income, we submit that a special clause to that effect would have been inserted in the Federal Acts. Howevet, there is no such section in the Federal Acts, and, consequently, a man may deal with hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of freehold or secured land (as opposed to leased lands), aud, no matter what profit is made on those dealings, he is not liable to pay Federal income tax in respect of the protit. For these reasons, it seems to us monstrous to think that the Legislature ever intended to treat thc proiits of the small selector as income while letting tbe dealer, whether small or large, in freeholds or secured tenures, go scot free. honourable member for Balaclava, I may mention that this communication is from, a firm of lawyers of very high repute, and I know fro m experience that what that firm says is very often true. The letter proceeds' Following out the above reasoning, the most peculiar anomaly about this particular case is that if O'Mullane had converted his settlement lease (as 'he had a right to do under section 184, et seq., of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913) into 'conditionally-purchased lands prior to selling to Lyons, then he could not have been called upon to pay one shilling income tax, because, in case of such conversion, he would have then been a selector of conditionally-purchased lands instead of a selector of settlement lease lands, although the land would have still been the same, and his' I do not wish to labour this matter, or profit the same. Gould such a position as to repeat what has been already said; but that ever have heen intended by thc Legislature? Wc think not. I because I happen to know the venwidespread. The statement of the Treador and the purchaser, and because surer, that under the Act this method is the former placed the facts before the only one possible, may be correct; but me some two years ago. mitted them to the ex-Treasurer ( Sir assessment of natural increase on a cash Joseph Cook), but this man has received sales basis. The Australian climate is no relief. The present Treasurer will notoriously fickle. We have periods of agree that the man is placed in a manigood years followed by periods of bad festly unfair position. He went on to a years. A stock-owner may havo a largo property which was useless-practicall y worthless-and at the end of five years' work, he sold for £8,608. He had borrowed something over £2,000, and his improvements cost him about £3,000; so that at thea finish he actually drew only £2,018for eight years' hard work, showing an income of only about £250 a year. Yet he is called upon by the Commissioner to pay taxation amounting to £1,597 14s. on the £2,018. That is the sort of thing that is operating under the present income tax law, and I see nothing in the Bill before us that will do away with these anomalies and difficulties. We ought to provide that when a man takes up a leasehold, improves it , and _ sells it, he should not be called upon to pay tax on the profit of the sale, or, at any rate, he should not be called upon to pay on the profit of the sale as one year's income; the taxation should at least be spread over the years he has spent in developing the property. In a case such as that to which I have just referred, a mau cannot expect to earn from the land anything more than He does pay, though. will just keep him going; and when he comes to sell, it is grossly unfair to treat the pr>fit of the sale as income earned in the year of the sale, and, therefore, taxable. Then, again, however right it may be in theory, the method of assessing and taxing natural increase works harshly in practice. If the Department would wait until the producer had realized on that natural increase, the latter would be in a position to pay. I know from experience the gross injustice of the present practice. Of the iniquities of our taxation law, it is the greatest, and it is having the effect of driving men off the land. I would impress on the Committee that dissatisfaction with the present method have quoted this case at length, of assessing natural increase assets is I then subthe Act should be amended to allow of the",36,Administration The Income Of Any Society Or Associa

But he is taxed on it just when it is of least value to him, and when it is least convenient for him to pay taxation. The term "" capacity to pay "" has been used a great deal, but this is a case of incapacitv to pav. Primary products are largely perishable, and the method of assessing natural increase which is distinctly perishable should be altered. It able member for Robertson spoke also of is true, as the Treasurer has said, that an allowance is subsequently made, but that allowance is insufficient. Although the man on the land pays taxation ou the natural increase of his land, he does not get back a cent of what ihe has paid. Furthermore, no allowance is made to him on account of the interest which he may have been charged on money borrowed to pay the tax. I do not think it would be of much good to ask the present Treasurer for consideration in regard to this interest, but I hope that the amendment providing, for an alteration of the method of assessing the value of primary produce will be supported, not only by the representatives of the primary producers in this House, but also by members representing city constituencies. They should do this as a matter of justice. The present system is undoubtedly unjust, and although I have listened attentively to the speeches of those who have spoken during the debate, and particularly to that of the Treasurer, I have not heard any argument against the proposed alteration of the law. We have had no clear statement why the alteration should not be made. The Treasurer, or some other opponent of the amendment, should put before us some definite objection to it. [3.371 I have srioken at some length on I am not able to deal with the question as the proposal to take a cash basis for a whole, T am not prepared to deal with assessing certain classes of property for it piecemeal by considering cases which, income tax, and I do not propose to reto my mind, are not so urgent as those ? eat what I have said on the subject, but connected with the transfer of big developwish to correct what I consider to be a TOTfitfltell l&SLSQS wrong impression left in the minds of the Committee by the hono.able member for I am pleased at the evidence of the Robertson ( Mr Fleming), who drew a death-bed repentance of the members of distinction between the breeders and the the Country party afforded by the submisdealers.

The honorthe taxation of premiums paid for the transfer of leases. When a premium is paid for the transfer of an ordinary city lease or the like, it is, I think, acknowledged that it should be assessed for income taxation. But difficulty arises in respect of transfers of developmental leases by men who are doing pioneer work. The most difficult classes of leases to deal with in this connection are Crown leases. Income taxation in respect of those leases is wrapped up almost inextricably with land taxation. I have devoted a good deal of attention to this very difficult matter, which has defied the wits and efforts of every Treasurer since 1915. A Royal Commission made certain recommendations about it , but no action was taken by the Treasurer of the day upon them. The subject has now been referred to a Taxation Commissi an, and I had hoped to have their views on it , so that some provision to deal with these leases might be embodied in the Bill. But, unfortunately, the Commission has not yet made a recommendation, and until I know its views, I do not feel able to deal with the whole question. It is a question which must be dealt with equitably, and care must be taken not to interfere unnecessarily with those who are doing developmental work in the back country.

260,Mr Watt,"If the honourable member, of the honourable member for iSwan has not been iput from the Chair. are two schools of thought amongst stock-owners as to whether the basis of valuation should be cash OT a fixed value, and I think the amendment I shall p-onose would meet the requirements of all stockraisers, as well as the fruit-growers, farmers, and other men engaged in primary production. I move That after sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph * (b) the following paragraph be inserted :""{be) It sliall be optional whether natural increase be taken into account at fixed value or when realized upon/' [4.2] -This question has b-.u discussed at very great length, and we have heard the views of honourable members upon two different systems of arriving at a basis for assessment of primary producers. The basis that is proposed in the Bill requires that natural increase of stock shall be brought to account at the end of every period. That system is in accordance with the general basis for assessment for income tax for every class of taxpayers in the community. If the compelling of primary producers to bring their live stock to account every year placed upon them a burden of taxation which was not placed upon other people, we would require to carefully consider whether we should not provide for alternative systems. But the proposal in the Bill does not place the primary producer in an unfair position as compared with the rest of the community. Under the amended proposal, he mav value his natural increase of stock at any figure between the minimum and the maximum prescribed. He may bring it to account at whatever figure he thinks reasonable and proper. If he brings it to account at the maximum figure his income tax will be increased in that year, but the amount of taxation he will pay on subsequent realization will be reduced. If , on the other hand, he brings the stock to account at a low figure, he will pay a small taxation in the first year of assessment and heavier taxation when the stock is realized. Wo have been told that the primary producer may never realize upou the stock which he has to bring to account, but a great number of other people in the community never realize upon assets which they bring to account, and upon which they are taxed. Practically every trader in the community during the last few years has paid income tax on assets brought to account as if he had a very large income; but when those assets were realized they did not have the value which was placed upon them when first brought to account, and the owner has made a substantial loss in respect of them. ducers bear the loss of depreciation in addition to dead loss. engaged in primary production or trade, are in the same position. The value of the stock decreases, but the owner has been taxed upon an assumed income, arrived at by placing a valuation upon the assets. When the assets are realized it is found that certain income taxation in respect of them should not have been paid. The averaging system has been introduced for the purpose of trying to minimize the effects of a disaster of that kind, and it will aid the primary producer as much as anybody else. Unless the primary producer is asked to bring his assets to account in a way which unfairly differentiates between him and other taxpayers, there is no reason why we should have two bases for arriving at income tax liability for different classes in the community. We must either insist that assets be brought to account at valuation in determining what the profits are or take the cash basis, levying income tax only upon the actual surplus of revenue over outgoings. Already our system of assessment is complicated, and many honourable members do not hesitate to unfavorably contrast the cost of taxation collection with the cost of collection by other authorities. If the proposal to provide optional bases of bringing stock to account were adopted another complication would be introduced, and there would be an enormous increase in administrative costs. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment. I hope the honourable member will not press it , and that the Committee will agree to the one basis for assessment, which I suggest is reasonable for all classes. The Treasurer stated that the positions of primary producers and manufacturers, in regard to unrealized assets, were parallel. I was surprised to hear such an",41,Paibs

If the Committee assents a depreciation of assets, but, in addition to that depreciation, the stock^raiser suffers a total disappearance of his assets through drcumslances entirely beyond his control. [4.11] We have been told that the stock-owners are taxed on assets that may never be realized-that the stock may die, or tha crops be ruined by the elements. To a city dweller such taxation seems unfair. I have heard the same complaint for years, and have never heard from any Treasurer a satisfactory refutation or solution of it . I desire to vote fairly upon the amendment, and I seek some enlightenment. Treasurer say that the reason for not agreeing tb the proposal put forward by the Country party is that the farmer could easily falsify his accounts if he were not compelled to take into account all his stock? What are the reasons for not 'acceding to what seems to be a very fair request? I do not think that the Government should levy taxation upon an income that is never enjoyed. I voted last time against the Government because I regard it as our duty to defeat the Government whenever we get the chance. But one likes to know the merits of a case. For their own sake, the Government might expkin why they insist upon taxing people upon assets which have not been realized. honourable member for Melbourne Ports is evidently in dire distress, and needs a helping hand. The Government should immediately respond to his appeal, and explain why the system of valuing stock was first introduced into income taxation. Before proceeding to discuss that matter, I ask for consideration of the method of proposing the amendment now before the Committee. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) has proposed to introduce matters relating to the valuation of live stock after sub-paragraph iii of paragraph 6. nothing whatever to do with live stock. It deals with company propositions. Its first sub-paragraph deals with dividends, bonuses, or profits; its second with bonus shares, and its third with tbe interest paid to debenture-holders. Paragraph a, which we have passed, deals with the valuation of live stock, and sets out that the valuation must be as prescribed for to the proposition submitted by the honourable member it will make the Bill a rare joke, since we shall have in a sub-clause dealing with bonus shares and debentures a reference to live stock. if .agreed to, would be particularly governed by paragraph 6. which it is proposed to insert the amendment has nothing whatever to do with the primary producer as an individual. Whatever benefit there is in the honourable member's remedial proposition would apply only to a member of a company. Will the interested in natural increases. ber for Robertson is endeavouring to deal with the whole problem of the man on the land, and it is only here"" and there that we have companies dealing with such matters. The primary producer is an individualist who likes to have his own land and his own stock. another paddock, so far as this amendment is concerned. run in another paddock where there is more grass for it . Apart altogether from the merits of the honourable member's amendment, it seems to me that he has moved to insert it in a most awkward and unfortunate part of the clause. To insert it at the point proposed by him would be to demonstrate the principle, but not to produce any effect. The Treasurer is not obliged to find a way out of the forest for wandering members, and the honourable member for Robertson knows his way about sufficiently well to be able to find in the Bill the proper place for an amendment of this kind. May I now refer briefly to the merits of the amendment, and deal with it on lines somewhat different from those adopted by the Treasurer. An ordinary trader in his income tax schedule has to Paragraph 6 has bring into account the stock 'with which his year started, and the stock with which his year closed. Those two factors govern, in some cases, mightily, and always, to some extent, the question of whether or not he has made a profit, and is assessable for income tax purposes. That goes without argument. The law must contain",42,Paibs

274,Mr Watt,"The amendment ought tosuch, a provision. If it did not, and if a man could' start with stock to the value of £1,000 at the beginning of the year, and finish thc year with £5,000 worth of stock, without accounting in any way for the visible improvement in his stock to the extent of £4,000, the law would be faulty. And go we say that every trader, whether he is a manufacturer, an importer, or an exporter, must account for the stock with which he starts his year, the stock with which he finishes his year, and all the other factors that go to make up the assessable amount for the year. If he does not take stock at the beginning and the end of the year, it is impossible to say what profit he has made. The primary producer, whether: he is a fanner growing potatoes or grain, or whether he has live stock that has increased in number by purchase or by natural increase, has to do exactly the same thing. The whole object of making such a provision was to put on an equal footing all income taxpayers, whether they handle live stock or trading stock. The onus of proof must rest always on the man or the class of men who seek exemption from that requirement, which, to my mind, is the fairest requirement of any system of direct taxation levied on income. It is true that under the old system with which we are all familiar, a great deal of hardship was sometimes inflicted upon certain classes of our live-stock owners because the valuation was -an extremely high figure, and if an increase, let us say, upon. Without some such valuation we of 50 calves or 100 lambs were registered in a given schedule, and those animals died, the owner had to pay income tax in respect of them as if they had lived on and increased in value. He got no refund if they died. tremely difficult for the State to say it was dealing fairly with these men. But after this matter has been analyzed most carefully and impartially by the Royal Commission, and analyzed, I think, to finality, the Treasurer now comes along and says, "" Very well, we will give holders of live stock no exemption from bringing their stock into account at the end of the year, but we will give them the fairest possible basis of valuation at which we ean arrive. They may adopt any one of three courses which have been devised."" They may make their own valuation. be one-fourth of the maximum.

If it were 10s. the owner could take the value of his lambs at 2s. 6d. per head at the beginning and end of the year, and from year to year the man who did that would be treated as fairly as the State could possibly treat an income taxpayer who dealt in or bred live stock. finalized; but it is proposed so far as lambs are concerned that the minimum (shall be 2s.

The Treasurer said that apart from the three alternatives there is another outside course which can be pursued theoretically, and that is the course of not bringing such stock into account until it has been sold or, in other words, working on a cash basis. If that course is to be adopted in respect of live stock why should it not be followed in regard to everything else? case of a big continental merchant, who starts a year with £500,000 worth of stock, and closes it with £750,000, but shows no profit except what has passed into his stock. Such a man might say to the Commissioner, "" I have made no profit, and will not have any until I realize."" die. this stage.

Put it that way. is suggesting the cash basis. If we say that receipts and outgoings shall be the only matters of which the income tax law shall take cognisance, then we scrap this Bill. If we did that, we should absolutely scrap practically every clause of the Bill, and would say "" Henceforth we will not deal with the ledger, but only with the cash book of the taxpayer."" system. ber applied his clairvoyant "" X "" ray mind to this problem, he would probably come to another conclusion. scribing my mind. doubts my description; I doubt it myself. I shall withdraw the words "" X ray"". Honourable members must recognise that if we were to take into account only receipts and outgoings, then all the vast increases of wealth that are occurring in the producing, mercantile, and manufacturing interests would not be brought into account until they had been turned over and the profits registered by actual payments. The income tax system provides differently. It provides, in effect, that in each year, from 1st July to 30th June, we shall bring into account the whole trading of the nation, and that whatever profits are made by people whose incomes are above a certain figure must be rendered in the schedules for that year. In ascertaining the profits made by them in that year, we take into account the increases in the value of the things they bought and still hold. Although the}' may not»have realized on them, and although it is doubtful whether they will ,get the full price they expect to obtain for them., they have to bring them into account on the stock-taking valuation. I would not tear up the income tax law by putting everything on a cash basis. I prefer to keep all taxpayers on the same basis, unless hardship amounting to injury can be shown in respect of the owners of live stock. The Treasurer has endeavoured to meet the irksomeness of the past system and the injustice of it, if* it did work injustice, and I think his proposition deserves a trial. If it is given a trial, the live stock owners of Australia will, I think, appreciate it, and will not ask for a change. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has dealt",44,Paibs

Whether he said it in this House or not, he has said elsewhere that if you were to ask the stock-owners whether they would go on the cash basis, not one in twenty would accept the suggestion. dred ! would. for Darwin( Mr Bell) speaks for the southern part of Australia, while the honourable member for Maranoa speaks for the wide areas of Northern Queensland ; and here we have the clash to which the Treasurer referred. point, that nrobably in dealing on a cash basis, in both casesj more income tax would have to be paid, shrewd Queensland men whom the honourable member for Hunter represents, and who are anxious to pay as little taxation as possible, would sooner have that kind of option. I think that broadly on principle, and from the stand-point of expediency, it is proper to reject the amendment, and keep to the principles of the Bil l and the alternatives to be prescribed by the Government later. spoke on this subject yesterday, and I haye no desire to repeat myself. thing I did say yesterday-that the Treasurer should give people the option. I know from practical experience that if they exercise the option they will only have themselves to blame,, and will be very sorry afterwards. A t the same time bhey have been crying out for something they have uot got, and they will not be satisfied i m t i l they get it , no matter how sorry they may subsequently be.. Many points have been touched on, and I should like to refer to what it costs to produce a beast. We were told that cattle were to bo taken at a valuation of from 10s. to £ 2 . Every business man likes to take stock at least at. what the stock cost; if we reckon .a beast at the very least, to cost 16s. a year to produce, in four years there has to be calculated four times 16s. A t the end of three years there has been three times 16s. spent, and the beast may be sold for £10, but the profit is not £ 1 0 , but only £ 1 0 less £ 2 8s., or £ 7 12s. If a cash basis'be adopted, a tax has to be paid on the entire amount of £ 1 0 , and there is no escape. On a cash basis the only debits are purchases and the sales are credits; and I can give an instance where a man would make a huge loss, and yet have to pay on a huge credit. In the boom in Queensland a few years ago, No t one in three huna man may have paid £10,000 for cattle in A p r i l ; and we must rememI venture to say they ber that in the first year he has a debit of £10,000. In the following A p r i l he may have had no rain for nine months, and he sells £10,000 woTth of cattle for £5,000. Although he has made the huge loss of £5,000, he w ill , on a cash basis, have to pay income t a x ' on a profit of £5,000. In the case of a man who does not deal, there is an advantage. If we take the price of cattle at £ 8 , he would, on a cash basis, have to pay on a profit of £ 8 per head, whereas on the' other basis, the first year he would pay on £ 3 a head, but in the following year only on the difference, that is, £ 5 per head. W it h a graduated scheme, it is much better to pay two income taxes, one on, say, £3,000, and another on £5,000, than one income tax on £8,000. over that. a professional point of view, and I -cannot vote contrary to the way in which I I advise my clients. Out of 300 clients on my books, there is only one who adopted One the other method, and he has' suffered accordingly. There are men wham you cannot convince of the injustice that is being done to themselves. From the point of view of the income tax authorities it would be a great convenience if there was' not this stock schedule at the end of the income tax return, for it takes up a tremendous amount of time in its checking. That is the reason, I suppose, that there are so many men like myself malting a living, because people find the preparation of the schedule so difficult. It cannot be said that in his proposal the Treasurer is shirking work in this regard; but, as I have said, people axe continually crying out, and I should advise giving them the option, with an intimation that they can neverchange. I think that if that were done we should in two or three years find them asking for an amendment »of the Act.

It is certainly extremely hard that such men should be penalized. But at the present time large areas in the western district of New South Wales and iu the south-western district of Queensland are going to ruin because men are not prepared to expend years of effort there only to lose the results of their labours in taxation. Every year prickly pear is.spreading over thousands of acres in New South Wales and in Queensland. country is increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 acres per annum. pear-infested country, and I know that , it will be brought into use again only by the offer of substantial rewards. I have known such country to cost £24 an acre to clear,, and then not prove worththe expenditure. South Wales and in Queensland ia worth £3 or £4 an acre when cleared, and other country is. worth from £2 to £3 an acre-, but, without, the offer of incentives, men will not be got to take up. that land. It would not pay any man to hire others to clear it. To use it profitably, a man must clear it with his ownlabour; putting in years of solid work in the hope that, at the end,, he: may have made an asset sufficiently valuabletokeep him. No. one who has not seen, the prickly pear country can realize how fast the pest is destroying our land. Twenty-five years ago I rodethrough much of. the country t now covered^ with pear. Hundreds of thousandsof acres of' that land were then as good sheep country as ever there was in Australia; but to-day most of it is useless. I implore the Treasurer to do something to reduce the hardships of those who take up country like this. Weshould give men real inducements to bring back land to a productive condition. [4.54] I have very great sympathy with the pioneers of this country, but', as I said earlier in the afternoon, this matter cannot be dealt, with piecemeal. It has, to be dealt with on a broad basis, and in as manner that will give absolutely fair treatment to those who are developing the land: I cannot deal with it now, because I have not yet the necessary information.

I know that it -is 'almost impossible to make 'an alteration without recasting the whole of the 'clause, TbutI should like the Treaquired direction of placing taxation tin surer to give me the assurance that he will have a clause prepared for consideration on the recommittal of this Bill so that we may have a vote upon the question before the Bill finally leaves the Committee stage. We are not asking for anything unreasonable. It is impossible for the Treasurer, or any other man who has not seen the prickly-pear country, to realize w,hat .an amendment would mean ,tp the men who are .attempting to keep back the ravages of a pest which accounts for the loss of 1,000,000 acres of productive land every year. iframes an amendment later on, he knows as well as I do that steps can be taken elsewhere to have the matter ventilated. It is hardily fair for him to ask me to deal with it now when we all know -that this Bill must go through. For weeks past, honourable members have been aware that the Bill was coming forward. A t any rate, if the honourable member has not an amendment prepared, he might take *he 'ordinary step vof .having it dealt with -elsewhere -without asking ane to recommit --the clause for the purpose Treasurer .expresses his intention of supporting a Teasonable amendment !in ithis direction.

337,Mr Bowden,"There are some as' sold out for £15,000. The Income Tax Office brought into one year's account the whole of that £15,000 as income. The only deduction .they allowed in connection with his lease was half of the premium he had paid. They said that as five, years of the 10 years' lease he had acquired foT £3,000 had gone they would allow £1,500 fo represent the value of the premium for ihe unexpired period of the lease he had not utilized. Thus, they deducted £1,500 from the £15,000, at which the hotel keeper sold out, and they regarded the balance as the premium received by him for a 'five years' lease of the premises. They cut out the good-will altogether. The asset really purchased was the goodwill of that property, and was not the fact that the purchaser would still have a five years' lease to run. It was ridicuthe good-will of some businesses as an lous for the Taxation Commissioner fo contend that any one would pay £15,000 for a five years' lease, as compared 'with a sum of £3,000 which had been paid five years previously for a ten yoars' lease of the same premises, unless, of course, in the meantime the value of the good-will of the property had materially increased. The Department adopt the policy of allowing good-will to be taken into account in all businesses other than hotels. as accretion of capital. cover not only the hotel keeper, but also the ""grocer and softgoodsman, this little word "" tangible "" has now been inserted in the Bill, putting out of court altogether any question of the good-will of a business being taken into account. It is quite an easy matter to ascertain the good-will of any business. The usual practice in Melbourne and Sydney is to estimate it at three years' profits. To cut out all consideration paid for sueh good-will in respect of all transfersand sales of businesses is totally unfair, and really amounts to levying a tax on an accretion of capital. The working of the old provision was hard enough, but the insertion of the word "" tangible "" will make a very big alteration in regard to the manner in which the Taxation Department will administer this clause in future. Therefore, I ask the Committee to agree to my amendment, and leave it out. I support the amendment moved by the den). To those of us who have taken an interest in the incidence of income taxation, it is apparent that if the clause is not amended as desired, the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation will be that good-will must be taxed in any circumstances as a profit, and in the year in which it is paid. Any person who has had the benefit of securing an accretion of good-will over a number of years must realize that whatever increase of his capital is due to the sale of such good-will is really, and in truth, what I have said it is, namely, an increase of capital, and not income whioh is taxable under the Act. It has been said that the Commissioner treats different businesses in different ways. That is to say, he treats accretion of capital, and in other cases he regards it as income derived during the year of payment. The clause goes on to specifically omit good-will in mining businesses, and the good-will of a business that is converted into shares, and I think that if the word "" tangible "" were omitted it would give a little fairer play to many cases deserving of consideration. After all, in certain circumstances the good-will of a business may mean everything in the world to an owner. It may mean a small competence to him. Its investment may enable him to live in comfort after thirty or forty years of work, and I do think that the opinion of the Commissioner should be further narrowed, by the insertion of the word "" tangible."" Goodness knows, we give him discretion enough. Of all the Commonwealth public servants the Commissioner of Taxation has the greatest power, and I do not wish that power further increased by the inclusion of the word "" tangible."" [5.16] -The word "" tangible "" has been inserted because every sale of the lease of a hotel premises has exemption from taxation on the ground that it is a sale of good-will only, whilst sales of pastoral and other leases to which no good-will is attached do not get that exemption. It is considered that the payment is in respect of the future and anticipated profits over a certain number of years, and the purchaser is entitled to amortize the price he has paid for those profits. If he can do that and no taxation is to be paid by the vendor, the whole transaction",49,Pairs

If I accepted the amendment, that particular class of business would be removed completely from the area of taxation, whilst sales of other leases to which no good-will was attached would be taxable. Amendment negatived. toThat in paragraph (cl), sub-paragraph (ii), the words "" in the opinion of thc Commissioner "" be omitted. move That in the proviso to paragraph (d) the words "" the Commissioner is satisfied that"" be omitted. The sale, transfer, or assignment, of a lease is a fact that can be ascertained, and the Commissioner's satisfaction should not be involved in a question of fact. The less responsibilities we throw upon the Commissioner the better for him and the community at large. [5.22] -The honourable member for Swan is a little unreasonable in proposing this amendment, because the discretion which is thrown upon the Commissioner by the proviso as printect must be thrown upon somebody, namely, to determine whether the lease has been sold, assigned, or transferred "" to a bond fide prospector, or by a person, partnership, syndicate, or company who or which does not make a business of buying and selling mining properties, &c."" If the discretion given to the Commissioner were struck out the proviso would be meaningless. If u l ly share the general feeling against discretion being left to the Commissioner where that can be avoided, not because I have any doubt as to his ability or fairness, but because I am totally opposed to Acts of Parliament throwing upon some official the responsibility to determine questions. But in regard to the matter with which the proviso deals it is essential that somebody shall determine certain facts. Amendment negatived. Clause further amended verbally, and agreed to. Clauses 17 to 20 agreed to.

Many companies do not declare dividends in the same year as that in which they have been earned. The dividend is declared at the annual meeting, and is distributed in the year following that in -which it was earned. [5.28] -The clause is intended to provide what the honourable member has suggested, and if he will withdraw his amendment I shall have the drafting of the clause examined. If it does not mean that a company which made its distribution in the ordinary way after its accounts were made up, and the annual meeting was held, would be on perfectly safe ground, I shall have an amendment proposed in another place. suggestion. I think he might also consider the addition of the words "" for such year "" after the word "" company "" in the last line of sub-clause 1. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. the Treasurer agree to make a concession to co-operative companies under, this clause similar to that which was agreed to by the Committee yesterday? Take the case of a co-operative company which sells goods to its own members, and, possibly, to others, and makes a profit of, say, £500 on the transactions of the year. It does not distribute that £500 amongst any of its shareholders, but retains it as a trading asset. It takes the prolit, in a sense, into its reserves, and it really becomes capital, because the company finds it nocessary for the purposes of its trade to have a larger capital. If that £500 were taxed as profits, it would be very hard on such a company. It seems to me that it would not secure the benefit that would go to other companies under this clause, where two-thirds of the profits are",50,Pairs

In the case of the company to which I have referred, none of the profits would be distributed. required only if the Commissioner so 'determines, and there is a right of appeal to the Appeal Board. There is no possibility of a co-operative company which deals, with its money in the way suggested by the honourable member being taxed. If it were it would have the right of appeal. I was seeking from the Treasurer, and I -am very glad to have it. I was afraid that under this clause a small profit of £400 or £500 made by a company, such as I have mentioned, and' not distributed by it, might be taxed. need not have the slightest apprehension -as to that. It should not be within the province of the Commissioner to delay coming to a conclusion in respect of the matter dealt with in sub-clause 1. I suggest to the Treasurer that he add the words, "" Provided that any determination by the Commissioner shall be made not later than six months orable member? I ^have circulated an .amendment very much on those lines. the Treasurer amend sub-clause 1 by substituting "" one-half "" for "" two-thirds "", or give us some other modification of the provision? I think it would be for the ;goed of the country in many cases if more -could be distributed. [5.36] I knowfairly well the facts which the honourable member has in mind in proposing that this amount should be reduced, but I am afraid I cannot see my way to accept the proposal that "" 50 per cent."" should be substituted for the words "" two-thirds."" The main difficulty is that no distinction is made between companies. A small private company of two individuals is just as much a company as is a great joint-stock enterprise. In the case of any large joint-stock enterprise, I do not think the honourable member need have the slightest fear that anything in excess of 50 per cent, is likely to be levied on. But in respect of some H3m.aU -com> panies we have to safeguard ourselves, and to see that unscrupulous people do not make use of this provision to attempt to defraud the revenue and to avoid their proper obligations. In view of that fact, I cannot consent to reduce the amount of 66$ per cent, that is fixed in the Bill, and to take out of the purview of the Commissioner altogether any one who distributes a less amount. I can assure the honourable member, however, that there is no intention of hounding people and preventing them from creating proper reserves to promote the stability and future expansion of their businesses. Having in mind the difficulty that the honourable member feels, and v the fact that there is a very great distinction in many cases between taxable and distributable income, I propose .later on to move an amendment which will make one of the specific facts that have to be taken into consideration in the determination of whether or ,not a proper distribution has been made, the relationship between distributable and taxable income. Provided that full consideration is given to that point, I do not think that many people in the community will take exception to the provision .regaining at 66| per cent, and not 50 per cent. I think that many have grave apprehensions in regard to the provision as to 66$ per cent, of the taxable income if the relationship of taxable and distributable income is not borne in mind. not an arbitrary distribution. company has distributed that amount there cannot even be an inquiry as to whether it is sufficient or insufficient. be compelled in any circumstances to distribute more? distributed anything less than 66f per cent, the matter will be open to review; but there'is no certainty that such a company will be made to distribute more than it has done.

I submit this amendment for the reason that after the clause had been drafted certain doubts were expressed that if a 1 company distributed only 65 per cent., and so brought itself within the purview of the Commissioner's ""onsideration, the Commissioner might then be able to say that it should distribute 70 per cent., 80 per cent., or 90 per cent., whereas in the case of a company that had been sufficiently astute to distribute exactly 66f per cent, no further action could be taken. I am proposing to insert these words merely to indicate that the power of the -Commissioner to order a distribution is limited to the same amount as would have taken the company wholly out of his consideration. Amendment agreed to. [ 5 . 4 2 ] That the following words be added to subclause (1) :"" Such determination in the case of any financial year prior to that beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, to be madenot later than the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and in the case of other financial years within six months after the date of the issue to the company of its ordinary assessment."" This amendment is very much on the lines of that which the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) was suggesting when I interrupted h i m a few minutes ago. These words are being in serted so as to give finality w i th regard to all previous years. The matter of the distribution, so f a r as previous years are concerned, has to be determined during the current financial year. Forf u t u r e years it w ill have to be determined w it h in six mouths of the issue of the assessment to the company. I think that that Would the honourable will give a measure of finality, which is very necessary in connection with the. penal, clause of this character.

MT . WAT T (Balaclava) [5.44] -The spirit of this amendment .appears to be perfectly right, but it is difficult to say precisely what its effect w ill be if it is unsympathetically interpreted.

The Treasurer might at some subsequent stage of the B ill , here or elsewhere, make this a littl e more definite. The honorablo gentleman w ill understand precisely what I mean. I do not wish to make the task of the Commissioner harder, but I desire that certainty which he aims .at as the result of the amendments to the clause. If , on consideration, the honourable gentleman can do this, he will clear up a matter which is very important to the trading community. consideration.

371,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Treasurer )Act 1918, any part of the income of a company not actually distributed has been deemed to be distributed to any member or shareholder of thc company, his taxable income shall be reduced(a) by one-third of the total amount of the income of the company actually distributed to him and of the income of the company so deemed to be distributed to him; or (6) by the amount of tlie income of the company so deemed to be distributed to him, -whichever is the leas; uud the Commissioner shall refund to (him the tax overpaid. The difficulty with, regard to this clause I indicated in my second-reading speech. Certain people have been assessed under what is known as the old section 16 (2), and there are others who have not yet been assessed, but whose oases are under consideration. Under section 16 (2) the Commissioner had no option, if he determined that sufficient had not been distributed, but to say thab the whole 100 per cent, of the profits must be distributed-mus t be deemed to have been distributed, and the shareholders must pay tax on their proportion. The difficulty we were faced with was that if the cases not yet finalized were to be dealt with under the new B ill , then, in justice, the old cases would have to be reopened and tieated in the same way. To get over the difficulty of reopening the cases, reconsidering them and making a new determination, which would have beeu a very laborious task, to say the least, I propose this amendment, the purpose of which is to administer what is reasonable, even if it be somewhat rough, justice. It is proposed in all cases that have been dealt with, instead of the f u l l 100 per cent, which has been required to be distributed, 63§ per cent, should be su.bsti= tuted. dividual taxpayer? taxpayer is concerned, who was assessed in regard to the amount that it was found should have been distributed, he will get a. refund of what he has overpaid. But whereas formerly 100 per . cent, was deemed to have been distributed, it will now be 66{j per cent. As to the cases which have not yet been settled, they will be determined under the provisions of this Bill. Does the Treasurer propose to give the shareholder any remedy against the company in cases where the tax has been collected from him instead of from the company ? from the shareholder, under the old Act . The shareholder is the man who w ill get relief. back one-third of the amount he paid, and as to the remaining two-thirds must take his own action, for, so far as I see, no remedy is provided in the B ill . I s there any power given to get from the company the tax that has been paid by the shareholder? assessments not yet paid will be a charge against the company, and not against the shareholder. Amendment agreed to. [5.51] I move That the following words be added to new sub-clause (C) just added-""and the company shall repay to .the Commissioner the tax previously refunded to it or dealt with as it directed in respect of the total amount of income to 'be excluded from the assessments of the shareholders of the company under this sub-section."" The company will now have to pay back to the Commissioner the amount that was refunded to it at the time that the assessment was made on the individual. I think I can make the position clear in a few words. This unfortunate transaction took place in this way: The company had undistributed profits on which it had paid the company rate of tax. The Commissioner suddenly came in and said that these profits were no longer undistributed, but had been distributed, and he went to the taxpayer and got the tax from hi m at the appropriate rate. But the company And refunded to the inwas entitled to relief for what it had paid ; and the company having got relief, we are entitled to get our share of the money back into our hands. That is all the amendment does. It puts the position as it was before the company was deemed to have distributed this one-third. This matter appears a little complicated, but really it is very simple if honourable members take it quietly. Amendment agreed to.

But the word "" outgoing "" the amount so set apart for the year in which the income was derived shall, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, be the sum to be deducted for depreciation."" The adoption of the amendment w ill mean the restoration of the old provision regarding denreciation. The provision in the B ill was designed to liberalize the allowable deductions in respect of depreciation, and was the subject of most careful thought. It is only f a i r to mention that it was the Gommissio er who pressed for the liberalizing of the deductions allowed for denreciation. The provision was framed to deal w it h the obsolescence of assets generally; but many representations have been made to me about it , and the opinion generally expressed has been that if the basis now in (Flinders-Treasurer ) operation, which is clearly understood, were altered, it would greatly inconvenience many taxpayers. On the other hand, I have had no strong .representations in support of our new liberalizing provision. Therefore, at the request of a great number of taxpayers, .and to meet their convenience, I have moved to substitute the old basis of depreciation for the new. I agree with the Treasurer that from the sion now in the Jaw is, on the balance, an improvement on that proposed in the Bill. I agree, too, that manufacturers have become familiar with the practice (Flinders-Treasurer ) of the Commissioner in regard to depreI moveciation of plant and machinery. If the Commissioner desires to liberalize the deductions allowed for depreciation and wear and tear, he has now power to do so under the Act, which allows him a disSo far as m y experience of the working of the provision in regard to depreciation goes-and I have had many representations made to .me on the subject, particularly in the early years of the Act-the Commissioner errs on the mean side. I know that the maximum depreciation he allows .on machinery that can have a life of only ten years is 5 per cent, per annum., though, according to my arithmetic, it would require a generation at that rate to pay for it . As machinery is used more and more, and as so many developments have taken place in regard 'to it , I suggest, to the Treasurer that, in the interest of proficient manufacturing, the deductions allowable for depreciation should be",55,Pairs

392,(By Mr Watt) Agreed Manufacturer's Point Of View The Provi,"liberalized. . Our manufacturers should have no temptation to continue, inuse machinery practically obsolete. Every encouragement should be given to themto bring tbeir plant up'to date. Many firms -write off 10 per cent., and in some cases 1 15 per cent., on their machinery annually, and replace that machinery long before 1 it is worn out, because it is becoming obsolete. Yet the. Commissioner allows a deduction of only 5 per cent, in respect of it for depreciation. It may be argued that the cost of repairs can be deducted; but in view of the fact that it is constantly preached to us that progress in manufacturing is to be made, not by keeping' down wages, b ut by increasing the efficiencyof processes, this matter of depreciation should) receive more liberal treatment from the Commissioner. should like to know whether it would be possible to amend the provision whichi the Treasurer seeks to substitute for that in on tbe opinion of the Commissioner as the B ill . There is a general desire to include beasts of burden used in connection with businesses among the assets on which depreciation may be""allowed. Mr BE LT (Darwin) [ 6 : 8 ] going' to mention the matter spoken of by the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden). I would suggest the insertion after the words "" rolling stock "" of the word's "" animals used, as beasts of burdenand working beasts."" Those assetsaxe excluded in the previous clauseand , 1 should be included here. The value of beasts of burden obviously depreciates from year to year, and can be"" as easilyallowed for as the depreciation in the value of 'machinery [6.9] -I do notthink that I need reply to-the criticism of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten), because if the Commissioner has taken too narrow a view of the allowance which should be made for depreciation of machineryI do 'not admit that he has-ther e can be an appeal to an Appeal Board, and tbe result of such an appeal may be to obtain a more liberal allowance. cently been the opportunity of appeal. be taken as admitting, for one instant,, that the Commissioner has taken an unfair view.' As to th© point raised, by the honourable member for Nepean. ( Mr Bowden), it has been the practice of the Department to make an allowance for depreciation of tfae value of beasts of burden and working beasts. I suggest that he should allow me to look further into his proposal, w it h a view to giving propereffect to it . I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) that hitherto the Commissioner has taken a narrow view regarding the allowance to be made for depreciation of machinery. Manufacturers have not been allowed to deduct more than5 per cent, for depreciation of machinery. When speaking on the second reading of theB ill , I mentioned a case in point. The Minister thinks that the value of the machinery can be taken into consideration. But if he says, as he did by letter to me, that [6.7] I the law need not be amended' in order to give relief to a certain taxpayer, I can see no way out if the taxpayer is to rely to what is a reasonable amount to allow. Amendment agreed to. I was anxious to know why the deduction in respect to gifts to charitable institutions is limited to sums exceeding. £ 5 . I should imagine that, in many caseSj ten gifts of £ 1 each would, be more acceptable than one g if t of £ 5 . W ill the Treasurer explain why the limitation is made ? [6.17] -It would be almost impossible to. administer a provision which allowed, a l l gifts to be included in the deductionscapable of being claimed by taxpayers. I think the figure provided in the Act' (Flinders-Treasurer ) is very low, but I have l e f t it as I found it.

I should like to se© some extension or widening of the provision which, while not bringing about any considerable sacrifice of revenue, would invite generous donors to make the gifts to this or that charity without suffering the infliction of having to pay income tax upon them. In my personal experience the Commissioner's definition of this provision is extremely narrow. [6.22] I do not agree with the contention of the honourable member for Parraniatta, ( Mr Pratten) that this provision should be widened; in fact, this particular class of deduction is one that should not be extended in any way. The paragraph was first inserted in th© Act at ' ii. time of the war when w© were all burning with patriotic Tervour. Parliament was a little inclined to allow its sympathies to run away with it . But having found th© provision already made. I have not, on this occasion, suggested its deletiou. not think that it should be extended. deductions for gifts to charities purely. spent their income in a particular way, which I trust gives them every satisfaction, as it should, if it ds in the direction of income tax upon it . As the Treasurer of generous gifts to charitable causes, they are a little too inclined to think that the State should subsidize them for so doing. The other day a gentleman said .that he would give £25,000 to a particular institution, but he only proposed to burst into this generosity if he was freed from the payment of income tax. I looked up his case and found that the Commonwealth would be paying nearly half the gift. I have not the figures with me now, but, broadly speaking, if he had an income of £30,000 and kept £5,000 for himself, which ought to be adequate for any ordinary peison to live on, and if he gave away the remainder of his income in the direction indicated he would, on the figures' I worked out, have given about £14,000 and the Commonwealth would have given about £11,000. I have grave doubts as to whether people are entitled to be exempted from the payment of income tax in respect to gifts which one presumes are made willingly and with pleasure, and for which I understand a great reward is expected at a later period. A t any rate, it is a principle which should not be extended. The Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) is right in saying that this provision was inserted in the Aet in an emergency during the war. Previously, no exemption was allowed in respect of charitable gifts. (Flinders-Treasurer) wealth had no Income Tax Act. but I do not think that we would have inserted a provision of this kind if it had not been for the war. When' we passed the provision many organizations were collecting funds for war purposes, and in order to encourage gifts to those funds the provision was put in the Bill. accompanying it in respect of Repatriation Funds. push my view on the matter, but I think the time has arrived when we should However, I certainly do strike out this exemption. Many people do not include gifts to charitable bodies in their taxation returns, and I do not think that a man who makes a gift of a large sum of money to a charitable organization has any justification for expecting to be exempted from the payment has just pointed out, gifts could be made for the purpose of so reducing a man's income as to bring him to a lower rate of tax. I hope that there will be no extension of the principle. have come to the conclusion that a large number of people give gifts to charities for tbe sake of securing advertisement,, and I move That paragraph (h), sub-paragraph (ii), be left out.

With the exception of that allowed by the State of New South Wales, the deduction allowed by the Commonwealth is far more generous than that permitted under any of the State Acts. tion all owed in Great Britain? very different from our own. The '""Royal Commission recommended a deduction -of £30 for each child under, sixteen years of age. The recommendation was embodied in the .amending. Bill passed last December, and is included in .the measure now before us. I would remind' honourable members that, under this Bill, .something more has been done. The general exemption has been lifted from £156 to £200, so that a married .man's income is exempt up to £200 .and he is .allowed 'a deduction of £30 in respect of «ach child. This question of granting a larger deduction in respeot of children was considered very -arefully by the Government before they brought in the measure now before ue. It -was taken into account in connection with the proposal to increase the general exemption to £200. We gave full consideration to two proposals-(1 ) That the general exemption should remain where it was in respect of both , single and married men, and that ,an increase should be made in the deduction for children, or (2) that the general exemption should be raised. The decision of the Cabinet was in favour of raising .the .general exemption to £200. By raising it to £200 we have probably done very much more than would have been suggested with regard to the deduction for children had we left the general exemption, at £156. What we are proposing is, I think, far more generous than anything that would have been proposed in respect of the deduction for cliKlren' had we allowed the ""exemption to remain at £156. The Committee is now invited to add to what has been given. I suggestto the Committee that too' much ie being asked. I agree that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards this measure has throughout been consistent, but he has not been worried by any particular sense of responsibility, in regard to the .finances of the country, t t is easy to make proposals of this kind, which .must of necessity command the sympathy of all honorable members, but I suggest dt is hardly fair to try to increase the deduction in .respect of children when the generalexemption has been raised to £200. what -amount would be involved in lifting the deduction .to the extent of £10 .per child-? Committee some figures that will help them -in arriving at a proper calculation. When the deduction was lifted from £26 to £30 it involved a loss of revenue amounting to about £40,000. On the basis of those figures, to raise it from £30 to .£35 would cost about another £45,000, land to raise it from £35 to £40 per child would cost an additional £50,000. The point I wish to stress is that the deduction we are now giving was recommended by the Royal Commission, and that the question of a still further deduction was considered by the Cabinet. Instead of -raising the .deduction beyond £30, we .'have done something which will probably ,give greater relief than would have been afforded -a man with children had we left the general exemption where it was and raised the deduction for .children.. .The reason that the Cabinet decided to raise 'the general .exemption instead of increasing the deduction for children was that, by raising the general exemption, the administrative costs would be very materially reduced. Had we raised the deduction for children and left the general exemption where it was we should still, have been faced with the necessity of handling and considering a great mass of income tax returns -of which we are now free. averaging proposition, as embodied in this Bill, cancel .the decrease in cost of administration which he secured by lifting the exemption? that justifies the .absorbing in that way of .the expenditure so saved is that the averaging system is an attempt-a n attempt with which some .people may not agree-to place the burden of taxation more equitably upon the shoulders of the taxpayers. tempt to place it more equitably upon the shoulders of people with families ? raised' the general exemption, and the burden ie' now more equitably borne",60,Pairs

We are often told that our crease the deduction in respect of children. I would ask honourable members not to be carried away by their sympathetic feelings with respect to this particular point. It is an easy appeal, and an easy cry to raise. We, as legislators, however, have a great responsibility, and are not entitled to respond to sentimental cries that appeal to us, and arouse in us the desire to do things which in our saner, moments we would not consider to be justifiable. For these reasons I appeal to the Committee to accept the basis of deduction per child which was embodied in the amending B ill passed last December-a n increase on the former deduction-and which is again repeated in this measure. I have just been handed the figures for which the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr married life means what it was intended Watt) asked. To raise the deduction for children from £30 to £ 3 5 would mean a loss of revenue amounting to £ 4 5 , 0 0 0; to raise it from £ 3 0 to £ 4 0 would involve a loss of revenue amounting to £95,000, and to raise it from £ 3 0 to £ 5 2 would mean a loss of revenue amounting to £220,000. ment has already sacrificed £600,000 in revenue. mind, as mentioned by the honourable tions? member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), that in this BiU there is relief to the ber is right, but if we are to be what taxpayers, included amongst whom are all we are supposed to be-representative s who would benefit by an increased deducof the people-w e have a right to form tion for children, amounting to £600,000. a judgment of our own.'

We have heard a lot from the Treasurer a loss of £ 1 in the exemption. In New( Mr Bruce) as to the loss of revenue South Wales, the State exemption, whati t was. Having observed a which would be involved in raising the deduction allowed in respect of Australian-born children; but I would remind the Committee that the honourable gentleman is a member of a Government that is spending on immigration considerably more than the loss that would be so best immigrant is the Australian-born child; but when we show a desire to encourage in a small way the rearing of suoh immigrants, we are met w i th a "" poor mouth "" on the part of the Government, who declare that they cannot alford the money. It must be remembered that, at the same time, the Government can find money to help to bring children from other parts of the world. We are told that to raise the exemption to £52 will result in a loss 'of revenue amounting to £220,000. But who is going to get the benefit of the remission ? Not the men and women of this country who would rather nurse dogs than children. Those who will get the benefit are the average citizens, who believe that for.

441,Mr Watkins,"T h a t is before theover it is, applies to a l l, and does not diminish, in the round-about way adopted in Commonwealth legislation. the exemption is to catch men who reach the higher incomesa policy that has always been urged by the honourable member's party. cords will show that when the honourable gentleman who interjects was Treasurer, and the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) raised this point, the honourable gentleman would not admit that the diminishing exemption would work in the way it has done. off the exemption. this exemption represents a fair way of imposing taxation; in my view, if there is an exemption, it should be' a proper exemption. I hope the Treasurer sees that the time has come when the present exemption of £ 3 0 might well be increased in order to afford some assistance to people who are trying to rear families in Australia. I trust I shall not be accused of raising this question, or of taking part in a discussion on it , merely because we are on the «vo of an election. On referring to Hansard, I found that one of the first speeches I delivered on becoming a member of this House was on the same subject. On 15th May, 1918, Mr Pigott and myself brought the matter under notice quent speech! member very much. We were, however, defeated in our efforts on that occasion, when we asked that the exemption be raised from £ 2 6 to £ 5 2 . On the next occasion that presented itself, 8th October, 1918, I again introduced the subject, and submitted an exactly similar amendment, but was defeated. however, that .as a result of the discussion created by suoh amendments, greater prominence has been given to the subject. ' stolen! that score. I do not care from what quarter such a proposal is made, I intend to support it . HadI not happened to be called out for a moment I should, myself, have submitted a similar amendment. The exemption for children has now been increased from £ 2 6 to £ 3 0 ; and I shall support my honourable friends opposite in making it as large as possible under this B ill . Twice have I moved that it be raised to £52, and I am quite prepared to support an exemption of £ 6 0 . This is the The Hansard regravest question that has ever been brought before any Legislature in Australia. An adequate increase of our population is absolutely dependent on the attitude' which the. community generally, including this Legislature, adopts towards the two conditions of life-on e known as single blessedness, and the other I am talking of shading as married happiness. I am a warm supporter of the immigration of people I do not knew that of British blood; and I am certain that there is no necessity to take steps to import people of other races. There are tens of thousands of men, women, and children in Great Britain who would make magnificent settlers in this country-so many are there who are perfectly ready to come that I feel sure we should not be able to provide sufficient ships to carry them. But in addition to immigration we must take every opportunity presented by a measure such as this, which, however indirectly, may tend to increase our native-born population. The question of making proper allowances to people who are prepared to undertake tha difficulties and responsibilities of parentage lhas never, I believe, been adequately considered by this Chamber. Owing to the increase in the cost of living since the beginning of the war, it I remember your elohas become more and more difficult for married people to bring up their children I thank the honourable in the way they ought to be brought up, and there has been created a much wider gulf between the cost to a single person of living i h comfort and happiness and the cost to married people. The income now required to support a family in comf o r t is much larger than it was some I am glad, years ago, as compared with the incomenecessary to support a single person. The result is that people who decide to get married, and who, in the natural course Y o u r thunder has been of events, are blessed with children, find themselves at a great disadvantage; and the Legislature should endeavour to reI have no regrets on move every obstacle from their path. ThisB ill presents one means by which those obstacles can, to a certain extent, be removed. In my view it is not a question of whether it will cost £50,000,",62,Pairs

When those remissions were being considered, the very first to claim attention should have been the remissions to people who are undertaking to bring up families in this country. It .seems to me, however, that it is only at the last moment that anything of the kind has been thought of. Having remitted taxation amounting to -over £3,000,000 we may surely spend £50,000 or .£90,000 in making the most important remission of all. I feel most strongly on this subject.

The honourable gentleman talks about sentiment; but what sentiment influenced him when, in his Budget speech, .he proposed to relieve 20 per cent, of the people of this country of £1,900,000 of taxation? .He has no hesitation in taking £3,500,000 from Trust Funds to relieve gentlemen who are connected with public 'companies, who, during the whole of this debate on taxation, have been watching and endeavouring to obtain more relief for themselves and their friends. It is not the wealthy seccome should , be taxed. In the Budget, tion of the community that has .the large families. Those best able to keep children have the fewest. If the Treasurer had to live .on the basic wage of £3 18s. a week fixed in New South Wales, and had a family of six children, he would view very differently the proposal to increase the deduction for children, and would not have made the soeech that we have heard from hdm. I know that if he and I together took the public platform on this auestion, I would have the audience with me. Reference was made to the New South Wales law. There the exemption is £250. with a deduction of £50 for each child. In that State a Government with humanitarian ideals has been in power. The population of New South Wales is increasing rapidly, past Governments having laid the foundation of a prosperity that has amounting to over increased by leaps and bounds. 1 do not worry much about those who are well off; it is what Blatchford calls the ""bottom dog,"" those who have not too much of this world's goods, whose interests need guarding in a matter of this kind. The Treasurer's concern was not for the "" bottom dog "" when he reduced the income tax by 10 per cent., which means that a man who formerly had to pay £1,000 in income taxation can *.ow give £100 to his .wife as a present for jewellery or other expenses. The honourable ,gentleman has forgotten those 'Who have to .straggle for a living, and are not in constant .employment. It is they who need ,a deduction of £3.0 for each .child. It is the men and women who are .rearing .large families i£or whom we should .have most consideration.

Thusi t was that we came to propose an. exemption of £156 and a deduction of £13 for each child. We have been called disloyalists; but we were loyal enough to impose heavy burdens, on our own. class during, the war time, and should, be commended for what we did. It should not be a reflection on us that the deduction for children we proposed was small. not as a reflection', but as a reminder. near the right honourable member regarded it as a reflection on us. During the consideration of the B ill in Committee, I have been surprised to note the keen watchfulness of the Treasurer aud thesupporters of the Ministry on behalf of public companies, wealthy squatters, and other wealthy persons; the interests of the' rich could not have been more 1 safeguarded. I think that it is .my duty to safeguard the interests of the poor. My life has been a strenuous one, but I am still f u l l of vigour, and ready to champion the class from which I have sprung. Environment makes character, and the poor cannot get any one to represent them better than a member of their own class. The Treasurer talks about the burden of taxation, but after all the bouquet ;th!rawinjg hei benefits 75 per cent, of the people by remitting their taxation to the extent of £600,000, and benefits the other 25 per cent, by re. nuttingtaxation affecting them to the extent of £2,000,000. Apparently it w ill devolve upon honourable ' members of the Labour party, when they get on the other side of the Chamber, to see that justice is done to taxpayers w i th families; but It h in k that the Treasurer should mark his period of office by agreeing toi'the proposal put forward' fro m -this' side. If he would do so his memory would be; kept green,, because he would be doing somethingthat would give satisfaction to the masses. While the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce)' was speaking, it seemed to me there was. running through his speech the refrain, "" Children, have no votes."" He advised the Committee not to be led away by sentimental] reasons.. As a matter of fact, almost every exemption provided for by Cirthe: Treasurer in the B ill has a good solidreason in the shape of votes behind it . The incidence of taxation largely determines where people live and what they d'o>;it also largely determines the character of the population. Therefore, the. Treasurer should have given consideration to the raising of the deduction for children before agreeing to raise the exemption in the case of single men. The best immigrants Australia can have are the kiddies born here, and with the many calls that modern society makes upon the purse of the breadwinner, ib is often a difficult matter for families to live in decent comfort. Meni n my pro^ fession axe able to judge where the shoe pinches in the household better than most men are able to do, and, speaking with that knowledge, I claim that the first remission of taxation should be in regard to those persons who have families. Last year I said that I would support the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) upon this matter; but when it was pointed out by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) that, by agreeing to the amendment the honourable member had submitted tlie revenue would be reducedto the extent of £200,000 or £300,000, and it was .already over £2,000,000 short, I supported the Government. However, we found that, although we had saved £200,000 or £300,000 by rejecting the honourable member's proposal and taking the money from the parents of children, the Government, despite their promise to effect economies, spent £1,000,000 morethan Parliament voted for them. In these circumstances, and as exemp1 tions are being made in other directions which are not so vital, I -have no hesitation to-night in saying that I shall support, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton).

AlthoughI cannot see my way clear to support a deduction to the extent of £60 ior each child, I think that the Treasurer might compromise by fixing the amount at £40. Under the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) a man with three children and a salary of £7 5s. a week would escape the payment of income tas. If the deduction were fixed at £40 for each child, a man with a family of three children and a salary of £ 6 5s. per week would escape the payment of income tax. Therefore, I think a deduction of £40 would be reasonable. I regard £30 as altogether too small a deduction to make, in view of what it costs to rear a family. No honourable member would care to keep a child on less than £40 per annum. It is refreshing to find that thc Country party are coming into line with the Labour party at this eleventh hour. them. them.

When the Treasurer tells us in his Budget that the Government propose to remit £2,000,000 of the taxation paid by the wealthy classes of Australia, and that it is proposed to spend £200,000 or £300,000 per annum on immigration, thero should be no hesitation in giving some relief to those people who are already in this country, and who have families. As a matter of fact, I believe that the general exemption should be raised to £300. A young Australian soldier who was wounded on several occasions married in London and brought his bride to Australia. The couple arc living at Malvem, 3^ miles out of Melbourne. The husband earns £200 per annum. They pay £1 2s. 6d. per week for two rooms and the use of a kitchen, 10s. per week for their furniture which they have bought on time payment, and about 10s. per week for debts incurred in .other ways. They were kind to me when I was in London, and I have asked them on several occasions to come up to the House and have tea with me, but they tell me that they cannot afford to make more than one trip per fortnight to Melbourne. Yet these are the people we are asking to pay income tax. Can we imagine a couple in such circumstances having children? all right. for the honourable member, with his millions of acres, to talk in this way, but there is no doubt that this couple are Not all of financially embarrassed. The Government speak of spending £10,000,000 upon introducing people from abroad; yet many of our people are in very straitened circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) proposes to give some relief to those people by, in the first anything place, increasing the allowance for each child to £60. When the Treasurer is able to relieve the wealthy classes of £2,000,000 of taxation, I apnea! to him not to listen to the honourable member for Balaclava when he asks that everybody should be interested in taxation, and that there should be no exemptions. It is very easy for the honourable member and those similarly situated to speak of no exemptions. exemptions. or three children and a husband earning about £4 per week, which is about the average wage to-day, has a serious problem in making both euds meet. We ask that people of this class should be given a little consideration. I think they should be absolutely exempt from taxation.

The proposed allowance of £60 is too high, for it does not necessarily cost that amount to maintain one child, or £120 to maintain two children, in reasonable comfort for the year. I look upon an allowance of 15s. per week for the maintenance of a child as reasonable, and I shall be prepared to support the honourable member for Indi( Mr Robert Cook) in uiakiner the deduction £40 in respect of each child. The amount proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is a little more than is reasonable, having regard to the cost of maintenance. It is rather amusing to listen to honourable members opposite voicing their opinions about what is fair and reasonable for the other chap. The honourable member for Darwin told the Committee that ho is quite iu favour of a fair and reasonable allowance in respect of each child; but what is fair and reasonable is to be determined by him.

In other States the basic wage is approximately the same, and when the campaign that is being conducted by those who are satisfied and those who are dissatisfied with the present occupants of thc Treasury bench is completed, the wages received by the working men and women will not be such as to necessitate their burning midnight oil in making out their income tax returns. I know that the great mass of the working men and women will not be benefited by a measure such as this. A certain strata of the working classes will be benefited, but they are not the great majority; they are not those who are the first to experience reductions in wages, and who find it so hard to make ends meet. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Robert Cook) spoke of giving exemption to workers who are in receipt of £6 or £7 per week; but how many of the working men and. women are paid that amount? troubled with taxation. will not, but the honourable member does not seem anxious to divest himself of his "" troubles"" and get busy with a pick and shovel at £ 3 18s. 6d. per week 1 member and his colleagues have their way, I shall soon have an opportunity of doing that.

I fail to see that taxation is a burning question amongst working men and women. Of course, it is a matter of great concern to honourable members who represent the various conflicting commercial, manufacturing, and agrarian interests, which to-day are proposing to form new parties to further their respective selfish ends. The capitalistic press in Melbourne is telling U9 that politics are merely a reflection of the struggle between the steel interests and certain manufacturing interests represented by honourable members opposite. We saw something of that struggle in connection with the war-time profits tax, when various groups were trying to shift the burden of the tax on to the shoulders of each other.

Their' concern is to stop robbery a»t the 1 point of production. However, I intend to support the amendment, moved by the Leader of the Opposition, because it will benefit, certain sections of the working classes-thos e who. are already enjoying certain advantages in comparison with, other working men and women. Later, I shall propose a further allowance to a married man who is wholly maintaining relatives other than his children. Single men wholly maintaining a parent or parents are allowed a deduction, but a married man who also is maintaining his parents receives no 'consideration, «ty cept in respect of his children. When a taxpayer is supporting a parent or parents wholly dependent upon him, he should be allowed the deduction that is permitted' in respect of children. I propose later on to move the insertion of the words "" and/or parent,"" so that the paragraph, if amended' as proposed, will them read,The sum of sixty pounds in respect of each but, since the honourable member has made child who is under the age of sixteen years at the beginning of the financial year in which theincome was received and/or a parent wholly maintained by any taxpayer who is not an absentee, shall be allowed as a deduction from income. We have heard a lot from the Ministerial side as to "" common justice,"" and I think that honourable members will agree that as an act of common justice the amendment have foreshadowed should be agreed to. If it is right that a. deduction should' be allowed a taxpayer in respect of the children whom he is maintaining, then it must appeal with added force to honourable members that if such a taxpayer has the additional burden of maintaining an aged parent who is absolutely dependent upon him, he should be allowed a similar deduction in respect of that parent. If honourable members opposite are really de1 sirous of reducing the burden of taxation imposed upon these people-if their professed desire to increase the deduction in respect of children is not a mere electioneering cry-the n they will support the further amendment of which I have given notice. . . Mr Considine. [9.33}. -This question has been discussed at considerable length, and many vieww have been expressed, but I am inclined' to think that all who have spoken, are notquite clear as to the exact meaning of this proposal. If the deduction is increasedto £60 per child it means that a. married man with two children will not be liable to taxationunless his incomeis more than £320 per annum. bers take that view, but it seems to me that such an exemption would be far too high, and much in excess of what is required to meet the ordinary necessities of a man before he is brought within the income tax area. The Leader of theCountry party (Dr. Earle Page), for some reason that I cannot fathom, prefaced his remarks by suggestingon my part an absolute want of good faith in the proposal I had put forward. I may have many sins, but I do not know that want of good faith is an outstanding one. The honourable member said that, underlying my observations with respect to this amendment, there was the thought that children have no votes. Such a statement was a little unprovoked, and quite uncalled for; that suggestion against me, I . think I am quite fair in making a counter suggestion against him.. I would remind him that while children may have no votes, their parents have. There is probably no more burning question throughout Australia than that as to the extent of the' deduction from income tax that should be allowed in respect of. children. An honourable member with an eye to the elections I oould not .take up, a morepopular cry than that of "" increase the deduction for children."" The Leader of the Country party's suggestion that my attitude in opposing the amendment to increase the deduction was governed by a desire to please the electors, and that I was quite ruthless in respect of matters that would not affect votes certainly shows a very fundamental misconception of the whole position. If I were desirous of putting forwardsomething that would appeal ,to the electors as a whole I could not do better than propose to increase the deduction for children.

Had my modesty permitted, I might have suggested, in reply to him the reason he was now prepared to vote for such an amendment was that I had so improved the financial position that we could afford the loss of revenue .that it would entail. The honourable member put forward the amazing explanation of his present .attitude that, is no necessity for the wealthv section to after all, we were so reckless and were wasting so much money that it did not matter much whether or not a. further sum waa wasted. That was the substance of his explanation, and I think honourable members will agree with me that it is wholly insufficient. The right honourable .member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) has said that imitation is still the sinparticular class which the amendment now cerest form of flattery. Underlying that statement, no doubt, is the suggestion that if the Leader of the Country party is going to attribute motives to me I might very well respond in the same way. anything of the kind. Coming back to the question immediately before the Chair, I maintain the position I took up originally, that ithe deduction proposed by the Government, taken in conjunction with the fact that we have raised the general exemption to £200, is reasonable and proper. I realize, however, that at times we are met with an expression of opinion that cannot be overlooked, and that the .general opinion of the Committee is that some' f urther concession should be given to taxpayers with children. The Government cannot for one moment entertain *he amendment moved by the Leader of the 'Opposition, providing that the 'deduction 'shall be raised to £60 'per child. Such an increase is quite out of the-question, and would be extremely unfair to the general body of taxpayers. In addition, the.Joss -of revenue which it would involve is more than we could contemplate, when taken in conjunction with our general -financial proposals for the year. In order, -however, to -meet the wishes of the Gommittee, as so freely expressed, and without in any way receding from the?position that its original proposition is reasonable and fair, .the Government is prepared to raise the deduction from £30 to £39, which is -equal to 15s. per week for each child. The of the Committee, but it cannot agree to any greater deduction than £39 per child. It is most extraordinary that the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) should, without any soliciting from the House, be so prodigal towards a certain section of the community. But, of course, the soliciting of 'that section is not done in the chamber; there which T refer to do their lobbying here, seeing that it can be done through the organizations which control the Government. The Treasurer came down to this House with a proposal to afford taxation relief amounting to £2,100,000 to a certain 'section of the community. Not one penny of that relief so granted helps the before us has in view. We are not now concerned about the wealthy with large families-the wealthy can bear the brunt. to find the wealthy with large families.

On the one hand we see £2,100,000 given to one section of the community, and £9 offered to another section. .That is a sort of discrimination to which only the representative of the Government could give effect. The Government have given a £5,000 exemption in the case of the unimproved land values tax, an exemption which is enjoyed by the large landholder, whether he be worth £1,000,000 or £10,000,000. who did that! the case of land taxation we ane prepared to do in the case of an income tax deduction for children. We are prepared to do the fair thing by the workers of this country. It may be interesting to know thab this is not the first time the Labour party has endeavoured to afford this relief to a very deserving section of the community. On the 8th December, 1921, the present Leaden of the Opposition ( Mr whose behalf I am now speaking, in the Charlton), when an Income Tax Bill was under consideration, moved that the deduction allowable for each child should be £60. The honourable members who voted against that proposal were: Messrs. Atkinson, Bamford, Bayley, Bell, Blundell, Bowden, Bruce, Cameron, Robert Cook, Corser, Foley, Richard Foster, Francis, Gibson, Greene, Gregocy, Groom, Higgs, Hill, Hughes, Hunter, Jackson, Hector Lamond, Lister, Marks, Marr, Maxwell, MoWilliams, Earle Page, Poynton, Prowse, Rodgers, Ryrie, Laird Smith, Watt, Wienholt, Wise, Mackay, and W. H. Story. ter) -Ho w does the honourable member propose to connect that with the amendment before the Chair? that this question was discussed on a previous occasion, and that a similar proposal waa then defeated. I propose further to show that the taunt cannot be thrown at this party that the proposal is made now as a vote-catching cry. to reflect on any vote given in this Chamber, and I have already called other honourable members to order.for doing so. by any reasoning, sir, you can say that I am reflecting on any vote given in this House. WhatI say is that the fact that in that division list there appear, as supporting the proposal, the names of Messrs. Anstey, Blakeley, Charlton, Considine, Cunningham, Fenton, Gabb honourable member not to continue that line of argument. Chanter, that you are not going to prevent me making my speech. other honourable members to order for the same thing. that the whole of the members of the Labour party, without exception, together with the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), the only member of the Country party to do so, voted for the £60 deduction. Not one member or supporter of the Government voted for that proposal, and it is no reflection to say that. I hope that the Treasurer will relieve that section of the community on same way as he afforded relief to the wealthy.

The position of the Commonwealth is very different from that of Viotoria. generous exemptions than does tlie Victorian Act, and allows of the possibility of a man making provision for the vicissitudes of life. 1 know it is very difficult far men with small incomes to do that, but this Bill provides more opportunity in that way than does the Victorian taxation law. to pay both State and Federal taxes. tried to arrange our taxation in a way that is just aud equitable. The exemptions which this Bill provides are just and equitable. life are hard to meet and are very distressing to those whom they overtake, it 13 impossible in. an income tax system, although possibly desirable, to provide that a man who experiences any misfortune shall receive special treatment. AlthoughI have the very greatest sympathy with those for whom relief is sought in this amendment, I cannot see my way to agree to its incorporation in the Bill. WhilstI should like to be able to support the amendment, there is not the same need for it as there is for a provision granting some relief to those who do not enjoy the convenience and advantage of adjacency to medical attendance. In the great centres of population there *re lodges and societies which men may join for a small quarterly fee, and medical attention may be obtained cheaply through those channels. I am more concerned about the people in the outback portions of the Commonwealth, and I understand that recently the income tax law in Western Australia was altered to provide that the medical expenses of people in remoter portions of the Stats should be deductible from their incomes. If people are to be induced to go into tbe country, and if women are to bear children there, special consideration must be given to them. to all people. back-blocks the nearest doctor may be 20 miles, and even 100 miles, distant. Medical fees in the city may be a mere bagatelle, but the doctor in the country, although subsidized by the State, has to charge big fees because his patients are not numerous. T the Western Australian Act does not differentiate between residents in different parts of the country. man wrote to me on 22nd AugustMy wife had to undergo a serious operation during 1921, and I applied to the Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation, at Perth, for a deduction for the amount of cost of operation and expenses attendant thereto, and in reply was told that medical expenses were not allowable deductions, and I think that as they are not "" expenses"" they ought to be "" deductions"" as in my case the amount was over £90. Whilst the vicissitudes of An expense of that kind is a big burden to a struggling settler. Not only has he to pay the medical bills, but he is inconvenienced by being deprived of the assistance of his help-mate. Then he is told that he must find the money somewhere, and the Taxation Department will not help him. I wrote to the Federal Commissioner on the subject; and this is the cold-blooded reply I receivedRe J. T. . . . Narrogin, WA. Thc Income Tax Assessment Act does not permit any deduction in respect of medical expenses incurred by a taxpayer in respect of himself or his family. The Royal Commission on Taxation has not made any recommendation for the allowance of such deductions. point out that what the Commissioner states is what the law provides. It is not fair to describe the Commissioner's reply as "" cold-blooded."" the Commissioner is doing his duty by administering the Act, he does not seem to have made any recommendation on this subject to the Royal Commission on Taxation. Yet this is one of the disabilities retarding the development of the country. Few women can be persuaded to go out-back, and those who do are in continuous dread of illness overtaking themselves or their children, when they are so distant from medical practitioners. In cases sueh as that I have mentioned, an allowance should be made, no matter what the cost. If the amendment now before the Committee is not carried, I shall propose a further amendment, to the effect that sums paid in respect of medical attendance, where the taxpayer resides not less than two miles from a",73,Pairs And The Expenses Would Amount I O

In the case of a person (other than a company or an absentee) there shall be deducted, in addition to the sums set forth in the last preceding section, the sum of Two hundred pounds less One pound for every Three pounds by which the income exceeds Two hundred pounds. This clause deals with the general exemption. I never agreed to the exemption being fixed at £ 2 0 0 . I thought'at the time that it should be £250, and the purchasing power of money has decreased in the meantime to such an extent that 32s. would now be required to represent the purchasing power of £ 1 at the time when the exemption was fixed at £ 2 0 0 . There is justification for a much higher exemption than is now provided for. I am not going to ask the Committee to make it £ 3 0 0 , but it is fair that a married man should have an allowance for his wife. In Great Britain, the married man has an exemption of £ 1 5 0 for himself, £ 1 0 0 for his wife, £ 4 0 for the eldest child, if under sixteen years of age, and £ 3 6 for each of the remaining children. That means an exemption, in. the case of a man with a wife and three children, much higher than that provided in this B ill , even w i th the concession granted in the form of the children's allowance. I move That all the words after ""pounds"", line ti, -be left out, with a view to insert, in lieu thereof the words "" with a further deduction of One hundred pounds in the case of a married man."" That would leave single men with an exemption of £ 2 0 0 , and would give married men an extra allowance of £100 . [11.24] I am afraid I cannot agree to that. I do not think I need go at very great length into the question of an exemption with respect to the wife. We have discussed at some length the general question of exemption, as well as the deductions to be made in respect of children and other dependants, so that thera is very littl e remaining to be said on the subject. W it h regard to the second part of the proposal, to abolish the provision which reduces the exemption by £ 1 for every £ 3 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds the amount of the exemption, the Government cannot consider it ; if for no other reason, because of the loss of revenue it would involve. I have not the figures with me now, but my recollection is that to give every taxpayer an exemption of £200 would mean a loss of revenue of something like £1,500,000 per annum, which is a loss that we could not contemplate.

[11.56] -On e Appeal Board has been constituted up to the present time. In the A ct passed last December power was taken for the establishment of a.

When I came to consider this question it appeared to me by no means certain t h a t ' these Boards would function as .we hoped, or* would f i v e .the results that we desired. The Government, accordingly, decided that the best course to> adopt would be to appoint one Board with th© very best personnel we could get, to give a trial to the system. The Board was constituted, I think, in A p r i l last. It consists of Mr chairman or member)'. Twine, who was the Assistant Commisning, who was a lawyer in Western Australia, but subsequently went upon the bench and was a magistrate dealing, at the time of his appointment to the Board, exclusively with income tax matters. made very careful inquiries w it h regard to Mr Canning, and I gob from the business community such very strong recommendations as to his capacity, and the way he was filling his office in Western Australia, that it appeared to me that he was the man for the position. When I found that the view of the commerical community was confirmed by my own officers in the Department, I had no hesitation in recommending his appointment. The third member of the Board is Mr Lightband, who was an accountant with a large practice in Brisbane. The -head-quarters of the Board are in Sydney, and while the head-quarters remain there it will be a travelling Board, and w ill go wherever its services are most urgently required. quarters be in Sydney when the central office of the Taxation Department is in Melbourne ? number of cases will probably have to be dealt with in Sydney.

A business man, pure and simple, would be of very slight value on a Board of this character. The Board is constituted on the best basis possible. It includes a practising accountant, a lawyer, and a Government official. Tbe average accountant knows more about business than the honourable member or his associates.

If the honourable gentleman w ill think of the difficulties surrounding the constitution of a Board of this character, he will realize how hard it is to get a Board with a strong and useful personnel. The expense of these Boards is very great. Each Board w ill cost from £10,000 to £12,000 a year. This Board has been established for some months, and it may have had a case referred to it in the last few weeks; but when I last met the members in New South Wales they had not had a single case referred to them.

We know very well that not only in regard to income tax, but in various other forms of taxation, especially in the States, quite large sums in the aggregate are gathered from people because it is not worth their while to take their case to appeal or before the Law Courts. If they appealed and won the case the appeal would probably cost them more than the benefit they would derive. that ia no reason why these people should be compelled to pay a taxation which is not just. I know of numerous taxpayer* having been assessed at a rate above that which they considered to be fair, but an appeal was not worthwhile, because of the cost. isystem of Appeal Boards dissatisfied taxpayers would be able to get redress at less expense than in the past. Obviously, if there is to be one Board only, taxpayers in various States w ill find that it is costly to reach that body, and probably that is the reason why [139] more appeals have not been lodged. I shall be dissatisfied if there is to be one Board only, because it will not be easily accessible to the many dissatisfied taxpayers in Tasmania. Clause agreed to. Clauses 44 to 46 agreed to. Clause 47The chairman and each of the other members of a Board shall receive such remuneration and travelling allowance as the Governor General determines, and the Consolidated Revenue Fund is, to the necessary extent, hereby appropriated accordingly. I suggest to the Treasurer thab this is too large an order to ask the Committee to pass. We have elicited, by inquiry at this late hour, the salaries paid to the present Board, and this clause governs the whole scheme by specially appropriating for the existing Board or any number of Boards considerable sums of money, the control of which w ill pass beyond the reach of Parliament. We are told thab the existing Board is to cost from £10,00 0 to £12,00 0 per annum, and we have just heard the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) pleading instead of one peripatetic Board. We may Unless this Board of Appeal have half-a-dozen of these Boards, costing the country fro m £60,000 to £70,000 per annum, without Parliament knowing anything at all about the cost so long as the Governor General is prepared to sign the necessary papers on the advice of his Ministers.
