In fact the Channel7 this morning and, in fact, was arguing honourable member for Wills-I suspect that it is that really there are 93 per cent or 94 per because of embarrassment caused by some of the cent-wide and rash statements of the Leader of the Opposition-has tried, as a substitute for not Mr Barry Jones-He said 92 per cent. having a policy in that regard, to pretend that the member for Lalor, who watches all these these matters. programs. The President of the ACTU said that Nothing could be further from the truth. If 92 per cent of persons are currently in employthere were a magic wand we would certainly wave ment. One could be forgiven for feeling that he, it. There is not. One cannot, in the end, get away unlike his predecessor, has not yet got the message from fairly orthodox economic management. In that people making up that 92 per cent cannot the end one cannot get away from the fact that if just press for the maintenance of their current the markets are not available for what is dug out level of real wages except at the expense of some of the ground, grown or manufactured and these of their 92 per cent and certainly in a way which is products cannot be sold, one cannot go on prejudicial to the prospects of re-employment of employing people to do those things. For the steel some of those who have been shed in the last few industry there has been a drop in export markets months. I accept the social consequences to which at the same time as a drop in domestic demand. So the honourable member for Wills has rightly rethe imported steel products are those we do not ferred. The Government certainly accepts the ulmake, do not make in volume or cannot make timate responsibility for trying to get the cocompetitively. But if we were to put up all the operation of people. But beyond jawboning it is barriers against imports of some of the things we difficult to know what we can do to induce the cannot make competitively, other people would President of the ACTU to understand that at this put up other barriers against some of the things stage there is an obligation to tighten the belts and we do make more competitively and sell. That to have what virtually is a wages freeze for the would disemploy a whole range of other people. It next few months. is no easy solution to say that we will put up more We accept that the dimensions of the problem protective barriers or that we will put on this or are very serious. Not for one moment have I run that protective device without running the risk of away from the kinds of descriptions the honourretaliatory action which can only worsen the emable member for Wills has given here today and ployment situation for someone else somewhere elsewhere. However, I do not think that such deelse. scriptions ought to be so dramatically overstated I submit again that the Government has shown that they actually create an even more pessimistic a consistent approach in trying to take a longer psychology in the community than that which term view. Parts of primary and secondary indusnow exists. It is important for people to get an tries have already undergone a very major restrucunderstanding of the gravity of the situation so turing. The fact that we hear nothing about them that they will moderate wage demands or take now is probably a result of the fact that good news more serious approaches to productivity improveis not reportable news.

The package of legislation before the Bottom-of-the-harbour schemes developed out House to deal with bottom-of-the-harbour type of the so-called dry Slutzkin dividend stripping tax evasion schemes, or straw company schemes schemes which were legitimised by a 1977 High as they are otherwise known, is in five parts. The Court decision. Dry Slutzkin schemes basically inTaxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment volve the following steps: First, the target Bill [No.2] is the principal Bill. It sets out the company with accumulated profits on which all basic conditions under which promoters of these company tax has been paid is liquidated so that all schemes and former share owners in companies assets are held in cash. Next, the shareholders of dumped under the schemes become liable to the target company sell their shares to the repay evaded company taxes and undistributed scheme's promoter for a price close to the full profits taxes. This so-called recoupment tax will value of the cashed-up company.

Finally, the proVendors) Bill and the Taxation (Unpaid moter, through a series of transactions, declares a Company Tax-Promoters) Bill formally impose dividend to milk funds out of the company so that tax on the promoters for 20 per cent of the tax no further tax is paid. An example of the scheme liability and on the shareholders' shares of the might involve a company with accumulated after unpaid company tax established under the first tax profits of $1 m. Assuming that 40 per cent is Bill while the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) distributed to shareholders so that undistributed (Consequential Amendments) Bill amends other profits tax is not payable, tax on the $400,000 Acts to fit in with this legislation. Finally, the Individend in the shareholders' hands would be come Tax Assessment Amendment (Additional $240,000 if the shareholders are on the top marTax) Bill amends the income tax laws to increase ginal tax rate. In this case the true worth of the late payment penalties from 10 per cent to 20 per company, after allowing for tax liability, is cent, effective two months after the Bill becomes $760,000. However, under this scheme the company is sold to the promoter for, say, the view of the Opposition, there is no way, how$900,000-that is, well above its actual valueever, that there is any justification for either which represents a commission to the promoter of aspect of such schemes. They were little more $100,000 and a tax free profit to the shareholders than a highly blatant and artificial device designed of $140,000. In effect the shareholders and the to abuse the intent of the tax laws and avoid huge promoter have split the tax payable between amounts of tax for the greedy few with access to them. These schemes were subject to amending such schemes. Both varieties of this scheme have legislation in 1978 but, as usual, the Government in common the aim to avoid liability for tax on went only half way and further legislation was dividend income paid out of company profits required in 1981 to stop these activities finally. which, when distributed to shareholders, should have been taxed at the shareholders' marginal tax So far I have been describing the dry Slutzkin rate. While such distributions in the dry Slutzkin schemes. The bottom-of-the-harbour or so-called scheme are paid out of already taxed profits, the wet Slutzkin schemes are a particularly insidious bottom-of-the-harbour variety goes further, as I development of the dry variety. They usually inhave shown, and also evades the tax which should volve the target company with current year have been paid on the actual company profits beprofits on which company tax has not been paid. fore a dividend is paid. So the reason for the Again, the target company is cashed up before higher tax loss from such schemes in the example being sold to the promoter for a price approxiI gave earlier is that they dodge company tax on mating its full value with no account being taken company profits and undistributed profits as well of the outstanding tax liability. Once again, as personal income tax on dividend incomes. vendor shareholders are advised to ask no questions. As in the dry Slutzkin scheme, the promoter The Government has decided to attempt to and the vendor shareholders effectively split the recoup only that portion of the tax lost under amount due as company tax between them.

Therefore, I propose to confine my remarks at some time in their lives an evasion through the to a few points. Certainly in my electorate and in cash economy. For instance, any person who pays many parts of this country my atlitude to this cash for a job which somebody does in his house legislation is well known. I have always made it and any person who shops in a market where no clear that as a member of the Liberal Party, as a receipts are given probably have a fair idea that a person who believes in the rule of law and in the percentage of that payment might be going to things for which our forefathers fought, I do not somebody who withholds knowledge of that see retrospective legislation of this nature as being transaction from the Commissioner of Taxation in the long term interests of Australia. Nevertheor does not declare all of the transactions at the less, I want to make one or two other points. I am end of the financial year. It is well documented, acutely aware of the concern in the Australian certainly overseas, that the cash economy is a community about the tax evasion industry and major economy.

DecIsions on tax avoidance were dominated until It has been clearly demonstrated that at least two then by the Barwick view.

It could have done so under which was mentioned in the Costigan report, existing law, as the rebels on the opposite side of outlined that either individually or collectively the House are so keen to point out. But it did not the company taxation Act, the Crimes Act and do that. It could have legislated in the way in the Income Tax Act contained sufficient powers which the Commissioner of Taxation pleaded both to charge the perpetrators of the schemes with it to do but it did not do that. There were and to recoup the finance involved. almost four years of inexcusable delay and this country lost almost $3 billion in revenue. Why was there a delay? According to documents tabled in this House on 22 September by I want to digress slightly and put this on the the Treasurer, letters written by the Comrecord: Use of the existing law could have missioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, how and why recouped this money.
