So there is a problem with when a person drives from one State to another, vehicle safety. he has an idea of what the roads are like and I am one of those who would like to think what the rules are.

The point is that it is important that we I think it would be a dashed good idea if all cars have safe vehicles on our roads so that we do hired in Tasmania had a different number plate. not worry when we let our children go out in I always look at the back of a car to see whether motor vehicles.

These are very real hazards on the road.

One does not get I would like to mention a few of the problems many kilometres of road for $1 m. I have noticed on roads, particularly bitumen I draw honourable members' attention to the roads. Some shires and some organisations repair Hume Highway, for example, and in particular the roads or reseal the roads and do not replace the Tumblong deviation, which is south of Gunthe centre line.

To construct one kilometre of dual carthink the ultimate in road construction on a riageways there, which is part of the bicentennial bitumen road is to have an edge line as well as program, would cost approximately $1.5m.

By the time Sometimes, particularly on the Hume Highway one takes into account acquisition of land and where there are four lanes-two one way and property the cost would be much more than two the other-we find that if they are not in $l.5m. So it is important in the construction of sight of each other we forget whether we are on these roads that we have the maximum amount dual carriageways or single carriageways, and of efficiency, not only from the machines but that can cause very serious accidents, particualso from the people employed in that area. I larly with the number of transports going up am hoping that governments, both State and and down that highway. Federal, ensure that this is the case. The major thing I want to speak about here Looking at outback New South Wales, partictoday is the problem of fatigue on our roads. I ularly in the Riverina-Darling electorate, we have know that a lot of research has been done into many bad roads. These, I believe, are one of the drink driving on Australian roads, and I notice major causes of road accidents in my electorate. that an analysis was done in 1983 when the We have the Rankins Springs to Lake Cargelligo Committee commissioned research into the probroad, which I have described on many occasions lems of road safety. A number of people were as a death trap. Something really has to be done asked what they thought were the major causes about that because it has all the major features of road accidents in Australia. I notice that of those roads which cause the most accidents. eighth on the list is driver fatigue. Only 1.2 per It has bad sight distance; it has dips and curves; cent of the people said that driver fatigue was a it has a bad road base; and after rain we have a cause of major accidents.

The BooligaJ. to Ivanhoe road is similar. area, a major cause of road accidents is fatigue. The Broken Hill to Tibooburra road is not much One sees accidents that just cannot be explained; better. The Cobar to Bourke, and Mossgiel to where people are driving in one direction and Hillston roads are similar. All these roads are in all of a sudden they veer across the road in front need of urgent attention. Of course we all know of oncoming semi-trailers or buses or into each that the ultimate in road Gonstruction is to have other or into trees.
