Tho Writer requests me to act in th* matter. Recently, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr ""Ward) waB informed by the Postmaster-General tha-; copies of the Red Leader were destroyed on legal advice that the publication offended against the laws'of tbe Commonwealth. Can the Postmaster-General inform the House in what respect the publication offended against the laws of the Commonwealth, and if the embargo applied to one issue only. If so,' will £*promise that future issues will not be 1 interfered with? matter to the Postmaster-General, wbn will furnish a reply later. WAR SERVICE HMS, ter aware that of 599 war service home* which have reverted td the Commonwealth Government, no fewer than 384 reversions took place during tbe last financial year as a direct result of tbe depression! That total does not take into account reversions to the commission's agents, the Government Savings Banks of South Australia and Victoria. In view df the very serious loss thus caused to the Commonwealth, and the hardship* imposed on occupants of the homes, will the Government give further consideration to the suggestion that an impartial tribunal be appointed to investigate the whole subject of war service homes?

I shall ensure that every honourable member confines his remarks to the item before the Chair. ringah) [10.55] I oppose this item, under which the British preferential rate has been increased to 50 per cent. Aluminium and enamelled cooking utensils are light, but bulky, and consequently the freight on them is in itself a high protection. Not only is this duty of 50 per cent, prohibitive, but the British preferential rate has been reduced by 5 per cent., although the previous margin was considered necessary in order to assist our trade with Great Britain. Nothing should be done at this stage to interfere with British trade, particularly when no disability is being inflicted upon this country. Apparently, in fixing this duty, no regard whatever was paid to Great Britain and to the maintenance of preferences. I do not agree with the views expressed last evening -by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) and the Leader of the Country party (Dr. PJarle Page), and I propose, in the interests of the public and of my constituents, and as a responsible member of the Opposition, to continue to point to what I consider to be tariff anomalies and injustices. member must confine his remarks to the item before the Chair. endeavouring to do that.

Many other tools, including spalling, saw-makers' chip and scaling hammers, marling spikes, mattocks, picks, and plumb bobs are not being manufactured in Australia, and yet they are subject to these excessive duties.

Before the tools referred to in sub-item A were included in the list of dutiable goods, an .inquiry was .made by a departmental investigation officer, who first satisfied himself that they were being madein Australian factories. Since the duties have been imposed, the output of local manufacturers is improving, but, owing to the prevailing depression, it is not so great as was anticipated. Nevertheless, one manufacturer has entered into a contract for the extension of his plant and buildings at an expenditure of £14,500. The prices of all lines have been reduced since the imposition of these duties, in some cases by as much as 35 per cent., and prices are the same in all capital cities in Australia. So much for the arguI ment of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) that these duties represent a tremendous burden on the working man.

Imported dies for certain sewing machine parts which, under a 10 per cent, duty were costing the Australian user £4 per set, are now quoted at 45s. per set under a duty of 75 per cent. This is a complete answer to opponents of the Government's policy to effectively protect Australian manufacturers, and also is a welcome exposure of the methods of certain overseas manufacturers, who take an unfair advantage of the,users of these tools in countries where they are not called upon to meet local competition. Siuce the Australian factories were established, prices for all tools have come down, and importers have also been obliged to reduce their prices. I cannot accept as accurate the Minister's statement that stocks and dies are made in Australia. Anybody possessing knowledge of the business knows that titer* is a very large range of taps and dies, and that to produce them iu Australia the manufacturer must have machinery to make the different gauges. But, before this business can be undertaken profitably, the makei must be assured of a far wider market than is available in Australia. I admit that anybody can make garden trowels and hoes, but I am quite sure that there are included in subI have said that before these duties were item A many tools which cannot be manufactured on a commercial basis in this country. The Minister has reminded us that if they are not being made here they may be admitted duty free under departmental by-laws. That provision is merely a pretence. The whole item ought to be amended so that tools which cannot be made in Australia shall be admitted duty free. Taps and dies vary in size. Some dies are very small, and some are very largo.

To-day the lowest price is 10s. No one will deny that axes can be manufactured in. this country, but at what price? Because of these higher duties, every person who takes up land is penalized as the result of the higher prices charged for all his tools of trade. I am informed that there are approximately 30 different patterns of hoes, each of which is made in from four to eight different sizes, and although the local manufacturer produces not more than one or two lines satisfactorily, these excessive duties areimposed upon every size. The Minister states that stocks and dies are being made in Australia, but he does not claim that a complete range will ever be produced here. The demand is so limited that no manufacturer would care to incur the expenditure necessary to install the necessary plant. did not tell the committee that a good Australian axe costs only 5s. 6d. imposed a good axe could be bought for 4s. The best that the Minister can say in reply to that statement is that the Government is now giving the people the privilege of paying 5s. 6d. for an axe which they could previously purchase for about 4s.

It is of little use for a man to go out looking for certain classes of work without a shovel. Shovels are not' made in Australia to any extent. Britain is the home of shovel manufacturing.

He said that the increased duties now being imposed upon ,axes have led to an advance in price from 4s. to 10s. for an ordinary axe The fact of the matter is that the axes which our workmen use in the Australian bush are admitted free of duty under departmental by-law. I advise the honourable member to read the by-law. The axes referred to in this item are morticing axes.. The honourable member does not seem to know the difference between a morticing axe and a pole-axe; but he w ill probably -realize after the next election that there is a difference. Morticing axes are being made in Australia, and are therefore dutiable.

Taking into consideration the exchange rate, the primage duty, and natural protection in the shape of freight, insurance, and shipping charges, the effect of this impost will be that the local manufacturers of rabbit traps w ill enjoy a protection of 130 per cent. normal times, the rabbit trapping industry is of considerable value, for we export a large quantity of rabbit skins to Great Britain. In my opinion the existing duties are quite sufficient. We should not make the traps which are used by trappers more expensive than they need be. If the manufacturers of rabbit traps in Australia cannot maintain their industry with a protection of less than 130 per cent, they should go out of business. It is not f a ir to ask the rabbit trappers to pay the extra cost of the duty. Such an infliction upon them is entirely .unjustified. The price of rabbit skins is to-day at a very low level, and if wo. increase the cost of the traps we m a y prevenf many of our unemployed peoplewho are trying to eke out a bare l i v in g by trapping rabbits from following that occupation. It is absurd to impose a duty of 130 per cent, on rabbit traps, and I protest against it .

I cast no formity with the recommendations of the Tariff Board. I have little or no protest to make regarding that aspect of the subject. I wish, however, to call attention to a very strong expression of opinion by the Tariff Board on the amount of protection afforded in this country to local refinery; 1 refer especially to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. I know that this Government did not establish the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. They were established years ago by the Hughes Administration, and various governments since then have continued the policy of that administration. But in view of the abnormal difference between the retail price of petrol in Australia and the wholesale f.o.b. price in the United States of America and other oilproducing countries, the time has surely come for us to cause a complete public investigation to be made into the cost of refining and distributing petrol in this country. Refining in Australia enjoys a protection through the various customs impositions, and an excise of 3d. a gallon on the refined product. Board recommended that that 3d. should be reduced to l£d. per gallon. I am sure that that very remakable recommendation was not made without the deepest consideration and exploration of the facts by the Tariff Board, and it should not be lightly set aside by this committee.. It should not be necessary to emphasize into the detailed costs of this semithe supreme importance of our obtaining petrol at the cheapest possible rate. Its price affects every conceivable cost of production and distribution in tliis wide continent. It is incredible to me that, if local refining is being conducted on business lines, there should be justification for the tremendous difference between the 2Ad. per gallon f.o.b. that is charged for refined petrol at American ports, and the selling price in Australian capitals of 2s. a gallon. In the country districts, the the purchaser. For instance, at Canberra, the retail price of first-grade petrol is 2s. 6d., and as one goes further inland the price becomes higher. I am not certain, but I strongly suspect that for various reasons, the C.O-R. is not reflection upon the management of the concern, whose refining is confined to one State, and because of the limitation of output the cost of refined petrol exported from Victoria is abnormally high. I believe that the C.O.R. was established in Australia with a view to control the price of petrol, to benefit the consumer. It may have done so for a brief period, but I believe that the excessive cost of refining by the company is the main factor in keeping petrol prices at their present level. The relatively small amount of refining that is done by the company is used by the great importing companies to justify the exceptionally high price that the Australian user has to pay for petrol. I should not have spoken to the item had it not been for the very great importance of the matter. I urge the Prime Minister and the Minister to cause a complete investigation to be made into C.O.R.'s costs. In the past it was urged by governments that the costs of the C.O.R. should not be disclosed, because of the information that might be conveyed to the great importing companies. The Tariff That plea should no longer be entertained. into the operations of the Shell Refining Company?

Should it be that this semi-go vernmejital concern is a positive factor in bolstering up the price of petrol in Australia, the matter is a very serious one, and it leaves the Government and honourable members generally responsible for the existing abnormal price of petrol here.

The report was submitted to the Government, together with certain recommendations, which were adopted. Complaints were made by the companies, and the matter was further investigated by officers of my department, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Analyst, Melbourne. It was then found that the previous recommendation was impracticable, and a further one was submitted. I referred the whole matter to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. That .report has been received, and it is practically on all-fours with the last one submitted by officers of my department. The recommendations in regard to the excise duty differ as to whether it should be 4d. or S-Jd. a gallon. That matter is being fully investigated. Evidently, the analyst in Melbourne who made the inquiry had iu mind at first the petrol content of crudes that enter Victoria, which is much lower than that of the crudes, lhat are imported by the Shell Company in Sydney. sider the holding of a public inquiry, or the disclosure of all the costs of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries? gestion before the Cabinet at its next meeting. Two very capable officers are to be appointed to make a thorough investigation of the whole question. Unfortunately, the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, both pasi and present, have not made any repori to Parliament or to the Government on the workings of the company unless specially requested to do so on a specific phase of the industry. The information in regard to refining costs given by that and other companies to the Tariff Board was marked "" strictly confidential "", and the board was asked not to disclose it because its publication might benefit their competitors and militate against them. Dp to the time that this Government came into office, there wa.« no excise duty on petrol produced in Australia. The excise duty is now 4d. a gallon; and the import duty has been increased from 3d to 7d. a gallon. The investigation as to what should be the permanent differential rate is in the hands of two officers who have been appointed to go into the. matter. move That the following be added to sub-item c of the proposed amendment:(o) ""And on and after the 3rd October, 1931--(c ) Petroleum and shale products, viz.: -Naphtha, benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol and any other petroleum or shale spirit, per gallon-British, 7d.; intermediate, 7d.; general, 7d."" My object is to register a protest against the duties that have been proposed, which favour the bulk importation of petrol and oil, leaving the field open for exploitation of the whole Commonwealth by the large combined oil interests. This will create a tendency to force out of business small concerns that are at present operating in Australia, to increase unemployment, and to destroy every possibility of cheaper petrol for the ' consumers of Australia, and there is definite evidence of these tendencies in several directions. I and my colleagues consider that the present duties favour unduly the bulk importation of petrol aiid oil into Australia at the expense of the smaller interests and the general public. It is as well to have placed on record the opinion of the Independent Oil Importers Association, an organization that has its head-quarters in Melbourne. A letter on the subject, written by Mr P. 0. Spicer, of that association, statesOn Monday, 27th July, the Major Oil Comjianies reduced their price' of 'second gradapetrol to tlie public by a penny per gallon. We have read long letters in the press from these same companies explaining the reason for their high charges, yet immediately the Government imposes an additional primage duty equivalent to Jd. per gallon and notwithstanding the extra duties, taxes and abnormal exchange rate, these companies can afford to reduce their prices! In the pre1 vious wdck these same companies raised the price of their lubricating oils 4d. per gailou on the plea that increased primage duty and sales tax necessitated such action! This does not seem logical to us ancl we anticipate that there is another story behind the lowered eost of petrol. The Major Oil Companies, without exception, import petrol in tankers at a huge saving in cost. The Independent Oil Companies, being srrialler concerns, import petrol in drums, whicli costs approximately 5d. per gallon more than when in ported in tankers. We wouldsuggest that an attempt is about to be made by the Major Oil Companies to influence the 'Government to increase the duty on petrol imported in",22,Division 7 Oils Paints And
91,Mr Gulj.ktt,Will the Minister con,23,Division 7 Oils Paints And

93,Mr Eldridge (Martin) [12.2],"Idrums and that thu Major Oil Companies liave deliberately reduced their prices in order to encourage the Government to impose this duty. Yet the Independent Oil Companies by means of economical marketing have always sold below the "" arranged prices"" of the Major Oil Companies a.nd this competition has always benefited the Australian motoring public by keeping down the Major Companies' prices and incidentally profits. For this reason the Major Oil Companies have been trying to eliminate the Independents for many years. It has been urged that the giving of preferential treatment to the bulk, i m portation of oil would increase employment, by enlarging the activities of the case-making industry. evidence that is in any way tangible that such increased employment would be given in that direction. The opinion of the Independent O il Importers Association in connection with the matter may well be considered. It is in the following terms:A short while ago, the Government was induced to increase the duty on petrol, imported in cases, to 8id. per gallon, on the grounds that this action would "" help the Australian case-makers"". We challenge the case-makers to prove that they have collectively obtained any increased business since this duty was imposed. The result of the dutj' has simply caused the cessation of cased petrol imports, which averaged nearly 5,000,000 cases per annum, to the detriment of the Independents and the public who appreciated tliis convenient package'. The second point that we have to consider concerns the small companies to whom I have referred. In considering it , we may well take into account the report and^ recommendations of the Tariff Board on petrol imported in containers, together with the summary of evidence that is to be found on pages 10 and 11 of the report, which is dated Melbourne, the 6th November, 1930. The evidence given by 34 Australian-owned concerns was in opposition to the duty. The inquiry conducted by the board clearly showed that the effect of the duty would be to drive all of those firms out of the business, because case petrol would be too costly to compete with bulk petrol. The next point to be considered is the effect upon employment of the importation of bulk petrol under favoured conditions. It is claimed by competent ties that, in the handling of petrol in cases, 3,000 cases will provide twenty men Mr Eldridge. with employment a3 wharf labourers for fifteen hours each, in addition to 40 carters and twelve storemen and packers for sixteen hours each. On the basis of 15,000 cases, twenty men would be employed as wharf labourers for 30 hours, 40 as carters for 32 hours,,and 80 as storemen and packers for 30 hours. One of the industrial organizations chiefly, and detrimentally, affected by the proposals of the Government is the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. We should consider their views, as they have been expressed by themselves. In a letter that we have received, Mr W. J. Tliere is no Mills, vigilance officer of the federation, Sydney, first complains that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) went behind the backs of his own colleagues by tabling, at the end. of a session, the regulation increasing the duty on oil in containers of less than 40 gallons, after he had promised his own party that it was not his intention to increase it , by an amount of l ^ d . a gallon in excess of the duty imposed on bulk oil imported into the Commonwealth. quite wrong when he says that the duty on petrol in cans and cases was imposed behind the backs of my colleagues. That was a Cabinet decision, which was made for the purpose of giving effect to the recommendation of the Tariff Board. The big oil companies wanted the duty to apply to petrol in drums as well as in cans and cases, or, in the alternative, that it should not be imposed at all. We decided against them, by confining it. to petrol imported i u cans and cases. That action was taken at the request of the Sheet-metal Workers Union, and a number of members of the Government party who interviewed me on the subject. the duty was deferred in the first instance until the 1st June; but, nevertheless, was tabled and became operative on the 1st May. It is considered that the Minister acted wrongly in rushing the tabling of the duty in that way. It has been pointed out that orders for shipments to arrive in Australian ports prior to the 1st June were, as a result of that action, penalized authorito the extent of the new duty, with consequent loss to the importers of small packages, to whom I have referred.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong, who was then in charge of the Trade and Customs Department, said that as there was a considerable conflict of opinion and interest on the matter, the Tariff Board might have to.consider the whole subject and submit a recommendation to the Government. The matter was later referred to the Tariff Board by me when I was Acting Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, and the board, as stated previously, took evidence in all States, and submitted a recommendation that the duty be imposed on cans and cases, which recommendation the Government adopted. Another deputation waited on me on the 19th February last. It was introduced by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), and it was urged that the deferred duty should operate on petrol imported in drums as well as on petrol in tins and cases. A l this deputation the following were represented:-The Chambers of Manufactures of all States, except Tasmania; the Vicconcerns such as the Texaco, Atlantic Union and Vacuum Oil companies to provide for their can and case, trade by placing orders for those containers locally, He strongly petrol entering Australia in drums as well The Government, in deciding to p u i . the duty only on petrol imported in can.' forth, managing director of the Vacuum Oil Company, Mr Darch, of the Shell Company, and Mr Ryan, of the Atlantic Union Company, waited on the honourable member for Maribyrnong and myself, and made strong representations in favour of the duty being imposed on petrol imported in drums, as well as on petrol in tins and cases. They declared that, failing the duty going on petrol in drums as well as petrol in cans and cases they would prefer it to go on neither. So much for the statement that the major oil companies wanted the duty to go on petrol in cans and cases. I have also had interviews from representatives of the Sheet Metal Workers Unions in Melbourne, Sydney ancl Brisbane, pointing out that the canister factories obtained large contracts from certain big oil companies for the manufacture of cans that were formerly imported. One order was for 250,000 4-gallon cans. The Tariff Board pointed out that if the duty were, put on petrol in drums, it would have the effect of wiping out the independent oil importers, while the imposition of the duty on petrol imported in cans and cases would protect the local manufacturers, put more trade their way, and still leave the independent oil importers in operation. -Wheneve r petrol is mentioned, all panies operating in Australia to levy toll honourable members become exceedon the consumers of petrol, but that the ingly alert.

I have in my possession a white paper, issued by the British Government, showing that although oil is not produced in Great Britain, it is conveyed long distances from London to various parts of the United Kingdom, and sold at most reasonable prices. Its association with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is much more satisfactory than ours'. I am not saying anything against the company, but merely pointing out that the British Government is in the happy position that, during the war, it purchased £6,000,000 worth of debentures in the company, and has since then, been more than repaid for the money invested. The association of the British Government with that company has had a steadying effect on the prices charged for petrol to the consumer. I had been hopeful that by means of joint action between the Australian governments and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, we might have been able to have prices reduced in this country.

When I was in Vancouver, a deputation pointed out to me that the imposition of a duty on petrol in. containers might lead to the restriction of shipping services between the western ports of Canada and the United States of America and Australia. Vessels were going direct from United States of America' ports to the unloading points in Australia as far north as Cairns. am iu some doubt at the moment as to , how I should vote on this matter. I feel much more inclined to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) than for that of the Minister. so far as that of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) when he was Minister. He proposed to put a duty on drums, as well as on cans and cases. was referred by me to the Tariff Board. If I think it proper, I am not afraid to lay myself open to a charge of inconsistency. If one receives conclusive proof that a certain line of action is right, there is no harm in changing one's opinion. When I was Minister, I received a deputation from country users of petrol protesting against high prices. One large deputation told me that, if the small petrol-importing firms were wiped out, petrol users iu the back-blocks would be at the mercy of the great combines. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) stated that petrol-users in Canberra were compelled to pay 6d. a gallon more than was charged in the capital cities. I am prepared to entertain favourably any proposal which may have the effect of reducing petrol prices. We must keep the big petrol companies in check. I know the two officers of the Customs and Audit Departments who are conducting the investigation into petrol prices, and they are good men. They will do all they can; but they have not the power to go into the matter as fully as would be possible if the Commonwealth and State governments co-operated in prosecuting a full inquiry. The Minister referred to the recommendation of the Tariff Board in regard to this item. I have here an extract from the Tariff Board's report of 6 th November, 1930, on the proposed duty on petrol containers, and I ask the Minister whether it is correct. It is as follows:While not suggesting exploitation on the part of the major companies, the board considers it desirable that the competition which has hitherto been brought about by the operations of independent importers should be preserved. If that is what the board-recommended, I why has not its recommendation been respected in the preparation of the present tariff schedule? has correctly quoted an extract from the Tariff Board's report; but the board also said in the same report that the imposition of a duty on petrol cans and cases would not result in the wiping out of independent importers; and that, in the interests of employment in Australia, there should be a duty on cans and cases, but not on drums. direction has been falsified by events. 1 have moved an amendment on behalf of the honourable member for West Sydney, the leader of our party ( Mr Beasley), and every member of our group supports it.

One of the strongest opponents of the Government's proposal was the present Minister for No man is more capable of answering the statements of the Minister in the matter of giving employment than that gentleman. information and supplied me with a good deal of valuable matter. He is bitterly opposed to theso duties, and I expect him to vote in accordance with the statements he made prior to becoming a member of the Ministry. The Minister spoke of deputations of trade union secretaries coming to Canberra on several occasions. I sliould like to ask those trade union secretaries who paid their expenses to Canberra and who was behind the proposition they were supporting. I guarantee that the trade-unionists' organizations did not pay their expenses. Many trade unionists' organizations are bitterly opposed to these duties, and two or three trade union secretaries gave evidence before the Tariff Board against them. That proves conclusively that fewer men will be given employment if these duties remain operative. I trust that a majority of the committee will vote against the Government's proposal In conclusion, I should like to say that I was associated with the party opposite for many years; and I little thought I would see it stand£1,000,000 in erecting a new plant, but ing up in defence of the interests of foreign monopolists and exploiting the uaers of oil in this country. that I would see the honourable member associated with the Nationalists. associated with a party that is game enough to stand up against the monopolists of this country.

Petrol in containers is used almost entirely by persons living in the outback parts of Australia; cityusers are able to obtain the benefit of the services provided by the distributors. This is another instance in which people in the outback parts of Australia have to pay more for what they require in order to provide employment for a comparatively'^Sfell number in the city. For instance, iu The electorate of Kalgoorlie, which is larger than the State of Yictoria, practically all the petrol is transported in containers, for whicli the-users have to pay an enhanced price merely for the benefit of certain small factories -in other parts of Australia.

Some are in favour of additional work being provided, for those employed in box and can factories, and others wish the work to be given to those on the waterfront. For the first time the "" wharfies,"" through their representative, are asking for a reduction in the duties. The Minister referred to the representations which have been made to him. Honourable members must have been struck by the fact that those pushing for this duty and squabbling amongst themselves have been the trade unionists, on the one hand, and on the other the big oil companies-thes e old vicious combines that have such an extraordinary hold upon this Government. Those are the only two sections for which this Government has any consideration. I did not hear anything in the Minister's speech in advocacy of the claims of the users of petrol.

No class in the community has suffered more acutely as the result of the tariff impositions of this Government than the waterside workers. Vessels that came to Australia loaded with freight now come half loaded, and do not require anything like the number of men formerly employed to discharge and load them. They come into a port and leave the same day. The misery one can see on the waterfront of Sydney is harrowing. A t one time in point of tonnage and employment of labour on the waterfront Sydney was one of the first five ports of the world, but now its glory has departed. "" Change and decay"" have taken its place. The extraordinary feature of this matter is that a Labour government should be found to be bolstering monopolists.

143,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [2.47].,"Minister's opening statement, but I quite agree with what has ""been said by the honourable members for Warringah ( Mr motorists. Australia, however, is their Parkhill) and Indi( Mr Jones). The people of this country have long been anxious to know why the price of petrol has risen to such an exorbitant figure. The Minister has made no attempt to deny the statement that the price of petrol in America, making due allowance for the difference between the American and Imperial gallon, is about 3d., as"" compared with from Is. 2d. to Is. 3d. in Australia, after deducting duty and retailers' profit. member for Warringah drew attention to another fact that is agitating the minds of the Australian people. Many years ago, at my suggestion, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited was formed for the purpose of assuring to. the people an adequate supply of petrol from British sources, and I have been very much disturbed in mind, as others have been, to see this company marching hand in hand with those whom it was designed to check and correct. That is an anomaly that requires explanation. If it be said ,that there is no understanding between Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and the other big companies, language has lost its meaning. Is it mere coincidence that year after year the price of Commonwealth Oil Refineries' spirit keep3 pace with the price of American oil, rising when American oil rises, and falling when American oil falls? The source from which the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited derives its crude oil is entirely distinct from the sources of American crude oil. although the raw material used by Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited is sold to the British Navy at approximately 5d. a gallon or less, we in Australia are unable product below the price fixed by the five major oil companies. true that one of these five is not American, but it is equally true that these companies have parcelled out the world among themselves. Some countries are allotted to the Shell group; others to the American group. No doubt competition is maintained in those territories which are still in dispute, but over the greater part of the world they work Mr Hughes. amicably together to the great and lasting disadvantage of vast numbers of paradise; into it no serpent enters. The lionorable members for Indi and Warringah referred to the work of which the waterside workers have been deprived. Huge tankers discharge a consignment of bulk oil in a few hours. In America the oil is poured into the tanks, and in Australia it is drawn off; very little labour is employed. Having regard to the present state of the national exchequer and Australian industry, does the The honourable Minister contend that, in this age in which industry is largely dependent upon the internal combustion motor, the price of petrol is not a serious, often fatal, handicap to progress? We know how it affects the waterside workers, but what of the manufacturers and the men on the land? The latter are urged time and again to bring their methods up to date; they do so, but are dependent upon .American petrol for the means of taking off their crop. The oil companies stand at the gate and levy toll on every human being in this country, and that corporation whicli was established for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of our people, and over which the Government has supreme control, might, for all the practical use it is, have its habitat in New York or some other American city. There is another aspect of this problem. Those who have read the admirable report of Dr. Woolnough, Commonwealth Geologist, are aware that he is convinced that oil in payable quantities exists in Australia. While Australia is filled Vet, with unemployed and the persons who have money and are the mainspring of industry are taxed so heavily that they have nothing left to carry on industrial enterprise and so provide employment for to buy the finished idle hands, under our feet are wells of incalculable wealth which requiro only to be It is located and tapped. Although the Government is assured by Dr. Woolnough, after a prolonged visit to America, that oil in commercial quantities is to be found in Australia, not one penny is being provided for prospecting on the lines which he suggested. On the one hand is the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, an enterprise in being, that walks submissively hand in hand with the American oil companies and obeys their slightest behest. On the other hand, are subterranean supplies of oil which, if tapped, would invigorate this country and enable us to be independent of the United States of America, All that we require is £25,000 or £50,000 for prospecting. Not one penny can we get; but the oil companies can get all that they ask for. There is something rotten in the state of Denmark. right honourable gentleman was Prime Minister.

157,Mr Hughes,"It is an intolerablehim out. I call upon this Government to act ancl to cease talking. right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has informed the committee that he established the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited some ten years ago. That is true, but, unfortunately, during tbe regime of the right honourable gentleman and his successor, the ex-member for Flinders( Mr sympathy for the unfortunate people outllruce), that company fell down on its job. It was years before October or November, 1929, that this company commenced to walk hand in hand with the American companies. anxious throughout that the Commonwealth Oil Refineries should, by active competition, bring about a substantial reduction in the price of petrol. The right honourable member for North Sydney accused this Government of not taking action during its two years of office to control this company, but let the tell him that if this Government, say a month or two after the elections, had decided to replace the two directors, who were appointed by previous administrations, and who have fallen down on their job, it would have been accused of making political appointments. Only a few minutes ago the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) referred to the appointment of ex-Senator Findley as the Commonwealth Government's representative on the directorate, and suggested that we were quite satisfied so long as one of our members was drawing fees. Findley, as the representative of the Commonwealtli, is receiving £300 per annum, and he is the only gentleman on the directorate who has any wish to benefit the petrol users of the Commont wealth. The position is that directors supsearch for oil in Australia. He referred posed to be representing the Commonwealth are working hand in hand with American interests. I have protested time and time again agaiust the action of the Oommonwealth Oil Refineries in allying itself with the American companies. nounced an increase, in the price of petrol, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries immediately followed suit. I am not out to protect the interests of the major companies. I am just as keen as any other honourable member to bring them under effective control, but I approach this item as I have all other items from the point of view that by passing it, we shall provide additional employment for our people in the manufacture of cases and tins. opposite, who profess to show wonderful back, suggest that this item is an additional burden upon them. They also suggest that the minor companies are rendering great service to the primary I have been producers. But to that suggestion I give an emphatic denial. These minor companies are doing the bulk of their business in and around the metropolitan areas. They import petrol in 40-gallo.n drums, which, will not be accepted by many of the shipping companies or the railway authorities on account of the risk. Consequently, the people outback cannot get them delivered by rail. Moreover, they are not carried in our coastal vessels. It has been suggested that these duties will prevent wharf labourers and other transport workers from obtaining employment. That argument could be advanced in connection with other commodities that might be imported. It might be contended that oils and other commodities should be allowed to enter this country in bottles, in order to provide work for wharf labourers, and that no regard be paid to the claims of the Australian glass-making industry. Boots and shoes, Ex-Senator neatly packed in cases, could, on the same ground, be imported. That argument will not stand. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) complained that the Government has failed to provide money to conduct a to the report of Dr. Woolnough. Official publications from the TJnited States of America show that Australia is supposed to have the second largest oil deposits in the world. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether this year, or last year, was the time for Australia to provide When those companies an£250,000 for oil prospecting. How far would the £25,000 or £50,000 suggested by the right honourable gentleman go in prosecuting the search for oil? It would scarcely scratch the surface.

160,Mr C. Riley,"Honorabl e membershonorable gentleman, and others, denounced the Government for having failed to do this, that, and the other thing. I ask what did Nationalist Governments do when they were in office. The right honourable gentleman from North Sydney did not use the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited to control the American oil companies when he was Prime Minister. During the many years that Mr Bruce was Prime Minister, all that he did was to threaten the American oil companies that if they attempted to get Australia by the throat he would do certain things. He did nothing. The present Government has been handicapped in dealing with these companies because of the directors appointed by the Hughes and the Bruce-Page Governments. I repeat that had this Government attempted to replace those directors by men who would place the interests of the petrol-users of the Commonwealth first, it would have been accused of making political appointments. I support this item because I believe that we should manufacture in Australia the containers required by Australians. ter) [3.8] I listened with amazement to the speech of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), in which he attempted to blame the present Government for the result of his own government's actions. It is easy for the right honourable gentleman, as a private member, to say what he would do by way of legislation; but I point, out that it is matter. about ten years since he laid down the conditions of which he now complains. It was he who entered into the agreement, which was signed by him on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and later was ratified by an act of this Parliament. He says to-day that what the law has given, the law can take away. Lord has given, the Lord can take away. hear the right honourable member aright. Tn any case, the inference was that the power that entered into this agreement was the power that could get out of it ; that the legislation which ratified the agreement could unmake it. The right honourable gentleman knows that that is not so; he is .aware that any legislation introduced to break the agreement would boin the nature of repudiation. The agreement contains provisions whereby the Government may ultimately secure control of the company, it provides that at the end of fifteen years the Government may buy out the company! But two years' notice must first be given! I remind the right honourable gentleman that, although he was in office for a number of years, and later sat .behind another government for several more years, nothing was done. Does he expect the oresent Government, which has been in office for only two years-the most strenuous years in Australia's historyto undo in two years all the wrongs of the past? Another clause in this precious agreement entered into by the right honourable gentleman provides that the Government and the company shall be partners, the Governmeut being represented on the directorate by three members and the company by four members. I remind him that the agreement cannot be amended by legislation without the consent of the other party to it. The right honourable gentleman knows the nature of the agreement into which he entered; he knows that it. was ratified by an act of Parliament; yet he now says that if the Government will bring down certain legislation, he will sunnort it. His statement is cheered by honourable members sitting in opposition. I accept his challenge; the Government will go into the not rushed to upset everything that was done by previous governments. Probably a criticism than can justly be directed against it is that it has been too fair in carrying out the obligations inherited from its predecessors. There are two companies in which the Commonwealth is supposed to be partners, but in each case one partnerthe Commonwealth Government-is kept ignorant of what is being done with public moneys. The Government has been endeavouring to surmount the difficulties which have faced it. Probably it will soon decide to appoint to the directorate of both companies",36,Riley I S Thonw Anythiiig Man

Our only object inaware that the Tariff Board also reported that the competition, due to the operation of tlie independent importers against the importers of petrol in bulk, should be preserved ? reason the board declined to recommend the imposition of a duty upon petrol in drums. I may add that the major oil companies do not wish the item to stand in it3 present form. They stated definitely that, unless the Government imposed the duty on petrol in both drums and tins, they would prefer neither, so in this matter we are not considering the wishes of the big oil companies. The competition of independent importers is being maintained by these duties. The manufacture of tins and cases is an established Australian industry, and it is growing. If honourable members reject the item they must take responsibility for throwing a large number of men out of work. this item has evolved a general discussion upon tlie operations of the C.O.R., and the ramifications of the major oil companies in Australia. I have searched in vain for the reasons which actuated the Government in imposing these duties. I . have already consulted with the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and other members of the Ministry with regard to the serious position arising^ out of the huge importations of petrol from the TJnited States of America, and, in fairness to the right honourable gentleman, I must say that I believe he ancl members of the Ministry are just as keen as anybody else to bring down the cost of petrol to users in it could put the "" screw"" on these comAustralia. The people of this country are being robbed by these big oil companies, which have spread their octopuslike tentacles throughout the commercial life of this country, and are not deserving of consideration at the hands of this Parliament. Quotations published daily diclose that, for the last three or four weeks the price of petrol f.o.b. New Orleans and New York is 3$ cents per gallon. As freight to AusAustralia for less than Is. per gallon ex tralia cannot exceed Id. per gallon, the duty. price charged here is out of all proportion to its cost. Officials of one of the biggest companies in Australia informed that it is landed in Australia at ahout me in Sydney a week or two ago that liis company could land the best grade petrol for 5d. per gallon. are landing it for about tliat figure, but they camouflage the real position by publishing false returns. able member, when he was in office, put a stop to it? the real position has been disclosed. I do not blame this Government for the present position. On the contrary, I give the Ministry credit for endeavouring to bring down the price, but I doubt if the duties imposed in this item will effect this much needed reduction. Cheap industrial power is an essential to progress. I am afraid that this tariff item will not make possible any marked reduction of power costs. One reason given by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) and also the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) in support of the duties was that they would mean additional employment in the manufacture of tins and cases. Apparently they overlook the methods adopted for the distribution of oil in Australia because, as a matter of fact, not a great quantity is delivered in tins and cases. All the major oil companies have independent systems for distribution by means of bulk oil wagons to various centres, and they exact high prices from consumers. In Canberra, for instance, petrol is 6d. per gallon higher than in the other capital cities of the Commonwealth. The people generally would support the Government if panies and compel them to reduce their prices to a reasonable level. The maximum price charged at Honolulu which, I admit, is TJnited States of America territory, for the last five year3 has never exceeded Is. per gallon, and, while the f.o.b. quotation to the Solomon Islands users is less than Is., prices in Australia are much higher. 5d. per gallon.

Any legislative proposals to bring down the price to Australian users would have my heartiest support, but [ cannot sec how this item will achieve that end. The Prime Minister stated that the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was responsible for the establishment of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. I would, however, remind him that the directors of that company are appointed for a given period, and if the Government deems a change desirable it may be made from time to time. The Commonwealth holds 50 per cent., plus one, of the shares in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, and, as all honourable members know, the numbers of shares held counts in the appointment of .new directors. I am not suggesting that the Government is endeavouring to evade any of its responsibilities in this matter; but if it can compel the Commonwealth Oil Refineries to take certain action in the interests of petrol users in Australia it will have my support. I fail to see why that company should not be able to exercise its influence in the matter of price-fixing and eventually put the other companies in their proper place. The.Prime Minister was unkind enough to say that the Bruce Page Government, of Avhich, at one time, I was a member, had done nothing to safeguard the interest of petrol users. The facts do not support the charge made by the right honourable gentleman. The Bruce-Page Government provided an additional £250,000 for the purpose of erecting a number of huge tanks in the principal ports of Australia with a view to the importation of petrol in bulk. All of the tanks have not yet been completed. I appreciate the difficulties of this Government, and, as I have said, I will give it every support in any legislative measures necessary to force the major oil companies to bring down the price of petrol to a decent figure. I fail to find in the Tariff Board's report any reason to justify the Government in giving the applicants what they ask for. The adoption of the Government's proposal will not help Australia, but will help the monopolistic companies which hold her by the throat. ifr. Marr. pany is totally opposed to this duty. A couple of weeks ago it made a definite request that the duty should be taken off. Vacuum Oil Company, or the Shell Company, even if it went down on its knees. These two great companies have been holding a pistol at the head of our people for years. If honourable members are convinced that this octopus should be fought, let them join forces and fight it. I do not believe that the adoption of this duty will help Australia. On the other hand, I believe that it will help such monopolistic companies as the Vacuum Oil Company and the Shell Company. want this duty. They desire the amendment of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) to be adopted. tralia to get cheaper oil and petrol we should encourage competition. The Vacuum Oil Company and the Shell Company are doing all that they can to smash, the small oil companies which are buying oil in bulk in the TJnited States of America and shipping it to Australia in comparatively small quantities. We should encourage the small companies to do this, with tbe object of introducing some competition into this business in Australia, and so reducing the price. This great oil octopus has spread its tentacles throughout the world. In Africa, its prices for petrol are Is. higher even than in Australia. In the islands of the Pacific, for which Rabaul is the centre, the price varies up to 4s. 6d. a gallon according to the distance of the particular port from Rabaul. It is the same with lubricating oil. This product is not refined so highly as petrol or kerosene, yet the companies are charging Ss. 6d. a gallon for it in Australia. They oven own the containers in which it is sold, from the large tanks right down to the bottles which we see in use at garages. How can it be said, therefore, that there is a big industry in the manufacture of theso containers and bottles in Australia?

If one thing more than another has convinced me of the insincerity of the Opposition in respect of this item, it is their attitude in regard to monopolies. Wheneveri t has been proposed to deal with the distributing monopolies of this country, it has been the Labour party which has set out to enlighten the people. We have done our best to remedy the existing defects in our method of distribution. Labour in politics has suggested that greater constitutional power should be given to this Parliament to deal with distributing and other monopolies, the proposal has been strongly resisted by honourable members opposite. Dr. member should say by the State governments, and particularly the Government of New South Wales. has, on several occasions, endeavoured to obtain the consent of the democracy of this country to an enlargement of the constitutional powers of this Parliament, but its efforts have been thwarted by the activities of honourable members opposite. It will take more than the wild gestures of the right honourable member for North Sydney to convince the people that he sincerely desires to reduce the price of petrol and oil in Australia. If ever the people of this country are able to obtain petrol and oil at reasonable prices, it will be due to the actions of the Labour party, and not to the actions of those who to-day have hurled across this chamber the charge that the Government is protecting monopolies. The Opposition has used all the mental and monetary power at its command to prevent the Labour party from obtaining constitutional power to control monopolies and combines. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) was all astray in [17] If the his arguments. If his proposal is carried the amount of work available to our people will be reduced. The Tariff Board aspect of the subject with which he dealt, and has shown conclusively that a good deal of additional labour will be needed to give effect to the policy which the Government is proposing. If we followed to their logical conclusion the arguments of some of the honourable members who have opposed the Government's proposals, we should pull up our railway lines and use horse teams for transportation purposes. We should be saying iu effect that railway engines were no good, and that the steel rails should be ripped up. member believe in monopolies?

The scientific development of trade and industry has made it absolutely essential that the national Parliament should ho equipped with power to control and direct the trusts and combines which have grown fiscal development when we must recognize the economic truth that trade and commerce must be developed by the private or the socialistic trustification of the means of distribution. It has been said that the wheat-farmers have been greatly inconvenienced through the adoption of the existing means of distributing petrol and o i l ; but how are these requirements distributed? We know that the farmer who requires oil fuel for the engines on his farm obtains it principally from bulk lorries which travel far into our outback areas and deliver petrol as and where it is required. Some farmers may buy containers, in which to keep supplies, but usually they buy more or less limited quantities from the bulk wagons which visit them periodically. The latter is the means employed to serve nine-tenths of the community. It has been pointed out by the Tariff Board that the imposition of the duty proposed by the Government would provide additional employment. On that ground alone it should receive our support.

196,Mr Gibbons,"We have come to athat if this amendment were carried, it would, by some mysterious means, lessen the cost of petrol to the consumers. That, I submit, is all moonshine. It is evident that the fixation of the price of petrol is in the hands of a monopoly. If honourable members opposite desire to attack that monopoly, let them appeal to their political colleagues in the State Governments to take the necessary action. The Commonwealth has no power to regulate the price of any commodity in a State. That power rests with the State. If honourable members opposite are prepared to urge the State Governments to take that action, they will have my support, and that of other honourable members on this side. -The Prime Minister delivered himself of some observations concerning the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and myself that call for a reply by me. The attitude of the right honourable gentleman reminded me of a young woman drawing up her skirts preparatory to negotiating a puddle. He was very careful where he placed his feet. Being charged with permitting an American monopoly to' impose exorbitant prices on the users of petrol in Australia, the Prime Minister seeks to shelter himself behind an agreement entered into more than eleven years ago by the Government which I had the honour to lead; an agreement designed to insure to the people of Australia the supply of petrol at a fair and reasonable cost. The right honourable gentleman implied that, but for that agreement, things would now be very different; petrol would be like manna, to be had without cost. That agreement has hindered him so sadly that he is to this day floundering about, impotent! But the right honourable gentleman intends to take up my challenge. He will cause exhaustive inquiries to be made! We have raised ghosts, he declares, that we shall never be able to lay. Let those whose business it is beware of the consequences. I have not had time to go through the agreement again at length, but I shall read section 14 of the schedule, the operative section. It statesIn order to insure the full success and development of the oil-refining industry in Australia, the Commonwealth will, so long as the prices charged by the refinery company for products of refining are considered by the Commonwealth fair and reasonable, but not further or otherwise 1 and subject to this. . . that the price of petrol sold by the Commonwealth Oil Refinery is in the opinion of the Commonwealth Government fair and reasonable certain privileges are granted to the company. There is the power of the Goverument to deal with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. It is not as the Prime Minister said, powerless. Upon the Government rests the responsibility of declaring now that these prices are fair and reasonable. After all, what did the right honourable gentleman say? That eleven years ago something was done. Since then the millenium has come. Its banner-bearers have been in office two years. Now they come, like spoilt-children, crying, ""We cannot do this because, ten years ago, an agreement was entered into."" Precisely: It is an agreement that vests-in the Comm monwealth Government the right to deny to this company any advantages at all if it charges the public other than fair and reasonable prices. No man can say that the present prices are fair and reasonable. Let the Prime Minister stand up to his work. He was placed in,office to govern this country. If there is any legislation standing in his road, in the name of heaven, let him declare what that legislation is. His excuses are childish, and his attempt to evade his responsibilitiee has been blown to the winds. His denunciation falls from me like hail from an iron roof. What does it matter? The point is that if the Government had had the courage to do what it ought to have done, the price of petrol to the consumers in this country would now be fair and reasonable. This is a most important item, one that merits very careful consideration by this committee. We are all greatly concerned about the supply and price of petrol in Australia.

There is no industry in Australia in which the employees receive such a high wage as that of cigar manufacture. It seems extraordinary that the Government should have made such an enormous concession to this industry. time. I have been in communication with the Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) on the subject of an improved radio service for Perth, the present service having proved to be very unsatisfactory. J. havo been assured by the Minister that he soon hopes to provide a new and powerful plant. Is the Minister n'ow in a position to make a definite statement to (he House on the matter? master-General) [4.3] -The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) has heen indefatigable in his requests for an improved service in connection with the A Class station, 6'WF, Perth. For several months I have been looking into the matter, and the great trouble has been to provide the necessary funds for improving the station. The department is not prepared te shift the whole plant, but we intend to erect a new station, using as much as possible of the material in the old plant. The following statement sets out the whole position:Tlie Postmaster-General, the Honorahle A. K. Green, has already announced that stops are being taken to improve the national broadGregory) raised the subject of the excise casting service in the portion of Western Australia that can be served by the Perth Station, but he wishes to correct a misapprehension which appears to exist regarding the extent of the work that the department has undertaken. The impression appears to have been created that the intention is to remove tha existing transmitting apparatus from its present site in Wellington-street, Perth, to another more suitable position. Actually Perth w ill be supplied with what is virtually a new station. Certain portions of the existing plant that are suitable will h« incorporated in the new transmitter; but the major part of the installation will be entirely of new design and construction. The aerial system w i ll ""be of a type new to Australia, representing the most recent developments in broadcasting practice. The antenna portion of the aerial sj'stem will bo supported by two substantial steel towers, each 180 feet high, I cannot understand the while a very-extensive network of ground wires will be needed to form the lower portion of the aerial system. The new transmitter will be of the most modern design, capable of giving 100 per cent, modulation, and will be provided with a crystal control .master oscillator, guaranteeing frequency stabilization. The power rating of the station will be 3 kw. into the aerial. The present GW.F transmitter is rated on the old basis of power consumed, and it may be interesting to note that on an equivalent basis the rating of the transmitter which is now being constructed will be 10 kw., which is considerably greater than that of any other capital city broadcasting station in the Commonwealth. It is undesirable, if not impracticable, to attempt to rush through a work of this character in two or three months, which appears to be the period that a number of interested persons in Western Australia consider sufficient for the purpose. It may be of interest to record that the best offers which could be obtained for the rapid construction of broadcasting stations of similar capacity varied from six to twelve months. The department is pressing forward with all phases of the work, and no time w i ll he lost in making the station available for service. The general designs have been completed, and it is expected that within the coming week tenders for the steel towers w i ll be invited. Plans for the layout of the equipment, and the design of the building are in hand, and are being expedited as much as possible. The Postmaster-General is particularly anxious that the improved conditions should be made available to the people of Western Australia at the earliest possible date, but he wishes to emphasize that the magnitude of the work to bo undertaken is considerable, and it is important that it should be executed in the most efficient manner so that the best results may be assured. for Trade and Customs) [4.4] -The honourable member for Swan( Mr",44,Radio Service For Perth Taxation Department Appointme Nt Of Super Vising Officer Returne D Soldiers Dismissal From Postal Department

Owing to the high prices charged, these cigars were going out of favour. Any one who looks up the' figures will see that the consumption of these cigars was steadily decreasing. The cigar-making industry in Melbourne used to employ between 300 and 400 men, but they were gradually being thrown out of employment. It is a difficult trade to learn, and it takes men a considerable time to become proficient. I , am having a further investigation made into the matter, and something more may be said regarding it when the excise schedule is before Parliament. Unless there is some compensating factor, we would not be justified in sacrificing this revenue. As a matter of fact, the revenue which it was said we might receive, was mythical. tinued at 7d. a cigar, it is doubtful whether the public would have continued to buy them, and the consumption would have fallen to such an extent that we should have obtained very little revenue at all. terday I asked the Treasurer a question relating to the appointment in the sales tax section of the Taxation Department of a supervising officer-who was -without accountancy qualifications, and who was a non-returned soldier, although there were other officers, both senior and junior to him, who were returned soldiers, and who possessed accountancy and university qualifications. I asked the reason for the appointment, and the reply I received was a typically departmental one, being intended practically to snub me for having asked the question. in accordance with section 50 of the Public Service Act. There was no need to mention that, because it was known both to me and to the returned soldier officer! who had been passed over. The reply continuedEvery officer who considers he is more entitled to appointment to the position has, and has presumably exercised, his right of appeal against the officer provisionally appointed on the ground of (a) superior efficiency; or (6) equal efficiency, and seniority. The determination of any such appeal rests with the Public Service Board which is required, for the purinquiry into the claims of the appellant and those of the officer provisionally appointed.

I wish to know whether we, as representatives of the people, are or are noi entitled to ask questions, and receive informative replies to them. The answer I received is quite untrue.

I have here a letter from the Returned Soldiers ExeHad prices concutive of Victoria, dated the 3rd February, complaining of this appointment.

215,Mr White (Balaclava) [4.7],"Yesfeels very much aggrieved, and rightly so. This Governmeut can be accused of discriminatory action against returned soldiers, whether intentional or otherwise. Recently, several cleaners in the employ of the Postmaster-General's Department were under notice of dismissal. Other honourable members and myself took the matter up, and pointed out that these men were recuined soldiers. do the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General the justice of saying that they took action, and the men were kept on. Nevertheless, notice appeared shortly afterwards in the Government Gazette advertising for cleaners. I brought the matter again under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and he assured me that the men would be kdpt on. During the regime of 'Ke present Government, 1,500 returnee, soldiers have been dismissed from the Postmaster-General's Department. They were repatriated into their jobs, and should have been made permanent officers. Many of them are buying homes through the ""War Service Homes Department, and, as a result of liicir dismissal, are now in arrears with iheir payments. Whether intentionally or not, the returned soldier is being eliminated from the Government Service. The reply which I received from the Treasurer is evasive and unsatisfactory. I do not know the man who is appointed. He may possess certain qualifications, but it is claimed that they are negligible compared with those of the unsuccessful appellants. The departmental reply stated that he possessed organizing ability and personality. I ask honourable members to listen to the qualifications of the officers who were passed over, some of whom are senior to the roan who was appointed. Tbey are as follow:1. Academic Commerce, Melbourne University, A.F.I.A. ; returned soldier with four and a half years' active service. 2. Academic qualifications--Diplom a of Commerce, Melbourne University, L.I.C.A.; returned soldier witli two years' active service. 3. P. 9.

It is evident that those men possess outstanding qualifications, and it is greatly to their credit that, although they lost considerable time overseas in the service of their country, they were prepared after they came back to take courses at Melbourne University. 1 ask the Minister to see that they are given justice, aud also to take steps to ensure that I will when honourable members of this Houseseek information, they are given satisfactory answers. ter) [4.12] -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) asked when the tariff could be sent to another place. After it has been disposed of here, it will take at least two days to have i i printed, and sent up to the Senate. It would be fairly safe to say that if tbe tariff passes this House next week, it could reach another place in the following week. I do not know the officer referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), but I gather from the honourable member's own statement that the appointment was made either by the Commissioner for Taxation or his deputy. An appeal has been made to the Public Service Board, and the board has upheld the appointment. Tbat procedure is in conformity with the act. That was tbe nature of the reply given to the honourable member; and I am sure that the department did not endeavour to snub him. It merely drew attention to the law which this Parliament passed, and it was entitled to do so.

When temporary men are to be dismissed it necessarily means that returned soldiers have to go, as the majority of temporary men are re-, turned soldiers. In this case, dismissal notices were issued to a body of cleaners, because there were redundant permanent officers for whom the department held positions had first to be found. The matter was brought before the Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) and myself, and we realized that their case was particularly hard. Their occupation had not gone, but as work could not be found for certain junior permanent mechanics they were appointed as cleaners. The Public Service Board felt that its first duty was to find positions for permanent men, and notice of dismissal was therefore given to the cleaners, The Postmaster-General studied the case of these men very sympathetically, and handed the matter over to me when he left for Western Australia. I asked the Deputy Director of Postal Services to hold up the matter. justed; but the appointment in the Taxation Department has not. ilr. Scullin. still embarrassed in finding positions for a number of men. We are hoping that under a new ruling with respect to furlough of officers due to retire we shall be able to case the pressure in the permanent service. , MT. It. GREEN -If temporary officers There is a could be made permanent after two years' service, they would all come under tbe one heading. that. .The difficulty becomes much greater in times of depression than when conditions are normal. Mr Ei.nitinoE -Did not the Government make a definite promise to absorb these unfortunate returned soldiers who have been dismissed? Postal Department are being retained, and we are endeavouring to absorb redundant permanent officers. When the activities of the Postal Department increase, the department will endeavour to absorb all the returned soldiers and Pracother ""officers who have been dismissed from temporary employment. For tbe good of Australia, and in the interests of these men, we hope it will not be long before that can be done. The Postal Department, which is the first to feel a depression, will also be one of tbe first departments to respond when we return to prosperity. We hope that, the present situation will soon improve, and that a number of these men will soon be able to return to the positions which tbey formerly held. Question resolved in tbe affirmative.
