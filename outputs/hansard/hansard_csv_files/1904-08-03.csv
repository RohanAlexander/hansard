Those within whose electorates proposed sites are situated-and it is only fair to mention that the Lyndhurst site is situated not far from the electorate which I represent-see m to make the question peculiarly their own.

Since then, however, there has been a change of Ministry, and the present Premier, who represents the State electorate of Carcoar. within which the Lyndhurst or Carcoar-Garland site is situated, is now displaying a great amount of energy in connection with the matter. The question naturally occurs to one, why is it that when the subject was last under discussion in this Chamber, and the Lyndhurst site needed supporters, the honourable gentleman-wh o was at the time Treasurer of the State-di d not show the zeal which he is now displaying? Is not the answer to be found in the fact that proposed sites are situated in a number of the New South Wales constituencies, and the See Government had not the moral courage to offend possible supporters by saying that they preferred some particular site, and offering that site to the Federal Government? In this Parliament we find that members who represent constituencies in which no proposed site is situated are advocating the postponement of the determination of the Seat of Government, in order to gain popularity, and the approval of the press. honourable member? me probably as much as to the honorable member for Newcastle. The honourable member was in favour of Lyndhurst, but he turned a somersault, and discovered that \ Tooma was the best site.

Are they not favouring the selection of Albury, or Tooma, because either of those places would be very much closer When this Parliament to Melbourne than to any other State capital, their newspapers into the Federal city some hours before the daily journals published in Sydney, or any other capital city in the Commonwealth, could be delivered there? That is the chief object held in view by the newspaper proprietors when they urge that matters should be allowed to remain as they are, or endeavour to persuade honourable members to select a site which would not be regarded with favour by the people of New South Wales. They know that whilst they urge the selection of Albury or Tooma, there is no likelihood of the matter being settled, and that, so long as the people of New South Wales are dissatisfied with the choice made, the Seat of Government will remain in Melbourne. Despite the press, however, the representatives of Victoria should demonstrate that it is the intention of the people of that State to keep faith with New South Wales. The Kyabram movement in favour of public economy has been availed of to prejudice the minds of the electors against any expenditure upon the Federal Capital. I ask how it would be possible to establish the Seat of Government anywhere outside of the large centres of population without a large expenditure of public money ? I am prepared to vote any sum that may be required for properly housing the Federal Parliament and Departments, and for laying out the Federal city, in order that the Commonwealth Government may have a suitable home, and I believe that such action will be approved by the common sense of the people..

18,Mr Henrywillis,"If the honortime, it would be inadvisable to enter upon any unnecessary outlay. We should, if possible, choose a site in connection with which only a reasonable-expenditure will be required. Several such places have been offered by New South Wales, and I wish to refer to one or two which I regard as worthy of attention. There are other sites which are not entitled to any consideration whatever. Albury is so close to Victoria that if the Federal Capital were established there New South Wales would be called upon to practically grant to Victoria a large slice of her territory. No concession would be made to New South Wales in regard to the establishment of the Capital within her territory if she were called upon to provide a site embracing an area_ of 100 square miles on the borders of her territory. accordance with the spirit of the compromise entered into between the representative of New South Wales and those of the other States. New South Wales was, at first, unwilling to enter the Federation unless the Capital were established at Sydney, but as a compromise it was agreed that, although the Capital city should be in New South Wales territory, it should not be located within 100 miles of the metropolis. I do not think that I am committing any breach of confidence' in stating that at the Premiers' Conference the right honourable member for East Sydney suggested a limit of eighty miles as a fair compromise. But the right honourable member for Balaclava, the then Premier of Victoria, immediately replied that if such a limit were fixed, Moss Vale would become eligible as a site for the Federal city. He said that he could not consent to that, and urged that a limit of 100 miles from Sydney should be honourable member for Balaclava evidently contemplated that the Capital would be established very close to the 100 miles limit, and I think, therefore, that we should only be paying proper regard to the spirit of the compact if we endeavoured to select a site as near as possible to that limit. An Honorable MEMBER -Should we' tal at a distance of not more than 100 miles not select the best site that can be found ? the best site for the Federal Capital sion contained in the Constitution, honourable might be found at some place immemembers have not exhibited any undue diately outside the 100 miles radius from eagerness to get away from Melbourne.

The remajority-takin g into consideration the sponsibility which rests upon honourable statutory number of .votes that had to be polled. They were then opposed to Federation, whereas all the other States were eager to bring it about. It was impossible to form the Union without New South Wales, and the other States asked what she wanted, in order to induce her to join. The mother State then made the very simple request, "" Give us the honour of having the Federal Capital within our territory; that is all we ask."" That request was granted, and I now ask bonjrable members to carry out the compact then made, and agree to the establishment of the Federal Capital as near as possible to the 100 miles radius from Sydney. The people of New South Wales would never approve of Bombala, Tumut, or Albury, and it would be a waste of time to select That would not be in either of those sites. I heard this matter discussed in. the last Parliament, and I came to the conclusion that notwithstanding the adverse influence that was being exerted by the press, honourable members were disposed to keep faith with New South Wales. I have yet to learn that honourable members will not do what they believe to be fair to the mother State, which entered the Federal union, quite content to trust the people of the Commonwealth through their representatives. A very great moral responsibility rests upon honourable members, and it is their duty to discharge that responsibility. Is it to be said that the other States having inducedcthe people of New South Wales to join the Federation; that the first Commonwealth Parliament having, immediately after it had assembled, imposed extra taxation upon them, amounting to .£1,000,000-taxatio n which was not required for the cost of the ordinary fixed.

21,Mr Henrywillis,"The people ofmembers is a real one, and one which should be discharged to the satisfaction of the people of New South Wales. During the course of this debate a great deal has been said concerning the very beautiful sites which are to be found adjacent to Victoria. Personally, I do not think that the Tooma site can possibly be superior to that of Table Top, which is situated close to Alburya town which is already connected with the various State capitals by railand the altitude of which is quite as great as that of Tooma. Table Top is situated a few miles north of Albury, but although it is a very beautiful site indeed, it is an abseen both sites? solutelyimpossibleone because of its distance from Sydney. The Tooma site, which is advocated so ably by the honourable member for Hume, is also a magnificent one. The honourable member for Newcastle has declared that when he visited it he had a perfectly, open mind, but that, after having seen it. he concluded that willing to believe that it is an admirable site. The fact remains, however, that it is situated upon the border of New South Wales, and that it is inaccessible, whereas the Albury site is very accessible. Therefore, I claim that the expenditure which would require to be incurred in establishing the Federal Capital at Albury would be very much less than that which would be involved in establishing it at Tooma. I would further point out that while the water supply at the latter place might be very excellent, it would be drawn, not from the Murray, but from the Tooma River. A doubt also exists as to whether that supply is as good as it has been represented to be by the honourable member for Hume. While the Tooma site is no doubt.a very excellent one, I do not believe that it is much superior to a hundred oiher sites which are to be found in various parts of New South Wales, and which can be had merely for the asking. able member inspect the Tooma site? fair question to put, and I think that my reply will be equally fair. I did not visit Tooma because I do not consider that it is just to ask the people of New South Wale.? to assentto tlie establishment of the Federal Capital upon the Murray River in that locality. During the early history of the Federal movement, the late Sir Henry Parkes frequently used to speak of the "" Federal City."" I am inclined to think that he borrowed .that phrase from the late Sir Hercules Robinson, who, upon one occasion, delivered a famous after-dinner' speech in the Albury Town Hall. It is because of that speech, and because Albury was afterwards dubbed the "" Federal City"" of Australia, that a great deal of prestige has been associated with that particular locality. Personally, I cannot conceive rhat the Tooma site is very much superior to that of Table Top, which has an altitude of 1,500 feet, and Avhich is situated within ten or fifteen miles of Albury. superior. Albury would not constitute a fair compromise, and therefore cannot be accepted as a settlement of this somewhat vexed question, any more than can the Tooma site. no better site exists. I am If we want ""to obtain a magnificent water supply, there is another site which would, perhaps, prove acceptable to the people of New South Wales. The drainage in that case is from the opposite side of Mount KosciuskoI refer to the Dalgety siteand it possesses a magnificent supply of the purest of water. In the opinion of geologists Mount Kosciusko is the oldest mountain in the world. From it we can obtain water at a season of the year when streams in many other parts of New South Wales are practically dry. .Thef a l l of the water is such that it might be possible to obtain motive power there at a very small cost indeedpower which would call into being a large manufacturing centre outside of the city area. pose protective duties before we could secure the establishment of any manufactures. member for Melbourne Ports declares that to induce the establishment of manufactures we should require to levy heavier protective duties.

If he has read that article he must know that at Dalgety the water might be so diverted as to provide a f a l l quite equal to that obtained at the Falls of Niagara. I would direct his attention to the possibility that the suburbs of the Federal Capital, if it be established on this site, may be converted into very large manufacturing centres, assuming that the waters of the Snowy River be utilized to the fullest extent under the scheme advocated by Mr Pridham. Dalgety is a magnificent site. It has an easterly aspect, and a water frontage, and if it were selected it would be possible to make an ornamental lake twenty or even forty miles in length. The land adjacent to the site is as good as any to be found within the several areas dealt with in the reports before us. I have heard it said that Dalgety comprises fluky country. It may be fluky country, and therefore unsuitable for sheep raising; but we desire to secure not a sheepwalk, but a site for a centre of population. The land could lie so drained as to secure as large an area for settlement as is likely to be required. If opposition to the selection of Dalgety be based on the ground that it consists of fluky country, then we must give no consideration to Tooma, because I believe that a similar objection applies to it. member for Hume will admit that is so. Sir WILLIAM LYNE thing of the kind. assertion based on mere rumour or on a statement contained in one of the reports? by an honourable member that it was a mere fluke that Tooma was brought under our consideration. I am inclined to think that if it had not been included in the list submitted to us, some other magnificent site in the electorate of Hume-for the honourable member's constituency comprises many such sites-woul d have been brought forward. All round I have no objection to sites in that district being brought under our notice to.provide pleasant week-end excursions for honourable members, but it would not be worthy of the honourable member for Hume to seriously suggest the selection of any of them. The honourable member has a duty to perform for his own State-h e owes an even greater duty to New South Wales than do the representatives of other parts of the CommonI f so, the wealth. The right honourable member for Swan visited a number of sites in the Southern Monaro district, and has given Dalgety his imprimatur, holding that it is the best in the district. The right honourable member has a reputation to back up his opinion. He was the first, to cross Australia from west to east, and furnished reports on the country through which he traversed, pointing out the good and the indifferent land, the extent of the water supply available, and the possibilities of the interior. His reputation as an exploreras a man of wide experience, possessing a European reputation-is such that his opinion on this question should not be allowed to pass without due consideration. The possibility of utilizing the water power available at Dalgety has been dealt with by the right honourable member in a very convincing way, and Tooma cannot be regarded as in any way comparable with it as a site for the Federal Capital. The water supply of Dalgety is superior to that of Tooma, while the land is equally good; and as a compromise the selection of Dalgety would be more acceptable to the people of New South Wales. If the distance separating a site from Melbourne and Sydney is to be a factor in the selection, then the journey from Melbourne to Dalgety would not be so great as to give dissatisfaction to even the most fastidious The honourable person who might have to undertake it. I should like once more, to impress upon honourable members that it is necessary that we I do not admit anyshould make such a selection as will lead the people of New South Wales to consider that we have kept faith with them. We might secure a site adjacent to Goulburn which would be a little more than one It is suggested hundred miles from Sydney, and the selection of. such a site would give great satisfaction to the people of New South Wales.

During the discussion a great deal of attention has been devoted to the centrality of CarcoarGarland, Canobolas, and Bathurst, situated as they are just beyond the limit of 100 miles. Much has been said by those opposed to the settlement of the question as to the impossibility of conserving in ^If a i l altogether to these areas water sufficient for the requirements of a city.

66,Mr Henrywillis,"there is evidence to support the conclusion that they are fairly sufficient for an assumed population of 40,000, and would be capable, by auxiliary storage, of supplying a still greater population. Moreover, the superior rainfall of Canobolas (as much as 14 inches greater than that of Bathurst) becomes an important factor when comparing the catchments of Canobolas and Bathurst; while the same may be said of the facilities possessed by this site for providing an ample water supply for large bodies of workmen, and others employed on buildings, &c. Canobolas, from the superior altitude of its site, and its position on the fal l of the plateau towards the Great Western Plains, is preferable to that of any western site, and I believe that the comparatively high rainfall of Canobolas is climatically beneficial, and in no way injurious to health. A very long report was written by the late Mr Oliver upon the suitability of the western district for a Federal Capital. He says:In regard to land values, the figures appended show the estimated cost of absolute resumption of the western sites as originally proposed :Canobolas (Orange) Improved value of 64,700 acres (less 10,800 acres of Crown lands) outside Municipal boundaries Improved value of lands within Municipal boundaries ' ... Total Bathurst Improved value of 64,000 acres outside Municipal boundaries 5,530 acres Crown lands) at £ 4 per acre Improved value of lands within Municipal boundaries Total Forest Reefs (Millthorpe) -Im proved value of 82,000 acres (less 50,640 acres Church and School lands equals 31,360 acres) at £ 6 per acre(*) * NOTK -This valuation omits the cost of compensation in connection with Church and School iands held under lease, &c. That, I think, is a refutation of those arguments used against the quality of the land in that district. There is land estimated as worth £ 6 per acre at Millthorpe, and it is grand agricultural soil, which will produce wheat such as the honourable member for Grey has seen in his own district. Then we are told by Mr Oliver that the cost of the site would be ,£188,160, which is -very much less indeed than the cost in the Canobolas district. When we go a little further 6p 2 west, still within the fifty-miles radius, we find that Mr Oliver, in regard to Wellington, says:Wellington -Improved value of 91,500 acres outside Municipal boundaries (less £ s. d. 15,890 acres of Crown lands), at ^3 per acre ... 226,830 o o Improved value of lands The climate of within Municipal boundaries '67,535 10 o Total 394)365 1 0 0 Here is a very large area of Crown land that should be very acceptable to the people of Victoria, who are saying so much about the cost of the proposed Federal site. The lands outside the Crown lands area are valued at £ 3 per acre. The land in the Wellington Valley is magnificent; it is a very rich chocolate soil. The yield of grain there is very much superior to anything in South Australia, or to the average in Victoria. One notable fact is that grain grown there has taken the gold medal in London for its superior quality. If honor£ s. d. 365,000 o o able members sitting behind the Government wish to obtain a large area for closer settlement, there is no part of New South 592,426 o o Wales that is more suitable than the district which I have the honour to represent, say, 957,426 o o within the area described by Mr Oliver at Wellington, or the country a little further on towards Werris Creek, going (less up to Cobbora, or the land between Cobbora and Dubbo.

So that in selecting 913,184 o o a western site, we should have an almost 1,147,064 o o unlimited area of first-class land surrounding the Federal city. I do not know of any part of Australia where we could obtain such a large area of land so suitable for settlement, and which from its superiority in quality should be so acceptISS,I6O o o able to the Commonwealth. It will be noticed, from Mr Oliver's description, that a large area is what is called Church and School Land. It has not been taken up for settlement, because it was reserved for a specific purpose. scribed as Church and School Land, though it is now held under lease. for church purposes?

Land that was reserved for church and school purposes in the early days is, as honourable members may well suppose, very superior indeed, considering that the church then wielded such influence in the management of affairs at head-quarters. I should like also to direct attention to the report concerning the Carcoar-Garland site. Mr For a period of eighteen years, the records of Oliver estimates the cost of absolute resumptionFor the whole area, including Church and School lands, but excluding town of Carcoar:it ,£200,000; or, at ^3 per acre, for 50,000 acres, outside municipal boundaries, and .£35,000 for lands within those boundaries, .£185,000. Those figures allude to the site which has been specially selected as representing the western district. There is no reason whatever why honourable members should not consider the claims of any site in this district that would be equally as good and as convenient as that of CarcoarGarland. Canobolas is a most excellent site, and one that is deserving of considerable attention; but I should particularly like to say something for Wellington. Honourable members have referred to a considerable extent to Tooma. where the altitude runs from 1,200 feet up to 1,500 feet. But there is a much finer climate in the district of Wellington. Close at hand is Mount Arthur, which, as may be supposed, was named after the Duke of Wellington. The mountain overlooks the Town. The situation is not at all unlike that elf Montreal, where Mount Royal, from which the name of the city is derived, is close to it. There is a magnificent range of hills around the site. Perhaps that is the reason why it was not seriously considered by Mr Oliver. It was not that the soil was inferior, or that the water supply was not adequate, but that the altitude within the town was not deemed by him to be commendable. Buti f climate is to be considered, there is a very much finer climate in the district of Wellington than at Tooma. The people there are healthy; disease is not prevalent, and persons with weak lungs are sent there because of the salubrity of the climate. Major Barton wrote a report setting forth the case for Wellington, and I should like to say something about it, because this document throws some light upon other sites, and also because it affords information of a most acceptable character in the interests of those who are advocating the selection of a site in the western district. Mr Oliver saysThe climate of Wellington is described by a very good judge, Mr C. H . Barton, as one of the healthiest climates in the. world, though for four months in the year the heat is very great. But it is not anything like so great as the heat at Adelaide, and I suppose that there is no finer climate in Australia than that of Adelaide. the Government Astronomer, show that during the Summer quarter, the mean temperature is 73'3; during the Autumn quarter, 53-3; during the Winter quarter, 49'7; and during the Spring quarter, 68 deg. The greatest recorded temperature reached 105*9, f a n c t n e lowest 19. Then, with respect to the rainfall, the report saysThe quarterly rainfalls during the same period are very regularly distributed, being 5'83, 6'30, 5*58, and 6""84 inches, showing for the year a rainfall of very nearly 25 inches. It has to be remembered that that rain falls upon magnificent soil, at regular periods of the year, when it is most wanted. The altitude of Wellington is 995 feet, and that of the proposed Federal territory averages 1,200 feet. That is about the altitude of Tooma. . On this subject the evidence of the witness above quoted, Mr Barton, went to show that the pretensions of Wellington to possess the Seat of Government depend mainly on the construction of the railway from Werris Creek, on the Northern line, to Wellington, and that, without that connection, Wellington could not be considered accessible, so far as Brisbane is concerned-a n objection which, in the opinion of the witness, is common to all the western sites; but that, if connected with BrokenH ill and Werris Creek, Wellington would be a singularly central site, and would be very accessible to Adelaide, Brisbane, and Melbourne. On this head, he produced the annexed Tables and Report. These figures have been used by quite a number of plagiarists without acknowledgment. I have read newspaper articles published in all the States in which they have been quoted, but in very few of those articles have they been used for the purpose",20,Rolls

I refer honourable members to the following ""Table of distances from Wellington railway station to Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, and Newcastle by railway lines now in existence "": From WellingtonTo Adelaide vid Melbourne To Brisbane vid Sydney To Melbourne vid Blayney To Sydney vid Bathurst To Newcastle vid Sydney ... 350 miles.

The Public Works Committee of New South Wales has recently held quite a number of sittings in that district, and they have reported that if a line is constructed from Werris Creek to the western line, it will open up magnificent country in the locality of Cobbora. I am happy to be able to say that this large district is also in my electorate. The electorate covers 10,000 square milesi and though I speak with Some little modesty, I may say that I think it is really the finest district in New South Wales. All the lines to which I have referred are within easy reach of these magnificent agricultural districts. Cobbora has not yet been established as an agricultural district, simply through lack of railway communication. When a railway is constructed from Werris Creek across to the western line, it will When these lines bring the land in that district under settlement. I have already referred honourable members to the yields of crops grown. I have said that last .year, in one or two cases, the yield of wheat went up 'to as much .as 60 bushels an acre, and the average yield of the district was just upon 30 bushels to the acre. Throughout this district of mine there is grown the finest grain produced in the world. The Wellington flour secured the gold medal in London, and I mention that with some pride, because, although South Australia has hitherto always been the State which has produced thefinestflour, this district secured the gold medal against even South Australia.

There is there to be found a magnificent climate and soil, and an abundant water supply. When I am talking to honourable members who are practical men, it is unnecessary to enter upon a long dissertation upon the possibilities of water conservation in a district in some parts of which there is a rainfall of 39 inches, and rivers running in all directions. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro smiles at this, but I am not speaking of Dalgety. I admit that the Snowy River is a magnificent river, but ... miles. there are possibilities in the western district to which I refer which are not to be ... 248 miles. surpassed in any other part of Australia. I have heard honourable members ascend to poetry in describing some of the suggested sites; but when one honourable member last night, in speaking about the western district, said it has not the undulations to be found in some other parts, I could not help thinking that Washington and St. Petersburg were established in swamps, and that Amsterdam was also established in a swamp, and that the Royal palace was built upon piles. I might refer honourable members to other great cities of the world that have been built on sites which are not to be compared with any of those in New South Wales which have been brought under the notice of the Committee. I am glad to see that the Postmaster-General approves of what I am saying. The honourable gentleman knows that the garden of Australia is to be found over the Blue Mountains, and that if honourable members desire to possess a Federal Capital which will do honour to the Commonwealth, they should establish it there. is the place for it. gentleman's lungs are not too strong, and within that district will be made available I say. that the atmosphere of Wellington to us.

I had no intention of speaking at such"" length; but, in conclusion, I wish to say that the people of New South Wales ask this Parliament to establish the Seat of Government within the western district. That district is just beyond the 100-miles radius provided for iii the Constitution.

The result will be that before very long the private individuals and companies concerned will be using all their influence to keep the Seat of Government in Melbourne, and the Ministry will have a very plausible argument for postponing its removal elsewhere, in the fact that they will have entered into leases, having many years to run, of buildings for which they pay very high rents. That reason will, of course, commend itself to honourable members who, on the ground of economy, allege that it is necessary to wait a few years before building Federal offices in a -Capital of our own. vernment remaining in Melbourne, as I should be opposed to its being placed in Sydney, for several reasons, of which the influence of the local press over the Parliament is one of the chief, while the second is the advantage which is given.to the State in whose capital the Federal Parliament meets. the representatives of Victoria could, at a critical moment, be all brought to the 'House within about fifteen minutes, and distant States, such as Western Australia and Queensland, whose members have to reside in Melbourne almost permanently, are also well represented. But the representatives of South Australia and New South Wales, who go to their homes at week ends, cannot always be recalled in less time than some days. . Consequently Victoria has an advantage over New South Wales, which, in my opinion, is equal to an additional representation of three members; and she has a proportional advantage over South Australia. If-we had a Seat of Government of our own, however, none of the States would have an advantage over the others in this respect. conclusion, I urge that the compact made at the Premiers' Conference with the Premier of New South Wales should be carried out, and the Seat of Government located within that State at a suitable site, as near as possible to the 100 miles radius of Sydney. I think that I have shown that the most suitable site available is at Lyndhurst, in the western district. I might keep this question has apparently been approached by some honourable members withI would point out a due acquaintance with the Constitution, and, perhaps, also without a full knowledge of the compact entered into at the time the Constitution Bill was submitted to a referendum. When the first Bill was presented to the people of Australia, no condition was made with regard to the Capital. New South Wales voted in favour of the Bill. tent of the statutory majority. We must suppose that the condition imposed by the Parliament of New South Wales had the approval of the whole of the people. I quite admit that legislation has been passed in this Parliament which does not represent the will of the people; but if the honourable member were in favour of such legislation, he would contend that it was legislation by I am opposed to the Seat of Gothe people for the people, and, therefore, we must apply the same rule to the Federal referendum. In order to induce the people of New South Wales to accept the Constitution Bill, a proposal was madethat the Capital should be located in that 'State. It is true that local jealousies prevented the Premiers from fixing upon Sydney, which, At the present time as the oldest capital city in Australia, should have been selected. From my point of view, the question should have been left open; but we can deal only with the facts now presented to us. There is no doubt that a great many people in New South Wales thought that the Seat of Government should have been established at Sydney, and I am rather inclined to think that if the question had been submitted to the whole of the people of Australia, that site would have been chosen. However, we are now called upon to select a site in New South Wales, but distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney. I should like to draw attention to the wording of section 125 of the Constitution, which shows what was in the minds of the Premiers of the States who In met in conference. I contend that the clear impression was that the Capital would be located at Sydney unless some limitation were imposed, and that, in order to prevent Sydney from being chosen, it was stipulated that the Capital city should be situated not less than 100 miles from that place.

I would point out that it was further provided that, in return for the concession which New South Wales was to receive, the Parliament should sit at Melbourne until it met at the Seat of Government. Why were these two concessions made by New South Wales, unless it was thought that the Capital Site would be chosen as near as possible to Sydney, outside of the 100-miles limit ? I think that if we look at the provision in the propart of that price, they are now asking that per spirit, we shall recognise that that was the idea and intention of those who drafted the section. and learned member, think that it would have been better to establish the Federal Capital at Sydney rather than at some place beyond the 100-miles limit? it would have been infinitely better to establish the permanent Seat of Government at either Sydney or Melbourne. These two cities are undoubtedly destined to become the greatest commercial centres in Australia, and I do not approve of a Federal Capital being created merely as a place of meeting for Members of Parliament. However, honourable members do not accept that view, and I do not think it is necessary to argue the matter. abide by the Constitution. by the Constitution, and we cannot, except at considerable difficulty, secure its amendment. It is very questionable whether it would be worth our while to incur the Gangers to which we should be exposed if we were to attempt to amend the Constitution in order to secure the adoption of Sydney as the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. We are not called upon to discuss that question at present, because wo are preceding to act in conformity with the Constitution. In return for the concession to New South Wales regarding the Capital, it was agreed that the Parliament should meet, as it has been meeting, at Melbourne, and that all the Crown lands within the Federal territory should be granted by the New South Wales Government free of charge, and it is obvious that it was intended that if any advantage could be given to New South Wales by the selection of the Capital site, within her borders, then only such a site should, be selected as would confer that advantage upon her. It may be that fhe advantage will not be a very valuable one. Some honourable members' assert that wherever the Federal Capital may be situated no advantage will be conferred upon New South Wales. That, however, is hardly the question. The point is whether, in the opinion of the people of New South Wales, any advantage would be conferred upon them. As they have agreed to pay the price, and are already paying in the selection of the site the advantage of locality shall, as far as possible, be conferred upon them. Viewed from this standpoint, the selection of a site, such as Tooma, which, by the shortest means of communication, is situated 430 miles from Sydney, as against only 270 miles from Melbourne, would, in the minds of the great majority of the people of New South Wales, involve a violation of the spirit of the compact. . member's figures are wrong.

If a line were built direct from Yass to Tumut, through that country, its cost would not be less than ,£50,000 per mile. way would be practically impossible. In surveying that district for some time, so that I know what I am speaking about. When I mention that surveying work costs TOO per cent, more than the ordinary scale -of fees in that country, although it is lightly timbered, and simply because it is so precipitous and hilly, honourable members will .understand its character. Consequently, I put railway construction quite out of the question. . Nobody who has ever been -through that country will imagine that it is practicable to build a railway through it -without tunnelling pretty well the whole -distance. It is scarcely necessary, therefore, to discuss the matter from that standpoint. I ask those honourable members who are anxious to see effect given to the spirit of the Constitution, to regard it from that stand-point. If any advantage is to be gained by New South Wales from having -the Capital established in her midst, that advantage should be conceded as some return for the Parliament having met in Melbourne during the past three years. WhilstI admit that the site upon the Upper Murray is one of the most picturesque which can be found, and that some of the land surrounding it is very rich, I still think that honourable members who speak lightly of the work of constructing a railway from Tumut to Tooma, have not considered the real difficulties to be encountered. I would merely point out that if a line were built from a point situated ten miles to the northern side of Tumut, up the Gilmore Creek, and then down again, it would be running practically the whole time upon an old volcanic range. At one time, no doubt, there was a considerable area of that country, but it has been washed away, so that to-day only the remains of the old volcanic range exist. Starting from an altitude of 1,000 feet, it would be necessary for any railway which might be built to rise to a height of 3,270 feet. is the altitude ? statement of Mr Chesterman. When I was asked some question, in regard to this matter last session, I said that the altitude was about 3,000 feet. Mr Chesterman, however, declares that the height of the gap above sea-level is 3,270 feet. That altitude was taken by means of an aneroid, and would probably be within 10 feet of the exact height. I repeat that if a railway were constructed it would require to rise 2,000 feet in the short distance of twenty-five miles, and to fall again to the same extent upon the other side. When I tell the Committee that the country to be traversed is all of a volcanic naturethat it is practically a narrow range-honorable members will understand that the work would present difficulties which, whilst not insuperable to an engineer, would involve such an enormous expenditure as would practically place it outside the region of probability. be always a slow line? on account of the cuttings and short curves which would be necessary certainly it would be impossible to have more than ten chains curves it would be . a very slow line to travel upon, and a very expensive one to construct.

All I contend is that it is impracticable, because of the expenditure that would be incurred, and because of the small traffic which it would carry. honourable and learned member. will find scarcely any engineer in New South Wales or Victoria to agree with him. I would further point out that if this Parliament decides to acquire any area along the border of Victoria, or any other State, it will be doing something which section 123 of the Constitution clearly prohibits it from doing. That section providesThe Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the consent of the Parliament of a State and the approval of the majority of the electors of a State, voting upon the question, increase, diminish or otherwise alter the limits of the State upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed on, and ma}', with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any increase or diminution, or alteration of territory in relation to any State affected. It will thus be seen that it was never contemplated that any alteration should be effected in the boundaries of a State. In any case, we could not do what has' been suggested without first getting the consent of the Parliament of New South Wales; and. secondly, the approval of its people. Nearly twelve months ago I pointed this out to the House when a proposal was submitted to extend the Federal territory from the Murrumbidgee to the Murray. The more I have considered the matter since, the more confirmed have I become in my opinion. Last night the honourable member for South Sydney also pointed out the effect of that provision. We can only overcome that section by refusing to extend our boundary to the Murray between. ber says, by making a chain road between.

The wording of section 123 is so clear that it cannot be avoided. It was for that reason that it did not appear to me that we ought to enter into the question of the selection of Tooma as fully as we otherwise might have done. A certain price has been paid by New South Wales to secure the alvantage of having the Capital within its boundaries. was that the Parliament should meet at Melbourne until tbe establishment of the Federal Capital. £70,000 for that privilege. discuss that question, because I have from the first held that such a provision should not have been placed in the bond. It is in the Constitution, however, and we have to deal with things as they are. We must recognise the compact, not as we, in the light of the fuller experience of to-day, would have made it, but as agreed to ""by the two great contracting parties. I ask that it should be as far as possible carried out. In my opinion, Tooma is not an accessible site, and many years must elapse before it will be connected with the railway system of the State. Accessibility is one of the chief factors to be considered in making a selection, and the only Teaspn why I do not place Dalgety first in the list in this respect is that, while some honourable members say that it will be connected with the Victorian railway system by a railway line running from Bairnsdale, it' does not seem to me that such a railway is within the realm of practicable work. first? first consideration, and shall give my reasons for that belief. If the Capital be not established in a readily accessible position the whole of the correspondence of the Commonwealth will be delayed sometimes for half-a-day, or more. Are we to subject the people to this disability, merely because honourable members have a love of the artistic, and are anxious to be able, on leaving Parliament House after their day's labour, to survey some beauty spot in the neighbourhood? We are not to make a selection from a purely artistic point of view. Art arises only when a nation has reached a high stage of civilization, and our first consideration should be the interests of the great bulk of the people. the convenience of legislators, or for the convenience of the people ? to study the mere convenience of honourable members. I for one have no desire to consider the interests of legislators by voting for the selection of a site merely because it would be a pleasant, pretty, and comfortable place in which to reside. My idea of a Legislature is that it should be composed of a body of men who meet together for the purposes of business. If they can carry on the business of the country, and, at the has paid same time, devote a certain degree of attention to artistic surroundings, well and good; but mere beauty of surroundings should not be the main factor in the determination of this question. One of the reasons why I have a liking for Dalgety is that it is fairly accessible, and that 'if it were selected, New South Wales would have no serious cause of complaint, because she would be called upon to construct only a very short line, forming part of a railway of which the State Parliament has already practically approved. The selection of that site would therefore not be open to the same objection as would attach to the choosing of one' of the other suggested sites which the New South Wales Parliament has never even thought of connecting with the railway system of the State. If we consider Dalgety from the point of view of water supply, it unquestionably stands before Tooma, or any other site. No doubt Tooma possesses a fairly good water supply* but its climate is practically the same as that of Table Top, a site which has already been rejected by this House.",27,Rolls

Albury is situated in a valley, and Welaregang is just at the entrance to it. I may tell the honourable member that maize and pumpkins and tobacco will grow fairly well in the valley. Tumut is also a place at which tobacco might be grown, but at certain seasons the climate is not that which one would select as the most desirable. pointed this out when the matter was under consideration last session, but my remarks were not treated as being worthy of that attention which I thought they ought to receive. Subsequently a number of honourable members visited Tumut, and on that occasion found the weather so hot rthat most of them have since told me that my description of it was a perfectly fair one. We know that that one visit caused a number of honourable members to change their opinion as to the suitability of that site. If honourable members visit Welaregang, or any part of the Upper Murray district, they will find that the valley is very close during the summer season. I spent some time in the district, and found no difference between the climate there and that of Tumut. The mountains are nearer Welaregang than Tumut, but both places are situated in a valley, and during the summer it is very' close.

No exception could be taken on that ground, however, to the selection of Dalgety, because I feel satisfied that a 1 ail way will be constructed to it as part of a scheme to eventually connect Bombala with the State railway system. Therefore the objection 'which I have to the selection of Tooma does not apply to Dalgety. But, in spite of the last-named site being preeminent in the matter of water supply, I think that it labours unrier other disabilities which debar its selection. Honourable members coming from Victoria to the Federal Capital would have, for scores of years, to and then to travel by the branch line to Cooma. vears. be the case.

182,Mr Fowler (Perth),"I am one whobe honoured in that respect. that the Federal Capital should not be established in one of the large commercial or industrial centres. In that respect both Sydney and Melbourne have been put out of the question, and very wisely so. Those of us who have been members of the Federal Parliament from its inception, must have found at various times that our presence in this large industrial and commercial centre has not always been fraught with the best results to legislation. No matter where we go, if we settle in a large industrial centre, it will be found that the same circumstances will surround the making of legislation. As a matter of fact, the two countries whose conditions most nearly resemble our own-namely , the United States and Canada-hav e both been compelled to remove their capitals from the large centres to what appeared at the time of the removal to be remote villages. The people of the United States were obliged to remove their capital first from Philadelphia, and latterly from New York, to a situation that was denounced at the time as being absolutely in the wilderness, and inaccessible. Again the people of Canada were compelled, by force of circumstances -the particular circumstance immediately operative being no less than the burning of Parliament buildings by an excited mob -to remove from Montreal to the present position at Ottawa. Those who consider what the surroundings of a legislative body ought to be, will not, I believe, have any hesitation in adopting the wise view taken .by those who drew up our Constitution, which requires the Federal Capital to be somewhere other than in one of our large cities. In -determining this question we have -mor e perhaps than in regard to any other question which we have yet discusseda very great responsibility indeed devolving upon us. have yet enacted can be altered by this Parliament. cessitate no great sacrifices; and, as a matter of fact, any modification of any of our existing Acts would be undertaken by this Parliament with very little hesitation. Buti f we decide upon the Federal Capital, and the necessary work is undertaken; and if by-and-by we remove to the selected place and establish the Seat of Government there, the chances are that we shall have taken an irrevocable step in the history of Australia. However unwise the choice may have been, it will be one that in all probability the people of the Commonwealth I believe will have to abide by. Therefore, we ought to be particularly careful to make the best choice possible. I regret a good many of the arguments that have been put forward ; they have been too provincial. The honourable member for Robertson incidentally referred to the position of the Western Australian members in this Parliament, and made the astounding statement that those members were in some way responsible foi the burden of taxation which New South Wales at present has to carry. That statement does not require any refutation from me. Those who wish to have a refutation of it will find it in the pages of Hansard, whei: the Tariff was being discussed. I think 1 can claim for myself, and for the other representatives of the Western Stats, that wt approach this question with minds absolutely free fro m any State prejudice, or any consideration of conserving State interests. It is a very good thing indeed for the Commonwealth that we are able to approach the question in that way., and I can only regret that our numbers are not stronger, so as to counteract what appears to me to be the provincial spirit manifested by some honourable membersa spirii which may operate to the detriment of the best interests of the Commonwealth. It has been argued that the first consideration ought to be accessibility. I am unable to adopt that view. I ' have mentioned that Washington was selected as the site for the capital of the United States against the wishes of a large number of people residing in the large centres of population. I hold in my hand an extract from a document that will be found amongst the papers of the United State -; Senate. It was printed in 1889, and forms portion of a report of a committee of the Columbia Historical Society upon the question of the transfer of the Federal Any legislation that we Capital to the Columbian territory.

185,Mr Fowler,"I am not at present reobtain what we require in those districts, and if we can succeed in attracting population to them, I , for one, will very readily with the right honourable member for East put aside all other considerations. The mere question of accessibility, viewed in that light, is reduced to very unimportant dimensions indeed. If , in addition to this consideration we can secure natural beauty, a magnificent water supply, and splendid soil, I take it that we have very weighty evidence in favour of the selection of a site in the uplands of Australia. In the last Parliament I gave a vote, on these considerations, for the Monaro Tableland; but on this occasion I intend to alter my vote, without prejudice in the least to Monaro, because I still think a very great deal of that part of the country as a possible Federal Capital Site, but because there is another district which I think ought to be reported on by experts before we come to a final decision. It is a district which I admit has been brought forward at a somewhat late hour, but it is nevertheless entitled to some consideration. It has been said several times in this Chamber that the honourable member for Hume has a great many sites in his electorate, and that he has been particularly adroit in retreating from one to another its each has been discovered to be unfavorable, and that, finally in his selection of Tooma he has been able to secure the assistance of many who went on a picnic with him to that part of the country. I wish to say that I went on a visit to that part of the country, and it was not by any means a picnic. It was a very unpleasant experience indeed, so far as my personal comfort was concerned. I think that even the right honourable member for East Sydney, who designated the trip as a picnic, would have shown a good deal of dissatisfaction with the condition of the elethen the beauty of its environment is ments, and sometimes even with the eatables and drinkables that were placed before us on that trip. I feel sure that if I were to refer to the right honourable gentleman as having enjoyed a picnic on the top of Mount Canobolas on a certain occasion he would very strongly deprecate such a reference. A couple of years ago I saw the right honourable gentleman near the top of Mount Canobolas, sitting with a glass of gingerale in his hand, and a sjd -tin of corned beef on the ground in front of him. I am quite sure that that was no picnic for the right honourable gentleman. I can say honestly that the latest trip I took to inspect a Federal Capital Site was much more unpleasant than the one I made to the top of Mount Canobolas in company Sydney. I considered it my duty to look at this portion of the country, but not on the representations of the honourable member for Hume. That honourable gentleman certainly .spoke to me on the subject, as he had a right to do; but I candidly confess that if I had had only his word in recommendation of this particular district, I should have taken it with a considerable discount, knowing that the honourable gentleman is naturally interested in that part of the country, and that he would consequently be unconsciously biased in its favour. I went to Tooma largely on the recommendation of the honourable"" member for Grampians, who, like myself, is perfectly disinterested in this matter. I must say that I am exceedingly glad I took the trip, and saw for myself what is to be seen in that part of the Commonwealth. I have no desire to attempt a description of the visit, but I am bound to confess that in driving up that valley, and on to the rolling uplands cf the Tooma site, I found country which, from a picturesque point of view, I never had expected to discover in Australia. . The view of Mount Kosciusko to be had from the Welaregang station is one which I think few people, no matter how prosaic their temperament, could behold unmoved. Ridge after ridge rose in a gradual succession of terraces from the river, and above all towered the mighty mountain, his magnificent shoulders clothed with a beautiful mantle of white, which, when we saw it, was glittering in the sunshine, as if sprinkled with diamonds. I say that if a report on that site would show it to be favorable in all other respects, something of which this Parliament, Australia as a whole, and the future generations of Australia would have every reason to be proud. I do not absolutely pledge myself to that site. I desire to have the necessary expert evidence as regards detail of which no honourable member on an ordinary visit could make himself master. But. so far as I could see, we had there almost every requirement that could be desired for a Federal Capital. The land is magnificent, and the water supply would. I tlunk beyond question, be ample'. Within a few rmles we could find an almost tropical climate along the river flats, and on the uplands a bracing atmosphere that I have not experienced since I left Scotland. On the flats there could be produced nearly all forms of tropical vegetation. climate in that district. There is a tropical climate along the river flats, and we could rise to elevations where we should have a degree of cold which, as I say, I did not expect to find anywhere in Australia. As regards productions, we could have a corresponding variety. We could have almost tropical vegetation along the river flats ; along the slopts w<; could have sub-tropical products; whilst on the uplands we should be able to grow vegetables and fruits of the colder zones which can only be raised with extreme difficulty in most portions of Australia. I take it that it is a most important consideration for us that, within a very few miles, we could, in that part of Australia, have such a large variety of climate and production. In conclusion I would urge upon the Committee that a further opportunity should be afforded honourable members for a close inspection of the locality. I feel sure that the visit would be one which honourable members would enjoy, and it would, I think, be to most of them the entry into a territory such as many imagine cannot be found in Australia at all. I shall vote as I have alrea'dy indiWales for joining the Union, and some honcated, not because I wish to commit myself to the selection of this site, but because I recognise that in another place a vote has been cast for Dalgety, and that if a majority can be secured for Tooma in this House, there will be that consideration given to the district which it deserves, and which I hope it will receive. I trust that in our deliberations on this important matter we shall continually keep before us our responsibility to the Commonwealth, and to the future generations of Australia. propose to deal at any great length with this question, but since I possess a fairly intimate knowledge of the country comprised in the only three sites likely to receive practical consideration-the Murray site, the Tumut site, and the Lyndhurst siteI feel it incumbent upon me to reply to some of the statements which have been made about them. stress has been laid on the fact that the Tooma site has only recently been brought under notice. But may I remind honourable members that when the last Bill was before us, I , with others, voted for the Tumut site on the clear understanding that the Tooma site would be reported .on. : reported on? because of the native modesty of the then Minister of Home Affairs, in whose electorate Tooma is situated, and who had other sites in his electorate. But, at any rate, he gave us to understand that the site should be reported on. The knowledge which I have gained in regard to the various districts of which I am about to speak is not the result of recent observations, because I had not the privilege of visiting them with other honourable members, but of my experience in travelling through them, generally with stock, more than twenty years ago. The information which I possess has not been gained by a hurried glance. I have spent as much as a month in travelling from Tumut to Welaregang through Tumberumba, and I have been from Welaregang up the Murray towards Mount Kosciusko. I spent as much as three months on the station on which the Dalgety site is situated. I have . also travelled repeatedly through the Bombala district, and through the Lyndhurst district. A good deal has been said about the price which was demanded by New South orable members have gone so far as to claim that the Parliament of that State should select the Federal territory. My reading of the Constitution, however, is that the first step to be taken is for this Parliament to select a territory which will embrace an area suitable for the site of the Seat of Government, and that the site of the city should be afterwards chosen. I understand that what is now proposed is that we shall select the Federal territory, and not the site of the Seat of Government. That, I think, is the proper course to follow. has been laid before us refers to sites, not to territory. information in our possession is incomplete, and that there are conflicting statements in regard to the various sites.

230,Mr Sydney Smith,"On e of the sites is that later on. It is admitted, even by the advocates of the Lyndhurst site, that an adequate water supply is one of the essentials. I admit that, so far as its elevation is concerned, Lyndhurst should be a healthy locality, and I also acknowledge that there is some very good land in the district. It is not like the Monaro country, where people might starve, so far as production is concerned, because it would be impossible to supply a very large population with food. At Lyndhurst, there is country within easy reach, which would be capable of producing all the food required by a large population. The water supply would not, however, in my estimation, be sufficient. Without entering too much into details, I would point out that all the authorities are agreed as to the sources from which the water supply will be derived. They are the Coombing Rivulet, Flyer's Creek, Cadiangullong Creek, Brown's Creek, and the Lachlan River, near Mount Macdonald. Now, what have the Commissioners to say with regard to the Coombing Rivulet?The Coombing Rivulet, which is proposed as the primary source of supply, has a catchment above the point of off-take, about one mile and a half south-west of the village of Shaw, of about eighty square miles, consisting of hilly country, in which is included the eastern slopes of Mount Macquarie. At the time of inspection the rivulet was practically dry, so that flood waters only would have to be depended upon. In ordinary seasons, however, there is said to be running water in this creek throughout the year. Therefore, it is proposed to obtain Then the Commissioners saythe chief supply from a rivulet which was dry at the time of the inspecof inspection, has a catchment area above the protion of the Commissioners. The Commisposed site for the dam, below the junction with sioners were specially appointed to inSoldier's Creek, of fourteen and a half square quire into this particular question, and I bolas regard their report as the most reliable collecting water.

I am only pointing to the difference between the two authorities. The Commissioners, whose report must be regarded as an honest one, unless honourable members are prepared to challenge it, state that one source of supply, the Coombing rivulet, was dry at the time of their inspection. They say furtherThe land included in the catchment area is used partly for cultivation and partly for pastoral purposes. About 46,540 acres have been alienated, the remainder being Crown land. To insure the purity of the water the whole of it should be resumed. Therefore, the position at Lyndhurst is practically the same as at Dalgety, and a large expenditure would be required for resumptions in connection with the catchment area. In a case where storm waters only can be relied upon, and the catchment area comprises a large amount of cultivated land, we can imagine what an enormous quantity of silt would be carried into the reservoir. One of the other sources of supply is Flyer's Creek, which is thus referred toFlyers Creek, which takes its rise near the Canobolas Mountain, has a catchment area above the site of the dam, at the outlet end of Long Swamp, of eighteen square miles, consisting principally of hilly country favorable for the collection of water. The land is used for both agricultural and pasforal purposes, and would have to be acquired to insure the purity of the water, which would involve the purchase of about 10,750 acres, the remainder being Crown lands. Therefore, in that case also, we should have to rely upon storm waters.

These are the four creeks from which it is proposed to draw a supply of water for the Lyndhurst site. I notice also that a report has been secured upon the feasibility of obtaining a supply by pumping from the Lachlan, but the cost of that scheme renders it impracticable. I do not intend to say anything regarding the Lyndhurst site, further than that the cost of obtaining an adequate water supply practically condemns it. member should read Mr Wade's report. have already stated that upon the previous occasion when this question was discussed, I voted with the Welaregang site clearly in my mind. It is unfortunate that we are not in possession of a full report upon that site. The information which is available, however, places it at the head of the list so far as the possession of all essentials for a Federal Capital are concerned. Of course, if the Committee desire to obtain a site in close proximity to Sydney, it may be possible to get an equally good one. Nevertheless, I venture to say that we cannot obtain a better location for a Federal Capital than exists at Welaregang. honourable Werriwa has declared that from the stand-point of climate it is practically upon an equality with, and is similar to, the Tumut site. Upon that point Mr about £^5,000 per mile. That sum comChesterman, who has made a hurried report upon this particular site, and who has been resident in that district for some five years, saysThe Welaregang-Tooma Valley is protected by lower ranges from the cold westerlies, the prevailing winter winds, which blow toward the Snowy Mountains. These mountains, in a direct line, are about thirty miles south-easterly, and their proximity tempers the summer climate, from them. Though the average altitude of the suggested Site may not exceed about 1,100 feet, the above local conditions contribute to renand sixty miles. der the climate free from marked extremes, .and it will be noticed that the situation is immediately miles as the crow flies. south of the 36th parallel of latitude. With its varying elevations this district offers various climatic conditions. Take, for instance, Tumberumba, about seventeen miles north, where the climate is distinctly more Alpine in character, the winters being severe. Again, about seventeen miles easterly, is the old Toolong Hut, situated in classified snow country-that is, country "" usually covered with snow for a part of each year, and considered to be unfit for continuous use or occupation."" When honourable members declare that the elevation of a particular district governs its climatic conditions, I would direct their attention to the fact that this particular site is within seventeen miles of the snow line in one direction, and twenty-five miles in the other. As a matter of fact, it is within seventy miles of perpetual snow. These conditions, I claim, must materially influence its general climatic conditions. "" With regard to accessibility, we have been told that it is absolutely impossible to construct a railway into that district. Yet we are aware that Tumut is already connected by that the line could be made a fast one, if necessary. Twenty years ago, to my own knowledge, teamsters used to haul an average of 15 cwt. per horse over what way practically a bush road between Tumut and Tumberumba. That is sufficient proof that it is not impossible to extend the GundagaiTumut line from Gadara to Welaregang. In this report, estimates are given of the cost of constructing a line upon the Victorian side of that site. But I would point out that those estimates were prepared in the boom times of the early nineties. We know that since then railways which were surveyed at the same time have been built for half the estimate which was then furnished. The Consequently, we may reasonably expect and learned member for a reduction of 40 per cent, in the cost of constructing a railway upon the Victorian side of that site. It is fair to assume, therefore, that it could be constructed for pares favourably with the latest estimate we have of the cost of constructing a railway from Cooma to Dalgety. It is estimated that the construction of that line would involve an expenditure of ,£4,700 per mile, and I venture to affirm that the cost of building a railway from Welaregang to Gadara would not exceed ,£5,000 per mile. the easterly breezes blowing Welaregang to Gadara? cost indeed this site could be made accessible to travellers by constructing a loop line from the main line between Melbourne and Svdney.

I admit that, so far as accessibility is concerned, Lyndhurst possesses an advantage, but in regard to water supply, I do not think it could be argued for one moment, on the evidence available, that that is a desirable place for the Federal city.

It turned out, however, that after the animals had been turned out on those beautiful, undulating granite hills around Dalgety, for a week, I did not know them; and I venture to say that if It will be found they had been left to find their own food there, nobody would have been able to recognise them as horses.

It is not our own convenience, or the immediate requirements of to-day, that we have to consider. We have to consider the future of Australia, and to do that, a few essentials must be taken into account. I do not think for a moment that the Capital city will ever rival or out-pace the present commercial centres. It may become a centre of population; we do not know what developments there mav be in the future. We must, however, consider, first of all., water supply and climatic condifor the Bill. tions, and if these are satisfactory, ascertain whether there is a possibility of increased settlement and production.

But it seems to me that they overlooked the Such a climost important fact, which I think really ought to commend itself' to us more than any other fact at the present juncture. That is that we are now fulfilling an obligation which the Commonwealth incurred towards New South Wales when that State joined in the Federal compact some years ago. What is the history of this affair? Why is it that at the present time we are confined to New South Wales territory in the selection of a Federal Capital site? The Federal compact was felt by the people of New South Wales to expose them to a very serious risk, to which the other States were not exposed. The fiscal question was considered to be of immense importance. That point may not commend itself to other honourable members, but the fact certainly remains that the people of New South Wales attached paramount importance to the fiscal question, and the risk of sacrificing their fiscal autonomy was so serious as to make them pause before entering that union of the six colonies which every one in Australia desired to see consummated. did not pause; .there was a majority in favour of the Commonwealth Bill at the A considerable period first referendum. for Melbourne Ports and some others have thrown a great deal of vituperative eloquence at the State from which I have the honour to come, because she saw fit to take what was, in my opinion, a very prudent step with regard to the first referendum.

There is no doubt, at any rate, that on the occasion of the first referendum in New South Wales, it was strongly felt by those who were in a position to know by the leaders of opinion-that the Federal Capital question was, in the opinion of the people, of the utmost importance. It was felt that the Premier of New South Wales should be intrusted with the mandate of consulting with the Premiers of the other States, in order to see whether they could arrive at some sort of compromise. The Premiers met in Melbourne. As every one knows, the Premier and the people of New South Wales would naturally have preferred to have' the Capital fixed in Sydney, which was the centre of the State. Commonwealth. the Conference of Premiers, that New South Wales was not entitled to that unique privilege. Ultimately it was.agreed that New South Wales was to have the Capital within her borders, but that it should be shorn of much of its advantage, from the State point of view. The Conference passed the folam not thinking lowing resolution: It is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well he left to the Parliament to decide. for Melbourne Ports need not applaud until he has heard the whole resolution. sentiment underlying the resolution. But in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales, at a reasonable distance from that city. The people of New South Wales knew what that resolution was when they accepted the Commonwealth Bill. They read it in its broader meaning. they could. by some honourable members to read it in any way they can. But I think that the people of the other States will be in favour of fulfilling to the utmost limit the bond entered into between New South Wales and the other States of the Commonwealth.

In view of. the fact that New South Wales took that view, and that on the strength of it she entered into the Federal partnership, I hold that the question of the locality of the Federal city is one in which New South Wales is peculiarly interested-in which she is interested more than the rest of the Commonwealth. But there is another question, namely, that of the expense incurred in building the Capital, and in making it accessible. matter of expense is a Federal question, in which all the States are equally interested. having entered into this partnership, their worse fears with regard to the fiscal ques: tion were realized. As the result of it her taxation has been increased by £1,500,000 per annum. think that the question of the Tariff has anything to do with this matter. South Wales could have reduced their taxation in other ways. New South Wales has incurred this increased taxation, she is now more than ever entitled to that consideration which she expected when she joined the Union. It is very significant that whereas the taxation of New South Wales has been increased, taxation throughout the rest of Australia-wit h the exception of Western Australia-ha s not been increased. I do not think that any State is better pleased than is New South Wales that the other States have not also suffered increases, but still the fact remains that taxation in New South Wales has been considerably augmented. It is now said that the State Parliament could have reduced the amount of taxation. only direct taxation which they could have diminished was to the amount of half-a-milSeat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. lion As a consequence of this heavy ins creased Customs and Excise taxation, the people of New South Wales now feel that they are bearing the whole cost of Federation. There is not the slightest doubt about ity. Such being the resolution Customs revenue in 1901 amounted, to less than £[2,000,000. In 1903 it amounted to nearly £[3,500.000. In other words, there was an increase of slightly more than _£J:,500.000.

I was giving what I considered to be a pertinent illustration, but if the Chairman rules that it is out of order. I will bow to his decision. Our duty obviously is to render to New South Wales a fulfilment of 'the obligation which induced her to enter the Federation. To render that obligation we ought not to choose a site that will be of no benefit to her, but a site which will satisfy the people of New South Wales that the Commonwealth Parliament is endeavouring to honour the obligations entered into in their liberal and true sense. I propose to consider the different sites from a double aspect Tthat of location, which is the serious aspect from the New South Wales point of view; and that of expense, which is the Federal aspect.

336,Mr Kelly,"I think that the feelingsaccrue to New South Wales from the location of the Capital at Welaregang are absolutely n i l . member's stand-point? have explained, I am considering the matter from two stand-points. I know that honourable members from Western Australia are very airy in their views about expense; but I can assure the honourable member that it is necessary to consider the various sites from the point of view of expenditure. I am dividing the aspects of the matter into two -the view which the people of New South Wales might reasonably take, and that which the people of the Commonwealth as a whole might reasonably take. The first is the question of locality, which is peculiarly of State interest; and the second has relation to expense, in which the whole Commonwealth is directly interested. I hold that on the first of these two points the Welaregang site is altogether out cf the running. It is inaccessible from the point of view of New South Wales. It is on the border of that State. It is a place which would draw all its supplies from a neighbouring State. In this I an: merely putting the New South Wales point of view. the members from other States to attach more importance to the point than they are predisposed to do, having regard to the interests they represent. The State of New South Wales would derive no advantage whatever from the establishment of the Federal Capital at Welaregang. ment there would place that State in a worse position than that in which she is at present, because it must not be forgotten that New South Wales must supply all the Crown lands free, and forego all taxation on the alienated lands. The establishment of the Capital at Welaregang would therefore render the fulfilment of an obligation, from which New South Wales expected to derive an advantage, only a new means of irritating the people of that State; it would mean a'fresh sacrifice, and a new source of unfederal feeling. A t present New South Wales is in a state of unrest, because the settlement of this question has been delayed for some years. It is now our duty, not only to at once secure its settlement, but to allay the irritation that exists. In Welaregang we have a site which is distinctly unsatisfactory to the mother State, and one about which we practically know nothing. It has not been surveyed, and we are being asked to take a leap in the dark which may afterwards expose this Parliament to the ridicule of the civilized world. We. have before us an No , not altogether. As I extremely scratchy report on the Tooma district. That is not the fault of its author, because he was asked, without making a survey or examination of the district, to sit down in his office and furnish Parliament with a report on which we are supposed to decide for all time the Federal Capital of Australia. In this connection I may say that I am very much surprised at the attitude assumed by the honorable member f o : Perth. That honourable member told the Committee that he intended to vote for the Welaregang site, because that would mean deferring the question for a further period. He explained .that if we decided upon Tooma the Senate would not agree to our choice, and that would probably mean the relegation of the question to a session of Parliament-migh t I say-fiv e or six years hence, until within the fifty-mile radius suggested by the honourable member for Hume a site might be discovered possessing all the advantages which are now claimed for the Welaregang site. honourable member referring?

Mr Wade, in a report based upon that of the Capital Sites Commission, and his own personal and intimate knowledge of the district, saysThe Federal Royal Commission appointed to report on the proposed sites for the Seat of Gosay that if the Lyndhurst site is chosen, the vernment considered that the Coombing Rivulet of eighty square miles catchment area, together with the Flyn's Creek, of eighteen square miles catchment area, were capable of supplying by gravitation a population of 54,000 people, at an average consumption at the rate of 100 gallons per head per diem. They also mentioned that the Cadiangullong Creek, with a catchment area of fourteen and a half square miles, and Brown's Creek, with a catchment area of forty-seven square miles, were capable' of supplying by gravitation an additional population of 35,000 people on a similar basis of consumption, or, in all, a total by gravitation of 89,000 people.

If , after a delay of so many years has occurred, such a site is chosen, the feeling of irritation and discontent now smouldering in the mother State may burst out into a flame of indignation which would be prejudicial to the State, to the Commonwealth, and dangerous to the Union, which we are all bound to uphold. naro) -It is not my intention to speak at great length, because so much has already been said on this subject. Had it not been for the statements of some honourable members, I should hardly have deemed it necessary to say anything at all. The advantages of adopting the district which I favour are so apparent that the place has only to be seen, or to be spoken of, to commend itself to all who view the question from the national rather than the provincial standpoint. I was rather surprised to hear the honourable member for Wentworth follow the line of argument which has been used by a number of other representatives of New South Wales, by mainraining that the people of that State expected to receive, as the price for joining the Union, the location of the Capital within its borders. The honourable member stated that at the first referendum fewer than 80,000 persons voted for the B ill, and that the requisite majority .would not have been obtained had it not been promised that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth would be situated in New South Wales. I deny that that is so. No doubt, in the mother State, there was a strong feeling that the Capital should be situated within its borders, and many persons supported that view when urging the acceptance of the Constitution. But to-night we must deal with this matter from the Federal stand-point. We have to select a site where the Capital will remain, not for a few years, but for all time. Consequently, we must choose the best site available, observing the provision in the Constitution, not only literally, but in its spirit as well. The meaning of the Constitution is so clearly expressed that it does not require explanation, and, therefore, I do not propose to deal with it. I intend rather to address myself to some of the speeches which we have heard regarding certain of the proposed sites. In the first place, I ask the Committee to remember who they are who made those speeches. 60/ The remarks of the honourable member for Moira are fresh in .our memory,, and, therefore, I shall commence with them. His objection to the Dalgety site is that it is too cold, and he had a great deal"" to say of the miserable weather and the snow which he met there. Yet, in the next breath he told us that the Snowy Mountains are nearer to Tooma-whic h he favours-tha n to Dalgety; and he had so much to say about the beauty of the Tooma climate that I almost expected to hear him recite the poem entitled ""Beautiful Snow."" He did not, however, give us to understand why the snow on one side of Mt. Kosciusko should be colder than the snow on the other side of it. That has not been made clear. Then again the honourable member told us, with the same cocksureness that has characterized him throughout, that he questioned the sufficiency of the water supply at Dalgety. the Commissioners. propose to answer the statement of honourable members, who, bereft of every other opportunity of traducing the Dalgety site, express doubts with regard to the water supply. honourable member is getting a "" t u r n "" about the water supplv. sorrow of the honourable member's lif e is that he cannot show us any water at Lyndhurst. The honourable member is reputed to be a great temperance advocate, and Fe knows that unless an expenditure of upwards of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is incurred, it will be impossible to provide an adequate water supply at Lyndhurst. Mr Pridham is my authority for that statement. No temperance man ought to advocate the adoption of the Lyndhurst site, because water will be so scarce that it will be necessary to lock up the water, and leave the whiskv outside. We can fully understand that the honourable member is very touchv about any reference to the question of water supply. The honourable member for Moira stated that there was.no timber at Dalgety; but he informed us that he had not visited that part of the country since 1884. timber there then than there is now. jection made by the honourable member reminds me of the fact that he has now submitted his sixteenth site.

That money would have to be spent for the sole purpose of connecting Welaregang with the Victorian system.

I give the honourable member credit for good intentions, but he should remember that the way to a warmer place than Tumut is paved with good intentions, and should be more careful in accepting statements made to him by interested parties. for Moira said that it was very questionable whether the Southern Monaro tableland could produce sufficient food to supply the requirements of a population of 50,000. from the report of the Commissioners. what one authority has to say with' regard to that district. His statement reads as The record of follows: I think if there is a district in which a railwav should be constructed it is from the tableland to the port of Eden. There is no finer port in the Colony, and there is no finer country at the back of it . It is certainly to be regretted that the construction of the line has been left so long in abeyance. There is no possible doubt that the port must become a great shipping port, and it will become a great centre of population. The honourable orable member for Hume.

405,Mr Austin Chapman,"The stateally, I mean. able member was quite right in the statement he then made. I desire now to quote another statement made at the same time by a man who did a great deal for Federation, and whose name has not been mentioned in connection with this debate. All those who believe in Federation should remember his name with respect. the late Sir Henry Parkes. He saidIt does not follow that because this very fine port has, from one cause or another, been neglected, that it will continue to be neglected. When that district is opened by railway communication, to which, in my judgment, it is richly entitled, Eden, which has a very fine harbour, will become the site of a very important maritime city. I have that faith in the progress of this that other honourable members have opinions country that I have long foreseen that, although retarded by unfavorable circumstances, this result is certain by the very force of growth from without. . . Twofold Bay has been the victim, if I may so term it, of singular neglect. I do not say whose fault it is. It is very difficult to disby voting for his latest fad. tinguish ; but, certainly, before many years, Twofold Bay, where the town of Eden is situated, will become one of the most important places in New South Wales. I have no doubt whatever of that. j \ s far back as 1873 I advocated the construction of a railway to the port, to bring the traffic of Monaro to the bay. That was . the honest opinion of a man who knew the country, and. it was backed up by that of the honourable member for Hume. not been constructed yet. if the honourable member has his way, it will probably be some little time before the railway is built.

The honourable member, when he spoke last night, made an attack upon the late Mr Alexander Oliver. him. orable member expressed regret that the late Mr Oliver had made a certain report. 6Q2 that he had issued his last report. did not suit the honourable member.

He may walk about and boast that he will be able to turn a number of honourable members, that in fact he has their votes in his pocket, but he will find as well as himself, and that whilst they may, as I do, entertain a very warm personal regard for him, they will not sacrifice their principles in order to please him, I would remind the honourable member, who has boasted that he will be able to turn round a. number of honourable members, that he should not ""halloa"" before he is out of the wood. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have never made such a statement. dently appeal for the support of honourable members who knew Mr Oliver, when I say that no man in New South Wales was better fitted for the task intrusted to him. The honourable member for Hume appointed him. He is very clever in selecting good men for' certain work, and he often gets into great trouble over them. He selects good men, and whilst everything goes to suit him they are all right. After appointing Mr Oliver, with the approbation of the people of New South Wales, he has turned round and accused him of having found fault with the conclusions of the Royal Commission appointed by the Commonwealth GovernIts records are such that it inment. I have nothing to say against the Commissioners.

It was stated that, there had not been a single case of typhoid for seven years. hardly the province of the Prime Minister to chime in, with a view to helping the honourable member for Hume. given him sumcient help in the past. It is a fortunate thing for me that, to a certain extent, the honourable gentleman is muzzled. Some of the statements which he has made against the Monaro district will not bear analysis. the subject. the last Parliament the Prime Minister made desperate efforts to prevent the Monaro site from being selected. He made it a personal matter against the Monaro district. the honourable member? the Prime Minister used his Own personal popularity with honourable members to prevent the Monaro district from being selected. He has sworn a sort of vendetta against that district. However, I do not mind his opposition, because he fights in the open. Hume has stated that trees will not grow in the Monaro district. trees there. able members will peruse the report of the Commissioners, they will find that it contains a reference to the "" inexhaustible forests"" of Bombala. That, I think, is a sufficient answer to the statement of the honourable member. When he was asked where all the opossum skins came from if there were no trees at Bombala, he solemnly declared that they were ground opossums. Had they been under-ground opossums, he might have been an authority upon the subject.

That journal saysA Riverina paper has received a letter from Sir William Lyne, stating that there is no doubt that a majority in the Federal Parliament is against the sites near the town of Tumut. Sir William Lyne states that he is now endeavouring to get the area selected for Bombala so extended that it will I have never spoken upon take in Tumut. Members who visited the Murray site with Sir William Lyne have impressed others with the suitability of that locality, and it is likely there will be a sufficient number to support the new idea. He says that any amount of underground engineering is going on in favour of Bombala, and some of his colleagues in the late Ministry are the principal movers. letter. is it the honourable member's letter, but the Gundagai Independent, which is published in his own constituency, reprints it, criticises it, and frankly declares that if a Tumut site cannot win by the adoption of other tactics than these, it is preferable that it should be left out in the cold.

He said that Mr Wise had no right to indulge in any such criticism. Apparently, nobody has a right to criticise. I have no desire to say anything against the Tooma site, because I have not seen it. But I have seen the Albury site, and there is not much difference between the two. The former is a little closer to the snow line, but its altitude is about the same as is that of Albury. It is between 1,100 and 1,600 feet above sea level.. The last Parliament decided that no site should be eligible for selection which had an altitude of less than 1,500 feet, but that provision has been carefully eliminated from this B ill . Why? In my opinion, because its omission suited the district represented by the honourable member. Sir member has been told that I knew nothing The honourable member has been examining about the matter, and consequently it is the list of deaths in the district, in order not fair for him to make that statement. say that the provision was eliminated at forthcoming. I have no objection to his the instigation of the honourable member, bolstering up the claims of Tooma in that but I believe that it was omitted to suit his way, but I certainly object to his making district.

Another assertion made by the honourable member for . Hume was that Cooma was supposed to comprise the best lands in the Monaro district. Every honourable member who comes from New South can be placed on such a statement. It is said that the railway constructed to Cooma does not pay. facts associated with the construction of that line? lic Works Committee, consisting of Members of Parliament, deal with every proposal to build a railway. They analyze the reports, consider the estimates, and having gone closely into all the facts make a recommendation to Parliament. Minister was at one time a member of that Public Works Committee, and will be able to tell the Committee that it invariably makes an exhaustive inquiry in regard to all the proposed works submitted to its consideration. the Committee is that it has saved the State many millions of pounds by refusing to recommend many works which have been suggested. Works Committee have inquired into a proposal to construct certain lines, the Railway Commissioners are asked to make a report on the lines selected for construction by the Public Works Committee. That Committee, however, while the honourable member for Hume was in office, in New South Wales, reported in favour of the construction of the Cooma line, and the Railway Commissioners subsequently stated that they were amazed to find so great an area of good country stretching away from Cooma farther south. commercial grounds-quit e apart from any suggestion as to the establishment of the Federal Capital in that district-the y recommended the construction of the line. That is my answer to the honourable member's assertions. are open for inspection, but it is unnecessary for me to deal fully with the figures, because honourable members are already familiar with them. however, that an old estimate of the cost , of constructing a railway from Cooma to Dalgety is £^127,000. We are told that It is, to we may take off 20 per cent, from many of the old estimates, so that in (round figures the construction of the line to Dalgety, which is half way between Cooma and Bombala, would involve an outlay of about ,£100,000. To carry on the line to Bombala would require the further expenditure of a similar amount. of constructing a railway line from Bairnsdale to Dalgety?

461,On Mr Austin Chapman,"There is not obtain one. The honourable member for Hume also told us a story about the Bairnsdale railway and the zigzag. Sir here. the honourable member's plans in regard to the settlement of this question will fall to the ground. I am prepared to accept the opinion of the Chief Victorian Railway Commissioner in preference to that of the honourable member for Hume, in regard to the extension of the railway from Bairnsdale to the border. The -Commission appointed by him report that the Chief Victorian Railway Commissioner stated that a railway from Bairnsdale via Orbost would have to be constructed for State purposes, quite apart from any question as to the establishment of the Federal Capital at Bombala or Dalgety. member is very ingenious in endeavouring to saddle the sites in the Southern Monaro district with all the expense of building such a line. If we established the Capital at Dalgety or Bombala, the first expenditure necessary would be incurred in supplying railway communication; but there would be no occasion to spend any money in securing a water supply. We should have a pure stream of running water at hand,'and practically every other requirement would be available, so that no additional expense would be incurred. On the other hand, it would be impossible to construct a railway to Tooma from Victoria, or to connect that site with the railway system of New South Wales, without incurring a very heavy outla) . We have also to consider whether we should for all time have to rely on a railway for the carriage of heavy freights to the Capital, or whether we should avail ourselves of the great highway of the world-the ocean waterway-whic h is within fifty miles of Bombala. Comparisons are odious, and I should not make them, but that I desire to answer some of the statements of the honourable member for Hume. sioners appointed by him when Minister of Home Affairs report that the Chief Railway Commissioner of Victoria said that a railway from Bairnsdale via Orbost w.ould have to be constructed for State purposes. should be a sufficient answer to his assertions in that resoect night the honourable member referred to like methods, which he said had been resorted to ; but any one who gets the best of him when fighting on these lines should be welcome to his victory. He stated that Bombala and Dalgety were further south than is Welaregang, but I have had the in a direct line nearer Sydney than is the Upper Murray site. The honourable member is not very sure on that point, but if the Upper Murray site were nearer Sydney than is Dalgety, he would have no hesitation in mentioning that fact. If a railway were constructed to Tooma it would have to strike in at Queanbeyan, and it would be necessary to tunnel under Mount Kosciusko, and, indeed, right through the Australian Alps. On the face of it , the suggestion that such a railway should be constructed is too absurd to receive a moment's consideration. The honourable member admits that for three years-durin g the life of the first Federal Parliament-h e The honourable was of opinon that the selection of the Upper Murray site would be unfair to Sydney, and he credits the honourable member for Grampians with having introduced that site into the arena. We know that the honourable member for Grampians, and the honourable member for Moira spoke out for the Upper Murray site when this question was before us last session; but what assistance did they receive from the honourable member for Hume, who was then Minister of Home Affairs? He might very well have granted the inspection which they asked on behalf of the Upper Murraysite, just as he granted my request that Dalgety should be inspected. I desire to acknowledge that in that respect the honourable member treated Dalgety very fairly. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am glad to hear that I did something right. orable member for Grampians, and the. honourable member for Moira thought that the Upper Murray site was such an excellent one, why did they not take action ? What were they doing ? Were they asleep ? as was the honourable member. those who favoured other sites succeeded in obtaining reports from the Commissioners, That they sat quietly by, and it was only at the last moment that they were able to secure When speaking last the consideration of the Upper Murray district.

What position should we occupy if , without any information as to the altitude of the Upper Murray site, the area available, the cost of providing an adequate water supply, and the characteristics of the climate, and only a hazy notion of whether it could be connected with the railway system of New South Wales-wit h nothing before tis save that snow-capped hills can be seen in the distance-w e selected that site? If it went forth to the world that we had selected that site, in the absence of any in1 formation in regard tp all these important points, would not our proceedings appear farcical in the eyes of the people? honourable member for Hume raked up one or two photographs of the Upper Murray district, and exhibited them in this House. ,1 should like to know whether they are not photographs of country on the Victorian side of the river. him to inform the Committee how far the site which he now so warmly advocates is from the River Murray, and what he has to say as to the unearned increment about which he waxed eloquent: last session, when he submitted a map of Tumut to the Committee, and pointed to the large area of Crown land which we might secure there. It would be interesting to have an explanation on that point, and to know why he has changed the opinion which he held for three years that the selection of the Upper Murray site would be unfair to New South Wales. fair as would be the selection of Bombala or Dalgety. bala and Dalgety were in the list originally submitted to us in the last Parliament. .both of them. report made by the late Mr Oliver on something like thirteen different sites, Southern Monaro was placed first for water. The Commissioners which the honourable member appointed objected to go to Dalgety. of the Commission objected. going to attack any of the officers. patrick. port of Mr Kirkpatrick, against whom I say nothing, was a most remarkable one, as coming from a Commissioner who put the Bombala and Dalgety sites, whatever their faults may be, nearly last on the list in regard to water supply. The honourable member for Hume possibly knows that the absence of a water supply is a strong objection, and that is why he thought it necessary to say something unkind about Mr Oliver, who merely repeated what his engineers had told him. Mr Oliver only The said what he thought, and what was thought by a great many people in the country, namely, that Mr Kirkpatrick, no doubt unconsciously, was biased in favour of two particular sites. It is remarkable, however, that both of these sites happen to be in the district represented by the honourable member for Hume. I am sorry I invite that the honourable member for Hume should drag these remarks from me. No one knows better than that honourable member what the honourable and learned member for Balaclava and Sir Alexander Peacock said in regard to Albury. Both of these gentlemen expressed the opinion that to select Albury would be unfair. We remember the desperate efforts made by the honourable member for Hume in support of Albury-ho w he stood on the hilltop there, in the midst of one of the regular daily duststorms, ' and said, "" Gentlemen, there is a lovely site here if we could only see it . "" The honourable member for Hume knows that it was the visit of honourable members to Tumut which killed the chances of that site. Tumut was regarded as a compromise, but that visit, as I say, put it ""out of the running."" We can remember the honourable member for Hume standing on the Tumut site, and as the perspiration poured off him, remarking"" This is a most invigorating climate."" In the first What has made the honourable member change his .mind as to Albury? What is the difference between Tumut, Tooma, and Welaregang? Why did he not stick to Gadara, Lacmalac, Tomorroma, or one of the other sites on which he was previously so keen ? D i d not Mr Chesterman make an enthusiastic report in favour of Tooma?

At any rate, I did not make the mistake which the honourable member made when he took honourable members on a visit to Tumut in the summer time, with the result that the chances of that place were killed "" in one act."" We have to ask ourselves what were the qualifications of the right honourable member for Swan to make a report of the kind desired. In his report he laid down the essentials for a Capital Site, looking very carefully into the facts connected with the whole of the sites; and it is remarkable that a large majority of those who made personal visits of inspection are in favour of Monaro. ber for Swan has not seen Tooma. opinion if the right honourable member for Swan were to see Tooma and believed that it was a better site than Dalgety, he would have no hesitation in saying so. I am sure that every other honourable member believes the same of him. It is an insult to him to say that he gave his opinion with regard to Dalgety simply because I went with him. He also had with him Colonel Owen, the Inspector-General of Public Works, a very able engineer, who probably has no axe to grind. knows the Monaro country well. been camping there. able members want fish stories they can get them from the honourable member for Hume. He reports strongly in favour of Southern Monaro. of disinterested experts, whose reputation, to a large extent, hangs upon their judgment of these various sites. Southern Monaro thoroughly. remarkable thing that the bulk of the Victorian members and the bulk of the New South Wales members respectively are supporting either the Upper Murray or the Lyndhurst site? I do not say that they are not honestly supporting those sites. I give all honourable members f u l l credit for honesty, and believe that they will vote for the site which they consider to be best in the interests of the Commonwealth. But, nevertheless, is it not remarkable that the Upper Murray vote .will be principally given by Victorian members, whilst the Lyndhurst vote will be principally given by New South Wales members? able fact that the bulk of the members from Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. other States who have no personal interest to serve in favouring one site more than another, are supporting the Southern Monaro site? I should be quite prepared to take the decision of honourable members representing the other States, and to let the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales stand aside altogether. what the verdict would be. Of course, I do not propose to take such a course; but still it is remarkable that the bulk of the independent opinion of this House is in favour of the Southern Monaro site. A great many speeches have been delivered with regard to the Federal Capital. It has been considered from many standI n my points. We had a very glowing speech from the honourable member for Richmond. He dwelt upon the beauties and the glories and the grandeur of a Capital such as Australia should possess, assured us that the site for which he intended to vote was most beautiful, and urged that it was necessary that we should consider picturesqueness. But is it not a peculiar thing that the honourable member was not able to assure the Committee that he had even seen the site which he proposes to He support? The. honourable member for He has Gwydir also made a very able speech. It was a fine descriptive speech, and any one who heard it must have admired very much If honorthe earnestness with which he entered into details. In the course of his remarks he read a long letter which he had sent to What does iColonel Owen say ? the Sydney Daily T<elegrafh, in which he set forth some facts which had been I point to these as the opinions given to him-probabl y by the honourable member for Hume-showin g that during the drought the Upper Murray site was They stand by able to maintain fifteen sheep or one bulIs it not a lock to the acre. ported the honourable member as making a two hours' speech in favour of Tooma. is that the honourable member for Gwydir, after making a very able speech in support of the Southern Monaro site, dwelling strongly upon the reports of the experts, declared that he intended to vote for a site which he knew nothing about, except that he had been there for a very short time, in company with the honourable member for Hume.

508,Mr Austin Chapman,"The factsuch slender evidence. able member for East Sydney has assured the Committee that the finger of destiny is pointing to Lyndhurst. that, if we were to select Lyndhurst on account of its accessibility, we should be taking a very short-sighted view of our responsibilities. peculiar if we were to select a site for the Capital on account of the conveniences which at present prevail in regard to the conveyance of Members of Parliament, and were to ignore the fact, which I very few years, wherever we fix the Capital Site, the district will be riddled with railways. It is taking a short sighted view to say that we should clump down the Capital at ;some place where there is a railway at present, whilst ignoring the means of communication that are bound to be provided in the future. The honourable and learned member for Wannon has urged that the Capital ought to be located in Sydney, on the ground that that would lead to a saving in expenditure, but I would remind the Committee that there could then be no return whatever to the Commonwealth in the shape of unearned increment. . The effect would simply be to make the corner blocks and the good sites that are now held by private individuals worth far more money, without the Commonwealth receiving any return. the bush, on the score of economy. does not need any argument to show that .1 "" bush Capital,"" as it is called, would be people of Australia than a Capital situated in one of the great cities. I venture to say that of the three western sites Lyndhurst is the worse. Its supporters may bolster it up as much as they please, but it seems clear to my mind that if any western site is to be chosen, Lyndhurst certainly ought not to be favoured. Either Orange or Bathurst would be preferable. The strong feeling in favour of Lyndhurst is simply a reflex of the opinions expressed by the Sydney daily newspapers. Honourable members get a good deal of their politics from these journals. Their views are drummed into us every morning. I do not, however, question the honesty of the supporters of the Lyndhurst site. I am quite sure that the honourable member for North Sydney would not support it unless he believed in it. I can also quite understand the anxiety of the honourable member for The right honorMacquarie to see it selected. I feel like that myself sometimes regarding Monaro.

I am quite It would be very prepared to take the area that was selected by the Senate. I think we ought to have a large area. I wish to have a gateway to the sea, and also an entrance from another State. It is in my opinion for Parliament to select the area, and the choosing of the take to be certain, that within a actual site is rather a matter for experts. honourable member's constituents? the honourable and learned member for Wannon' is one of those who consider the desires of their constituents a good deal. Personally, I have no hesitation in saying that I like the Bombala site, and believe in it. honourable member going to vote for? that Bombala is the best site. member going to vote for it? for a district or territory, not a particular site. I have made a careful analysis of the opinions of honourable memWe ought to put the Capital in bers, and I know that very few of them are It prepared to vote for Bombala. I am not fool enough to throw away my vote. I am not prepared to follow the course which very much cheaper for the the honourable member for Hume took on a former occasion. I am not going to urge honourable members to vote for Dalgety. while I myself vote for Bombala. I urge them to vote for Monaro district, and leave the selection of the exact site to experts. In this way all selectors of Monaro will stand solidly together. I strongly resent the inference of the honourable and learned member for Wannon; and as for the honourable member for Hume, he should be one of the last to make the insinuation which his question implies. He, himself, on the occasion of the first ballot, voted for Albury, whilst he urged other honourable members to vote for Tumut, deserting one site after another, and afterwards trying to placate the supporters of Tumut by talking vaguely of a railway.

The honourable member for Moira is usually very careful, but he destroys our confidence in him when he makes a statement of that kind. The honourable member for Grampians knows something about country, and although he has said some unkind things of the Monaro district because he does not like it, and because he favours the Upper Murray'site, he would never have asserted that horses would not live in the district. Monaro would take stock off Riverina and put them on to Monaro to thrive. so, how is it that during the last two years, when we had a drought, nearly all the stock from the Riverina side were brought to the Monaro district?

Houses were shaken violently, and apparently some portions of the town were affected more than others. Vhe current travelled southOne distinctly audible shock, with vibrations and rumblings, lasted over a minute. It was elicited at the Observatory this afternoon that a slight shock had been felt at Adelong at 1.15 this morning.

The honourable member for Lang also spoke about the cold. He said that he had had avery cold If the honourable member can trip when passing through Nimitybelle one summer's night. a very cold drive through Nimitybelle during a summer's night. the sort of statements which I have to combat. The Prime Minister wishes it to be I spoke from personal exinferred that it is distressingly cold in the There were 15,000 sheep on Monaro country in the middle of summer, and those who believe such extreme statements will, of course, hesitate before going there. I regret that the honourable gentleman should thus go back to his old practices. In many respects it has improved him to have more responsibility and less liberty; but he should not, even as a joke, say that the climate of Monaro is so bad as to be distressingly cold at night in the middle of summer. Such absurd stories are an insult to the intelligence of honourable members. The honourable member for Macquarie also spoke about the cold of the Monaro district; but let him listen to the following paragraph from a newspaper dated 9th June. 1.903 :of snow this morning, the ground being covered to a depth of three inches. It was much heavier at the Canobolas. Light rain has been falling all day, with a cold westerly wind. There are no indications of the weather clearing, and another snow storm to-night is probable. All holidav sports had to be postponed. Similar reports came from Blayney, Lithgow, and other places in the district, while the Observatory records show that, on the same day, the weather in Monaro was perfect. I do not seriously contend that therefore the Monaro climate is warmer than the Orange climate. I quote the statement to show the absurdity of some of the statements made by the honourable member. Thefollowing article, however, is one to which I think the Committee generally would do well to pay attention : It was in some measure unfortunate that the Australian Federation was not cradled in time of war or other great national stress.

The honourable member for Macquarie does not care about the Bulletin statement, but I would ask him to follow me whilst I refer to Mr authority on water-power in the CommonPridham's report. ber has asserted that Mr Wade's report, upon which he relied, was based on Mr streams in the Lyndhurst district, and that Pridham's figures. I have just as high an opinion of Mr Wade as has the honourable member for Macquarie, but I took exception to his being called upon to give evidence as a special advocate of a particular site, unless we also obtained the testimony of Mr Pridham and other officers of high standing. NowI shall refer to ham's report, which was presented to this House in May, 1904. The right honourable member for Swan in his report saysNone of the creeks I saw were running when I visited Lyndhurst on 5th April. The Belubla River was dry at Carcoar, the Mandurama, the all dry. It must, therefore, be clearly understood that should the Capital be established at Lynd*servation, and not from perennial streams. The is, therefore, under existing conditions, out of the question for a pure water supply. The proposals to obtain from conservation by placing dams across four separate water-courses, viz., Coombing Creek, Flyer's Creek, Cadiangullong Creek, and Brown's Creek, sufficient water for a population of 89,000, and when the population increases beyond that number to pump water twenty-two miles from a large storage reservoir in the Lachlan River, does not seem to mark out this site, so far as water supply is concerned, as one amply favoured by nature for the Seat of Government of Australia. The enormous cost of this water supply {vide Mr Pridham's report, herewith, marked Appendix B), namely,. £2,728,030, is, in my opinion, a serious handicap to this site. We gather from this that an outlay of nearly ,£3,000,000 would be involved in providing an adequate water supply at Lyndhurst, and it remains for the honourable member for Macquarie to show us that such an expenditure would be justified. The right honourable member for Swan says furtherAs there is no perennial stream near Lyndhurst, there is no reasonable possibility of generating electricity to any large extent by water power. Mr Pridham's report, herewith, Appendix B, paragraph 5, shows that no adequate power would be forthcoming from the Lachlan River; this factor may, therefore, be considered as practically non-existent. No mat'There is the statement of Mr Pridham, together with the cold analysis of the right honourable member for Swan, which speaks Now, I desire to deal with the for itself.

602,Mr Austin Chapman,"Manyground to which they have carried it. We have the evidence of the Chief Victorian Railway Commissioner' that a line will have ' to be constructed from Bairnsdale via Orbost for State purposes alone, and there can be no doubt that Biombala will be connected by-andby with Eden. If the Capital be established in this district, those who travel to it oversea, via Eden, will have a chance to enter it through the Federal gateway. By means of a railway it will have its own gateway to the sea. We may pooh-pooh the suggestion at the present time that there is likely to be any trouble between the Commonwealth and the State, but any one who has given this question serious consideration must recognise that there is a possibility of friction, and that it is thereprobable that the Parliament will meet in fore desirable that the catchment area of our water supply should be within Federal territory, and that there should be an entrance to the Capital from two States. Monaro has its own water-shed, and its great expansibility is also a great factor in favour of its -selection. In the Monaro district we have a State in itself-a territory which has never been developed, but is capable of vast improvement. we select this district, we shall hear the school-bells lingling where to-day the sheep bells ring, and with a railway bringing a market to our door, we shall have manyhappy families and homes, where to-day there are but a few boundary* riders' huts. That is a point which we have to consider. We must have a good climate, a reasonable water supply, and the opportunity for great development, so that as the city grows, and the people desire more room there will be ample scope for expansionWith these essentials the Capital will become the centre of a great population and the home of a great people. We should select a site that will not be on the verge of Dalgety and Cooma, had never been closed inferior country. We do not wish to select a site merely because it is a beautiful spot that can never become anything more than a -glorified village. The climate of the Monaro district speaks for itself; the records of the temperature are open for inspection. It has been said that the cold is more intense in Monaro than in any other part of New South Wales; but it has a bracing climate, cold frosts, days of sunshine, and nights of brilliance unknown in foggy regions with their forbidding desolate chills. There is no damp chilly atmosphere in Monaro, and we ought to hesitate Mr Austin Chapman. before we pass by such a district. I would point out that many honourable members visited it not in mid-summer when everything is beautiful, but during the coldest months of the year, when they could not see Monaro at its best. That fact should be borne in mind when we are dealing with this question. Should we not ask ourselves whether the Federal Capital is not likely to develop into a great sanitorium if a suitable site be selected ? Every visitor to AusThat' is a very important factor. tralia will journey to the Federal Capital to see what it is like, and if it possesses a bracing climate, and is surrounded, by beautiful scenery, magnificent caves, sparkling waterfalls, and snow-capped mountain ranges-if it be a district in which to spend a pleasant holiday-it is likely to attract a large population. It is extremely the summer months, so that honourable members will practically go for a change of air to the Federal Capital. Honourable members who are in good health are likely to do much better work in a district where the climate is good and the air is bracing than in one in which the atmosphere is as humid as is that of many of the big cities of Australia. The fact that the Monaro district If has so fine a climate is an argument in favour, of its selection. Its scenery is magnificent. Some of the finest caves in Australia are to be found there; Kosciusko is in sight, the great Snowy River flows through the territory, and the snow-capped hills are to be seen in the distance. The allegation as to extreme weather on the Monaro may be answered in many ways. The other day I wrote asking for how many days the schools at Dalgety and Berridale had been closed on account of bad weather, because I regard that as a very good test of the climate. The reply I received shows that the school at Berridale, which is a little township near the Snowy River, between one day on this account. Dalgety is a small hamlet, to which children have to come, perhaps, five or six miles, and on wet days some no doubt are kept at home. If only two or three children attend, school may be closed ; but I find that during the past fourteen years this has happened only on two occasions. Similar facts may be related of Bombala. where, some honourable members assert, the climate is worse than in other parts of the Monaro. I thinkhonorablemembers are satisfied that the Commission would not, without foundation, have reported on what they term the "" inexhaustible forests"" of' the Monaro; and there is not the slightest doubt that in the area may be found some of the finest timber in Australia. That report, coupled with the fact that there are three saw-mills at work at the present time, renders quite absurd the statement that there is no timber. No doubt there are rolling plains without timber, but so there are in Queensland and other States, and I have yet to learn that such country is avoided as worthless. We have to consider how products and merchandise can be conveyed to and from the Capital. city, especially when water power can be obtained, will become a great manufacturing centre, and, that being so, the cost of freight must be taken being equal, ought we to select a place like Lyndhurst, which would mean a tremendous train haulage over mountains, or a place like Tooma, which would mean railway carriage of 400 or 500 miles?. Or, should' we select a place within fifty or sixty miles of a good port? Water carriage, as we all know, is cheaper than railway carriage everywhere. £1,656,263 to build a railway from Cooma to the port of Eden. rate, I simply put this suggestion forward as' worthy of consideration. I am not endeavouring to ram my convictions down the throats of honourable members. I am. not making bald statements; I am merely puting forward facts which mav have been overlooked. By spending millions, Lyndhurst could no doubt be provided with that water on. which I lay so much stress. In Western Australia, the dry, arid country around Kalgoorlie reminded me very much of Lyndhurst; and yet the right honourable member for Swan, when Premier of that State, conveyed water over a distance greater than that between the Snowy River and the site which the honourable member for Macquarie advocates. Therefore, if Lyndhurst were selected, the matter of a water supply might be an objection, though not a fatal one. A water supply can be obtained from the Snowy River by the expenditure of millions, though such an expenditure cannot, of course, create good country, and it would be very difficult to justify the cost. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Would the heights permit the flow? think the heights would; at any rate, the expenditure of money would provide a water supply. The Eden-Monaro site would be close to our own sea-gate; and as to the statement that Twofold Bay would not make a good harbour, I should like to read the following quotations from Mr Oliver's report, to which I have previously referred : Dropping the part of critic with pleasure fcr a more congenial role, I may, perhaps, be permitted to point out that, without surrendering just claims to favorable consideration in respect I hope ""that the Federal of features such as climate, fertility of soil, and building materials, Southern Monaro holds an exceptional, and, indeed, an unique position in respect of1.

At a cost, now calculated by the Hydrographic Officer of the Public Works Department at £150,000, for a breakwater half-a-mile in length, and two jetties to cost £30,000 each, this harbour will be as secure an anchorage as Port Jackson. In the future it will be capable of being an effective naval base. 2. Federal railways from the port of Twofold Bay to the Capital, and from the Capital to Cooma. These would be Federally owned and worked, and thus all friction with State-owned railways would be avoided. In the same report Mr Halligan, New South Wales Government Hydrographer, writes as follows : In accordance with instructions received from the principal Engineer for Harbors and Rivers, in response to a request from you that an officer should be sent to Eden to report on various matters concerning the establishment of a Federal port at Twofold Bay, I beg to report having visited Eden on the 22nd ultimo, and returned to Sydney on the 4th inst. During this time. I made a careful examination of Twofold Bay and the surrounding district, to enable me to express opinionrst.

605,Mr Austin Chapman,"I hardlyevery wind lhat blows, and the steepness of the ground makes the site about the worse that could be chosen for a town. The difficulty, if not the impossibility, of finding a suitable site for a railway station, is also a serious objection to the adoption of Eden as the site of a future town. A much more favorable site exists at the south east corner of the bay, known 'as East Boyd. This part of Twofold Bay is sheltered from all but the north-east winds, which do not raise the same amount of sea as a southerly or south-east wind of equal strength, for reasons which it is not, perhaps, necessary to state here. My own observations go to prove that, with a light southeast swell coming into Twofold Bay, there was much less range at East Boyd than at the wharf at Eden, and the pilot and others informed me that this was the case in all weathers, except, of course, when a "" black north-easter"" was blowing. On account of the sudden alteration in the trend of the coast at Gabo Island, the northeast winds which prevail on the coast of New South Wales during the summer months, are changed to S.S.E., south, and S.S.W. winds on the Victorian coast, and the small strip of coast between Gabo and Twofold Bay is a neutral zone, in which the north-east winds do not blow with the same regularity as they do further north. Still there are times when they attain considerable strength, and in order to afford protection from them, and to deflect the south-east swell, I propose to run a breakwater in the position shown by blue lines on the attached hefio. Its length need not exceed 2,640 feet and at the outer end there is 9 fathoms of water. With a breakwater 15 feet wide on top, And 16 above high water, with inner slope i£ to r, and outer slope i± to r, the cost would be £150,000, and it would insure protection in all weathers over an area of '8 of a square mile with a depth of over 4. fathoms.

Being situated half way between Melbourne and Sydney, it will have to be fortified at some time. Are there not great inducements for us to fix the Capital at a place like that? No doubt the construction of a railway would be costly. It might even amount to £8,000 or £10,000 a mile. But sooner or later that line will have to be built. expect all these things to be done at once. It is idle to suppose that the whole of the cost of erecting the Federal Capital will Mr Austin Chapman. 1 be saddled upon the early years of Federation. I look at this matter from several stand-points. Naturally, as a New South Wales member, I pay great attention to it from the stand-point of the interest of that State. New South Wales is anxious to have the question settled. How can we best arrive at a settlement? The honourable member for Perth told the Committee that he intended to change his vote from Monaro to Tooma, because he knew that that would mean delay. Perhaps there will be some delay, but not much. We certainly want further information before we can think of choosing the Tooma site. The honourable member for Wentworth showed from the estimate from which he quoted that the railway to Tooma on the Victorian side alone would cost at least ,£500,000. On the New South Wales side there is a great distance to cover, and. it is doubtful whether it is practicable to connect the site with Sydney unless we come down to Germanton and make such a wide detour as would be absurd. We have to consider what inducement the Commonwealth has to offer to New South Wales to build that railway to the border. mile). There is a feeling that a great injustice will be done to New South Wales if Tooma is selected. There will undoubtedly be great turmoil and trouble about it. There will also be great dissatisfaction if there is protracted delay. hurst is not likely to be accepted by the Senate, which has an equal right with this House to express its opinion with regard-to the selection of the Capital. It certainly would be a very difficult matter, indeed, to induce the Senate to come round to that But I am dealing way of thinking. .Buti f we select the Monaro site, there will be no delay whatever. Beautiful as the Upper Murray site may be, and eligible as it may be, its Sooner or later these breakselection is likely to cause not only months, but years, of delay.

Of the two districts which are left, and about which we have full information, the Monaro We do not is the only one the selection of which woulrl lead to an immediate settlement of the question. I do not wish to delay the Committee longer. I thank honourable members for having listened to me so patiently. time, and the importance of the question must be my excuse for having occupied more time than I intended. tried to decry other sites. pointed to hard facts.

If we were going into this matter as a private speculator, should we not take a large area so as to secure the unearned increment? Why should we not get some recompense for' the money which we have to spend ? I have yet to learn that those who are in favour of the Commonwealth taking a small area have the support of the people of New South Wales. fight that battle in any electorate in the State. people, "" Are you prepared to put the unearned increment into the pockets of the land-holders or into the coffers of the Commonwealth?"" there can be but one answer.

I have said that I believe Bombala to be the better of the two sites mentioned in the Monaro district. AlthoughI hold that the selection of the actual site is a matter which must be left to experts, I am in favour generally of taking the territory I do not very often take up their defined by the Senate, with the exception that I think there is no necessity to go right into Pambula, and the rich country I have not where the settlements are. They might be I have simply avoided by skirting the mountain range, and then striking down to the coast. We might also go a little further west to take in the I presume f u l l catchment area of the snow country, which is of very little value. If that were done, we should have a reasonable I have area of 5,000 or 6,000 square miles, on which there is very little settlement at the present time, which is of very little value to New South Wales, and from which I believe that Bombala is the that State is now obtaining very little revenue. Settlers are paying a few pounds a vear for areas of 20,000 acres in what is called the "" snow country,"" which would be valuable as a part of the catchment I area, if required for the Federal Capital. The real reason why there is so very little I am a great believer in territory. settlement in the district is the want of railway communication. I recently drove about thirty-five miles from Bombala to Bungarbay, and passed through two or three houses on big stations. They said to me that the town was quiet, and I replied that I wondered it was not dead. Until people are given an opportunity of getting access to these lands, we cannot expect to have settlement in the district. commend that we should take over the whole of the area to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I am prepared to recommended that we should take over a great portion of it. I have carefully anaWhen the question is put to the lyzed the votes likely to be recorded. I am satisfied that a majority of honourable members will vote for Dalgety rather than for Bombala.

Strongly as I hold that the Monaro sites are the best, I have no desire to win by any unfair tactics, or unless there is a majority of the Federal Parliament in favour of one of those sites. I say that we should gravely consider the Bill as it has come down to us from another place, embodying practically the unanimous opinion of men who come not only from New South Wales or Victoria, but also from the great State of Queensland, from Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia, men who have no personal interest to serve, and who cannot be biased to the extent that honourable members of this Committee may be biased in thinking what they hope. I trust that we shall now select the site of the Federal city, and select it in the best place in Australia for the purpose. I hope that in a very short period of time we shall be enabled to get there, and that we shall start, as I understand the Government' propose, in a very small way, so that the Parliament House, public buildings, parks, streets, roads, and water supply will grow gradually with the requirements and necessities of the place. Let us establish the city in a good spot, I say, in Southern Monaro, and if we do I am satisfied that future generations will recognise that we have decided upon the best spot in Australia for the purpose, and one of which we can always be proud. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -More in explanation than anything else, I desire to say a few words bearing upon the long speech just delivered by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, in which the honourable gentleman has scattered about a great many statements. The honourable gentleman has said that I made an attack upon the late Mr him, as I should not think of doing anyOliver. ' He told me beforehand, privately, that he intended to make those remarks, and I told him that such a statement was not true or fair, because what I said last remark to make with reference to the night, in reference to the late Mr Oliver, criticismpassed by the honourable member was but a repetition of what I said last for,Eden-Monaro upon my speech. session.

EDWARDS -De mortuis nil nisi bonum. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is not my intention to say anything ill , but I have no desire that what I have said should be wrongly interpreted. I also said I did not think that the late Mr Oliver would have written the second report had he at the time enjoyed the robust health which I knew him to possess for the greater part of the time during which I was acquainted with him. The general comment at the time was that it was rather a scolding report. I thought that the late Mr Oliver had been very unwise in writing it, and that is what I said last night. I made no attack upon that gentleman, whom I held in the highest respect. I should not have selected him to make the first investigation of the sites suggested for the Federal Capitali f I had not had a very high opinion'of him. In regard to the other statement made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that I had accused the late Mr Oliver of having made mistakes, what I said was that he had not gone to the heads of Departments to obtain the best officers to assist him. I said that he had taken certain officers who, I was told by the heads of the Departments, were not the best for the purpose, and in consequence of his not having secured the assistance of the best officers, recommendations were made to him which caused him to f a l l into error. I do not think that one word which I uttered can be construed into an attack upon the late Mr Oliver, whom I knew for twenty-five years, and whom I held in the highest esteem until the day of his death. But in issuing his second report he made a mistake; I regretted it at the time. I said so last night, and I say so again now. There can be no doubt whatever that, so far as his lights went, and on the information placed before him, the first report submitted by the late Mr Oliver was a very able document. I wish now merely to deny the accusation that I made any attack upon thing of the kind. The",74,Orange Monday Ther E Was A Heavy F A L L
