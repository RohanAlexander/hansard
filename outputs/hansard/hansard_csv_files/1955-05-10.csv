It has been stated in thc press that the Government received this report as long ago as January. Will the right honourable gentleman also inform the House when the commentary by the Minister for Health, which is contained in the report, was made? Neither of the dates that I have mentioned is shown in the report. Will the right honourable gentleman consider the representations that havo been made by almost all the State Premiers with respect to a conference between the Commonwealth and the States to deal uot only with the Stoller report, hut also with the general matter of the maintenance ?f our mental institutions, and whether some assistance should he given hy way of social services in respect of those who are suffering from mental illnesses? of the right honourable gentleman's questions, I simply do not know what ' tiie dates are, but I shall find out. As to the second of them, I merelyrepeat that this matter is one which has, ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth, been under the jurisdiction of the States. The Commonwealth has had no association with this matter, but the State governments have. I do not propose to call a conference to ascertain whether the Commonwealth is now to enter the maintenance' field on. this matter. Tuesday, 10 May, 1965. When the Australian.",6,Setup

3,Mr Menzies,"As to the first 'Government discussed the circumstances arising out of the Stoller report, we decided that,, although we had no direct responsibility in this matter, the vital thing to be done was to improve the capital accommodation and facilities in this department of government activity. We therefore said thatas the States could hardly be expected to face a capital expenditure of £30,000,000 within a measurable time, we the Commonwealth, being without liability but being an Australian Government, would provide £10,000,000 towards that capital programme. I venture to say that that is a very handsome proposal. I want to warn honourable members not to succumb too readily to the idea that every problem in this country which involves nioney belongs to the Commonwealth, whatever the situation or whatever past practice may have been. wealth raises the money. able members against that idea. Who knows but that my friend, the honourable member for Dalley, may some day be a Cabinet Minister himself. If so, I hope that the chickens will not come home too violently to roost in his fowl house. Minister for Health tell me whether the Queensland Government has failed to cooperate with the Australian Government, first, in the full-scale development of the hospital benefit scheme in that State; and, secondly, in plans to provide properly for the mentally ill in Queensland ? Has this failure on the part of the State Government resulted in a loss to it of £1,500,000 which, otherwise, it would have had available for expenditure on these important functions ? pital benefits agreement, Queensland has made many fewer beds available for intermediate and. private wards relatively than has any other State. In respect of such beds an amount of 12s. a day is payable by the Australian Government to the States, and to that degree Queensland has suffered financially relative to the other States in that it has failed to qualify for an amount equal to that paid to them. That is entirely a matter for the Queensland Government itself. I understand that the position is due to the ungenerous terms of a law in Queensland which prevents substantial paymentsbeing made in respect of medical benefits and hospital insurance. In respect of mentally ill patients, I have urged the Queensland Government during the last five years to get into line with the other States and discuss the whole question in order to see what can be done to prevent the state of affairs that has been disclosed by the Stoller report. Queensland has lost financially by failing to follow such a course. There is no doubt that overcrowding must increase ill health in a mentally-ill community. addressed to the Minister for Health. What were the conditions of the Chifley Government's agreement with the States the Commonin 1949 on mental diseases benefits? What was the net gain to the States under that agreement? How does it compare with the amount now made available for capital expenditure by this Government ? made by the Chifley Government with the States in 1949 was most queer. It provided that the Commonwealth should pay to the States exactly the amount they were collecting on behalf of the patients at that time on condition that the States did not charge for the patients in future. The result was that the benefit to the mental hospitals was absolutely nil, because only the same amount of money was available to them. As soon as the Menzies Government came into office, I pointed out that something was needed to ensure that more beds would be available so that mentally diseased persons could have better treatment. I was quite sure that if the acute cases especially could be properly treated, the total number of mentally diseased persons in this country, and in our asylums would be considerably reduced in five years. The net revenue produced for the States was, 1 as I have said, exactly nothing. It isdifficult to make a comparison of nothingwith the amount of £10,000.000 which, as the Prime Minister has announced, the",10,Mental Illness

9,Sir Earle Page,"The agreementCommonwealtli will make available for tbe purpose of dealing witb this position-, but it is exactly twenty times as large as the amount paid annually by the Commonwealth since 1949, which was in lieu of the other charge that had been made. I am rather astonished by the fact that the gentlemen in the various States, who have resisted for the last six years coming into a conference with me in regard to the cancellation of this old agreement, should now, having received nothing since 1949, start kicking in the mouth the gift horse which will make £10,000,000 available to them. Health whether, since federation, any payment has ever been made for social services by any government to patients in mental asylums. If not, what reason would there be for beginning such a practice now? Who would receive the benefit if such pensions were paid? services legislation has been on the statutereferendum which was approved by the book every government, no matter what its political colour, has followed the provision originally laid down that pensions should cease immediately a patient became an inmate of a mental asylum. As the mental patient is quite irresponsible, eitlier the Master in Lunacy in some States or the relatives of patients in others, who are already being saved the cost of upkeep, would benefit from such a payment. There is no reason for commencing such a scheme at present because it would not provide £:' towards the cost of the extra beds needed to overcome the present hopelessly overcrowded conditions in our mental hospitals. is directed to the Minister for Health, nothing wrong with that legislation. .1 relates to the very bad record of the suggest that the right honourable gentleNew South Wales Government in the man would again see nothing wrong with accommodation and treatment of menit if his party were again to assume office. tally ill people. Is the Minister aware that, although the New South Wales budget for last year showed a surplus, no real effort has been made by the New South Wales Government to improve the directed to you, Mr Speaker. In view accommodation mentally sick people in that State? Does the microphone during the debate last this make a sham and a mockery of the Thursday night by the honourable memboasts of the Labour party that in this ber for East Sydney, will you inform enlightened age Labour governments treat people humanely? can answer all the honourable gentleman's questions. I think it was the honourable member for Bennelong who pointed out recently that in New South VVales expenditure on hospitals last year was down by a sum of the order of £1,000,000. I understand there are a good many millions of pounds in the kitty in that State. Later: question about the payment of social services allowances in respect of those suffering from mental illnesses. I now ask the Minister for Health whether he regards the list of social services provided by the Commonwealth as closed, simply because previous governments have not provided other services? Was it for that reason that the Australian Country party, of which the right honourable gentleman is a member, opposed the social services people? honourable member well knows, I opposed the social services referendum because i considered that it was designed as a paltry amendment of the Constitution that touched only-the fringe of the question. I asked him, in this House, to alter the proposal to include a chapter on health and he refused. Consequently, we now have the puny thing arranged by the right honourable gentleman, which puts us practically at the heels of the States.

I stated then that, if I had further occasion to direct the attention of the House to such an incident, I would ask it to judge whether the honourable member who had been accused was under the influence of liquor. As there had been a long period without any such incidents, on Thursday night I took the course that was taken. If such an incident occurs again, I intend to ask the Souse to sit in judgment on the accused and the accuser forthwith. propose to take, Mr Speaker, completely contrary to the Standing Orders? Neither you nor the House can sit in judgment on such matters. The conduct in question is either disorderly, or it is not. I could cite a dozen instances of insulting remarks having beeu made, but you allowed those remarks to pass and did not suggest that the House should judge whether they were true. Such remarks may be highly disorderly, but I submit that the action that you propose to take in the future is contrary to the Standing Orders. There should be some understanding on whether the Standing Orders exist only in the letter, or are to be observed. stated, this is not the first time that such au incident has occurred. What happens when one honourable member, who desires to be offensive, says to another honourable member, "" Y o u are drunk""? The latest experience that we have had is the best proof of what happens. Every honourable member knows that to accuse thc Minister for External Affairs of being under the influence of drink is fantastic. Ef a fantastic statement like that is made, it must be made deliberately in order to harm the Minister. In this case, a great newspaper in Sydney thought fit to publish its report of the incident on the front page with hcu»'!lines, and with a photograph, not of the accuser, but of my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs. of privilege? a breach of privilege. The whole object of the exercise was to give publicity to the incident, and to have some people somewhere say ludicrously about my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, who of all men is the most sober, "" He was under the influence of drink, and where there is smoke there is fire"". Therefore, I welcome the proposal that, in future, when such a foul allegation is made, the House should be invited at once to sit in judgment upon the matter. honourable member who has been accused is under the influence of drink? on a dirty, dirty, remark. cident is closed for the time being. ter able to inform the House whether the Commonwealth line of ships has been sold by the Government?

Vandalism is a polite name for a subnormal form of imbecility which appears to beset a number of people who, when detected, should be dealt with with the utmost severity. I have the matter of the American War Memorial uuder discussion and steps are being taken to avoid, if possible, such incidents in the future. whether it is a fact, as reported, that Australia's overseas reserves will run down by approximately £200,000,000 in 1954-55 to a new low danger level of approximately £375,000,000 by the 30th June next. Is it also a fact that this is the low level which reserves reached in June, 1952, when the Government drastically cut imports as a remedy? If these reports are correct, can the Treasurer advise the House whether the Government contemplates taking similar action again in the near future? If it does not contemplate such action, what action does it propose to take in order to conserve our overseas balances? cumstances at the particular time will be taken into account wheu methods are being evolved to restrict imports with the object of assisting our overseas balances. Those balances certainly have run down. That has happened for two reasons. The first of them is the decline in our export income, and the second is the increase in our import responsibilities. Consequently, the Government as a matter of policy was obliged to introduce a scheme of import restrictions which will be effective as from the next quarter onwards. Whatever action is taken in the future will depend on the circumstances existing at the particular time, which will be carefully considered. Lahour and National Service noted the fact that the leading Communist who formerly ran the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union until the industrial groups defeated him and his fellow Communists has now taken over control of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Railways Union? Is the Minister aware that this gentleman not only boasted that workers in Melbourne would walk to work when he decided that they should walk but has also carried out that threat? In view of the fact that the destruction of the Australian Labour party industrial groups by the right honourable member for Barton will almost certainly mean that these Communists will be able to confirm themselves in the control of the AusI ask the Treasurer tralian Railways Union, will the Minister make available to the people of New South Wales details of the continued stoppages which Victorian workers have suffered owing to the irresponsible action taken as a result of the Communist policy? fully informed on all the points of detail to which the honourable gentleman has referred in his question, but I shall see whether I can obtain a factual statement about stoppages in Victoria which can be attributed to Communist influence in the unions concerned. That information may be illuminating to trade unionists in other parts of the Commonwealth. ter for Labour and National Service say whether it is a fact that an appointee of this Government to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court recently gave permission for the ex-Communist State secretary of the Australian Railways Union in Melbourne to re-contest the election for that position, even though the registrar of the court had ruled that he was ineligible to do so? If that is a .fact, how can the Minister reconcile the judge's decision with the alleged desire of the Government to get rid of Communists from administrative positions, whenever possible?

I hope we shall never reach the position in this country when a judge will not feel free to determine matters that come before him according to his conscience and the best of his judgment. I do not know which judge dealt with the matter to which the honourable member has referred, but I assume that any judge called upon to determine such a matter would determine it in his judicial capacity and in a judicial fashion. With regard to the honourable member's reference to there being no necessity for the work of the industrial groups in combating the influence of comunism, I believe there are many forces which can be brought into the fight against communism in Australia. We on this side of the House have contributed notably to some of the defeats which Communists have experienced. But I take this opportunity to pay my own tribute to the courageous and energetic work which members of the industrial groups, drawn from all sections of politics and from nil religious faiths in this country, have done to combat the infiltration and subversion of this alien influence. I believe it is a bad day for Australia when men who are prepared to make such a. fight in the best interests of Australia are discouraged by public men in this Parliament from carrying on with that work. tier for Health had an approach regarding financial aid for the Australian anomaly.

The matter raised by him is one of policy, which will be considered in conjunction with the budget. for the Army a question which relates to a most distressing tragedy that occurred at Northam, in Western Australia, on ANZAC Day when, as a result of an explosion, a boy aged eleven years was killed instantly, having received shocking injuries, and another boy aged thirteen years is still in hospital suffering from the injuries he sustained at the same time. In view of the fact that it is reported that the explosion was caused by an army mortar bomb, I ask the Minister whether the circumstances of the tragedy have come to his notice and, if so, whether he is able to say that the explosion was due to the weapon which has been stated to have been the cause, of it? Will he .also ascertain, if he has not already done so. how this lethal weapon came into the possession of those young lads and, if it was an army weapon, whether he will institute such action as is necessary to ensure that there shall not be a recurrence of such a disastrous tragedy? full sympathy for those who have been afflicted in this recent accident. I am sure that the whole House extends its sympathy to them.

Addresses are given in the public schools, and large posters are displayed throughevery military camp and in the vicinity of each camp warning of the danger of doing so. A campaign through the means of press and radio has also been carried on, appealing to the youth of Australia to report to an army officer or the police the finding of any bombs or shells. From the recovered fragments it has been established that the bomb which caused the accident was a 2-iu. mortar bomb as used by the Army, that the bomb was of United Kingdom manufacture, and that it was made in 1942.

Further inquiries are being made. master-General a number of questions. Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission's offices and studio in Canberra are shabby, totally inadequate and a disgrace to any capital city? Are eminent Australians and distinguished overseas visitors required to use an enlarged cupboard for making national broadcasts? Is one small studio sufficient for the needs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Canberra? Will the Postmaster-General give urgent consideration to the establishment of attractive studios and offices befitting the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the national capital? the studios of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Canberra leave much to be desired, but the commission's studios in other Australian centres are even worse, and the studios in those places are the first ones which will be improved. that during 1953-54 seventeen commercial broadcasting stations in this country failed to broadcast the quota of Australian music required by the Broadcasting Act, will the Postmaster-General say what action he proposes to take to. make those broadcasting stations observe the law? Will he say also why the Australian Broadcasting Control Board failed to ensure that the law was observed? Will he consider an amendment of the act at an early date so that a minimum quota of 10 per cent, of Australian compositions can be substituted for the present quota of 2$ per cent. ? Australian radio stations broadcast more than the quota of Australian compositions, although it is true to say thut in some cases the quota is not reached. However, I have no doubt that when the attention of those stations has been drawn to their failure to observe the quota, the matter will be rectified."" Minister whether he will confer with the Minister for Territories in connection with the zone allowances payable in the north of Western Australia. These allowances were established in 1945 and adjusted in 1947, and as a number of questions addressed to the Minister for Territories have failed to secure information on this matter, which is vital to residents in the area, will the Prime Minister make an early announcement of the Government's intention to deal with the problem ? honourable member that the Minister for Territories is not open to criticism in this matter. The Minister has discussed this matter with me on several occasions. It is a matter which has to be taken into consideration in connection with the ber that it will be very carefully considered when the next budget is being prepared. to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Is it a fact that Australian butter is not marketed in Britain under its own wrapper, but is blended with Danish butter and sold under a national wrapper? Is the wrapping of Australian dried fruits marketed in the United Kingdom so unattractive as to make it difficult for our dried fruits to compete with inferior brands? Is the packing of Australian jams in tins detrimental to the marketing of our jams overseas because British people are stated to have a decided preference for bottled jams?

58,Mr Mcewen,"During the time therationing and price fixation were in .operation there, the British Government pursued a policy of blending all the imported butter and, I think, some homeproduced butter, to produce a standard quality for sale under a single brand and at a common price. As from the .1st July next, Australian butter and cheese will be sold in the United Kingdom without the control of the Ministry of Food. The Australian Dairy .Produce Board will co-operate with individual traders, both here and in the United Kingdom, in order to ensure that Australian butter and cheese shall be presented and sold under Australian brands and to the best advantage. Australian dried fruits are exported to buyers in the United Kingdom in, I think, half-hundredweight packages. The merchant purchasers and distributors in the United Kingdom re-package the fruit for sale to individual consumers in that country. To that degree, the situation there is beyond our control. However, I have endeavoured to inspire the members of the Australian'Trade Commissioner Service in England and the Commonwealth Dried Fruits Control Board to interest themselves in the final presentation of Australian dried fruits in the United Kingdom in order to improve commercial prospects there for Australian producers of dried fruits. Jam from Australia, for practical reasons of course, is exported in tins. A consumer preference for jam in bottles has developed in the United Kingdom, and I am afraid that the Australian processor can do nothing about that preference. Nevertheless, the.superior quality of Australian jam is beyond question. In this matter, also, the members of Australia's trade promotion services are doing their best to ensure that the superior quality of Australian jam shall be recognized by United Kingdom consumers. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture any recent information about the sale of American surplus butter? In Bega last Saturday the federal president of the Australian Primary Producers Union mentioned to me a report to the effect that the United States of America had sold £5.000,000 worth of butter on the United Kingdom market. Is the Minister in a .position to confirm that statement, and, if so, will he make any comment about the effect of that action on the Australian export industry? informed of any hulk export sales of American butter, and I believe that in almost all such cases I am informed of the price at which the sale has been effected. I have no knowledge of a sale of butter to the United Kingdom of a magnitude even approaching that referred to by the honourable member. I do not purport to carry in my mind all the facts about this matter, but I shall be glad to give to the honourable member, or any other honourable member, all the details that I have of recent sales. No sales have been made at prices or in quantities which wotild dislocate the ordinary pattern of trade of Australian exports of butter, or which would offer any threat to that trade. Minister for External Affairs relates to the suggestion by many members of various governments throughout the world that a meeting, at the summit of authority, of representatives of the nations known as the Big Four countries should be called. Has the Minister any information to suggest that such a meeting will be called in the near future, and if so, in which form will it be held? discussed by the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States of America and France at a meeting held in Paris during the last week-end. We have no positive information about the result of the discussions, although it is known that the foreign ministers discussed the subject of a meeting of the heads of the three States that I have mentioned, together with the chief of state of .Soviet Russia, .and alternatively, or at the same time, a meeting between the foreign ministers of those four countries.

ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. Minister for Labour and National Service choose Australian representatives to attend a Commonwealth conference on industrial relations which is to be held in February, 1949, when the Vice-President England in July next year under the chairmanship of the Duke of Edinburgh? If so, how will such representatives be chosen, how many will be present from Australia, and will the Government ensure that an opportunity is given for this Parliament to be represented, if not by delegates, then by observers ? is heing discussed, at government level, with interested representatives of management and labour. There was formed recently a committee which included representatives of the Ministry of Labour Advisory Council and certain persons who, although they belonged to other organizations, could be said to have, in their own capacities, some claim to participation in discussions upon this matter. They are not necessarily persons who will be invited subsequently to attend the proposed conference. No decision has yet been made upon the manner in which the invitations shall be issued, or the range they will cover. As the Prime Minister has just pointed out to me, it will not be a government conference in the sense that governments will be directly represented and, consequently, there will be no direct participation by the Australian Government as 3uch. Yesterday, there were further discussions on the general question with the Ministry of Labour Advisory Council, and the Government is trying to obtain information from the United Kingdom in relation to that discussion. It is expected that there will be a total attendance of approximately 280 representatives from countries of the British Commonwealth and Empire, 25 of whom will represent Australia. MR. SPEAKER. I moveI h a t this House has no confidence in Mr. Speaker for the reasons(1) That, in the discharge of his duties, he has acted in a partisan way by displaying bias against members of Her Majesty's Opposition; (2) Many of his decisions have been arbitrary and unjust; and (3) That he tails to interpret or apply correctly the Standing Orders of tlie House. The last occasion on which a motion of this kind was submitted was on the 24th of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) submitted the following motion in relation to the then Deputy Speaker:T move That this House hoe no further confidence in Mr Deputy Speaker on the grounds(a) That in the discharge of his duties he has revealed serious partiality in favour of Governnient members ; (fc) That he regards himself merely as the instrument of the Labour party and not as the custodian of the rights and privileges of elected members of this Parliament; (c) Tliat he constantly fails to interpret correctly the Standing Orders of the House; and (</) Of gross incompetency in his administration of parliamentary procedure. agrees with the honourable member entirely. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) will still be in agreement with me after I have concluded my remarks. Let me commence by observing that, whatever grounds the then Opposition may have had for its action in 1949, the present Opposition has much more serious reasons for submitting the motion that is now before the House. On the 26th July, 1946, the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, submitted a motion of no confidence in the then Speaker on a purely technical ground. He contented himself with submitting the following motion:That Mr Speaker does not possess the confidence of this House.",20,National Service

85,Mr Calwell,"I hope that theThe incidents to which I have referred represent the recent occasions upon which the authority of the Speaker has been challenged. I have always wanted to submit a motion of no confidence in you, Mr Speaker, on each occasion upon which the Opposition has felt aggrieved, but this is the first occasion for a period of five and a half years on which such a motion has been submitted. I now refer to the following decisions as being some of the arbitrary and unjust decisions that you have made over that period of five and a half years: Requiring the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to resume his seat following a breach of the Standing Orders, when a lesser penalty would have sufficed.; demanding that the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) would uot be seen again by you in the House until after he waited upon you in your rooms; ejecting from the chamber honourable members who called for a quorum when, in your opinion, a quorum was present when the call was made; demanding that honourable members should leave the House, as well as the chamber, when they were ejected by you under Standing Order 303, or were suspended by resolution of the House; repeatedly interrupting Opposition members by demanding that they should address you after you had allowed them to be interrupted by Government supporters by the asking of a question, or the offering of an insult or some irrelevant observation; and counting members when a quorum was called in order to advertise the number of Government supporters present if that number exceeded the number of Opposition members present in the chamber, and refusing to count the numbers when there were more Opposition members present than Government supporters. In relation to only one of those charges, that is, requiring an honourable member to take his seat, can precedent be found in the history of the Speakership of the Parliament. Over the past five and a half years, you have not named one Government supporter for disobedience to the Chair. Government supporters interjecting, now is indicative of their desire at all times to shout down members of the Opposition, and they have been able, to use the vernacular, to get away with it In that same period of five and a half years, on only two occasions have you, Mr Speaker, ejected Government supporters under Standing Order 303, and then you ejected them for the bad reason that they had called for a quorum. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) were the honourable members who, you claimed, had offended. I have sat under three Speakers in the HouseMr Speaker Nairn, Mr Speaker Rosevear, and Mr Speaker Cameron. In my opinion, Mr Speaker Rosevear was the ablest of all three. He was a man who tried to act justly, although on occasions his justice was fairly rough. I was one of those who, as a Minister, clashed with him on occasions, but at least he did try to act fairly. With all due respect to the memory of Mr Speaker Rosevear and to yourself, in my opinion Mr Speaker Nairn was the fairest of all the Speakers under whom I have had the privilege, and on occasions the misfortune, to sit. All that the Opposition asks for is a "" fair go "". Honourable members on this side of the House complain that you, Mr Speaker, do not give them a "" fair go "". They say that, whenever you can, you seize on the occasion to score an advantage, not for the Government, but for yourself or for the party as a representative of which you were elected to the Parliament. We say, with due regard to the gravity of the charge, that you use your position in the chair, and the Speaker's quarters, to organize happenings in the House, all with a view to injuring the political cause of the Australian Labour party. We say that you encouraged the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), some years ago, on at least several occasions, to attack unfairly and improperly the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Australian Labour party. We say that your action in describing the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist) as the Anti-Communist Labour party arose from, your partisanship and your desire to use the Chair for party political purposes.",21,Commonwealth Conference
86,Mr Calwell,"Their behaviourI shall refer only briefly to the incident when you stood in your place in this House and made certain remarks about the then Governor General, Sir William McKell. As a result of that incident the Opposition moved a censure motion. I believe that on that occasion you offended grievously against the representative of the Crown, regardless of what you, or I , or the Vice-President of the Executive Council may have thought of Sir William personally. I had no association with him while I was a Minister and he was Governor General. But as the Governor General he should have been treated with the respect that the office deserves. We do not give you credit for trying occasionally to organize opposition to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in this chamber because that, too, is a degradation of your high office. We believe that if a member of the Parliament takes the office of Speaker he should not merely try to be, but actually be, scrupulously fair in all his rulings and dealings with honourable members in this chamber. An honourable member who has been a strong party man should not nominate for the position. There are many honourable members on both sides who would be as unsuited for the oflice as you are, because they have not the requisite judicial calm for the position, and they have not lost their desire to score points for their party at any time and in any circumstances. Men of that character should not aspire to the office of Speaker. You will remember that you were suspended from the service of the House while you were a Minister. You were the only Minister who was ever suspended; and, then, to show your regard for authority, after you had offended against the authority of this chamber, you promptly suspended the licence of radio station 2KY in Sydney because an announcer on that station likened you to Hitler. Last week you brought your long list of peculiar rulings and your desire for publicity up to date with a ruling, which was completely unjustified, that an honourable member could call another honourable member a Communist and you would not require the offending member to withdraw the term. Then, to be consistent, you said that any honourable member couldcall another honourable member a fascist and that in doing so he would not commit any breach of the Standing Orders. When one honourable member called you a "" Communist Speaker"" you demanded a withdrawal of those terms; and then when the same honourable member called you a "" fascist Speaker"" you also demanded a withdrawal. But you went further and said that if any other honourable member referred to your political affiliations you would name him. It became an offence under that ruling for any honourable member to call you a ""party Speaker"", or, worse still, an ""ex-Country party Speaker"". Of course, what you ruled the other night was not in accordance with fact. You said that since the defeat of the referendum on the proposed alteration of the Constitution to give power to this Parliament to deal with Communists and communism, the Communist party was a legal entity and that it was not an offence to call an honourable member a Communist. In 1950, before approval of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was sought at the referendum, you ruled that it was an offence for an honourable member to call another lionorable member a Communist. In the Hansard report of proceedings in this chamber on the 28th March, 1950, the following appears:East Sydney( Mr Ward), whose speeches are alwaj's in line with Communist policy, denies my statement. ter's remarks are offensive to me. The speeches of the honourable member for East Sydney are not always in line with Communist policy. East Sydney has not asked that the statement be withdrawn. to me. sive to the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), the Minister must withdraw it.

I take the following from the Hansard report of the 4th May, 1950:allow the occasion to pass without referring to some of the hypocritical remarks of that notorious pro-Communist, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). those remarks, which are offensive to me, be withdrawn and that the honourable meniber for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) apologize. asked that thc honourable member for Mackellar withdraw the offensive remarks and apologize, and I ask him to comply with that request. deference to your request, Mr Speaker things offend the honourable member for East Sydney, of course I apologize. That, too, was before the referendum in respect of the powers of this Parliament to deal with Communists and communism was held on Saturday, the 22nd September, 1951. The ruling that you gave the other night was not consistent w it h r u lings that you gave, subsequent to the referendum, on the 21st November, 1951, and on the 28th February, 1952. I take the following fro m the Hansard report of the 21st November, 1951:that I am asked to withdraw? honourable member for Lalor was a defender of the Communists. he is not a defender of the Communists, aud I withdraw the words to which objection has been taken. closed. If you were right on the first occasion you gave a ruling on this matter after the defeat of the referendum on the Communist Party Dissolution B ill , you were wrong the other night. In the Hansard report of the 28th February, 1952, the following appears:cerned that the honourable member should be mouthing Communist catch-cries. I ask that the Minister be required to withdraw described the attitude of the Opposition his remark. for Wilmot is mouthing Communist catchcries. should withdraw that remark. Mr CahoHl. Speaker, I withdraw it. But, sir, you went farther. You continued in that line. From the Hansard report for the SOth October, 1952, I take the following: member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) used the term "" dirty fascist""'. should withdraw the term. Mr Emc J. HARRISON I consider that the term was intended to refer to me, and a mere withdrawal is not satisfactory to me. I want an apology to be made by the honourable member for having used the term. It is a term which has been accepted throughout the world as being a term of opprobrium of the worse character, and I insist on an apology. gentleman object to the word "" perfect"" or the word "" fascist"". question by saying that if I referred to the honourable member for Parkes as being a Communist of the reddest type, he might be entitled to object to thut expression, which is one that I would not use. The expression that he used is as offensive to me as such an expression would be to him. apologize for having used it . So, at least in 1951 aud 1952, Government, suporters thought the same as members of the Opposition think on these matters; and. we shall see, in due course, to what extent they are prepared to back the opinions which they held in those years when they vote on this motion. We shall also learn whether the Government w ill support your actions, which we regard as completely unfair, improper and unjust, particularly the ruling you gave last week. But you, Mr Speaker, have laid it. down as a salutary rule, which has been observed by Speakers before you, that if an honourable member asks for a withdrawal of a remark, a withdrawal must be made. Such an incident occurred on the 30th October, 1952. The Ministerf o r Health, offended against the Chair when he on a certain matter as the acme of hypocrisy. On that occasion, you, Mr. Speaker, affirmed your rule that an honourable member was entitled to the withdrawal of a remark which he considered offensive.

115,Mr Haylen,"1 withdraw the term and the Hansard report of your ruling proves my point:of the House tliat when un honourable member considers himself to be aggrieved by a statement a withdrawal of it must be made. If the honourable meinber for Lalor insists on a withdrawal of the statement being made, x mn bound to follow the procedure. withdraw the words, if they are objectionable to the honourable member, but 1 should like liim tu supply uie with appropriate words that I might use in tlieir place. able gentleman's time has expired. On the 6th March, 1953, the Prime Minister was speaking on a series of questions which he had been asked that morning concerning Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. He said it was an organized smear campaign against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and at that point, I asked for the withdrawal of the remark. You, Mr that, ordinarily, you are reluctant to Speaker, ordered the Prime Minister to withdraw the remark; I shall read to the House the words that you used on that occasion. They are as follows:It is customary in this House for an honorOpposition members-in other words, able member who objects to a statement made by another honourable member to insist that it he withdrawn. Tlierefore, I have to ask tlie Prime Minister to withdraw the remarks to whicli the honourable member for Melbourne hue. objected. That statement was a re-affirmation of earlier, similar rulings, but the Prime Minister, instead of withdrawing the remarks, submitted a motion of dissent from your ruling. Because he had the numbers, and for no other reason, your ruling was dissented from. The allegation of the Prime Minister, however, thar, it was an organized smear campaign was nothing less than a charge of conspiracy, and to the disgrace of the Twentieth Parliament, he was allowed, by virtue of his superior numbers, to set your ruling aside. But that fact is no reason why we should not, now and always, follow the excellent rule which you laid down then but which you nre not prepared to follow any longer. Sir, this charge of Communists and communism is a particularly reprehensible one to members of the Opposition. I am opno?ed, and so is every Labour man, to both Communist aggrpssion and Communist subversion. To call ns Communists or sympathizers with communism is to charge us with supporting a way of life completely antipathetic to democracy and to religious and cultural freedom; a way of life founded on the negation of every human right and every fundamental decency; a way of life sustained by the use of terror, the concentration camp, a ruthless dictatorship and mass murder. Yet you, Mr Speaker, have the temerity to rule that a charge of Communist, hurled recklessly, irresponsibly and maliciously by a Government member against an Opposition meinber is neither an insulting nor an unparliamentary expression. What bathos, what banality! Mr Speaker, we say that yoii unduly hinder Opposition members by establishing one set of standards for them while you let almost anything said by Government members go unchallenged. We say call Government members to order, but that you nearly always act with alacrity when you discern, or think you discern, a breach of the Standing Orders by that you act with marked partiality and favouritism. You have claimed over the years you have been Mr Speaker, that your actions are always inspired by a desire and an endeavour to maintain the integrity, the honour and the dignity of the Parliament. The Opposition says that you have not always endeavoured to do those things. We say that, far from maintaining the integrity of the Parliament, your actions on many occasions have tended to weaken it ; and we say that, instead of preserving the honour of the Parliament, your actions have brought it into disrepute. We say that, instead of safeguarding the dignity of the Parliament, you have tended to lower it. For the reasons I have given, I say, on behalf of the Opposition in this Parliament, that it is our firm belief that you have forfeited the confidence of the House, and that the House has an obligation to itself and to the people to express no confidence in you by passing the motion that I have submitted. seconded ? reserve my right to speak on it.",24,Commonwealth Conference

120,Dr. Evatt,"I second the motion, andVice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [3.52] -What is it, Mr Speaker, that arises out of this farrago of nonsense, this Leader of the Opposition that if Oppodredging of Hansard over the week-end by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) ? He has discussed a series of incidents, each and every one of which, in itself, is not of sufficient worth or weight to serve as the foundation for a motion of no confidence in the Chair. I venture to suggest that we could find in the Hansard reports of the Parliament of every other country which has a democratic form of Government, a repetition, almost word for word, of the incidents which the honourable member has dredged frorn the depths. Why has he done so? He has done so because of an incident in this House last week which resulted in a disgraceful scene that caused great concern outside the Parliament. The honourable member now seeks to divert attention from it by submitting a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. I shall deal with that incident, but before I do so, I should like to point out one thing to the honourable member for Melbourne. Mr Speaker has occupied the Chair for five and a half years in three parliaments, and he has not offended, until this moment, in such a way as to cause an honourable member to submit a motion of no confidence in him. The honourable member for Melbourne has indulged in a lot of humbug. Mr Speaker has satisfied this House with his rulings for five and a half years in three parliaments, so I should think that something of major moment must have happened to cause the honourable member to submit a motion of this kind. But nothing of major moment has happened. The incident that prompted the submission of this motion occurred when the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr remained for .seven long months on tbe Ward) had received the second call given to the Labour side to discuss a motion. The honourable member took advantage of that opportunity to attack members of the Anti-Communist Labour party. He said that members of that party, because they were called immediately after Government supporters in a debate, must be allied or associated with us. The honourable member for East Sydney was then called to order. Mr Speaker explained to him that he had advised the sion members were attacked by the corner party, the Chair would give them an opportunity to defend themselves. Mr Speaker had followed that procedure. The honourable member for East Sydney then used a term which Mr Speaker has always ruled out of order. The honourable member for Melbourne, in his dredging activities, did not expose that matter. However, the honourable member for East Sydney swung round and with a threatening gesture to Mr Speaker, in a most insulting way that no Speaker of any House of Parliament could tolerate, said that he did not want any more interruptions from the Chair. I put it to the House used. the same thing. He said, ""Don't you interrupt me, Mr Speaker. T do not want too many interruptions from you "". Those were, in essence, the words which the honourable member for East Sydney used. Naturally, Mr Speaker sat him down. Then occurred the scene from which .the honourable member for Melbourne is seeking to divert attention. That is the purpose of his motion. He has learned the art of diversion from his leader, who is the prince of diverters. Now let us examine whether there have been precedents in this House for the action taken .last week by Mr Speaker. On the 17th November, 1948, when the parties now in office were in opposition, no less a person than the then Deputy Speaker, was the subject of a motion of no confidence in him that was moved by me. Incidentally, the notice of motion notice-paper before the then Labour Government was game to allow it to be debated in the House. What a sharp contrast there is between the. action of the Labour Government then and the action of this Government, which has not allowed the notice of motion of the honourable member for Melbourne to",25,Commonwealth Conference

123,Sir Eric Harrison,"They meantremain for seven months on the notice paper so that it would have an opportunity to discipline its supporters, as the Labour Government did, to ensure that they would not take action against the Deputy Speaker in 1948. This Government has brought the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne before the House immediately, because it knows full well that the House will show, by its vote, that it has confidence in Mr as Mr Speaker exactly as he said he Speaker. 1.' shall recount the incident that occurred on the 37 th 1948, The present Postmaster-General( Mr while he held the office of Mr Speaker, /Anthony), who was then sitting in opposition as the honourable member for Richmond, attempted to take a point of order. The Deputy Speaker ordered him to resume his seat and then used the same words as Mr Speaker used last Wednesday night. The then Deputy Speaker used the following words:I have not given a ruling on the matter.. I have merely asked the honourable member to resume his seat because he has reflected upon the Chair. I call upon the next speaker to rise. the Labour party's idea of a perfect When the honourable member for Eichmond rose again to order, in an attempt to protect himself, in much the same way as the honourable member for East Sydney rose to order last Wednesday, the Deputy Speaker threatened to -name him. When the honourable member for Eichmond rose on a matter of privilege the Deputy Speaker named him. Here we have almost a parallel incident to that which occurred last Wednesday, but it did not result in the disgraceful disorder that caused Mr Speaker to leave the chair. I shall now go a step further with this matter because the honourable member for Melbourne, over the week-end, has gone to a great deal of trouble to establish a case, which really consists only of bits and pieces, not one of which can stand up by its own strength. The honourable gentleman eulogized the late honourable member for Dalley, Mr on Wednesday night what his ruling was. J. S. Eosevear, as the perfect Speaker. I do not wish to speak ill of the late honourable member for Dalley, but I remind the House that such matters as the conduct of the Chair can he determined only by comparison. Eirst, I direct the attention of the House to the fact that Mr Speaker Cameron has heen true to the statement that he made after his election to the Speakership. He has stood aloof from party matters, and has not attended party meetings since his election. He has never spoken from the floor of the chamber in debate. He has attended to his business would do. But the late honourable member for Dalley, whom the honourable member November, for Melbourne has held up to us as the to which I have referred. perfect Speaker, had no compunction, in taking a place on the floor of the House and -participating in debate. Indeed, he went further than that. I remember that on one occasion when he left the Chairthat high office of impartiality-h e took his place on the floor of the House and committed an offence that no Speaker would tolerate, by attacking viciously the High Court of this country. The honourable member for Melbourne referred to the late honourable member for Dalley as being Speaker, but I merely ask honourable members -to judge on the comparison that I have given to them. They will then see what I mean when I say that over the period, of five and a half years, and in the course of three Parliaments, the Opposition has never been able to produce one case upon which it could base a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. Not one of this multiplicity of unimportant bits and pieces that the honourable member for Melbourne has dredged up could, alone, he the basis for a motion of no confidence in Mr Speaker. The object of the motion is to divert public attention from.the disgraceful conduct of the Opposition in this House. The subject of the motion is action taken by Mr Speaker which is paralleled by exactly similar action taken by occupants of the chair when the Labour party was in office. When Mr Speaker was asked he said, as the then Deputy Speaker said on the 17th November, 1948, that he had given no ruling, but had exercised his powers and acted in accordance with the usage and custom of the House. On the following day honourable members oppoproduced this trumpery motion of no site said that he had no power to act as confidence, which the honourable member he had done, because there was no such for Melbourne has moved. Mr Speaker, power in the Standing Orders. I refer we have no hesitation in supporting your honourable members to Standing Order action. No. 1, which readsOrKNElSAl. UlILE FOB CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. 1.

The point is this: has and to give effect, promptly and decisively, there been any real attempt in those to the rules and orders of the House. The matters by Mr Speaker to apply the ultimate authority upon all points is the House Standing Orders? I do not think that itself; but the Speaker is the executive officer Mr Speaker has addressed his mind to by whom its rules are enforced.

Therefore, when it is said that the Speaker has no power to act as Mr Speaker acted on Wednesday night, I say that the power under which he acted has been accepted as the power of all Speakers, and I instance the action of the former Deputy Speaker when the Labour party was in office, who took such action because he recognized that, by usage and custom, he must have powers of this nature in order to control the House. Speaker uses that power under circumstances that are by no means new. However, the Opposition, in an attempt to evade its responsibility for its conduct in the House last Wednesday night, has Sir Erio Harrison.

It is a side issue in The House overruled Mr the meaning of the standing orders which me read them. They are Standing Orders by standing Mr Speaker's powers; I am speaking of the matter of calling to order, from which most of these things have arisen by way of bitter dispute. The object of the Standing Orders is not to determine the facts in every case, but to ensure that the business of the House shall be conducted in an orderly way, that points of view may be put, and that there will not be so heated an atmosphere in the House that a proper debate cannot be carried on. A further proof of the fact that Mr Speaker does not understand these standing The present orders is to be found in a statement which he made this afternoon. A suggestion had been made as to the sobriety of an honourable member on a certain occasion, and Mr Speaker said, "" If such a case occurs again I shall ask the House to determine",26,Commonwealth Conference

126,Dr. Evatt,"I am not speaking aboutwhether the honourable member was sober "". That is a monstrous suggestion. Such a determination would be impossible. How could evidence be called? If such a suggestion is made Mr Speaker must call to order the honourable member who makes it , and not ask this House to determine a question which, if decided in a police court, would require the calling of evidence and miglit take a f u l l day. The object of the Standing Orders is not to deal with a particular imputation but to prevent imputations being made, so that debates may be continued-unles s the particular allegation is directly related to a motion. I want to make that point clear. If these standing orders are not properly understood and followed, the proceedings of this House w ill be conducted in such a fashion that they will disgrace the nation as well as the Parliament. Standing Order 77 is. in the following knows that such an expression is offenterms:No Member sball use offensive words against either House of the Parliament or any Member member to object to offensive words. If thereof, against any Meniber of the Judiciary, I objected to some of the imputations of or against any Statute unless for the purpose of that nature that have been made against moving for its repeal. That is a prohibition. No House of the jected to the counter-imputation of being Parliament, or any member of a House, fascists, we would be rising all the time and no member of the judiciary may be to make our objections. It is the duty of attacked by offensive words. Standing Order 78 readsAll imputations of improper motives and all. It is his duty to do that in a way that is personal reflections on Members shall be connot arbitrary or unjust. He should not sidered highly disorderly. First, offensive words, and, secondly, peroffensive expressions are used, while alsonal reflections, are disorderly.

It is not necessary that an honourable except to bring this matter to the notice member should rise to a point of order. of the Governnient and of the House, and A stage can be reached in this House where so many insults are hurled across the chamber, especially insults connected with communism or Communist which have been mentioned by my colsympathies, that the honourable member league, the honourable member for Melwho is attacked cannot repeatedly rise bourne ( Mr Calwell). and interject.

I want to refer to the history of that standing order. There was a time in England when, if offensive expressions were used in the Parliament, the only remedy available to members was to resort to violence outside the House. The whole purpose of the Standing Orders is to ensure that the debate shall proceed, and that both sides may put their views. I now refer to Mr Speaker's ridiculous ruling about a suggestion that an honourable member is a Communist. Mr. Speaker has ruled repeatedly and correctly that such an imputation may not be made, yet he said on Thursday last that the Communist party is a lawfu l body, and that therefore such a suggestion may be made and is not offensive. Of course, everybody, except Mr Speaker, sive. It is not the duty of an honourable me, or if other honourable members obMr Speaker to call to order the honourable member who has used offensive words. single out this side of the House when lowing honourable members on the other side who use such expressions to go unOpposition members have no redress to ask for a f a i r decision. I shall not refer to the earlier matters They are all party as it is to-day, and if the use of exlikewise out of' order to-day. My complaint is that after a new group had been formed in this House the expressions were used over and over again, particularly during the foreign affairs debate, and the offenders were not corrected. That is a scandalous state of affairs. It prevents, the debate from being conducted in a dignified way. Such action cannot be tolerated. It would not be tolerated in an ordinary committee or meeting, but it is permitted here in the National Parliament. Let me give one or two further illustrations. Mr Speaker said last week, ""You may call a person a Communist. It is not against the Standing Orders. It is not offensive."" Mr W. M . BOURKE -I s it offensive to call an honourable member a fascist ? Mr W. M. BOURKE -The right honourable gentleman is always calling certain honourable members opposite fascists. my view, honourable members who unjustly call other honourable members Communists are fairly characterized, by way of fair comment, as fascist in trend. But let that pass. I believe that if such expressions are used on one side of the House there are bound to be reprisals, and the business of the House cannot then he properly conducted. That state of affairs is all due to the action of Mr Speaker. I do not think that any other person in the House who sat in the Speaker's Chair would permit it. I do not agree with tbe remarks of my colleague about political partisanship. Every one in this House is a political partisan, and there is nothing wrong in that. But in the Speaker's Chair, which is for the moment a chair of justice, partisanship should be controlled. That is all we ask. I shall refer now to the action taken honourable member for East Sydney from by Mr Speaker in relation to a matter getting into his stride with his speech. that I brought before the House last week. His time was limited to twenty minutes T refer to the allocation of rooms in this and he was most anxious to develop his building. I apologize for so doing, because remarks, but, in order to waste further the House decided the question. I wrote time, the honourable member for Henty to Mr Speaker about it. I suggested a ( Mr Gullett), who is the Government conference between the Speaker, the Whip, also intervened. Finally, the President and some other honourable memhonorable member for East Sydney bers to see.if the matter could be adjusted. offended. He immediately apologized. He Was that not a reasonable approach? But Mr Speaker placed the correspondence on the table of this House for the very purpose of permitting a debate on it and he allowed tbe Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) to make a personal and violent attack on me, in the course of which the right honourable gentleman did not deal with the question of accommodation. How can one transact business in that way? Who thought of that one? between the Speaker and myself! perhaps more than one mind conceived the vast and brilliant plan"" We will fix him; put it on the table and I will have a go at h i m ! "" These matters are very important. Some of the speeches delivered during the important debate on foreign affairs were worthy of the highest traditions of this House. However, six or eight members could not resist the temptation to seek a little publicity in the I realize that fully. In press by calling others Communist sympathizers. If any one unjustly accuses some one else of being a Communist, he is bound to meet with the counter-cry of "" fascist"". Any one who falsely accuses some one else of Communist sympathies deserves what he gets. The events that I have described led to the tone of the debate being lowered and to a complete lack of the required sense of responsibility. That is substantially a correct statement of the position. 1. turn now to the incident about which the Vice-President of the Executive Council made such great play. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) did not use the words that the Minister attributed to him, though it is true that the honourable member became impatient. It is my belief that a systematic attempt was made to prevent the",28,Commonwealth Conference

AVhat should the Speaker have done? May's Parliamentary Practice prescribes the action that should have been taken in such circumstances. The Speaker should have warned the honourable member for East Sydney, and should not have deprived him of the right to make his speech. By doing so, he did uot deprive the honourable member of anything so much as he deprived the honourable member's constituents and the Australian Labour party of the right to a proper debate on the matter that was under discussion. Having acted so far, you, Mr Speaker, went one step farther, and called a Minister. The result was that three speakers in succession, broadly speaking, with similar arguments to present to the Housea Minister, then an honourable member who belongs to the party led by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua), and succeeding him a second Minister-were called. That action led, as I have already stated, to disorder. The failure of the Speaker to ensure that the Standing Orders are correctly observed must always tend to lead to disorder. The days of the physical duel have order that followedI do not justify it, passed. Until comparatively recent times, but I look at it in the light of the events they existed in England, especially in that preceded it-wa s due to a sponrelation to parliamentary proceedings, taneous protest by every fair-minded memand for that reason the powers that I have ber against the way in which we on this mentioned were given to the Speaker in side of the House were treated. the Mother Parliament, from which thc practice of this Parliament derives.

I admit that the presence of the fourth In such an event, he should intervene immediately and call the offending member to order. In the proper case also, he should demand an apology, and, if the member in question has been grossly offensive, the Speaker should go even I do not say that it further. That is clear from the Standing Orders. If the Speaker acted in accordance with those Standing Orders, the decorum of thc House would be improved, order would be maintained, and the people generally would have the benefit of better debates in this House. I am conscious of the fact that you, sir, no doubt have very strong political opinions, in consequence of which you are opposed to the views of the Opposition, but I point out, with respect, that a Speaker in the chair must control his feelings. The Opposition asks only for the fair application of the Standing Orders. ""We ask that they be interpreted justly and not arbitrarily. ""What an arbitrary action it was for you, Mr Speaker, to order the honourable member for East Sydney to resume his seat so that he was deprived of the opportunity to make his speech, for you then to call upon a Minister to follow him, and for you thereby to allow three speakers in succession to present the case for the Government! Your action was sheer arbitrary conduct.

132,Dr. Evatt,"party in this House causes difficulty. But we want to face the situation frankly. The difficulty is that the members of that party, on some points, are not opposed to Government policy, and, indeed, their policy on a number of matters runs parallel to that of the Government. The foreign policy of the members of this fourth party, to a large degree, coincides with that of the Government. Consequently, I should think that it would be the duty of the Speaker to alternate the expression of the views of the Government and of the Opposition, not on the basis of the physical position in this House of the members of the fourth party to which I have referred, but by taking into account the substance of the views that you, Mr Speaker, knew would be expressed by the members of that fourth party. I am sure that a fair consideration of this question would enable any one to come to that conclusion. However, you did not act in that manner, and the Opposition suffered hardship because the honourable member for East Sydney was denied an opportunity to express the Opposition's views. This would not have happened if the Speaker had a sense of humour, and a sense of proportion, which you, sir, lack. You have wit. We know that, for you display it, often to the disadvantage of particular honourable members. On the otlier hand, you do not ensure that, in an institution such as this, where very strong differences of opinion are apparent, the debate shall be conducted smoothly by the application of oil to the machinery of parliamentary administration. Instead, you often throw sand into the machinery. This House must deal with great and small questions. It would be better for Australia if you, Mr Speaker, either made up your mind to observe theStanding Orders and to discharge faithfully the direct obligation thrust upon you by them, or made way for an honourable member who would discharge the proper duties of the Speaker of this House. That is the view of the Opposition. I certainly have not dealt with all the small complaints that we on this side of the House might make against you. I have pointed out that a serious situation arises if the Standing Orders are not carried into effect. With Dr. Evatt. the greatest respect, I suggest that not only are they not being carried into effect, but also they are occasionally applied partially, arbitrarily and capriciously. That is the worse possible thing that could be done. The capricious application of a law or, in this instance, of a standing order, serves only to engender a burning sense of injustice among those who are affected by the capricious application. The result is resentment, a tendency towards disorder, and, in relation to this House, the gradual bringing into disrepute of the proceedings of parliamentary government. The most important thing to be considered is the effective conduct of parliamentary government. Eor the reasons that I have mentioned, I support the motion. master-General) [4.24] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) that it is a serious thing for any one to call another person a Communist. I recall that very many years ago this term was thrown up at Mr ""Jock"" Garden. On each occasion on which it was used, he repudiated it. He stated that the rule? of the Australian Lahour party were so framed that he could not at the same time belong to the Australian Communist party and to the Australian Labour party. Eor 23 years that gentleman insisted that he had not, at any time, been a member of the Australian. Communist party. Yet, when officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service raided his office just prior to the appointment of the royal commission of inquiry in relation to timber rights in New Guinea, an up-to-date ticket for the Australian Communist party was found in the drawer of the desk in his office. It is one thing to call a person a Communist and quite another thing to prove it. No one can say with certainty that a person is a member of the Australian Communist party unless he sees his party faithfully ticket, and in no circumstances are we likely to see the party ticket of any one who is so accused. However, it is proper to call a person pro-Communist, and to indicate one's reasons for doing so. The honourable member' for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) are charged with having called other honourable members in",31,Commonwealth Conference

Every one who criticizes the Communist party is called a "" profascist "". That is the rejoinder of the Communists. me and I will say it against you: The impartiality with which you have discharged your duty, Mr Speaker, is shown by the fact that this is the first occasion that I recollect, during your period of almost six years in office, upon that you referred to the honourable memwhich such a motion has heen proposed. The difference between your administration and that of the previous Speaker is illustrated by the fact that such motions as this were then almost of monthly occurrence. I recall that very clearly because I was the victim of Mr Speaker Rosevear's rulings on more than one occasion. I remember beiug thrown out of this House, not for what I said, but for what the then Speaker thought I was about to say. To do him justice, I was indeed about to say it. The paucity of the ammunition that the Opposition was able to produce in support of the motion is shown by the fact that it had to go were a private member. It attempted to show that what you had done in respect of Station 2KY was an indication of your partiality as Speaker to-day. This was followed by the contradictory statement that at present you were working against the Prime Minister as well as the Opposition. Very little has been adduced as the presiding officer of this Parliament. The motion contains no merit and I have no doubt that, if this matter were treated in the proper way, the whole Parliament would vindicate your actions as Speaker. the motion because the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) was justified in criticizing the inconsistency of some of your decisions in the past.

143,Mr Keoh (Yarra) [4.30],"I suppontinction should be drawn between those who sit in this corner now two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate on the motion is interrupted under Standing Order 108. agreed toThat the time for the discussion of the motion be extended. members of the party who sit with me have accused those who sit behind the right honourable member for Barton of being Communists, but we are entitled to say that, irrespective of their personal opinions, they are the victims of a nonaggression pact, with the Communist party made by a junta calling itself the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, which is dominated by the right honourable member for Barton. able member will discuss the motion before the Chair. liave given, it is essential that there should the abuse that he may care to hurl at us be a clear line of demarcation between us and those who sit behind the right honourable member for Barton. Let us come now to the happenings of last week. The Leader of the Opposition has complained about the treatment that his supporters have received at your hands, but the boot is really on the other foot. We are the party that is entitled to complain. You, Mr Speaker, honourable members and the Government Whip know that when T spoke on the motion for the printing of a paper relating to foreign affairs and defence the supporters of the right honourable member for Barton arranged for the honourable member for East .Sydney( Mr what happened? Nobody was accusingAVard) to speak after me. That placed him in a very favorable position. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr had called, a supporter of the right honorHaylen) was to have been given the call, but immediately after you called me, the honourable member for Parkes retired gracefully from the table and the honourable member for East. Sydney, as had been arranged with' you by the Governnient. AVhip and the Leader of the Opposition, was called. That arrangement placed the honourable member for East Sydney in the most favorable position possible to reply to my speech. gave to the supporters of the Leader of the Opposition an advantage to which they were not entitled. We, as an Opposition party, are. entitled to put our views. In some respects they might coincide with those of the Government. That has often happened in this House, but you have continued to call honourable members from each side of the House alternately. That is the normal procedure and it gives parties their due representation in debate. In. giving the honourable member for East Sydney, instead of a Government supporter, an opportunity to speak after me you gave to the supporters of the right honourable member for Barton a very great advantage. To that extent you allowed yourself to be intimidated, and displayed bias. With regard to the speech of the honourable member for East Sydney, I"" believe, Mr Speaker, that you erred in sitting him down, because the members of this corner party are not afraid of the honourable member for East Sydney or of or at any of his friends sitting with him. But let me refer to what I think was the most disgraceful incident ever to occurin the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. You sat the honourable member for East Sydney down. Irrespective of whether you acted correctly or otherwise in doing so, under the Standing Orders there was ample opportunity for the supporters of the honourable member for East Sydney either to move that he be further heard, or to take other action so that the House itself could decide whether heshould continue with his speech. But anybody of being a Communist. There was no spontaneous eruption because I able member forBarton a Communist. The honourable member for East Sydney had been speaking, and he'had been calling people names. We-were not callinganybody names.

153,Mr Keon,"Thus, Mr Speaker, youbehind the right honourable member for Barton, led by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Webb), stood as one person, and hooted and yelled like a team of larrikins in the Sydney Domain. It was a most disgraceful performance, of which, I am sure, those who participated in it, if they have any regard for parliamentary institutions, are deeply ashamed. What would be the position in this Parliament if, on every occasion when the Speaker ruled against an honourable member, those who supported him rose to their feet and yelled and stamped like a mob of yahoos in some back suburb of a capital city of Australia ? I saw exactly the same kind of conduct hy people inspired by a few beers at a meeting which I addressed in my electorate last night. They were the same type of people, inspired by the same motives. The demonstration that we saw and heard in this House last Tuesday night, Mr Speaker, when supposedly responsible members of the Parliament were stamping and yelling insults at you at the tops of their voices, the influence of intoxicating liquor. warranted on your part the strongest possible action, if the dignity of the Parliawell that that remark was made with ment, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred with his tongue in his cheek, ledge that it was perfectly untrue. I am was to be maintained. This Parliament is more important than the Leader of the Opposition, myself, or any other member of it. The institution of parliament is the only bulwark by which ordinary men and women can hope to protect their liberties, their freedom and their decent way of life. Any action '3vich as that taken last Tuesday night by those who sit behind the right honourable member for Barton is aimed directly at the institution of parliament and, if permitted to continue, will make ordinary parliamentary life absolutely impossible. My complaint against you, Mr Speaker, and the reason why I propose to vote fbr the motion, is that instead of taking action against the people responsible for that demonstration, you walked out of the chamber and came in the next morning as though nothing extraordinary had happened. The demonstration required the strongest possible action by you against those responsible for it. Everybody who heard it in the House or over the air agrees that it was one of the most reprehensible things ever done by any group of members of this Parliament. I say, therefore, that you failed in your duty by not taking action against the people concerned. Another way in which I say you failed in your duty was in your dealings with the honourable member for East Sydney last Thursday night, when, with coldblooded and deliberate malice, knowing perfectly well that what he was saying was completely and absolutely untrue, he said, so that tens of thousands of people listening to their radios would hear it, that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) was full of grog. what he said. You made his offence worse, Mr Speaker, by rising to your feet, repeating what had been said and leaving the Minister for External Affairs -who , for better or worse, represents this country in the councils of the nationsin the position of attempting to rise in his place and argue that he was not under Everybody in the House knew perfectly deliberate ancl cold malice, in the knownot concerned so much with the welfare of the Minister for External Affairs as with the welfare of the other members of the Parliament. If you are going to permit, as you did permit, an honourable member to do a thing like that, only one remedy will be available to other honourable members, that is, to attempt to retaliate on the same lines. If they do attempt to retaliate on the same lines, what will this Parliament become, except a medium by which some honourable members will disseminate over the air slanders against other members? Therefore, Mr Speaker, I say that you failed in your duty when, after a cold-blooded andmalicious attempt to defame the Minister for External Affairs, you did not take the very strong action that was warranted. I know that in their hearts all honourable members sitting on the Opposition benches, whether they be supporters of the. right honourable member for Barton or otherwise, agree with me on that matter. One matter that was not touched upon, as far as I could gather, by the. mover of the motion, was the statement that you",34,Commonwealth Conference
154,Mr Fitzgerald,He never said that.,35,Commonwealth Conference
155,Mr Keon,"Everybody here heardhave failed to interpret or correctly apply the Standing Orders of the House. Last Thursday evening, when the motion for the closure of the debate on the Prime Minister'3 statement on foreign affairs had been put, I attempted to move an amendment to the motion for tbe printing of the paper. I attempted to do so after the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) had been disposed of. You ruled, Mr Speaker, that I was out of order. It was an important amendment, because it outlined the policy of the party that sits in this corner in relation to defence and the recruitment of Australian forces. It stated that we believed the security of this country was the paramount consideration and that Australian forces ought to be recruited by voluntary enlistment. But the Leader of the Opposition, who to-day is criticizing your conduct, rose quickly to his feet in order to persuade you to rule the amendment out of order, so that he and his party would not have to vote on it. Paragraph (&) of Standing Order 94 statesWhen the Motion"" That the question be now put"" has been carried, and the question consequent thereon has been decided In this case that referred to the amendment of the honourable member for Parkesany further Motion may be at once made without debate. I proposed to move a further amendment designed to add certain words to the motion proposed by the Prime Minister, but you ruled the amendment out of order. In my opinion, you acted contrary to the Standing Orders. I say that your interpretation of the Standing Orders on that occasion was wrong, and deprived the members of this corner party of an opportunity to secure a vote of the House on a matter we had been discussing for days on end, a matter of great importance to the Australian people. Finally, let me say that I believe that at the present time it is desperately important for the people of Australia that, if members of this Parliament, either individually or collectively, follow a policy which it may legitimately be pointed out coincides with the policy being advocated for the moment by the Mr Keon. Communist party, either in Communist organs, by Communist speakers or by any other means, we should have the right-indee d it is our duty-to point out that fact in this Parliament. If anybody feels offended by that action, I suggest that the remedy is to stop following Communist policy. Then nobody will be likely to accuse him of doing so. Opposition members interjecting, McCarthyism. Let me say that we have never been the subject, as has the Leader of the Opposition, of a comment by the members of a royal commission about smearers and those who use words which leave a trail of slime behind them. We have nothing whatever to apologize about in that regard. If the followers of the Leader of the Opposition advocate policies which are identical, almost word for word, with what appears in Communist party publications, with what appears in the Communist press and with what is spouted from Communist platforms in Hyde Park and on the Yarra bank, are we to be deprived of an opportunity to point out to the electors the policies that those people are advocating and how these policies coincide with the policies of the Communist party? If , Mr Speaker, you submit to intimidation by the supporters of the Leader of the Opposition, then you are failing in your duty to maintain this Parliament as a free institution which may allow the people to know what policies aro being followed by their elected representatives. I support the motion because I believe that irrespective of what has happened in the past, even last week you failed to take action against, those responsible for a most disgraceful demonstration in this House. That demonstration was entirely unwarranted, because those honourable members who created the disturbance had ample remedies under the Standing Orders. Under the Standing Orders they could have tried to get a further hearing for the honourable member for East Sydney, but instead of doing so they created a disturbance. I believe that you, Mr Speaker, erred in giving the honourable member for East Sydney an opportunity to wait until I",35,Commonwealth Conference
156,Mr Keon,"Our friends talk abouthad completed my speech on foreign affairs before he spoke, so that he, in his praising you, and the next moment he destructive debating style, could try to refute what I had said. In those circumstances I believe that you definitely disa t all if you draw the conclusion that the played favouritism. Again, quite recently you permitted the honourable member for East Sydney quite deliberately and maliciously to defame a Minister, well knowing that by so doing you were putting that Minister in such a position that he could not reply to the defamation without giving further publicity to it. Therefore, my party will vote for the motion before the House in the hope that that action will encourage you to desist from allowing honourable members on your left from continuing to intimidate you. have been amazed at the course that this debate has taken. The matter before the House was introduced by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who seemed reluctant to espouse the cause that had evidently been thrust upon him. Perhaps he thought that he should espouse the motion to justify his shaky hold, on the deputy leadership of the Opposition. His speech to the House demonstrated that he had done a considerable amount of homework during the week-end, and had studied many copies of bring the Government into disrepute, and Hansard in order to obtain the matter will bring it under a certain amount of upon which to build his argument. I was entirely unmoved by the impasto-day, Mr Speaker. There has been sioned address of the Leader of the a strong move on the part of the OpposiOpposition (Dr. Evatt). Indeed, the detion during the past few weeks to bring bate seems to have developed into somethis House into disrepute. That may thing like a schoolboy argument. Somebe traced directly to the fact that the body has called somebody else a nasty Opposition has now divided into different name. Somebody has hurled the word factions, and that honourable members "" Communist"" across the House, which opposite, not content with feuding bas brought the retort of ""fascist"". privately in their own ranks and having Then somebody has charged somebody disputes in the privacy of their own else with being an anti-Communist, and party room, have dragged their troubles somebody else has used the word "" antiinto this House.

However, such conduct has converted the House into a sort of pit occurred from time to time in the past, where they may conduct their arguments and those words no doubt will continue to -wit h you as the referee. be bandied across this House while red and black shirts are made and worn. Then the House heard the honourable terms and customs of the House, there is member for Yarra( Mr Keon). He an immediate howl from members of the seemed to blow hot and cold in your direcOpposition that they have no confidence tion, Mr Speaker. At one moment he was was condemning you. In view of the nature of his speech, we shall not wonder honourable member's arguments were not at all substantial. I believe that the substantial part of the debate has been lost. The matter which really should concern all honourable members is the lamentable lack of dignity displayed in this House during the last few weeks, and the lamentable loss of respect for the Chair by honourable members opposite. It is most regrettable also, that the business of the Government has been interrupted to-day by a member of the Opposition, with a motion such as that now before us. It is quite obvious that this technique of delay will be used by the Opposition time and time again as the days go by. This type of conduct does not enhance the reputation of the Opposition, nor does it increase the dignity of the Parliament. However, that tragic state of affairs does not seem to worry honourable members opposite, who are quite content to turn this House into what has recently become nothing better than a vaudeville show. The danger is that that type of action by honourable members opposite will criticism. Indeed, that may be the real motive inspiring the motion against you When you give a decision which is impartial and in accordance with the",36,Commonwealth Conference
157,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [4.47],"Iin-you. Then they cry out for the appointment of another referee. One should have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, as a one-time member of the High Court of Australia, would have had some idea of the necessity for upholding the traditions of your high office and the dignity of the Parliament. But, without doubt, the Leader of the Opposition has proved himself to-day to be the greatest exponent of all times of political bung rules. He has shown that he has no desire to curb the activities of his own colleagues if they want to put the boot into you, Mr danger of its being brought into disrepute. Speaker, or into the members of the Government. Despite what the honourable member for Yarra has said to-day, I believe that you took the only course open to you in ending that disgraceful scene which took place in this House last week. I believe that you did the right thing by suspending the sitting of the House. You did at least give the tempers of honourable members opposite a chance to cool down, and did give some hope that a sense of Parliamentary dignity would re-assert itself. I feel that partially, at least, your action did attain its objective. While there is little hope, as long as the Opposition is so seriously divided, that its members will behave in a manner creditable to our democratic system, I believe that the pressure of public opinion will at least prevent, a repetition of the scenes thafc we witnessed in this House recently when the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) attempted to make you, Mr Speaker, and this Parliament a laughing-stock for the nation. Many citizens, among them many of my constituents, have during the last weekend expressed to me the view that the Government, as the master of the House, should take some action to restore the decorum of tbe Parliament. to do. when most of the difficulty would come from the Opposition. It must be remembered that the forms of the Parliament have evolved over the centuries, with the just purpose of ensuring that the Opposition, as well as the Government, shall have full opportunity to express itself. Therefore, if this Government took any action which would amount to disciplining the Opposition, however justified that action might be, it would be a violation of the spirit of the Parliament. The eventual remedy for the behaviour of the Opposition in recent weeks lies with the electors, and surely in the future they will determine, by their vote, what is seemly behaviour by members of Parliament. That, however, is a long-term view. The immediate requirement is for the removal from the Parliament of the That can be achieved only by strong hut impartial action by you, Mr Speaker. The motion now before the House does little to assist you in the performance of your duties. It will be remembered that moves against the Speaker were very infrequent when the Opposition was led by the late Mr J. B. Chifley. Tinder the leadership of the right honourable member for Barton the Australian Labour party has converted itself into a number of brawling factions which may, or may not, have any regard for the dignity of the Parliament. As a result of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to display any quality of leadership, scant respect is paid to the Chair by Opposition member's. Does the fault lie in you, Mr Speaker, or in the ability of the right honourable gentleman to control the members of the party of which he is leader? I should like to quote the following opinion of one authority in relation to the office of the Speaker, which has been published by the Hansard Society of London:It has been well reinarked that such an office The office of Speakerdoes not require brilliant or rare qualities so much as common qualities in a rare degree, tt needs a practical man with a sound instinct for justice, who does his task honestly, firmly and good-humouredly. member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) interjects.

161,Mr Wheelee,"The honorablewhether there was any petrol in the tank of his car. When the thing blew up, the honourable member was left lamenting. His own leader, whom he had supported when the question of a spill was being considered, refrained from voting on the motion that the honourable member himself had submitted to caucus. All I can say about the honourable member for Werriwa is that he is living very dangerously. Whether or not there is a spill, he will discover that, in the process of seeking one, he has hurt somebody. There are honourable members opposite who have been in the Labour movement longer than has the honourable member himself, and he will suffer as a result of his inexperience. I had been referring to the opinion that had been published by the Hansard Society of London in relation to the basic qualities of a Speaker. Although you, Mr Speaker, may not have, in the opinion of honourable gentlemen opposite, your full share of those common qualities in a rare degree, it is a fairly well established fact that the office of the Speaker is very diflicult indeed. Despite that, it has become obvious from the remarks of Opposition members that there are many of them who believe they possess the outstanding qualities that would entitle them to occupy the chair at any given moment. The speakership is not the sole possession of the Government; the Speaker is voted to his honourable office by the House itself. I recollect the occasion upon which you, Mr Speaker, were elected to that office. The House alone may determine your term of office and sphere of usefulness, and it may set its own standard of dignity. A sense of dignity is something that should be fostered and cherished by all honourable members regardless of their political beliefs. If the occupant of the chair is not assisted by honourable members themselves, the dignity of the House is lowered accordingly. I , as a private member, voted for your election to the office that you now hold, and since your election, sometimes under trying circumstances, you have endeavoured, to the best of your ability, to l if t the tone of the House. The fact that you have not always been supported in your efforts is to be regretted. « -[21 ] ' There is a move afoot to make the House the political plaything of the Leader of the Opposition. He, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) has stated, is skilled in diversionary tactics. Having incurred the displeasure of the Labour party by his intervention in the Petrov affair, he looked for some means of diverting the minds of his followers from a criticism of himself. The result was the breaking up of the Parliamentary Labour party. Part of it sits on the Opposition crossbenches, and the remainder on the benches immediately before us. In this bid for power, he has flushed out into the open feelings of passion and hatred which have affected himself, so he has tried to turn the attention of his followers to you, Mr Speaker, by supporting the motion that is now before the House. No member or section of the Australian public will have been convinced by the reasons that have been advanced for the submission of the motion. I speak only for the electorate of Mitchell when I say that my constituents believe that it is my responsibility, in the House, to assist, according to my capacity, in the government of the country. They feel, ancl rightly so, that the purpose of government is not being well served when the House is called upon to spend its time, not in the process of government, but in witnessing, amongst members of the Labour party, a vendetta which brings little credit to the House. The value of the democratic system of government lies in the fact that thc party with a majority in the Parliament must rule. On the other hand, the Opposition is presumed to be elected by its supporters to place its views before the Parliament. The Opposition fails in its essential duty when, instead of advancing the views of its own supporters, it devotes its time to fighting amongst its own members. When it tires of that exercise, it turns to you, Mr Speaker, with the design that, through you, the House shall be discredited. The Opposition gains little from the submission of this motion, and it should be condemned for wasting the time of the House. While you, Mr Speaker, express the firm and honest intention of maintaining order, and of preserving the dignity of the House, I shall be content to support you. I am sure that the majority of honourable members agree with that attitude, and that they deplore the present irresponsible tactics of the Opposition.

165,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forThe purpose of this bill is to amend the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act 1948-1952 in certain directions. These amendments have been made necessary mainly by the fact that, because of the Poulton case situation, it has not been possible to make a final distribution of profits under the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act by the 30th -rune, 1955, as was originally envisaged by the Parliament. I shall refer to the Poulton case and its implications later. The bill also contains other provisions, mainly of a machinery nature, to which T shall also refer. A brief outline of the history of what are referred to generally as Joint Organization wool profits will probably assist the consideration of the present bill. Honourable members are no doubt aware of the war-time arrangement by which the Australian Government acquired and sold to the United Kingdom all wool produced in Australia except such quantities as were required for local use. The period of this arrangement was the duration of the war and one full year thereafter. Under the arrangement, which was terminated by mutual consent of the two Governments on the 31st July, 1945, any profits arising from the sale by the United Kingdom Government of Australian-produced wool to third countries were to be shared equally between the two Governments. Honourable members will recall that this war-time arrangement was followed by the wool disposals plan, to which the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were parties. Australia's part in the plan was written into the Wool Realization Act 1945. An authority known as the Joint Organization was established to implement the plan and the Australian Wool Realization Commission was created as its Australian subsidiary. The stocks of Australian. New Zealand and South African wools passed over to the Joint Organization by the United Kingdom at the outset were 10,400,000 bales. In addition to handling these stocks, the organization bought up the total Southern Dominion wool clips during 1945-46 and smaller amounts in later periods. Tbese later purchases were those made by the Joint Organization in pursuance of its plan to stabilize the market by buying in any wool which did not realize, at auction, a predetermined level. Some 90,000 bales of Australian wool were bought in under this procedure. The policy of the Joint Organization was to conduct disposals in an orderly manner so as not to depress the market. The market proved, however, to be unexpectedly buoyant and the disposal of the Joint Organization wool stocks did not take nearly as long as had been originally anticipated. In all, Joint Organization sold over 15,000,000 bales of wool of which nearly 10,000,000 bales were Australian. This disposal was completed at the end of 1951. The United Kingdom retained half of the profits from sales of wool during the disposal period, and paid the other half to the governments of the countries which had supplied the wool. Australia's share of the Joint Organization profits amounted in all to £90,200,000. These moneys, plus a profit of £900,000 arising from the war-time acquisition and disposal of Australian sheepskins, were invested as opportunity offered. Interest earned on these investments has resulted in the total moneys available for distribution being increased to £93,000,000. When it became clear that a profit, and not a loss, would result from the disposals plan, the Parliament passed the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act 1948, and a first interim distribution was made in 1949. Subsequent interim distributions were made in 1952, 1953 and 1954, and the latest of such distributions took place at the end of last month. At this stage, I should refer to what is known as the Poulton case. This litigation has forced the Government to review its earlier plans to complete the distribution of Joint Organization profits by the end of June next. The Poulton case, as honourable members probably know, is the litigation under which wool dealers are claiming a share of the profits which the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act has authorized to those growers whose wool was submitted for appraisement through dealers. Rulings on this case have been given by a single Justice of tbe High Court, and by the full High Court. Both of these judgments have been unfavorable to the dealers. It is my understanding, however, that Poulton!, through his solicitors, has mdicated he proposesto make applicationat an early date to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and it is this fact which is important in the present consideration. The effects of the Poulton case issue have been twofold. First, a result of the litigation has been that the Government' has had to delay payment of some £2,900,000 of Joint Organization profits to growers who submitted their wool for appraisement through dealers. second result of the litigation has been that, according to the Government's legal advisers, it would not be possible to make a final distribution in accordance with the provisions of the act before the 30th June, 1955. The reason is that the existing act requires that the "" expenses and charges"" of the Australian Wool Realization Commission in administering the act have to be known precisely before a final distribution is declared. These expenses and charges cannot be ascertained until the Poulton litigation is settled. As a first step out of this diffibeen contrary to the act to take into culty, I arranged earlier this year, with the approval of my colleague, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), to declare a fifth interim distribution, the amount involved being just short of £12,500,000. Although an interim distribution in name, this distribution is, in effect, the final distribution in respect into the Wool Industry Fund. The latter of xvool submitted for appraisement through brokers as distinct from dealers, because all available moneys due to be paid out by the Commonwealth in this connection have, with the exception of a very small sum, now been disbursed. In making the distribution, the commission is using the agency of the brokers. Distribution commenced at the end of April, and is now well on the way to completion. Growers who participate in the distribution will be aware that, as far as they are concerned, it is the final distribution. I have outlined the general background unclaimed moneys, will be left for payto this bill in tbe foregoing comments. I ment into the Wool Industry Fund. 1 now pass to its specific provisions. The say this because, in declaring the amount bill states that the distribution gazetted available for the fifth, and final, distribuon the 17th March, 1955, is to be regarded tion, the utmost care was taken to ensure as the final distribution for the main that the amount retained for tbe working purposes of the principal act. The bill expenses of the commission had been also removes the legal obligation to pay kept to a minimum, in order that growers out sumsthat arc too small to warrant distribution-. Those sums, amounting to approximately £14,050, were the moneys received from the Joint Organization after the announcement of the special distribution which took place in June, 1953, and which was restricted to those growers 1 who had left the industry prior to the Is:. September, 1949. For all' practical purposes recipients were paid tbeir frail entitlement at this distribution. The' principal act envisaged that moneys received after the special distribution The would be paid out at the time of the final distribution. Had this taken place, the persons who shared in the special distribution would have received £780 and other growers about £13,270. However, because the principal act required that the ""expenses and charges of the commission in administering the act"" should be known at the time of the final distribution, and because it has not been possible to ascertain them, as the Poulton litigation is still unsettled, the distribution which is now being effected had to be an interim distribution. It would have account the sum of £14,050 received from the Joint Organization after the announcement of the special distribution. The bill provides that this sum of £14,050 and any other amounts left in the Wool Disposals Profits Fund when all distributions have been made, shall be paid fund was set up in 1946 from moneys accumulated by the war-time Central Wool Committee from its activities in non-participating wool, wool-tops and sheep-skins under the war-time acquisition scheme. The fund is used for various purposes related to the wool industry, but mainly for wool research activities from which the benefits to the wool-growing industry are very real. I do not expect that any amounts of consequence, apart from the amount of £14,050 that I have mentioned and the",40,Second Reading

Only about £60,000 has in fact been retained for administrative and winding-up expenses to the 30th June, 1956. interim distribution that has declared has included an amount of dealer wool profits. The money concerned has been paid to the commission along with the other moneys to which the distribution has related. Asi t has not been possible to distribute the dealer wool moneys, they have been held by the commission. Most of these dealer wool moneys have been placed on fixed deposit, and a sum of £S0,000 in interest has been earned in this way. The principal act requires that any interest earned on moneys invested by the commission shall be paid to the Wool Disposals Profit Fund. The bill contains the provision that, as and when the dealer wool profits are paid out, each person benefiting w ill receive, in addition to the principal, his just share of the £80,000 interest.

169,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister f o rThe purpose of this bill is to repeal the legislation relating to the hide and leather control scheme that operated for a number of years under Commonwealth defence powers, and later under complementary Commonwealth and State legislation. Honourable members will recall that in October of last year I introduced a bill -the Hide and Leather Industries Act Suspension Bill-tb e purpose of which was to suspend the operative provisions of the principal act, the Hide and Leather Industries Act, 1948, as from the 16th August, 1954. The reason foi not repealing the act in 1 its entirety at that time was to leave the Australian Hide and Leather Industries Board in existence to conduct its winding up activities in an orderly manner. The board's affairs have now been finalized and no further reason exists for maintaining the board or the legislation. The board's current assets, after the winding up operations, amount to approximately £5,000. The bill provides that the Commonwealth will accept liability for any further proved claims against the board up to this amount but I am assured it is most unlikely there will be any such claims. It would be quite impracticable to return such n small amount to the people from whom the board acquired hides over the years, and it is the Government's intention that any residual funds should be used for research or other activities designed to improve hide production in Australia and to benefit the cattle industry. I commend the bill to honourable members.

This bill provides for the establishment of new machinery for appeals from courts-martial, so as to make better provision for the just enforcement of discipline in the armed services.

Under the system now operating in Australia there is no counterpart to this tribunal. (2) The court will be constituted by experienced lawyers drawn from the ranks of present and former justices and judges of federal courts and the Supreme Courts of the States and Territories, barristers and solicitor* of not less than five year?' standing, and other persons who have had legal experience making them specially suitable for appointment.

In deciding upon a new appeals syptem, a basic choice had to be made whether the body determining appeal* should form part of the ordinary system of justice, and, therefore, be a court in the strict sense of the word, or whether it should be part of the same system of are courts-martial. In England, a new civilian court, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, was created by legislationpassed in 1951.

172,Sir Philip Mcbride (Wakefield,"necessary from time to time for the court to sit in more than one division and for other judges to be appointed ad hoc. Provision was made to meet these contingencies. Creation of a civilian court did not present the British authorities with any constitutional problem. In Australia, on the other hand, we were faced by the constitutional requirement that judges exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth nust hold life tenure of office. However, rhe kind, of body which was needed was .me of a flexible character, able to function satisfactorily under all conditions in time of war as well as in time of peace Under active service conditions a fairly large complement of members might at times be required, whereas in normal conditions a relatively few members would suffice. In these circumstances, a civilian court, all of whose members would, in accordance with the Constitution, have to be appointed for life, was not an appropriate choice. The bill proposes instead a tribunal which is to form part of the same system as courts-martial. This tribunal will not be a civilian court. But we do not envisage that, on that account, our appeals system will be any less beneficial or satisinvolves injustice to the accused the confactory than that now operating in the United Kingdom. By reason of the qualifications required for appointment to the tribunal it can, I think, fairly be predicted that the tribunal will command, confirmation. After confirmation, a power in the military sphere, a status correto quash the conviction may be exercised sponding to that of a Supreme Court of by certain specified quashing authorities a State or Territory exercising criminal if it becomes apparent that the finding, appellate jurisdiction. Above all, the bill although confirmed, was illegal or involved does effect the major reform which was injustice to the accused. the prime object of the British legislation, namely, the provision of an oral and the proceedings is made in the office of public hearing of appeals. As a matter the Judge Advocate-General with a view of fact, a committee appointed in the to detecting any illegality or miscarriage United Kingdom to examine the adminisof justice. tration of military justice-that was the Lewis Committee, to which I shall refer again in a few moments-woul d appear in its report submitted in 1948 to have sentence. Such a petition may be prerecommended an appeal body forming sented before confirmation or at any time part of the military system, just like the after the finding and sentence have been one provided for in the bill. The bill takes as its model the United Kingdom Courts-martial Appeals Act of also in the Air Force. In the Navy, there 1951, although, for the constitutional is no confirming procedure, but the same reasons to which I have referred, it has not been practicable to follow that legislation at all points. There were valid reasons for paying close attention to the United Kingdom act. In the first place, the courts-martial system is very much the same in both countries and, secondly, the British act appears to have functioned satisfactorily in the period of about three years since it came into operation. These considerations led an inter-departmental committee, comprising representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the service departments and my department, to recommend for Australia legislation on the line of the Courts-martial Appeals Act 1951. It will, I think, assist honourable members in following the object and scheme of the bill if I first describe briefly the present procedure in regard to courts martial convictions. The system in the Army may be taken as an illustration. Tbe finding and sentence of an Army court-martial are not valid and effective until they have been confirmed by the appropriate confirming authority. Provision is made for the confirming authority to refer the proceedings to the appropriate Army legal oflicer for report. If it appears that the finding is illegal or firming authority is required to refuse confirmation. That is the position before the stage of In all cases an automatic review of Finally, it is open to the convicted officer or soldier to submit a petition seeking the quashing of the finding and confirmed. The system I have outlined obtains type of automatic review takes place and the convicted person may petition against the finding and sentence. The possibility of injustice occurring is, therefore, already pretty carefully guarded against. Nevertheless, there has for quite a long time been a feeling that the system was open to improvement. In the United Kingdom, two committees were appointed in the period between the first and second world wars. These were the committees presided over in 1919 by Lord Darling and in 1938 by Mr Justice Oliver. Further inquiries were pursued after the conclusion of World War II . An Army and Air Force Courts-martial Committee under the chairmanship of Mr satisfactory in most respects, in this parJustice Lewis presented a report in 1948, and in 1950 the naval disciplinary system was reviewed by the Pilcher committee. The reports of these committees were followed in 1951 by the passing of the Courts-Martial Appeals Act. The Lewis and the Pilcher committees drew attention to a defect that was then apparent in the British courts-martial appeals system and is still apparent in Australia. The whereas a civilian convicted by a civilian court was entitled on appeal to have the appeal heard orally and in public hy the appellate tribunal, this was not so in the case of a soldier petitioning against his conviction by court-martial. Both the automatic review, to which I have referred, and the hearing of the petition took place in private. Only written submissions could be made in support of a petition. These submissions were considered in the absence of the soldier or his representatives. The defect which this bill sets out to cedure for the review of findings of remove appears very clearly from the courts-martial. Similarly, a member of following passages, which are taken from the forces will, up to the moment when the Lewis reportThe drawback of the present system is that just as he is now able, to lodge a petition the Forces do not sec it in operation nor does seeking the squashing of his conviction. it necessarily take place at once. All that is known is that somebody in an oflice in London The existing system has worked well, (whom the soldier probably, though erronewithin its limits, and its retention will ously, regards as u War Olfice official) is supensure that only matters of real diffiposed to look through the case after convicculty will come before the tribunal. tion to see that all is according to rule.

The nobody knows, not even the accused, the reasons effect of these provisions is that, except which lead to a petition being dismissed if that is its fate. Sir Philip McBride. The committee continuedA further disadvantage was well described to us by a witness who at the time he was giving evidence was engaged in drafting a petition against the conviction of a number of soldiers by a court-martial at which he himself had appeared as counsel for the defence. He said, in effect, "" I can put down my various reasons of law on paper, but when reading them the Judge Advocate-General may form in his own mind some ground for thinking they are not well founded. IfI knew what that ground was, I might be able to show him by argument that his view was wrong. BuiI shall never get the opportunity of doing so such as I would have if there were an oral hearing of an appeal."" I think honourable members will agree that, although the existing system is ticular respect there is room for reform. In the words of a maxim frequently quoted, justice must not only be done; justice must be seen to be done. Clause IS of the bill gives positive effect to this principle. In these days a very large percentage of the male population enters one of the services at some time or other. Many of our young men spend periods as national service trainees. During the committees pointed out that, time for which they are in uniform they will, under the proposed new system, have available to them appeal facilities which, for all practical purposes, will be no less advantageous than are those to which civilians may have recourse. I think I have indicated sufficiently the prime object of the bill, and I turn now to a short discussion of some of its more important features. I shall refer also to the manner in which the new appeals system will work in practice. The new procedure is superimposed on. and does not replace, the present prohe has recourse to the tribunal, be able, in the case of a conviction involving sentence of death-which , it is thought, should he allowed to come before the tribunal as quickly as possible-the convicted person must first lodge with the appropriate authority a petition seeking the quashing of the conviction. The object is to ensure that the convicted person shall first exhaust the kinds of remedy available to him under the existing system. This is a reasonable requirement, since the petition may well be granted. If the petition is not granted or is not dealt with in a reasonable period the convicted person will be entitled to apply to the tribunal for leave to appeal against his conviction. On the hearing of an appeal the tribunal may, under clause 23, allow che appeal if it considers that the finding of the court-martial is unreasonable, or -jannot be supported, having regard t i the evidence, or if it considers that the decision involves a wrong decision of a question of law, or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice. This will serve to indicate the wide nature of the appeal which the bill provides. However, it is not proposed that there shall be an appeal against sentence, which will remain a matter for the servico authorities. In the ordinary run of cases, the determination of the tribunal will be final and conclusive, but provision is made in certain circumstances for a case to be stated to the High Court on a question of law. Either the appellant or the appropriate service authority may request that a case be stated. The case may be referred to the High Courti f the Attorney-General certifies that the question of law is of exceptional puhlic importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that thp question be so referred. The bill follows the United Kingdom Courts-Martial Appeals Act and the Criminal Appeal Act in this regard. Since the tribunal will be well equipped to make an authoritative determination, we think that it is not unreasonable to provide, as does the British legislation, that a person who has recourse to the new appeal body shall not thereafter be able to petition for the quashing of his conviction. As in the civilian sphere, quashing becomes a matter for the appellate tribunal. However, clause 58 expressly preserves the prerogative of mercy,, so that a convicted member of the forces will still be entitled, as is a civilian, to petition for the grant of a pardon or for the exercise of clemency in other respects. The bill contains quite a number of ancillary provisions, some of which are made necessary by reason of the fact that the tribunal will not be, as is the court created in England, a superior civilian court. I have outlined the main features and scheme of the bill, and I shall be glad to explain in committee any of the clauses on which honourable members may wish to hear discussion. The introduction of the new appeals system will mark an important step forward in the administration of military justice in Australia and I have, therefore, much pleasure in commending the bill to the House. adjourned.

175,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister forhonorable members that the first step which led to the introduction of the rehabilitation scheme was taken in July, 1941, when the Joint. Parliamentary Committee on Social Security was established by the Menzies Governnient under the then Minister for Social Services. The first interim report of the committee, issued in September, 1941, emphasized the need for physical rehabilitation and vocational training of invalid pensioners. In the same year the Department of Social Services began to arrange for the training of selected invalid pensioners at the Commonwealth's expense. After the war the Department of Social Services accepted the responsibility of arranging for the rehabilitation of physically handiwomen when doubts and fears give way capped ex-servicemen who were ineligible for repatriation benefits. The success of the scheme led to the introduction of legislation, in 1948, providing for the civilian rehabilitation service for invalid pensioners and recipients of sickness benefits. The bill represents a big step forward in the provision of a complete service of rehabilitation in co-operation with State authorities and private organizations. Rehabilitation in Australia has now progressed beyond the purely experimental and the conjectural. Its social and economic worth is recognized by all sections of the community. Up to the end of March this year, more than 7,000 invalid pensioners and recipients of sickness benefits have been restored to the work force of this country through the good work of the rehabilitation service. These were people who had either been granted an invalid pension because of the extent of their physical incapacity, or who were found to be drifting towards permanent incapacity of a pensionable degree. As a result of the employment of 2,700 invalid pensioners a saving of over £500,000 a year in the payment of invalid pensions . and dependants' allowances is now being made. By reducing the recovery time of about monwealth to intrude into their field. 4,300 people on long-iterm sickness Rather it is proposed to complement their benefit, a further yearly saving of activities, and to work in close co-opera£50,000 can be added.

We know that the fullest Sfr. McMahon. savings in pension payments will increase progressively and make an even more favorable comparison with current running costs. At a most conservative estimate, if we take into consideration the contribution to the national income by the rehabilitated worker, we can add well over £1,250,000 a year to the credit side of the account. It is not only the effect on the national income which appeals most strongly to the right-minded citizens of Australia: it is the social effect on the individual and his family. It does not require any feat of imagination to appreciate the tremendous spiritual value to men and to hope. Possibly the greatest advertisement for this scheme, and the most cogent reason why such strong representations have been made from so many organizations in Australia for a broadening of the scope of the service, are the thousands of men and women happily restored to gainful occupation and a normal life. It is with pleasure, therefore, that the Government has decided to extend the scope of the service for the physically handicapped. The most important amendment to be effected by the bill relates to young persons between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years. These young people are not eligible under the Social Services Aci for an invalid pension. Eor this reason they have, in the past, been excluded from consideration for treatment or training. Under this bill, services such as medical and ancillary treatment, supply of artificial appliances, vocational assessment and training, will be available to these young people. This earlier treatment will increase the prospects of ultimate cure. Voluntary bodies such as crippled children's societies, spastic centres, hospitals and others have done magnificent work in this field for many years. There is no intention on the part of the Comco-operation of voluntary organizations which is vital, is assured. There will he no intrusion on the functions of State Departments of Education. Here again, a close working liaison to ensure an emcient service will be required. The key-note of this development of the rehabilitation service must be team-work at all levels. Mr Speaker, it is many years since the Government has received representations from such diverse sources as it has received for the extension of this service to younger persons in the community. Employers, trades unions, doctors, social workers, and political organizations-al l of these have made representations to the Government. Another clause in the bill will allow the home, if finance for necessary plant, Director-General of Social Services to arrange for the admittance to rehabilitation centres of persons, not eligible for free treatment, who are able to pay the cost of treatment or for whom relatives, friends, insurance companies and the like are prepared to pay. As most honourable members know, treatment has, in the past, been confined mainly to invalid pensioners and recipients of sickness benefits. Numerous private cases have been referred to the department in which the medical advisers of the persons concerned have recommended treatment in a rehabilitation centre. Because those particular people were excluded, by their means, from receiving an invalid pension or a sickness benefit, they could not be accepted for rehabilitation under the existing act. Under this bill treatment will now be permitted in rehabilitation centres on payment of an approved fee. It is also proposed to include recipients of tuberculosis allowances in the classes of persons eligible for rehabilitation. In most cases, men and women in receipt of tuberculosis allowances would otherwise qualify for invalid pensions, and as such would be eligible for treatment or training under the scheme. There have been isolated instances where the means test applying to the grant of an invalid pension, is more restrictive than rehabilitation allowance, based on the that for the tuberculosis allowance. Where this occurs a deserving case for whom the Commonwealth is already paying a special allowance could be prevented from receiving the benefit of rehabilitation. In practice, recipients of tuberculosis allowances are accepted for rehabilitation primarily for vocational training or re-training. Early medical treatment and much of the after-care is done by the State departments of health as part of the national campaign against tuberculosis. This bill introduces an entirely new and important development in rehabilitation. It is the provision of a loan of up to £200 for disabled persons who, after treatment and/or training provided by the service, are unable to enter employment under normal industrial conditions, but who could be satisfactorily established in self-employment at equipment, &c, is available. Employment in industry remains the firm objective of the scheme, but there are cases where complete mobility cannot be restored and where self-employment at home is the best solution to the employment problem. Not all persons will be suitable for such ventures, but where it is fully justified the Government thinks that it would be unsound not to take this final step to enable the individual to undertake employment. Apart from the provisions I have mentioned, the bill also provides for the payment of certain increased allowances when the vocational stage of rehabilitation has been reached. Briefly, they are training allowance, living-away-fromhome allowances, and the allowance for books and other equipment required for training. The present training allowance will be increased from 25s. to 30s. a week. During the earlier remedial stages of rehabilitation the man or woman receives the benefit-eithe r a pension or a sickness benefit-to which he or she was previously entitled. This carries on until the vocational training stage of the rehabilitation process is reached. At this point the invalid pension or sickness benefit is replaced by a rate of invalid pension to which the trainee would be entitled, plus the special training allowance, which will now be 30s. a week. The training allowance might be constandard of accommodation in rehabilitasidered as a fixed additional allowance tion centres to ensure that it is in line aimed at providing an incentive to with modern developments.

I commend this bill to the House. for Supply) [8.1S] I move That the bill be now read a second time. With this bill the Government is completing a further stage in its programme of reviewing and bringing up to date the industrial property laws of the Commonwealth. In 1952, a new Patents Act was passed after a committee appointed by my colleague, the Attorney-General, had carried out an inquiry and submitted a report. W it h regard to trade marks, our present Prime Minister had already, in 1938, when occupying the office of Attorney General, set up a review committee. That committee, which was presided over by the late Sir George Knowles, did, in fact, present a report and propose a draft bill to replace the then existing law. However, the war intervened without the amending legislation being passed. Great Britain, Canada and the United States of America have in recent years reviewed their own laws on the subject, and as, in any case, it was some time since the Knowles Committee had presented its report, the Attorney-General {Senator Spicer) set up a new committee to review the Australian legislation. The present com mi tt.ee has been pretered under the present act are those sided over by Mr Justice Dean, of the which satisfy the test of distinctiveness, Supreme Court of Victoria. His Honour or in other words marks which are had previously boon n member of the adapted to distinguish the goods of the Knowles Committee, and the Government proprietor from those of other persons. was particularly fortunate in again finding His Honour able to give the Government and the country the benefit of his expert knowledge of a branch of industrial property law. It will be recalled that, in addition to his participation over the years in the review of trade marks law, Mr Justice Dean was chairman of the Patents Law Review Committee, the report of which committee led to the passing of the Patents Act 1952. The committee was a f u l l y representative body, since its members, in addition to His Honour, were the Parliamentary Draftsman, Mr J. Q. Ewens; the Registrar of Trade Marks, MrH . R. W i l m o t: Mr J. Colwell, a former Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks; and Messrs. J. B. Hack, of Melbourne, and W. Hooworth, of Sydney, who are practising trademarks agents and patent attorneys. The present committee has made an expert and (Parramatta-Minister exhaustive examination. Its report was tabled in both Houses of the Parliament on the 21st October last, and both the report and a draft bill attached to the report in which the committee embodied its recommendations have been most favourably received. A few alterations of a relatively minor character have been suggested. These were considered and approved by the committee, and in the result some changes have been made to the committee's original d r a f t bill. Trade-marks law is a technical subject, but it has nonetheless a considerable practical importance, not only to traders but also to the buying and consuming public. The bill now before the House w ill replace the existing Commonwealth legislation on the subject of trade marks, and the Government expects that both the public and traders will derive considerable benefit from the expression in the one act of a modern set of trade-marks principles. I shall indicate briefly the principal alterations which the bill proposes should be made to the exi?t.:in<r law. One of the most prominent reforms is concerned with the Register of Trade Marks.

178,Mr Beale,"The mark may be inherently distinctive in that sense or it may have become distinctive in fact by reason of actual use, but unless the mark is distinctive inherently or in fact when registration is sought, it is not capable of registration. It is proposed that there shall in future be a four-part register. PartA will include all the marks which have already been registered and will also be rhe part under which marks which are distinctive at the time of registration may be registered in future. Under PartB it will be possible to register marks which are not eligible for registration under Part A. These are marks which are not, and have not become, distinctive at the time of registration, but which are capable of acquiring distinctiveness as a result of extensive use. The main purpose of Part B, which is similar to provisions that havp been adopted also in the United Kingdom, is to enable Australian traders to obtain rights in certain foreign countries, such as the United States of America and Germany, which will give no protection to a mark used in Australia unless thf mark is a registered mark. PartC of the register will provide for r,he registration of what aro referred to in the existing legislation as standardization marks. Iu conformity with United Kingdom and United States practice, the?"" 1 marks will in future be known as certification marks. This term more clearly describes the nature of such marks. They are not trade marks in the usual sense, but are used by certifying authorities, such as, for example, the Standards Association of Australia, for the purpose of certifying to the origin, material, mode or conditions accuracy or other characteristics of goods. The law at present requires the proprietor of a standardization or certification mark to examine in every case the goods to which the mark is to be applied. Under modern methods of mass production this is an impracticable requirement. bill, following generally what has been done in Great Britain, dispenses with the requirement, subject to the safeguard that the proprietor must be able to satisfy himself that goods bearing his certification with the requisite future, applications for registration of Mr Beale. certification trade marks will be made to the registrar, and will not require ministerial consideration as at present. The decision of the registrar, as in the case of his decision with respect to other marks, will be subject to an appeal to tin appeal tribunal provided for in the bill. The fourth part of the register will be Part P, in which will be registered what are described as defensive trade marks. The legislation at present in force gives protection only in respect of the particular goods for which the trade mark is registered. However, there are somemarks which are so widely known thai the use of the mark by other persons on other goods could lead to confusion. The word ""Kodak"" is an illustration. Th« United Kingdom has provided a mean* whereby the proprietor of such a mark can obtain a defensive registration and thus secure wider protection. In thif bill we adopt the English provision, but with some variation. In England a wore can be registered as a defensive mark only if it is an invented word. The committee felt that there could he instance? in which a word which was not an invented word, such as, for example, th« word "" lion"", might be so extensively used in relation to particular goods as to make its use with respect to other goods likely to deceive. For this reason the committee has recommended that th» register of defensive marks should not h* limited to invented words. The bill proposes a change in regard to the eligibility of persons to carry on business as trade marks agents. No restrictions are imposed by the present of manufacture, quality law, but clause 135 of the bill, specifies certain qualifications. These have been so designed as not to work hardship on a person who does not possess the technical qualifications specified in the clause, but who nevertheless has over a period acquired a satisfactory knowledge of trade The marks practice and procedure. Under paragraph (h) of sub-clause (1.) of clause 135, a person will be able, with the approval of the registrar, to continue to practise as a trade marks agent if he has so practised in Australia for a conmark are in accordance tinuous period of two years immediately standards. In prior to the lst January, 1955. This provision has in fact been made more liberal, with the full approval of the committee, following representations received after the report was made public last year. I might say that further representations have been made to the Government -luring the last week or two, and these are at present receiving consideration. In rising qualifications for trade marks agents, the bill falls into line with what .has always been the position under the patents law in relation to patent attorneys. This is desirable, since trade marks law is probably no less intricate rhan is patents law. With regard to appeals from decisions uf the registrar, the bill follows the scheme of the new patents legislation. Under the existing law, an appeal lies from a decision of the registrar to the law officer, as well as to the High Court. The committee has recommended the abolition of the apj>eal to the law officer and has proposed that the High Court shall be the appeal tribunal for the purposes of the act. The provisions with respect to the appeal tribunal will be found in Part 15 of the bill. The committee considered whether there should be an extension of the protection which registration of a trade mark gives to the registered proprietor under the existing law. The present provisions with respect to infringement are to be found in section 53 of the existing act. That section provides that the rights acquired by registration of a trade mark shall be deemed to be infringed by the use, in relation to the goods in respect of which it is registered, of a mark substantially identical with the registered mark, or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive. Experience has shown that the registered proprietor of a mark may suffer injury in other ways. For example, goods may be repacked by a trader who applies his .own mark to the package; or the proprietor's mark may be defaced or obliterated. Clause 63 of the bill is designed to meet these circumstances. The clause enables the registered proprietor of a mark to take action to protect himself against the type of conduct to which E have referred, and in appropriate circumstances, enables him to sue for infringement as a result of such conduct. The bill does not adopt another provithe adoption of price maintenance prosion in regard to infringement which visions, and it does not appear that they appears in the United Kingdom act. In the United Kingdom, protection is given to the registered proprietor of a trade mark where the mark is used by some other person, not for the purpose of indicating his own goods, but for the purpose of indicating the goods of the registered proprietor. The evil to which this provision is directed is well illustrated by the Yeast-Vite case of 1934, reported in volume 51 of Beports of Patent Cases, at page 110, in which the House of Lords held that the use of the phrase "" a substitute for YeastV it e"" by anothei trader was not an infringement of thr trade mark "" Yeast Vite "". Following the decision of the House of Lords, representations were made to the Board of Trade Committee, in England, to remedy what was represented as a defect in the law. The Board of Trade Committee recommended the adoption of a provision to meet the case, and paragraph (6) of sub-section (1.) of section 4 of the British Act of 1933 was enacted in consequence. Sir George Knowles's Committee recommended the enactment of a similar provision here, with some alteration, but since then the English legislation has been subjected to severe criticism in the courts. The Dean Committee has come to the conclusionthat a novel and far-reaching provision of this nature should not be enacted. In paragraph 27 of the report it gives what are, I think, most cogent reasons for this view. There is one other respect in which the Dean Committee rejected a major proposal supported by the Knowles Committee. This relates to price maintenance. The Knowles Committee recommended the adoption of proposals which would enable the proprietor of a trade mark to fix a minimum price for the sale to the public of goods sold under his mark and to sue for infringement any trader who sold the goods below the price so fixed. This question has recently been considered by the Board of Trade Committee in England, and the Dean Committee had before it a report submitted to the United Kingdom Parliament in 1951. The United Kingdom decided against have beeu adopted in trade marks legislation anywhere else. Although the committee did not consider itself qualined to enter upon the economic and commei^cial considerations which legislation of this character raises, the government agrees that provisions of this kind are not appropriate to a law which is limited in its operation to goods sold under a trade mark. powers to legislate on this subject are limited and if, in any particular trade, there is a case for legislation to prevent price-cutting, the necessary provision can, it seems, best be made by legislation of the State Parliament, which would apply generally to goods sold in that trade. The committee also gave consideration to a proposal that the registered proprietor of a trade mark should be able to restrain the use of his mark, not merely in relation to goods covered by his registration, but also upon goods which are so closely allied to those specified in the registration that the public could suppose that tbose other goods were of his manufacture. Some fresh protection in relation to this matter is afforded by the provisions of the bill relating to defensive Reports. trade marks and, for the rest, it seems that the matter is more appropriately left to the protection afforded to a trader in passing-off action, where that is applicable. The committee also considered, but rejected, a proposal for the registration of conform with the practice in the United so-called "" service marks "". It was proposed that provision should be made for the registration of marks used in tertiary industries signifying that the goods to which the mark was attached had at some time been cleaned or repaired or otherwise treated by the owners of the mark. There are provisions of this kind in America and in Canada, but an attempt to register such a mark under the English Act of 193S was rejected by the House of Lords. The objections stated by the committee to the proposal provide strong reasons against its adoption. Tliere appears, as the committee says, little or no public demand for such protection, the law of passing-off probably being sufficient to meet any cases which may arise. to which the committee gave consideratial. The importance of it was referred to Mr Beale. tion. Other topics, covering the whole range of trade marks practice and procedure, are covered in the bill and, where necessary, are explained in the report. The bill will provide a modern and workable code for those affected by thii important branch of industrial property legislation. It will have the additional merit of bringing our trade marks laws The Commonwealth's into substantial conformity with thost.* now in operation in the United Kingdom. Opposition) [8.35] -The Opposition ha* considered the bill and approves of it. There is, however, one provision with which I think the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) should have dealt morrfully, because it breaks new ground so far as Australia is concerned and marks a radical departure from previous trade marks law. It represents a considerable advance in the conception of trade marks and, in a sense, implements a view expressed many years ago by two justices of rhe High Court of Australia, Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Higgins, in the Union Label case, as it is called, which is reported in 190S Commonwealth LanThe bill proposes the establishment of « special part of the register, Part C, which will provide for the registration of what are referred to in the existing legislation as standardization marks. In order to Kingdom and the United States of America, apparently in future those marks will be known as certification marks. They are not trade marks in the usual sense of the term, as the Minister stated in his speech. They are used by certifying authorities, such as the Standards Association of Australia, for the purpose of certifying origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristics of goods. In the first draft of the bill, I think it was suggested that such a. mark might cover conditions of manufacture. At any rate, the essence of the matter is that the mark will, be a guarantee to the purchasing puhlic of a standard. sary.",51,Fhaseb Adjourned Trademarksbill 1955 Second Reading

181,Mr Thompson,"That is very necesby the special committee presided over by Mr Justice Dean of the Supreme Uourt of Victoria. At page 4 of his 1954 report, he pointed out something that this Parliament often has to remember, that is, that Australia is a federation and, therefore, there is a division of powers between the Oommonwealth and the States. The Oommonwealth has power to legislate in relation to trade marks, but it has no power to legislate in respect of another branch of the law. I refer to what is called the law of passing off, which deals with cases where a trader, by using -ome device or pretence, puts goods before che public with the intention of leading the public to suppose that those goods are the goods of anotlier person, thereby increasing his trade by something in the nature of fraud. Then Mr Justice Dean dealt with certification or standardization marks. Ee said that, by a majority decision of the High Oourt, the scope of the Commonwealth power in respect of trade marks must be interpreted in accordance with r.he meaning of that expression at the date of the Constitution, and cannot be extended to an enlarged definition. He pointed out that that point was established by the Union Label case in 1908, and he discussed that case. I want to refer to what he said ahout the law of passing off, which stems from the fundamental principles of law and equity. A court of equity would restrain a trader who tried, hy some device, to pass off his goods as the goods of some one else. Mr Justice Dean referred specially to the Union Label case, in which the High Court held to be invalid a part of the Trade Marks Act 1905 relating to workers' trade marks. He saidThe point of the decision was that the expression "" trade marks "" in Constitution must be confined to such marks as were . . . properly regarded as trade marks at the time of the enactment of the Constitution, and that at that date the expresto most, if not nil, of the subjects of legislasion referred solely to marks nsed to indicate the source or origin of goods, and the workers' trade marks were not marks of this kind. Therefore, the union label provisions passed by this Parliament were declared to be invalid, by a majority decision of thc High Court. This valuable report saysThis decision imposes a serious handicap upon any reform of the law. Indeed, it may render invalid, for like reasons, the provisions of the existing Act relating to standardization trade marks. Tf the matter comes up for review it will bring into bold relief the attitude of the court. I think that ultimately it will be found that an authoritative body such as the Minister mentioned may have to fix a standard under which there will be satisfactory manufacture and tradesman-like performance of the work by employees. That would accord with modern conceptions of associated law in other parts of the world. It is widely defined in clause 83. Mr Justice Dean suggests clearly that that may be challenged because of this decision dealing with the union label way back in 1908. I should like to quote two short passages from the dissenting judgments. Mr Justice Isaacs took strongly the view that the term "" trade marks "" could not, even at that time, be limited to marks denoting the particular trade. He said that it would indicate some special connection of an association of workmen with the manufacture of goods; that, after all, the court was examining a constitution, not an ordinary piece of legislation; and that the definition of trade marks could not be restricted to the limits that applied in 1901. Mr Justice Higgins saidThe case as put for the plaintiffs is short and simple. They say that, though the Federal Parliament has power to legislate about "" trade marks"" a "" workers' trade m a r k "" was not a ""trade m a r k "" within the accepted definition in 1.000, the date of the Constitution, and that therefore thc Parliament has no power to make any law as to "" workers' trade marks "". It is said that, though the mark is to bc used by or with thc consent of a trader for the purposes of pushing trade, it is not a trade mark. If the argument for the plaintiffs is right. . . the if the powers of thc Commonwealth Parliament are so rigidly and narrowly circumscribed as is contended-ther e w ill be some curious results not merely as to trade marks, but as tion in Section 51. The n he dealt w it h ill u s t r a t i o n s of t h is and s a i d The Commonwealth is to be tied down to the practice in 1900. According to the plaintiffs' argument, the Federal Parliament having covered all the ground for trade marks as enforced by the law in lflOO, the State Parliaments may, each for its own State, make such laws as they think f it , varying in character and in machinery, as to any marks to be used for purposes of trade, excepting only such trade marks as the courts enforced in 1900. En other words, Mr Justice Higgins said that if the definition of "" trade marks "" were to be limited to that adopted This short bill proposes some amendments in 1900 the States would still be able to to the existing law in regard to applicapass legislation permitting ""workers' tions for letters patent. trade m a r k s "" under varying conditions.

[8.57] -This bill appears to disclose on the part of the Government an attitude towards the development of Australian industry which is typically timorous. The cotton industry is of the greatest importance to this country, and from many aspects. At present we are importing about 80,000 bales of raw cotton every year, and that makes a very considerable inroad into our supply of dollar funds. We are naturally .suited to produce, if not the whole, then a very considerable proportion, of our requirements of cotton. Of course, by producing cotton in this country and by placing the cotton industry on a sound foundation, we are not only performing an immensely important task from a defence viewpoint, but we are also doing an immense service to other aspects of Australian agriculture and industry. The cotton grassland rotation system is of great importance to the dairying industry, and the provision of by-products, including protein-rich cattle food, is also of extreme that more than twenty years ago we were producing 17,000 bales of cotton. once. pened in 1934, when in the one year we of the States of South produced 17,000 bales of cotton. If we go back further to the time of the disturbed conditions in the United States of America during the American Civil War, we find that, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) indicated in his second-reading speech, we had more than 50,000 acres of land under cotton in this country. That was before the turn of the century, of course. In the middle 1930's we had reached a production of 17,000 bales. Then World War II . came, and it was to be expected that during the war years the production of cotton would decline as a result of the limited amount of man-power that was available. Man-power was required for the performance of other tasks and, in particular, for the production of food. By the end of the war, the production of cotton had fallen to approximately 500 bales a year, which was a purely nominal amount.

That represents a very small portion of our needs, particularly when it is realized that our importation of cotton is, in an average year, approximately 80,000 bales. In view of those circumstances, surely the Government would be justified in offering to the some stability, and some encouragement I am convinced that, if the Government. It is the only had adopted that course, there was no reason why the production of cotton was achieved in 1934, when 17.000 bales were produced.

If he is afraid of rhe cost of giving assistance to rhe industry, let me remind him -hat so far the Oommonwealth has !>een involved in very small cost. Its assistance amounted to, I think, £17,000 iu one year and £25,000 in another year, a total of approximately £42,000. But it has not achieved the desired result. The Government has not succeeded in obtaining the production that is required for Australia's defence needs, and which -hose people who are engaged in the industry would beonly too willing to achieve if they were guaranteed an adequate, stabilized and profitable price r'or a reasonable number of years. A minimum guarantee of 9£d. per lb. in 1955 obviously is not enough, as has been proved by the production figures. The Opposition has not any intention of opposing the bill. It is only too pleased to see the Government giving further assistance to the industry. A little is better than nothing. !. have listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). He is not as well versed in this subject as he is in other subjects about which he speaks in the House. I have listened to his suggestions about the assistance that the Government should have given to the cotton industry. The Government has been told by honourable members opposite that it has done precious little to assist the industry over the last five years, but at least it has been responincreasing production which has consible for the lifting of production of raw cotton from 500,000 lb. to approximately 3,500,000 lb. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to the days of maximum crops, and he stated that in one year production reached 17,000 bales. I agree with his statement that, during the war years, the industry suffered and that, after the war, there certainly was a need for some encouragement to be given to it. The industry went into the doldrums, and it was confronted by problems that were peculiar to itself. A. Labour governinent investigated the cotton industry in the years immediately after World War II . It dilly-dallied, and the industry gradually declined still further. In 194S, the Chifley Government decided to investigate the industry thoroughly. There was even a Tariff Board inquiry. In September, 1949, in the dying days of the Chifley Government, when it had a chance to do something for the industry before an imminent election, Mr Chifley. in reply to a question by the honourable meniber for Eisher( Mr Adermann). stated that the Government did not propose to give any further assistance to ths industry. So much for the brave words of the honourable member for Eden Monaro! At that time the guaranteed price was 5-Jd. per lb., and the industry was on its last legs. -Inotation of Mr Chifley's reply. tion. The words were burnt into my mind. Despite what the Australian Labour party says now when it is in opposition, when it was in office it condemned the industry to extinction and said, "" We can get along well enough without the cotton industry"". It was left to this Government to try to revive the industry. The growers had lost heart because of the dilly-dallying of the Chifley Government over a period of five years. Most of the growers had left the industry, ancl they were not prepared to return to it unless they were guaranteed an adequate price. As so few growers had actually been growing cotton during those years, it was hard to assess a profitable price to the grower. In 1951, the guaranteed price was fixed at 9£d. per lb., and. immediately, the growers responded by continued to increase annually with the exception of last year when a substantial proportion of the crop was destroyed.b,v flood whilst that portion which was nodestroyed was so heavily weeded as a result of rain that it was almost impossible to get mechanical harvesters into the fields.

213,Mr Allan Fkasek,"Why should notditions, whicli vary considerably, and overseas marketing conditions must be taken into account. The Government has restored the confidence of the grower in respect of every phase of the industry from growing to marketing. I have beard it said that the guaranteed price is not to be guaranteed for a sufficiently long period. The reason why some growers have expressed that view is reflected in what they have said to me. Erankly, they have said, in effect, ""We are all right under your Government, but if that fellow Pollard gets back we will go into the ditch "". That has been said to me on many occasions. Eor that reason some growers have asked for the term of the guaranteed price to be extended. The fact remains that all the growers liave confidence in this Government. As a result of the assistance that it has ""iven to them, there are already on the cotton-fields two new John Deere mechanical harvesters, which are privately owned. Each of those harvesters, complete with tractor, costs approximately 610,000. The John Deere organization has taken an interest in the industry. After making a survey of it and its potentialities, that organization sent a man out from the United States to Queensland, and on the 16th February last he held a field-day and demonstrated the machine, which, as I have said, is privately owned. That is a great advance on the conditions that existed in 1949 when the industry was practically doomed to extinction. To-day, two individual growers have outlayed £10,000 for the purchase of mechanical pickers and other growers contemplate purchasing similar machines. The growers cannot show greater confidence in the Government than hy being prepared to pay out hard cash in that way. These tractors and harvesting machines are heing obtained from dollar sources and the Government has not, and will not, place any restriction upon their importation. The encouragement which the Government has given to the industry will .stand to its great credit, particularly as not so many years ago the industry was doomed to extinction when the Chifley Government said that it would not help it because the Tariff Board had reported against the provision of such assistance. Despite the Tariff Board's recommendation, this Government has assisted the Cotton Marketing Board and has given a guaranteed price to the industry because it is essential that cotton be grown in Australia. A price was guaranteed, mechanical harvesters were imported, and production immediately began to increase. As a matter of fact, production is now at a most satisfactory level, despite adverse climatic conditions. An officer has been sent abroad to study the latest method of ginning that will increase the return to the growers from the gins. All in all, we have this general improvement from the planting of the seed to the marketing of the cotton in Australia. Due again to the attitude of the Chifley Government, the spinners in this country had little faith in the ability of Australians to grow cotton and, accordingly, they made long-term plans for overseas buying. Production began to increase in 1951, and we tried to sell a larger quantity of raw cotton to the spinner. In fact, we had more than 500,000 lb. of raw cotton for disposal. The spinners, as I have stated,, had made long-term arrangements to purchase cotton from overseas, and, therefore, it was difficult to place some of the Australian-grown cotton. Due entirely to the work of the Minister for Trade and Oustoms (Senator O'Sullivan),' a very satisfactory basis has since heen worked out for the marketing of our cotton. The Minister brought the representatives of the growers, the Cotton Marketing Board and the spinners together in order to reach that situation. Opposition members say, graciously, if their attitude can be so described, that they will not oppose the bill. I say to them, ""Please do not criticize the bill, because this Government is doing something which the preceding Labour Government was not prepared to do. It has rejuvenated the cotton industry which the Labour Government had threatened with extinction and which would have gone out of business had the Chifley Government been returned to office in 1949 "". I say to the Labour party, "" Do not criticize the present Government, whatever you do, because it has looked after the industry from the planting of the seed to the sale of the last pound'",61,Harrison
214,Mr Pearce,"Becaus e seasonal conof cotton to the spinners in Australia"". The response by the growers has been tremendous. The cotton industry has been a great national asset. I wish this bill a speedy passage through the Parliament, and I hope that nothing will be said in this debate to disturb the confidence of the growers, because Australia needs this industry most urgently. did not direct attention earlier honourable member wish to raise a point of order ? attention, Mr Speaker, to the remark made by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce).

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has already indicated that we on this side of the House support the bill. BeforeI deal with the provisions of this legislation, I should like to had developed, was sufficiently high to refer to a few of the statements of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr dairying than in the extension of his Pearce). The whole tenor of his speech was that this industry had languished and had nearly died because of lack of action on the part of the Chifley Government. He laid the blame for every adverse condition in the industry at the door of the Chifley Government. Obviously, the honourable member has no knowledge of the history of this industry, and particularly of its immediate postwar bistory. I point out, for the information of the honourable gentleman, that when cotton-growing was first attempted in Queensland in I860 member remember that first attempt? Opposition at least conduct a little research into a subject and try to inform their minds of happenings in the past before they speak on a bill. The cultivation of cotton was first attempted in Queensland at the time of the American Civil War. The United States of America was then the principal cottonproducing country in the world, and the price of cotton rose steeply during the Civil War. However, after the restoration of American production, the Australian industry rapidly declined until it virtually went out of existence. In 1920, a serious attempt was made to re-establish the industry in Australia, and an Empire Cotton Corporation was founded for that purpose. Production reached its peak in this country in 1934, when from 50,000 acres. When World War II . broke out in 1939, production declined rapidly, due partly to a shortage of manpower and partly to concentration on the 1949, Australia passed through a transition period from a war economy to a peace-time economy. Thanks to the policy of the Chifley Labour Government, and thanks also to the fact that more jobs were available than there were men to fill them, high prices were paid for primary products. The dairying industry is conducted in association with cotton-growing, and the price of dairy products, before inflationary conditions make the dairy-farmer more interested in cotton-growing activities. It is true, as has been stated by the honourable member for Capricornia, that the Chifley Government requested the Tariff Board in 1949 to inquire into and report upon the cotton-growing industry. The Tariff Board reported that assistance to the industry was justified, but recommended the continuation of the then customs tariffs, because it was considered that the industry was not economic and was not establisbed on an efficient basis. A government, when it refers to the Tariff Board a proposal for the payment of a bounty, must pay some recognition to the report and recommendations of that",62,Harrison

223,Mr Eioedan,"Members of thebody. Of what use would it be for a governmeut to refer a matter to the Tariff Board for investigation and a report if it ignored that report ? The board, as I have said, recommended a continuation of the then tariff, and an alleviation of the burden of debt of £66,000 on the industry. That money had been advanced by the Commonwealth Bank to enable the establishment of ginneries and oil extraction plant. The Chifley Government alleviated that burden. Therefore the statement of the honourable member for Capricornia to the effect that the Chifley Government had crucified the cotton-growing industry was just too silly for words. The Tariff Board also made reference to the fact that cotton should not be grown on small areas of from 6 to 15 acres, and recommended cotton cultivation on areas of 100 acres or more, and the adoption of mechanization methods, particularly for the harvesting of the cotton seed boll. Action was taken by the Queensland Government to assist this industry. Mechanical cotton pickers, which have been operating in Queensland for some years, were purchased. The Tariff Board also made reference to the fact that if this industry was to be expanded due regard should be given to the application of irrigation to it. Government supporters have nothing to say in response to that statement, because they consider that the Burdekin scheme is uneconomical. Unless my memory is playing me false, one honourable member opposite referred to the Burdekin area as an area that could be used for the growing of sugar and tobacco. We know how essential cotton is to us, not only in peace-time, but also in war-time. Our annual peace-time requirements are 80,000 bales, yet the honourable member for Capricornia apparently thinks that because tbe industry is now producing 7,000 bales a year it is on a satisfactory basis. Seven thousand bales produced to meet a requirement of 80,000 bales! I read recently a statement made by one pared with 500 bales in 1949, would authority in 1951 to the effect that by be laughable, if it were not so 1958 our requirements should be in the tragic. The Government is supposed vicinity of 300,000 bales. Tbat statement to be concerned about the conserwas made at the time when the original vation of dollars and the expansion of legislation was before this Whether that assessment will prove to be read in the press that a dreadful position Mr Riordan. true, only time will tell, but it is certainly ludicrous to talk at this time of the industry being on a satisfactory basis with a production of only 7,000 bales a year. It is true that in 1949, for the reasons I have indicated, which included high prices for other primary products and inability to obtain sufficient manpower, the cotton-growing industry was languishing. Ignoring those reasons, the honourable member for Capricornia has compared the 500 or so bales produced in 1949 with the 7,000 bales now produced, nnd acclaims the increased production as a sign of great progress. As I have already said, whereas the Chifley Government lifted a burden of £66,000 from this industry, this Government talks about, giving the industry £42,000-£25,00 0 in respect of last year's production and £17,000 in respect of the 1953 production. Since cotton is so essential to us. both in peace and war, and since our present requirements of 80,000 bales a year may grow to 300,000 bales a year, a subsidy of £25,000 is a mere drop in the ocean. The Government is earmarking £200,000,000 a year for defence expenditure. When the cotton-growing industry was last discussed in this chamber the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) asked why the Government did not take action to expand the industry in its own territories, or in territories under its control, which lie in our vital, but empty, north. Why does not the Government expand the cotton growing industry in, for instance, the Kimberleys region or the Ord River region? Why does it not use for cotton growing, as the Tariff Board suggested in 1949, the tropical areas under its control, which are suitable for the growing of cotton? For any honourable member to rise in this chamber and take pride in the fact that the Government is guaranteeing growers a price of 14d. per lb. for the next three years and to flaunt as progress the present production of 7,000 bales, comHouse. our overseas balances. Only to-day we faces this country in the next few months in respect of its overseas balances. Yet, when the Government could encourage the production of a primary product that is so urgently needed, and which could conserve dollars and assist us to prevent a further drain on our overseas balances, it proposes a guarantee price of only 14d. per lb. in the way of encouragement to cotton-growers. It is true, as I said at the outset, that we, as an Opposition, support the measure, but we also criticize it for not going far enough. We believe that the Government's experiences since rhe original legislation was passed, coupled with the deteriorating international position to our immediate north, should have led it to do something more than it proposes to do under this measure to develop this industry. Those considerations should also have led it to take part of this continent. some action towards developing, as cotton growing areas, the territories over which it has immediate control. It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization is on the job in the Northern Territory and has a research station and experimental plant there. Those have certainly been established, but what action has the Government taken to ensure the f u l l ' use of the results of the investigations that have been made in the Northern Territory into the establishment of the cotton-growing industry? The Queensland Agricultural Stock Department and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization have both done work in connection with the growing of cotton under irrigation in the Burdekin area. Queensland has knowledge and experience of the growing of cotton which it gained since the early days of this industry in Australia and cotton can be grown in what is known as the Texas district of Queensland, near the New .South Wales border. Irrigation in that area could be used not only fbr the growing of cotton, but also for the growing of tobacco, two primary commodities which are in short supply in Australia. Tf the honourable member for Capricornia wanted to throw politics into this matter, had to say when he introduced it. he should have made quite sure of his facts b?for°. he did so. He should have gone back beyond the days of the Chifley Government to discover why this industry was languishing long before the beginning of the last war. He should have made some attempt to discover why it declined after 1934, when there was not a Labour government in office in federal sphere. vernment in Queensland. Pederal Labour government from 1934 until just prior to Japan's entry into World War II . I am anxious to see this industry established, because I am conscious of its great importance to Australia. I am also conscious of the faci that the areas in which the industry could be established profitably are thc areas in which population is badly needed. Those areas are in the northern is interesting to have placed on record the opinions of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan) in justification of the actions of the TarifT Board in respect of the cotton industry. I should have thought that, as an honourable member representing a Queensland electorate, with experience behind him of the Tariff Board's actions towards such industries as the sugar industry, the tobacco industry and the cotton industry, he would not have made any attempt to justify the board's findings. I compliment the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) on his second-reading speech on the measure, in which he set out clearly what the Government was doing. He stated that the bill would amend the Cotton Bounty Act 1950-1951 by extending to 1958 the term of the Governmem guarantee to growers of seed cotton, thu? giving some security to growers during that period. The Government proposes that the guaranteed price for 1955-56 will be 14d. per lb. for seed cotton. Despite what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) has suggested, he knows perfectly well what the bill provides, and what the Minister The original act does say that the average price must not fall below 9^d. per lb.",63,Harrison
224,Mr Pearce,There was a Labour go,65,Harrison
225,Mr Eioedan,There was nu,65,Harrison
226,Mr Brand (Wide Bay) [9.38],"l iand the Minister said that it would not fall below that figure, but the act provides that the rate of guarantee may be varied by regulation at any time. It has been extended by regulation to 14d. per lb. for tbe last three years and until 1956, as bas been stated by the Vice President of tbe Executive Council. The Government bas aided the cotton-growers of Australia, and the election pledges made by the Government will be fulfilled. The growers will have an adequate guaranteed price for their cotton. The price of 14d. per lb. is considered reasonis a very good effort by Queensland able by cotton-growers, and gi'eater production can be expected. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) has taken a keen interest in the cotton industry, and he has related to us the history of government action in regard to the cotton industry over the years. This Government is anxious to develop our primary industries, and Australia has the climate and the soils whicli will produce our ful l requirements of cotton. The honourable member for Eden Monaro has stated that Australia should produce the major portion, if not the whole, of its requirements of cotton. The Governinent recognizes that that should be so, ancl this bill is designed to orovide stability in the industry and to encourage growers to produce Australia's reciuirements. At present cotton is imported mainly from the United States of America, at a price which is determined in New York. Dollars must be found to pay for that cotton. Our annual requirements are about 80,000 bales of raw cotton. That means that Australia has to find dollars for about £7,000,000 worth of cotton to be used in the factories of this country. The production of our requirement of 80,000 bales would greatly assist the economy of Australia. Cotton-growers in Australia must produce this commodity in competition with countries which are using coloured labour. Australia is the only country that produces cotton with white labour only. The industry is, therefore, entitled to a measure of consideration by this Parliament. It is a tribute to primary producers that the cotton industry was preserved through the war years, and that the industry has retained in production Mr Brand. varieties of cotton, which have heen produced after experimentation at very high cost.' Since 1949 there has been a steady improvement in production, as is indicated By the figures which I shall cite. In 1949, 522 bales of raw cotton wereproduced in this country. We produced 805 bales in 1950, 1,124 bales in 1951, 1,510 bales in 1952, and 4,229 bales in 1953. In 1954 production dropped to 2,S19 bales. According to the Minister the estimated production this year is 7,500 bales. Thai cot ton-growers, considering the fact that cotton cannot stand up to monoculture. The honourable member for Kennedy has stated that in 1934 Australia produced approximately 17,000 bales of cotton. There is no question that the soils and climate in Queensland are capable of producing Australia's requirements, if the industry is stabilized. Every industry in this country has had its ups and downs. Foi instance, there was a time when one 1 could not buy rice in Australia, but now the rice industry is firmly established, and produces rice of an annual value of about £2,500,000. There bas been a record production of approximately 76,000 tons of rice this year, which is more than sufficient to supply the whole of Australia's requirements. That production has resulted from tlie encouragement given to the rice industry by this Government. The tobacco industry similarly has gained a firm foothold in this country, again because of the actions of this Government. The honourable member for Kennedy has stated that the Labour Government looked to the Tariff Board for reports on the cotton industry and the tobacco industry, but it did not give the tobacco industry the help that this Government realized should be given to it, We are producing in Australia to-day large quantities of tobacco for our own use. The quality of our tobacco is so high that it has commanded in the market the highest price paid for any tobacco in the world. That is because this Government has safeguarded the price structure of the tobacco industry. If honourable members study the history of any of our other primary industries, such as wool, wheat or sugar, they will find that all of them had to face initial difficulties, such as tbe cotton industry is facing to-day. The success of an industry is dependent upon its price structure. The price of cotton to-day is determined in New York. In tbe early 'thirties it was determined in Liverpool, but, as with many other industries, the price to-day is that which obtains in America. Why cannot Australia have its own raw cotton price, wheu it is producing cotton with white labour ? It is interesting, to hear the remarks of government for that great State, nevertheche honourable member for Kennedy, because the Opposition has not intimated chat it is prepared to assist Australian industry as this Government has done. [ am pleased to hear that the Opposition recognizes that cotton-growers are entitled to a reasonable price for their product. The present price of raw cotton landed in Australia is 42d. per lb. This price represents 14^1. per lb. for seed cotton. As the producer is guaranteed I4d. per lb. for seed cotton, this leaves only a i d . per industry receives the encouragement that lb., plus the amount paid by the Government for ginning, which, in the financial year 1953-54, amounted to £17,000, and which it is estimated will amount to 625,000 in thc financial year 1954-55. chat has been paid in five years. well thatthis Government has done a grand job for the cotton industry, which it has assisted to get on its feet. The honourable member for Melbourne and the Government of which he was a Minister refused to assist the industry. The levy of l£d. per lb. as a by-law item of customs duty has been lifted by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan), with a benefit for cotton manufacturers in Australia of £250,000 a year. If that duty were applied, the cotton-growing industry would be able to carry on without a bounty. Because it is not applied, the producers are entitled to look to the Government for a bounty that will meet their needs. Security is the key to success in the cotton industry, and cotton-growers are entitled to economic stability. This bill concerns two governments. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that, when this Government first made the guarantee of 9M. per lb., it obtained from the Queensland Government an assurance that that Government would undertake a comprehensive expansion programme directed at the development of a sound, balanced farming economy, embracing the use of cotton grassland rotation in the many districts where cotton can be grown efficiently. That programme is under way. A l though I acknowledge that a Labour government of Queensland is not the best less the Labour administration there has met the requirements of the Commonwealth. Cotton will not stand up to monoculture. Cotton grassland rotation is best suited to the production of cotton, and it is obvious, therefore, that considerable new areas of land must constantly be brought into use for the production of cotton if the industry is to be successful and if it is to be soundly established. I believe that, when the it will be given under the terms of this measure, cotton will be grown at a cost that will enable it to compete satisfactorily with imported cotton. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated also that the Australian Government had received from the Queensland Government an assurance that irrigation projects most appropriate to the sound development of the cotton industry would be undertaken. There is no doubt that the Queensland Government has been actively engaged in trying to bring some part of the industry under irrigation. The Queensland Government has declared also that it will undertake research in order to improve further the efficiency of the industry through plant breeding, .entomological control and mechanization. The State experimental station at Biloela, in Queensland, has been the scene of considerable development, particularly in the. breeding of cotton and in its entomological control. There is no doubt that the industry is subject to the depredations of pests. However, Queensland farmers have developed methods of controlling most pests in other primary industries, and they believe that they will ultimately achieve complete control over the pests that ravage cotton and tobacco crops. The assurances that have been given to this",65,Harrison

The honourable member for Petrie has said that the Queensland Government does little to assist in research and experiment work. The University of Queensland is doing more than is any other body in Australia for the advancement of research work on grasses and tropical plants. Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization is doing most of that work. association with the Western Australian Government near Ivanhoe Station on the Ord River in the Kimberleys area of Western Australia. The men who are doing most of the work i o r the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, especially in Queensland, are mainly graduates of the Gatton Agricultural Sigh School and College and of the University of Queensland. If these renegade Queenslanders continually attack their State Government I shall continue to defend the Gair Government, a very good government and the latest of the series of Queensland Labour governments that has been in power for 31 years out of the last 34. What does this bill do ? It guarantees a minimum price of 9£d. per lb. for seed cotton, the guaranteed price in 1950-51. The cotton-growers are getting 14d. per lb. for seed cotton to-day. Why does not the Government write a guarantee of I4d. per lb. into the bill ? All that it is killed the tobacco industry which the writing into the bill is a guarantee of 9£d. per lb., the guarantee for the last three years.

Labour was in office. would be worth 25d. per lb. now, having regard to the way in which this Government has depreciated the currency and devalued the £1. We are importing 80,000 bales of cotton a year. That has been admitted. I think that all we grew last year was about 3,800 bales, and the Government is hoping for 7,000 bales this year. Before the war, in 1934. Commonwealth 17,000 bales of cotton were produced annually in Australia. Why cannot the Government say, "" We want 17,000 bales of cotton to be grown in this country next year "" ? As the honourable member for Wide Bay has said, increased cotton production here saves dollars. A production of 3,800 bales last year and an expected production of 7,000 bales this year, when we are importing 80,000 bales a year, is a very poor effort for any government. The government that provides the money has the final responsibility in the matter.

""We are all agreed on this matter. Now let us pass the legislation"". not resist the temptation to follow the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr he has rushed to the defence of the Calwell) in this debate. He has suggested that there is some reason why we on this side of the House should not make this debate political. I believe there is every reason why we should make it political. If we look at the history of the able member for Melbourne. There was Labour party in relation to this matter, we find that it has done nothing for the cotton-growers, with the exception that, as has been mentioned by several members of the Opposition, it paid a debt of £67,000 owing by the industry. But I believe that that money was provided only to bury the industry, and even then it was not enough to give it a decent burial. What did the Queensland members of the Labour party in this House say when a Labour government referred the problems of the industry to the TarifT Board? The honorahle member for Melbourne has said to-nieht that this Government should exercise its judgment and increase the guaranteed price for cotton, but the best that the Queensland. Any honourable member who Labour party could do in the exercise of its judgment when it was in power in 1949 was to refer the problem to an outside body for a reporta report which would have killed the industry. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne has never seen cotton growing. He does not know what a cotton boll is like. He does not know what a mechanical cotton harvester looks like. He knows nothing about the cotton industry, yet he has had the temerity to blame this Government for not giving to the industry assistance additional to that which it has given. The Government of which he was a. member paid out £67,000 to bury the industry. This Government, in the short period of five years, has increased the 1949 production of cotton by no less than fourteen times. That is a record of which it can well be proud. To-night we have seen an example of the interest that the Labour party has taken in the problems of the cotton industry over the years. Except on rare occasions, no more than six members of the Labour party have been present in the chamber while this matter has been under discussion. The honourable member for Melbourne has referred to what the Queensland Government has done for the industry. As Queensland Government, I am prepared to rush to the attack, hecause it so happens that I know a little more about the efforts of that Government in relation to this industry than does the honora time when the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock was prepared to give scientific assistance to the industry, but to-day that department is giving practically no such assistance. The two research officers in the department who have a special knowledge of the industry and of cotton pests have been taken off that work, almost entirely. To-day, the Queensland Government is making practically no contribution to a solution of the scientific problems of the industry. Let us go a little further. Surely it is a responsibility of the Queensland Government to provide irrigation works in knows anything about cotton production knows that three times as much cotton can be grown on irrigated land as can be grown by dry farming methods.

I do not want to cover ground which has been covered over and over agaiu to-night. It is temerity on the part of the honourable member for Melbourne to come in at the closing stages of the debate, pick up two or three little threads, and try to hammer the Government with them. The record of this Government is far better than that of any Federal or .State Labour government in relation to consideration of the cotton industry in Queensland. In my opinion, there is only one thing wrong with this hill, and that is that the three-year term of the guarantee has not been extended. What we want in Queensland is sufficient encouragement to those who produce cotton to undertake the purchase of the necessary plant. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr examined this bill, is satisfied that it serves Pearce) referred to cotton-growers in Queensland who hacl purchased their own mechanical harvesters and tractors at a cost of approximately £10,000 each. We should encourage that type of thing. The Government should give serious consideration to extending the term of the guarantee beyond this three-year period. It may be that the guaranteed price will not be sufficient. In this respect, I disagree with the honourable member for Melbourne, tt may be necessary to increase the guaranteed price, and that can be done more readily by regulation than by amendment of the act. Some consideration should be given to a long-term proposition, because it is the long term which will determine whether we have a cotton industry in Queensland which will go somewhere near meeting the requirements of its secondary industry, cotton-weaving, in Australia.

That function, as stated in the bill, is the forecasting of weather and the state of the atmosphere, and particularly, the issuing of warnings of gales, storms and other weather conditions likely to endanger life or property, including weather conditions likely to give rise to doods or bushfires. It will not be necessary to remind honourable members of the very great risks which are run, particularly on the eastern coast of Australia, of hazards such as cyclones and floods. Events of the last year or two have shown how important it is to develop a very extensive and efficient system, so that the utmost warning can be given to all people, particularly those in country areas, of the approach of any of these visitations. Having lived on the Queensland coast, from Cairns south, ever since my boyhood, I have very vivid memories of the conditions which prevailed years ago. Then, the first warning of a cyclone would be when the wind actually started to howl. The result would be that a district would be suddenly hit, and the damage would be very great. We have travelled a long way from those days, due to the work of the Meteorological Branch. We now receive what can be described, fairly is of considerable value. In the recent cyclones on the Queensland and New South Wales coasts, for instance, there were two or three days' warning of the visitation. That was the result of extensive meteorological services and greater provision for the giving of information by radio stations. That fact is appreciated greatly by the people who suffer these devastations. Stations are proposed for Townsville and Gladstone, but as they will have a range of only about 150 miles a gap will be left in the central Queensland coast so far as the warning system is conoerned. The area from Bowen or Proserpine to just north of Bockhampton is prone to cyclones. In the last two or three years especially it has suffered heavily. Although last year we got fairly adequate warnings it is possible for a if r . Davidson. cyclone coming down the coast to switch suddenly inland and strike without warning. If stations were set up at Mackay and Cairns there would be a network of stations down the coast, each with a radius of 150 miles, and the warning system would be complete. That would be of great advantage to the people on the eastern seaboard of Australia. As honourable members know, these cyclones develop in the north and come down as far as northern New South Wales. The Minister realizes that there is still much to be done. One appreciates what has already been accomplished but must stress the need for the extension of the warning system. I have pleasure in supporting the bill. very glad that the bill has been introduced and I agree with the honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson) that it will be of advantage to the Commonwealth generally, and to Queensland in particular. Queensland is subject to extreme weather changes and frequently experiences cyclones, which wander about in such a fashion that their movement is difiicult to plot. Earlier in the year great damage was suffered in this area. The bill is certainly wide in scope. It proposes that complete investigations into all matters concerning the weather shall be made, and that tie results shall be I think, as supplied to the public. If it improves the accurate information, which system of weather forecasting for Brisbane it will have served its purpose. I do not wish to ascribe to any individual or organization any blame for the weather forecasts for the metropolitan area of Brisbane. Usually they are no more reliable than is the average racing tipster, and one can take little notice of them. Some time ago a prominent officer of the Brisbane City Council Electricity Supply said, with a smile, that his organization was supplied with the forecast that was not, of course, that which the ordinary public received. I do not know what to make of that statement, but I hope that the work of the Meteorological Branch will result in the feeling'that one can depend upon the weather forecast. I am happy to support the bill and hope that it will be to the advantage of the public generally.",71,Hughes
250,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [10.23],"I am-In Australia, weather forecasting poses a difficult problem. In the older countries of Europe, the North Atlantic and America, there are many more weather forecasting stations and better methods of gathering information than we have in Australia. permanently anchored in the North Atlantic, wireless information to the shore. Also, the weather people of other countries have at their command the results of research over many years. This enables them to make more accurate forecasts than are possible in Australia, which bas been settled for little more than 150 years. There are great distances between our warning stations. Australia has on either side large expanses of ocean, from which it cannot gain information about upper air currents. Some work of this type has been carried on at Macquarie Island and Kerguelen Island, but BO far our weather men do not know enough about such reports to draw from them conclusions as to future weather. A great deal of patient research into such reports must be undertaken before accurate forecasts will be possible. We have in the weather forecasting service some very brilliant men, whose work is of immense value to shipping, to December, in many parts of Victoria, had been the Royal Australian Air Force and to burning separately, as tliey do in any summer, the civil airlines that operate in Australia either and along the air routes to America and reached the climax of their intensity and England.

Bega district of New South Wales, as It is a distressing sight to see houses and shops many feet deep in water, and furniture, floor coverings, bedding, haberdashery, groceries and boots and shoes being carried away. Any one who has seen the devastation that flood waters can cause to residences and businesses alike Weather ships, will agree that weather can be a dreadful thing, particularly if there has been inaccurate forecasting. I propose to read to the House a passage from the Stretton report on the bush fires in Victoria in 1939. The report statesSeventy-one lives were lost. Sixty-nine mills were burned. Millions of acres of fine forest, of almost incalculable value, were destroyed or badl3 damaged. Townships were obliter7 ated in a few minutes. Mills, houses, bridges, tramways, machinery were burned to the ground; men, cattle, horses, sheep were devoured by thc fires or asphyxiated by the scorching debilitated air. As most honourable members probably know, when a bush fire is raging, the heating of foliage produces an explosive mixture, and the air itself is heated to such a degree that people exposed to it are burned, although their skin has not been touched by the flames. I have seen this happen to many people as well as to hundreds of horses and many head of cattle. The Stretton report continuesGenerally, the numerous fires which during "" under control"", as it is falsely and dangerously called, or entirely untended, ( On that day it appeared that the whole State alight.

251,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [10.26].,"the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan After the fire had passed, there was complete devastation over an area of 50 square miles. Where fences and trees had been, there were only little heaps of grey ash. Where fences still stood, cattle and horses had been driven iuto the corners and burnt to death. This Parliament now has before it certain proposals to deal with the menace of atomic warfare. We have not yet experienced the atomic bomb, and perhaps that catastrophe will never befall us, but bush fires are with us now, and so are floods, and in the prevention or mitigation of these disasters the work of the weather forecasters is of the greatest importance. From my long observation of forecasting, I believe that our weather reports are not accurate enough. A forecast made in Sydney may be adequate within a radius of perhaps 10 or 20 miles of that city, but it is virtually impossible to forecast on information available in Sydney the weather that may he expected in areas perhaps 200 to 300 miles away. A serious aspect of the matter is that, order, relief services organized, and when a wrong forecast is made, weather forecasts generally are liable to fall into contempt. People lose their confidence in the forecasts and tend to ignore them. For instance, suppose a farmer receives a warning over the air that he must leave his home. He gets all his most valuable chattels together, musters his stock and moves out, perhaps at night. Next day, there is bright sunshine, and he is able to return home in safety. The next time he receives a warning he may uot bother about it. Inaccurate forecasting, therefore, can be a grave danger. However, inaccuracy is not the fault of the weather man. fie does the best he can with the information at his disposal, but he is not given enough information. Australia is a huge continent and there are areas of perhaps 1,000 square miles in which no weather observations are made and from which, therefore, no reports are obtained. Then there is the huge area of the Indian Ocean.. Knowledge of the weather in that area is most important to accurate weather forecasting on the Australian continent. ifr. Jeff Bate. On the meagre information, available Eraser) will recall. to our meteorologists at present, it is dangerous to forecast floods or fires in any given area. The long-range solution to the problem, I believe, lies in training meteorologists for work in decentralized areas such as the Bega district, the Macleay district, the Richmond River district, and out west in New South Wales. In. all those areas there should be men at work collecting weather information, watching the overall weather plans, studying weather maps and trying to compile an accurate picture of the weather probabilities. However, it will be a long time before we reach the stage when we can have regional forecasts. Nevertheless, I believe that there afe now men available in most districts who could be formed into committees or who, by themselves, could assume the task of making weather forecasts, particularly in times of great emergency. For instance, if in January there is a heavy growth of vegetation, low humidity, and high temperatures and winds, there is an acute danger of bush fires, and it should be tht responsibility of somebody in each district to see that fire fighting equipment is in preparations made to evacuate certain localities if necessary. Some one must have the authority to give a warning, and I believe that there are men available who could be entrusted with this responsibility. They are ready and willing to undertake this work. Surely, if it is necessary to have a civil defence committee to organize defence against atomic bombs, it is equally essential that there should be a widespread organization assisting in the vital work of weather forecasting. It is necessary that forecasts should be worded cautiously. I believe it is wrong for a forecaster to say that there will be light showers, high winds, or something of that sort. The people should be told that, from the meagre information available, there is a possibility of such and such a kind of weather. Dogmatic forecasts can only bring weather forecasters into disrepute. You, Mr Speaker, as a farmer from South Australia, will appreciate the necessity for long-range weather forecasting. Many of us have been greatly interested in the long-range forecasting of the late Inigo Jones. Those who are farmers have found on many occasions that his accurate forecasting of the weather has enabled them to sow and harvest crops, and carry out other farming activities at the right time. 1. suggest that the Minister should conaider that it is of importance to investigate weather forecasting in this country, and to ascertain whether it is possible to decentralize our forecasting services. 1 suggest that he should work out regions of not more than about 100 miles in diameter, for which the weather could be forecast with regard to flood dangers and other hazards of nature. It isinteresting to note that the Royal Australian STavy has a separate system of weather forecasting wherever there is a unit the size of an aircraft carrier stationed. A ship like an aircraft carrier cannot operate on weather information received from Sydney or Melbourne, because it might be 500 miles away from those cities. An aircraft carrier needs accurate meteorological information ahout the weather in its immediate vicinity, or the weather which it is likely to encounter within a short time, in order that it may operate its aircraft in safety. I understand that the Royal Australian Air Force is also greatly dependent on weather forecasting, and that during the last war members of that force were given a very short course of training in weather forecasts. That training enabled them to forecast weather with such accuracy that the pilots developed a great deal of confidence in their ability. If such a system were possible during war-time, surely during peace-time men can be trained to forecast the weather in country districts. I appeal to the Government to take this matter seriously, and to ensure that sufficient money is allocated to train the right type of men to do this work accurately: Indeed, I suggest that the Government should also investigate the desirability of instituting a long range forecasting service. Such an action would take us out of the primitive state that we are now in with regard to meteorological activities. L understand that Australia has now joined' a world meteorological association. After that organization has carried out all the research that it intends to carry out, and has obtained all the data that it requires, I have no doubt that it will be of great benefit to us. However, we must remember that the object of meteorological organizations is to make accurate forecasts of the weather. They should not become bogged down with all sorts of bureaucratic influences and controls. We require accurate forecasting in this country, and the Minister should realize that we all are intensely interested in the weather and that accurate forecasting will be of great benefit to the whole of the country. weather forecasting has not been as accurate or as up to date in the past as it should have heen, because our meteorological services have been run on cheapjack lines. Most of the information that goes into our central meteorological organizations goes through the Postal Department. When I was an officer of that department I noticed that the governments of the day tried to run that data-gathering service as cheaply as possible. The men who were appointed to gather the meteorological information and make certain observations, were always grossly underpaid. Therefore, I suggest that if the proper encouragement were given to the officers of the Postal Department who carry out the important functions of gathering the meteorological observations, we should benefit by much more accurate forecasting. For the information of the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), perhaps I could point out that about 80 per cent, of our weather forecasts are accurate at present, and that if proper and adequate remuneration were given to those responsible for gathering the information, perhaps 100 per cent, of the forecasts would turn out to be accurate. treated weather forecasting as an unimportant sideline of other jobs. were called upon to read the heights of rivers and obtain other information were expected to do it for practically nothing.

In the past the Postal Department has had to bear the cost of the meteorological telegrams that have to be sent from all parts of the Commonwealth.

I refer to the making public of the details of the redistribution scheme which was recently completed in the various States before those details ought to have been mad;public. I refer specifically to the position in Victoria. I am unaware of what happens in New South Wales or in Sydney. That is completely beyond me. the honourable member to understand what is happening in Richmond. Richmond is well within my understanding. The first redistribution of electoral boundaries was completed in New South Wales and for some reason the Commonwealth Electoral Oflicer in New South Wales made information available before the statutory date for its publication. I am not arguing whether he should or should not have done so, but as a result of the controversy that followed his action definite and specific instructions were issued in Victoria by the commissioners responsible for the drawing up of the map showing the boundaries of the new electorate that no details whatever were to be given to anybody. The (c) arrange for local forecasts in all matter was confidential and the comreport under the statute on a confidential basis. The Government Printer of Victoria, who was to print the maps, wa* instructed not to make any information available to any person until the commissioners themselves decided to publish it. I am not arguing whether it was good or bad for the matter to be kept confidential or whether that ought or ought not to have been done. The simple position is that highly paid public servants who had taken an oath to preserve confidence in relation to matters that come to their notice by virtue of their positions were expected to take notice of their direction to keep these matters confidential, but that instruction was not observed by them. Every member from Victoria well knows that the Premier of that State was able to tell a favoured few, prior to the date of the official announcement of the new boundaries, just where they were likely to be-no t merely in a general way but specifically, street by street and boundary by boundary.

I am not too sure that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) were correct in stating that the commissioners gave the information before the day on which the maps were published, but I shall have that matter checked. There certainly was a leakage of information in Victoria, because many of the redistribution proposals were published in one of the daily newspapersI speak subject to correction-o n the 24th February, which was one month ahead of the 24th March, the day on which tha announcement was made ih the Gazette, and the maps were displayed at the recognized post offices. Immediately the Chief Electoral Officer discovered that a leakage had occurred and that the information had been published in one of the newspapers, he asked the Victorian redistribution commissioners to make investigations. He also asked them what steps they had taken to ensure that none of the information would leak out before it was published by them. As a result of that request, the chairman of the commission informed the Chief Electoral Officer that the maps had been prepared in the Victorian Lands Department, that the Victorian Surveyor General was one of the commissioners, and that he and the Surveyor-GeneralI do now, if the right had impressed upon all of the members of the staff of the Lands Department who were handling the maps that the information was confidential, and that it was not to be disclosed.

The position in Queensland in respect nf building applications is that the waiting period before processing commences is thirteen and a half months compared with the fifteen months average throughout Australia. The waiting period in respect nf existing properties is the same in a l l States, and as the rate of receipt of applications for this class of assistance in Queensland is higher in proportion than the rate of receipt of applications in other States Queensland receives the benefit. A separate record of the £2,000,000 has not been kept, but the total estimated expenditure on existing properties for Australia during 1954-55 is £14,200,000 of which the expenditure ;in Queensland w ill be £2,241,000. 4.

It is not possible to isolate any one particular 'reason that would account for the increased number of applications being received each year.' The following however, would be among the influencing f a c to r s : ( i j The increased maximum loan provided by the Governnient in the amendments to the act in 1951 and 1954; and ( i i ) thc general improvement 'in the economic position which would .be reflected Sn the applicants's ability to undertake the. obligation of home ownership; ( i i i ) the attractive conditions of the loan-lo w interest and a long term of repayment-and the general -satisfaction Among ex-servicemen w it h the treatment they receive from the Division. 5. The.existing staff is spending all the money made available. The waiting period is not caused by the stall' or administration but is due solely to the fact that it is not possible in the present economic conditions to make unlimited funds available for the provision of war service homes without unreasonably delaying other essential requirements.

The promotion of physical fitness is « responsibility of the State governments. The Commonwealth's interest in this field is to act as an agency for co-ordinating the work being done by the various State authorities. For this purpose and also to assist the State* to further this valuable work, the Commonwealth provides an annual grant. The original grant was £20,000 in 1939 and at presenl is £72,500 per annum. 2.
