Why not do mentary secretary on this occasion that there is almost a culture of fear within the TGA it with seven? Why not do it with five? Why not do it with three?

I want him to help secure 40 new jobs in Rockhampton. You would have to say that this government owes one to us in Rockhampton. I say that because the federal government last year did nothing to assist attempts to keep open the Lakes Creek Meatworks, one of our city’s largest industries, nor have we heard anything from the federal government about the crisis currently threatening the Australian Magnesium project in Rockhampton. The loss of the Lakes Creek plant cost our community over 1,000 jobs and the situation with AMC could cost another 450 full-time jobs. What have we heard from the federal government on this so far? Nothing. There has been silence on both these matters. There has been no help and there have been no words of encouragement; there has been just silence as 1,500 full-time jobs disappear from our community. Now there is a chance for the Howard government and Mr Truss as the minister responsible for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to do something to help a small business develop and survive in this very difficult business environment and to create much needed jobs in our city. A company called Naturally Australian Foods intends to reopen a small meat processing plant in Rockhampton. It intends to employ 40 people. This means 40 new jobs for Rockhampton. AQIS, however, will not allow this to happen unless the company agrees to pay the debts outstanding to AQIS from the three previous owners of the plant. AQIS is asking Naturally Australian Foods to pay over $250,000 for inspection fees and charges provided to previous owners of the plant. This amount includes the debts of Fitzroy River Meats, Royal International and Shannonville. All of these companies were allowed to run up a substantial debt with AQIS. None of them was in a position to pay these debts, and the government effectively allowed these companies to continue to trade while insolvent. Mr Truss and his department must take responsibility for this debt and must accept that it was simply bad management which allowed this situation to get so out of hand. We have a new company which is trying to establish itself being asked to pay for Mr Truss’s bad management. AQIS expects Naturally Australian Foods to pay the outstanding $250,000. Should the new company refuse to pay the outstanding debt, it will not be allowed to open and another 40 jobs would be lost for Central Queenslanders. It was the intention of Naturally Australian Foods to commence operations on 26 May; Mr Truss can for once do something for the jobless people of Central Queensland and help ensure the survival of this fledgling company. I appeal to Mr Truss to waive the charge of $255,271.51 to Naturally Australian Foods and ask him to pursue the previous owners of the plant and the directors of those companies whose debt this is. This government owes one to Rockhampton. We cannot see another 40 jobs in our city go when we have lost 1,500 jobs in the last year.

229,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.41 A.m.,"Health: Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.44 a.m.)-I am pleased and delighted to put on the record my thanks to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, for her announcement last Friday regarding the approval for more doctors under the federal government’s More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas scheme. This scheme is part of the federal government’s election commitment of $80 million over four years to improve access to medical services in outer metropolitan areas. It has been designed to improve patient access to doctors, particularly in outer metropolitan areas of high need. Friday’s announcement and approval of an additional and much needed 57 doctors, specialists and registrars to practise in areas of high need across Australia is very welcome. In the middle of my electorate of Petrie is one of the fastest growing regions in Brisbane’s north side. The suburbs of Mango Hill and Griffin have boomed in the last five to 10 years and have become a very popular residential location for young families and retirees. Indeed, they are part of a residential corridor that stretches from Brisbane’s northernmost suburbs and extends to Caboolture. It has been named the third fastest growing residential location in Australia. In 1999 the North Lakes development was established at Mango Hill and by the end of 2002 the population was close to 2,100, with growth expectations of 1,500 per annum. In FebruaryI wrote to the minister and asked that Griffin-Mango Hill be included as an area of work force shortage, given its rapidly growing population. In my letter I stated: ... an outer metropolitan area is defined as that part of a State capital city Statistical Division (using the 2001 Australian Standard Geographical Classification definition) which lies outside the 1991 urban centre area. Further research undertaken by my office through the Parliamentary Library found that in 1991 the census collection district, CCD, of Mango Hill and Griffin, 3180405, did not even exist and therefore was not part of the 1991 urban centre area of Brisbane. On this basis, given the growing population of the region and given the fact that the nationally recognised benchmark for the supply of doctors for outer metropolitan areas as calculated by the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee is one full-time equivalent doctor per population of 1,404, I argued for the inclusion of Griffin-Mango Hill CCD. I am absolutely delighted that the minister has given me the good news that it will be considered. This is an absolute win for those people who live in the Griffin-Mango Hill area-that is, some 1,600 households-and it demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to meeting the needs of Australians, particularly those who live in outer metropolitan areas. I welcome and am extremely delighted with the news, and I am sure that all of those who live in the area will be delighted as well. Telstra: Services Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.47 a.m.)-I rise this morning to inform this House and the nation that yesterday the suburb of Toukley in my electorate had no phone service whatsoever from 8.40 a.m. until 5 p.m. Phones have been reconnected today, but unfortunately the whole area was without working phones yesterday. This is a very spread-out area with an elderly population, and it is an area where people rely on telephones. We have businesses like Steve Kennedy Smash Repairs with no phones. The government talk about what they can do for small business but they cannot even ensure that small businesses will have working phones. They talk about what they can do for families, they talk about what they can do for older people and they talk about health care, but they cannot even ensure that people will have working teleMAIN COMMITTEE phones. There were no phones working yesterday at Wyong High School, and that is in the electorate of the member for Dobell. I would have thought that the member for Dobell would have known about this and been prepared to come into the House today and put on the record that he thought this was not good enough and that he knew just how far the ‘no phone zone’ went into his electorate. But, as usual, the member for Dobell is absent whenever anyone brings up an issue of real importance to his electorate. This is a very real issue for a number of Australians. The government have allowed the Telstra network to become run down. We have had enormous staff cuts throughout the Telstra network, and we have found that sometimes we have had to wait for workers to come from Brisbane to fix problems. I feel that the government need to act now. It is a time when we are looking at budget issues. One of the issues that they failed to address was the disgusting state of the Telstra network and its failure to support people when they are in real need. I implore the government to act now to set in place the proper procedures so that people in areas like Toukley do not have to wait a long period of time before they can be reconnected to their vital phone services. It is not good enough, and I expect the member for Dobell to support me on this issue. Environment: Water Treatment opments in relation to the long-term solution for the environmental disgrace, the Gunnamatta ocean outfall. Firstly, I wish to refer particularly to a development in last night’s budget. As part of the higher education reforms the education minister, Dr Brendan Nelson, announced four international centres of excellence which will be established in Australia. One of those centres involves the creation of a water resource management centre of excellence within Australia. Five million dollars will be provided over the coming years to fund and operate the centre. It will be competitively tendered for, but what is important is that it provides the opportunity for the first time for high-level academic research into issues such as localised water resource management and national water resource management. I will be working with Dr Nelson to make sure that there is a specific research project for urban water recycling, particularly for the Gunnamatta outfall, which receives up to 420 million litres of secondary stage sewage every day and deposits it less than 100 metres offshore from one of Australia’s great ocean beaches. The second development I want to mention in relation to the long-term solution to the Gunnamatta outfall is the creation of a national ocean outfall policy. I have previously raised this in the House, and we are making considerable progress. I have received correspondence from the Prime Minister in recent weeks in which he says he wishes to progress with, and to work on, a national ocean outfall policy and to do this within the context of a national water policy. We will be meeting to work on specific plans to do this. There is a third area where there has been a significant amount of progress in relation to the future of Gunnamatta. I will be working with the Clean Ocean Foundation to establish a regional committee to plan a technical solution, in the absence of Melbourne Water committing to do so. We will be working with a range of community groups, the Clean Ocean Foundation, local engineers and people throughout Victoria on a practical solution aimed at providing alternatives to the dumping of ocean outfall on one of the great ocean beaches of Australia. In particular, we will be working with Mr John Lawson, who produced a wonderful report recently. Ultimately, we will take MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Disability Services would like to pay compliments to an enterprise which supports families with children and adults with disabilities. I refer to Devonfield Enterprises which, although its headquarters is located in Devonport itself, its services, personnel and clients range from the north-west coast to the west coast. The aim of Devonfield Enterprises is to provide opportunities for community integration for people with disabilities and to maximise their independence. It achieves this aim by providing services such as day support services, occupational training and support, supported employment, supported accommodation and respite care. At the heart of providing these services is the commitment to give the greatest opportunity to maximise the life of, and opportunities for, disabled adults and children. It is under the management and care of its executive director, the indomitable, energetic Steve Daley. I refer to some of their services, such as the North West Support Services, which attempt to integrate disabled clients into their local community through the choice of a whole range of programs and activities ranging from communication, personal hygiene and road safety right through to cooking, first aid, community participation and volunteering. They also have a very strong occupational training and support service, which is there to develop the skills of, and training support for, each individual client of the program. The training ranges from literacy and numeracy, personal development, social skills awareness and sexuality awareness right through to telephone skills, horse riding, swimming and aerobics. There is a very active supported employment environment through Devon Industries Tasmania, a furniture manufacturing, welding, pallet and bin manufacturing industry; Tasmanian Rural Marketing Services; North West Forestry Services; and Devon Gardening Services. On top of that, they have developed a great expertise in offering canteen and catering services through Healthy Cuisine, the catering services at the Australian Paper mill at Wesley Vale and Simplot’s Quoiba plant. They also offer very supportive accommodation services for youth services, senior residential services, respite care, the community living program and tenancy support. The greatest thing about Devonfield Enterprises is not only that they support families but that they have created a family themselves. I thank all those involved in providing this wonderful service. Budget 2003-04 Maitland Mercury stating, ‘$25m for Thornton overpass’. Many times in this chamber and in the main chamber of the HouseI have raised the issue of Weakleys Drive interchange. Last night, funding of $25 million over three years was in the budget. I put on record my appreciation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, who gave a commitment during the last federal election that this road would be funded. Last night, the money was delivered-and delivered in full. These campaigns are not fought just in the political arena. The communities of Tarro, Beresfield, Thornton, Woodberry-indeed Maitland as a whole-have worked long and hard for this road infrastructure to be put into place.

232,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (9.56 A.m.),"It is a great day today, with the front page of theas a first stage in installing lights as part of traffic management at the New England Highway, Thornton Road and Weakleys Drive. Indeed, those lights were installed between October 1996 and November 1996. In a question on notice in April 2001, Minister John Anderson replied that the funding required to build the Weakleys Drive interchange would be $23.8 million. With a little bit of time and growth, that is now $25 million, with $1 million to be spent in the coming financial year, $1 million to be spent in the following year and $23 million to be spent on construction in the year 2005-06. There have been local campaigners who deserve credit. Hilton Grugeon, the major developer of the Thornton Industrial Estate, created over 1,000 jobs in that region. This interchange will mean that the trucks, businesses and people that go through there each day will be able to do it without the 20-minute delays that they experience on this road. Every truck that travels between Newcastle and Maitland-or, indeed, up the New England Highway-must pass through that intersection. Thousands upon thousands of vehicles go through that intersection each day. More worrying are the school buses that go through that intersection each day in the mornings and afternoons. The area has been known for fatalities and crashes. My children go through that intersection every day, and I fear for their safety. Within three years, we will see a result. I also commend the community, because a petition that was tabled in this House on 28 August 2001 on my behalf by Jim Lloyd petitioned this government to put forward the funding. At the same time, there was a petition to the state government to fund the link road between Beresfield and Thornton. That work is being achieved and should be completed later on this year. I congratulate my community and I congratulate the government. We really appreciate the efforts of John Anderson in making sure that this funding has been allocated. der 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Main Committee: Procedures government business, I would like to make a short statement. The House has readopted sessional order 84A for the remainder of this session. I remind members that the intention of this is to allow greater spontaneity in debate. As members will recall, the procedure allows a member to seek to ask a question concerning another member’s speech. If the member ‘gives way’, the other member is able to ask a short question relevant to the member’s speech. The clock is not stopped during interventions. The chair remains in control at all times, as for all proceedings. The chair will not allow the question to be posed if he or she is of the view that it is an abuse of the orders or the forms of the House. That would be clear if there were persistent and repetitive or mischievous interventions or if the intervention were too long. When a member has risen during another member’s speech, the chair has said, ‘Order! Is the member seeking to ask a question?’ If the other member confirms that he or she is, the chair needs to ascertain whether the member speaking will allow a question and asks, ‘Will you allow a question?’ If the member declines, there can be no dispute-that is the end of the matter. If the member allows the question, the chair will ensure that only a brief and immediately relevant question is put. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Statements By Members

I intend to circularise all members about the standing orders. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December 2002, on motion by Ms Worth: That this bill be now read a second time. Law) Bill 2002 amends some seven acts governing the Commonwealth’s military and civilian superannuation schemes to accommodate changes made to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to superannuation benefits. This new family law regime came into effect on 28 December 2002 following the passage of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill with Labor’s support in June 2001. The new regime is intended to provide a more equitable and flexible system for the division of property under the Family Law Act. This bill is one of four bills that, together with regulations, form a total package of some 400 pages of new law. The new family law regime ensures that superannuation interests form part of the property of married couples and provides for those interests to be split between the parties in a property settlement following a marriage breakdown. The new regime provides a method for the valuation of an accrued superannuation interest in a defined benefits scheme, such as the Commonwealth schemes, at the end of marital breakdown. That value can then be taken into account for the purposes of a property settlement and can be split between the parties. Parties to a property split may agree or the Family Court may order that the trustees of a superannuation scheme must allocate a base amount or the amount calculated by applying a percentage to the valuation to the ex or nonmember spouse of a scheme member. The new regime then provides a default option for the indexation of that amount if the benefit is not immediately payable and for this amount to be paid to the nonmember and deducted from the benefit payable to the member. Alternatively, the new regime allows superannuation scheme rules to be amended to provide for the creation of a separate interest for the nonmember and the subsequent reduction of the benefit becoming payable to the member. Three alternative approaches have been considered for applying the new family law regime to the Commonwealth schemes: the default option, a percentage only split and a separate interest approach. Given the variety of benefit outcomes possible in the public sector schemes, it is impossible to know for certain what the final benefit will be. It is therefore possible under the default option for the adjusted base amount payable to the nonmember spouse to be greater than the benefit payable to the member spouse, leaving the member spouse with nothing. A percentage split would eliminate the possibility of the nonmember spouse being left with nothing at the benefit stage, but it would reduce certainty for the nonmember spouse. This is because the value of the nonmember spouse’s benefit is dependent on the benefit actually paid to the member spouse, which can vary. In addition, both these approaches make the MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Business
235,Mr Cox (Kingston) (10.01 A.m.),"The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Familytiming of benefit payments to the nonmember spouse dependent on the access age of the member spouse and the benefit option selected. This bill opts for a separate interest approach whereby a separate interest is created for the nonmember at the time of the split, equal to the base amount determined by the agreement or order. A nonmember spouse’s benefits will be indexed in a similar way to a member’s benefits. Where the separate interest is created during the growth phase of the member’s benefit, the benefit to the nonmember will become payable when the nonmember satisfies a relevant condition of release, such as age retirement, death or permanent disability. Where the separate interest is created when the member is in receipt of a pension benefit, the nonmember benefit can become payable immediately. These provisions are to ensure that the retirement income objectives of superannuation are met. The immediate splitting of pension payments is appropriate because, had the couple remained married, they would have shared the pension payment. Certain classes of pensions, such as orphans’ pensions, will not be reduced should a split be made before the pension becomes payable. At the payment stage, a formula will be applied to reduce the benefits of the member spouse. Given the uncertain nature of benefits under the Commonwealth scheme, this could result in some separated couples receiving a combined benefit of more or less than they would have received had they not separated. Despite the potential for couples to receive a net financial gain or suffer a loss by separating, it is preferable to the alternative prospect of one spouse receiving little or no benefit at all. Furthermore, this approach, by allowing a clean break between the parties, reduces the dependence of the nonmember spouse on the payment of benefits to the member spouse. Labor will support this bill because the separate interest approach it applies is more likely than the alternative options to provide fairness, flexibility and certainty for all parties. Labor has adopted a bipartisan approach to the complex task of ensuring this new family law regime operates in a fair and efficient manner. I should, however, draw attention to the fact that we are debating this bill only after the commencement of the new regime on 28 December last year. In fact, despite the impending deadline of 28 December, the government did not introduce this bill until 12 December-the last full sitting day of the last parliamentary year. This delay in the necessary changes to the Commonwealth schemes is unacceptable. It leaves members currently engaged in property settlements in an uncertain position and may delay settlements or the implementation of payment splits. The government should clarify how this bill will apply to settlements completed before its commencement, particularly where this bill provides for a different valuation of benefits to the principal act. Law) Bill 2002 proposes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of Commonwealth civilian schemes and members of Australian Defence Force schemes. These superannuation arrangements are being amended as a consequence of changes to the Family Law Act 1975 and to regulations under that act in relation to the new arrangements for splitting superannuation on marriage breakdowns. Under these new arrangements, superannuation will be treated as the property of a marriage and will be able to be divided as part of a property settlement-something that is very interesting for the electorate of Gilmore, where we have a number of people who will be affected by this legislation amendment. This will also enable separating parties or the Family Court to MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Superannuation Legislation Amendment Family Law Bill 2002

I thank my good friend the member for Gilmore for making an erudite contribution, as she does in relation to so many bills. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2002 is one of those noncontroversial pieces of legislation that is privileged to enjoy the support of all parties in the House. This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of the Commonwealth civilian schemes and the Australian Defence Force schemes. The bill will provide a framework within the relevant scheme for dealing with a superannuation agreement or Family Court order in relation to the division of a member’s superannuation following a marriage breakdown. It will enable a separate superannuation benefit account to be created and arranged for a member’s former spouse in these circumstances. This will allow for a clean break of superannuation entitlements between the parties at the time of the marriage breakdown and will also provide both parties with control over their respective individual benefits.

The amendments clarify the language of the provisions to reflect their intended purpose without impacting on their operational effect. A further amendment to the Crimes Act will extend the class of indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily. Currently, offences that involve property valued at more than $500 must be dealt with as an indictable offence. The amendment increases this threshold to $5,000. In addition, offences that specify a pecuniary penalty only may in certain circumstances now be dealt with as summary offences. The amendments mean more offences may be dealt with in lower courts, thereby contributing to a more efficient criminal trial process. The bill also makes amendments to the forensic procedures provisions in the Crimes Act. Those amendments will enable the matching of the DNA profile of one unknown deceased person with the DNA profile of another unknown deceased person, clarify and expand the provisions enabling the minister to enter into arrangements with participating jurisdictions for sharing DNA information and clarify the role of CrimTrac. Such measures may assist in the identification of unknown deceased persons or the investigation of Commonwealth offences that occur in Australia. Amendments are also proposed for the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 to assist the expansion of the air security officer program to selected foreign destinations. They would enable air security officers travelling on flights to selected foreign destinations to deliver persons arrested on such a flight into the custody of a police force of the foreign country in which the flight ends. On1 January 2003 the National Crime Authority was replaced by the Australian Crime Commission. Amendments are proposed for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001 consequential upon the establishment of the ACC and the inclusion of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence in that body. The amendments ensure that, where appropriate, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Reserve Bank will be able to pass information relating to serious contraventions of the law to the ACC in the same way they were previously able to pass information to the NCA. These measures will assist in the transition from the NCA to the ACC. The amendments would also remedy a drafting error in the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002. The Crimes at Sea Act 2000 is amended to clarify that the laws that apply in the territorial sea adjacent to the Northern Territory are the laws of the Northern Territory rather than all laws that are in force in that Territory. The Australian Capital Territory is currently the only jurisdiction in Australia not represented on the Criminology Research Council. Amendments to the Criminology Research Act 1971 will remedy this situation by requiring that the council include a representative from the ACT. The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 is amended to remove a provision that requires foreign material to bear an official state seal. This requirement was originally included as a means of confirmation that the requested evidence was obtained through appropriate official channels. However, a number of countries have experienced difficulties in meeting this requirement, and it is not considered necessary that foreign evidence be sealed in order for the Attorney General to be satisfied that the material has been received through official channels. For exMAIN COMMITTEE ample, a covering letter from the relevant foreign central office for mutual assistance in criminal matters would suffice. This change should increase the efficiency of the criminal justice system. The bill provides for several technical amendments to be made to the mutual assistance in criminal matters provisions of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995. Those provisions reflect similar amendments which were made in 1986 to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. The amendments will ensure consistency between the regimes for assistance under the International War Crimes Tribunals Act and the provisions in the amended Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. The Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992 is also amended by the bill to remove restrictions on the Attorney-General’s delegation powers under that act. The amendments will allow the Attorney-General to delegate his powers to either the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department or to an APS employee. They also remove the requirement that the Attorney-General personally deal with a request which the delegate considers should be refused on national interest grounds. The current limitation on the delegation provision is unnecessary. Routine requests will be dealt with by the Attorney-General’s delegates, and more sensitive requests will be referred to the Attorney-General for personal consideration. Amendments are also proposed for the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to clarify that the Official Trustee has the power to sell restrained property where the Official Trustee is obliged to repay legal aid commission costs out of property of a suspect or other person covered by a restraining order. The Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 will also be amended to enable arrest warrants issued by parole boards and other similar bodies to be executed interstate. Currently, the act allows arrest warrants issued by a court in one state to be executed in another state but does not cover arrest warrants issued by parole boards and other similar bodies. The amendment will remedy this deficiency by allowing such bodies to be prescribed by regulations for this purpose. Enabling the warrants issued by these bodies to be executed interstate under the act will contribute to the effective administration of justice by recognising the problems that may be caused when a person absconds interstate while on parole. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. makes a number of minor and technical amendments to various Commonwealth criminal laws.

This includes allowing the use of video links and changing the conditions precedent to the use of force by police officers when making an arrest under the act. I will come to that later. I raised concerns about one of the original proposals at a briefing given by officers of the Attorney-General’s Department late last year. That proposal aimed to change subparagraph 66(2)(b)(i) of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act in order to ‘change the conditions precedent to the use of force in making an arrest under this provision from cumulative to alternative conditions in order to avoid unintentionally inhibiting the use of force where it is necessary to protect life or prevent serious injury’. The section of the act deals with the use of force in making arrests and sets out the boundaries around the amount of force that police forces can use in making a lawful arrest under the act. It says that police must not use force or subject a person to greater indignity than is necessary and reasonable to make the arrest. The subsection that the original bill sought to amend deals with situations where a police officer might cause the death of a person or cause them grievous bodily harm. It does not sanction such action but requires two things of police officers before they take such drastic action as shooting: (i) the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to protect life or to prevent serious injury to another person (including the police officer); and (ii) the person has, if practicable, been called on to surrender and the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person cannot be apprehended in any other manner. The proposed amendment was to replace the word ‘and’ with the word ‘or’-on the face of it, such a simple change, and such an ostensibly straightforward legislative amendment. But think about what that would mean in the real world: it would mean, quite literally, that a police officer would not be required to shout out to a person facing arrest under the powers in this act, ‘Stop, or I will shoot’; rather, the officer could simply shoot on the grounds that he or she believed it was the right thing to do in the circumstances. I am not suggesting that police officers shoot willy-nilly at people. We can be proud in Australia that our armed police forces have shown themselves to be vigilant about their use of firearms. When police do have to fire, for whatever reason, I know that it sends shock waves through the force, especially at a local level. It is not taken lightly. We also recognise that it is cold comfort to think that a call to surrender is all that lies between an individual and a police bullet. But my point is that such ostensibly simple amendments to legislation can amount to massive changes in how the law operates. The government and its advisers accepted my arguments against the change when I was given a briefing by the government’s officers. In response to my concerns, the government amended the bill in the Senate to remove the proposed amendment relating to the use of force when making an arrest. That is why it is so important for opposition parties to keep a very close eye on legislation and it is also why the government and its agencies, motivated in part to tidy up sloppy earlier drafting of legislation, need to always come up with solid, convincing arguments for the MAIN COMMITTEE changes they are seeking. I am very pleased that the government withdrew that proposed amendment and indeed facilitated an amendment in the Senate that led to the opposition of that proposed change. Let me deal with other provisions in the current bill. The government also intends to introduce a range of amendments that make further technical amendments to other Commonwealth criminal laws. They will: amend part 1D of the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the DNA profile of an unknown deceased person to be matched with another DNA profile of an unknown deceased person, and to clarify and expand the provisions enabling the minister to enter into arrangements with participating jurisdictions for sharing DNA information; make a minor technical amendment to the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Act 2002; amend the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 to assist the deployment of air security officers on Australian flights to and from selected international destinations; amend the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to allow information to be passed to the Australian Crime Commission in the same circumstances as it may have been passed to the National Crime Authority prior to its cessation on 31 December 2002 and to remove a reference to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, which has been incorporated into the ACC; amend the Corporations Act 2001 to allow information to be passed to the ACC in the same circumstances as it may have been passed to the NCA; amend the Criminology Research Act 1971 to make it a requirement that the Criminology Research Council include one member who is a representative of the ACT; make minor technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 to clarify that the Official Trustee has the power to sell restrained property so that, as originally intended, the Official Trustee can pay a legal aid commission’s legal costs out of the property of a suspect covered by a restraining order; and amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 to allow parole board warrants to be executed interstate. After considering the proposals, and with the amendments incorporated, the Labor Party is supporting the bill before the House. I apologise to the remaining speakers for not being able to stay in the chamber but I have a group of students in my office and I need to return. I commend the bill to the House. Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (10.27 a.m.)-The Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2002 is essentially a technical bill, as the member for Banks pointed out, which makes some minor changes and technical amendments. These amendments are being made to various Commonwealth criminal laws and deal with issues such as the taking of photographs and fingerprints, identity parades and changes to thresholds for indictable offences. Some of the provisions in the bill make changes that reflect our changing world-a world of many conflicts. One of the specific provisions of this bill deals with war crimes. This is extremely topical, given the conflicts which raged in the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. Currently, former President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic is facing the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The provisions of this bill allow the use of video links in these types of hearings-a very practical, modern and relevant approach. The government, in response to the concerns expressed by my colleague the member for Banks, proposes to remove the section of the bill which allowed a change in the conditions precedent to the use of force by police officers when making an arrest under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. Other amendments to be made by the government include enabling MAIN COMMITTEE the DNA of an unknown deceased person to be matched with another DNA profile of an unknown deceased person. This will help police work. In Western Australia, the state Labor government has made sweeping changes to the way DNA is used in crime fighting. The Premier, Dr Gallop, and the police minister, Michelle Roberts, developed legislation that allows the formation of a DNA bank which is used as a tool in unsolved crime. So far this initiative has been a success and has resulted in arrests for crimes that have remained unsolved. The solving of these crimes brings peace and surety to a lot of families and allows them to have closure on matters that have had tragic impacts on their lives. DNA is a vital tool in law enforcement and the changes in this bill, although minor in nature, ensure that law enforcement is able to face the challenges of this new century. The changes also allow participating jurisdictions to share DNA information. Labor believes that it is important to ensure that privacy safeguards are in place-that is, that there is adequate legislation. Item2 of the bill clarifies that a judge or magistrate is empowered to make any order reasonably necessary to ensure that fingerprints and photographic evidence are obtained from a convicted person. It brings in an enforcement mechanism which carries a penalty of 12 months imprisonment for non-compliance. In the past, people accused of an offence could decline to take part in an identification parade. The provisions contained in section 3ZM allow evidence of a person’s refusal to submit to an identity parade to be admissible for the purpose of explaining why no parade was held. This change has been made to remove the implication that a negative inference as to the suspect’s guilt may be drawn from the evidence of a refusal to take part in the parade. It also allows other identification evidence, based on photographs or another sighting of the suspect, as admissible. Again, these changes will bring some peace and security to the community, who often believe that it is somehow wrong when people refuse to give evidence in court cases. But the changes also protect the rights of an individual to pursue a reasonable defence of themself in these court cases. So it is a balanced change, and a change that is positive. The Attorney-General should be proud of it. Currently, indictable offences involving property have a threshold of $500. This has been increased to $5,000. This is a positive move, as it expands the jurisdiction of lower courts in relation to Commonwealth offences. This will mean that lower courts can deal with indictable offences, freeing up the higher courts for more serious cases. That is again a very practical and sensible move. The summary of indictable offences is also changed in the new section 4JA. These changes will mean that the criminal trial process will become more efficient. Although the change will take away a jury in these cases, it certainly will clear up the court system. It is a response to changes already made by a number of Australian states. How will this make the courts more efficient? It is designed to provide an incentive for defendants to waive their right to a jury trial by reducing the severity of a penalty that can be imposed by a magistrate. Given community attitudes towards crime and the constant call for tougher penalties, how are these changes a good thing? The people of Stirling asked me to bring their voices into this place. They want a bill which is not soft on law and order, but they also want a bill that is fair and just. In the types of cases covered by this bill, the offences which will be affected may be characterised as less serious crimes and do not involve terms of imprisonment. These crimes are not crimes against people. Measuring the changes to caseloads in both the lower courts and the higher courts, which this legislation attempts to MAIN COMMITTEE clear, will need to be done to gauge its effectiveness. Lower courts could find themselves in a situation where their caseloads increase and, without extra resources, they would develop waiting lists-something that nobody wants. Law enforcement is something I have taken very seriously during my time as the member for Stirling. One of the nightspots in my electorate, Scarborough Beach, was previously a trouble spot for residents, particularly on weekends. There would be a lot of fighting, drug and drinking offences, stolen goods offences-a whole raft of antisocial behaviour that was of concern not only to the residents but to the many tourists who come to beautiful Scarborough Beach. Through a collaborative strategy, the police, the City of Stirling, the member for Innaloo John Quigley, the Scarborough Beach Residents Association, the Scarborough and District Progress Association, the local drug action committee and my office put together a new patrol regime with an increased police presence in the area. As a result we have seen that Scarborough Beach is a now a far safer nightspot for young people to enjoy. As well, the beachfront is much safer for residents, tourists and casual visitors. Law enforcement begins on this basic level of caring for people in risky areas. When we have this sort of crime control right, it makes legislation of this nature far easier. Some minor changes will be introduced by the government to address concerns expressed by the member for Banks. These include amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 which will allow information to be passed on to the Australian Crime Commission. These changes recognise the cessation of the National Crime Authority. Given community attitudes towards corporate crime and the recent findings of the HIH royal commission and other high profile corporate collapses, these measures will give the public some confidence that we as law-makers will target white-collar crime. Criminal charges are expected to be laid from the HIH royal commission, and I think it is vital that perpetrators of corporate crime are seen to be punished. Too often in the past, high profile and rich defendants were able to get off charges such as fraud. This was mostly due to the fact that they were able to afford high-priced lawyers to avoid justice. The government needs to be told that tougher corporate governance is required. There is no doubt that corporate Australia is unable to govern itself, and we should not have to rely on expensive royal commissions to get to the bottom of corporate fraud. If law enforcement agencies are to clean up the bad eggs in our corporate world that give the majority of honest businesspeople a bad name, these agencies need support. On this issue of ethics and corporate governance, it is a dilemma as to how you pass on good values to young people when they are growing up. They have responsibilities when they go into a job and work their way through the career path up to the higher levels. They have responsibilities at multiple levels: to their shareholders, to the staff under them and to the community. I grapple at times with how you can build these values and ethics into people. I am not saying you do it in the school system; I think it comes from family. Like our Parliamentary Education Program, I very much believe that, at some time, we need to grapple with how we introduce these values into people’s lives-particularly if they come from families who do not have a notion of values-as a preventative measure to stop future corporate crime. I commend the government on the amendments, which I support. member for Banks and the member for Stirling for their contributions to this debate. I thank MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003
240,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.36 a.m.)-I would like to thank thethe opposition for supporting the Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003. The member for Banks knows that the Minister for Justice and Customs and I are always receptive to constructive suggestions to improve legislation that we are promoting, and I think the example in this case is typical. I do not propose to respond to the more general issues raised by the member for Stirling. The events at Scarborough Beach are of interest. The Liberal Party in Western Australia usually holds its state convention at Observation City, which overlooks Scarborough Beach, so the law and order situation there is of some interest. I do not share the member for Stirling’s fairly dismal view of the state of corporate governance in Australia. I think we have some bad examples, but I do not think that they are as general as her comments might have suggested. The Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003 will enhance a range of Commonwealth criminal justice related legislation. The measures in the bill will clarify the application of existing provisions and streamline certain criminal procedures. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 10.39 a.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Uniform Capital Allowance (Question No. 669) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Is it fact that prior to 1 July 2001, most individual or business taxpayers could claim a full tax deduction for most items of equipment up to the value of $300 so long as those items were relevant to a taxpayer’s income-producing activities. (2) Is it fact that, under the Uniform Capital Allowances (UCA) system which came into effect on 1 July 2001, an item up to the value of $300 can no longer be claimed as a full tax deduction in the year of purchase by businesses which have turnover greater than $1M per annum; if so, (a) why and (b) how does the Howard Government see this as a positive step forward in tax reform. (3) Is it also a fact that, under the UCA system, for a business having turnover greater than $1M per annum, an item of equipment costing as little as $10 now has to be placed in a pool in the taxpayer’s records and undergo a depreciation process, the end result of which is that that $10 item of equipment gets depreciated over a number of years; if so, how does the Howard Government see this as a positive step forward in tax reform. (1) Under the former depreciation rules, an immediate deduction for items costing $300 or less was available. (2) and (3) From1 July 2000, businesses have the option to write-off items costing less than $1000 through a low-value pool. Deductions for depreciating assets allocated to a low-value pool are worked out using set rates. A single calculation is made to work out the annual deduction for all the pooled assets. The removal of the immediate deduction and the introduction of low-value pools were recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation. The Review reported that keeping individual records for low-cost items could impose significant compliance costs. However, providing an immediate deduction for such items could provide undue tax benefits for those taxpayers who are significant investors in low-value items and could provide scope for tax avoidance. The recommended treatment was designed to strike an appropriate balance between taxpayer equity and tax system integrity, while also reducing compliance costs. Labor didn’t vote against these changes in the Parliament. Extensive consultation on this issue was undertaken as part of the Ralph Review. The question whether there should be immediate write-off for low-value items was raised in A Platform for Consultation (pages 95-96) and the low-value pooling mechanism evolved through consultation with industry. Treasury: Program Funding (Question No. 709) Ms Burke asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Are there any programs administered by the Ministers Department that provide, or have provided, funding to local government authorities in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000, (e) 2000-2001 and (f) 2001-2002.",180,Crimes Legislation Enhancement Bill 2003
241,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) If so, for each program for each of the years that funding was granted to local government authorities, (a) what was the level of funding provided to each local government authority, (b) what was the purpose for which the grant was made and (c) in which federal electoral division or divisions does this local government authority fall.

Many of these funding programs have a strong history of allocating funding to successful local government authority applicants, or applicants with strong local government authority linkages. For example, the Local Government Fund is providing $45 million over five years (1999-2000 to 2003-2004) to support regional and rural local government authorities in using telecommunications to deliver improved services and benefits to their communities. Information on grants and grant allocations including, the Local Government Fund are available in the Department’s annual report and at the Department’s grants portal (http://www.dcita.gov.au/Collection/CollectionPage/0,,0_1-2_1-3_202,00.html)",183,Questions On Notice

Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:",184,Questions On Notice
244,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) and (2) This information is available in the DHA Annual Report. (3) No. (4) The Australian Defence Force (ADF) Exit Survey completed in June 2002 shows that the top internal factor cited by members for leaving the ADF is ‘to make a career change while still young enough to do so’. The next most significant internal factors are cited as ‘desire to stay in one place’ and ‘better career prospects in civilian life’. Overall, career and family considerations (partner’s career, education of children, geographic stability) remain important issues for serving members when deciding on whether to remain in or leave the ADF. (5) 4,530 homes were classified as being inconsistent with DHA’s housing standards which now have amenities such as ensuite and family room. Note: As indicated in the answer to Part (1) – the information is contained in the DHA Annual Report. (6) These houses are located throughout Australia. (7) 1,084. (8) 1,967 are DHA owned and 1,479 are leased. (9) DHA has an ongoing strategy to replace, upgrade or dispose of sub-standard stock where possible. This is done under DHA’s capital program through the natural attrition of lease expiries, straight disposal, construction and property acquisition from the open market and directly leased properties from investors. In some instances it is more practical to upgrade existing stock to bring it to community standard rather than attempt to replace them. (10) DHA has 16 Major Regional DHA offices and 12 Outpost offices: (a) The Regional Offices are located at: (i) Adelaide (ii) Brisbane (iii) Cairns (iv) Canberra (v) Darwin (vi) Hunter Valley (vii) Melbourne (viii) Nowra (ix) Perth (x) Sydney (xi) Tindal (xii) Toowoomba (xiii) Ipswich (xiv) Townsville (xv) Wagga Wagga (xvi) Wodonga (b) (i) Woomera (ii) Canungra (iii) Puckapunyal (iv) Sale (v) Tasmania (vi) Rockingham (vii) Bullsbrook (viii) Sydney (ix) Hurtsville (x) Pennant Hills (xi) Richmond (xii) Alice Springs (11) DHA managed stock vacancy times (that is average vacancy time for houses vacant) in days were 32.7 at June 2002. Information relating to this position is not available prior to January 2002. (12) As part of the new ADF Housing Policy announced in April 1998, single members occupying level 1 and level 2 living-in accommodation were to have the choice of electing to live out with rent assistance from July 1999. Owing to the high cost of this change ($78 million per annum), the Defence Executive deferred its introduction pending a review of the most cost-effective way of providing housing assistance to living in personnel and to the ADF generally. In conjunction with this decision the accommodation charges for members occupying levels 1 and 2 accommodation were reduced as a compensatory measure. The review recommended a package of changes which included a modified form of rent assistance, called Optional Rent Allowance, which was introduced on 25 May 00. The accommodation charges for levels 1 and 2 accommodation were also reinstated to just short of their previous rates at the same time. Further changes were introduced on 25 October 2001 to further broaden the criteria under which single members can qualify for the payment of Rent Allowance and the modified form of Rent Allowance, which was also renamed from Optional to Partial Rent Allowance. (13) Stage one – To determine the long–term MWOD accommodation requirement for the Services from both a strategic and personnel perspective. (This stage has been completed). Stage two – To develop innovative, fully costed provisioning options that will deliver an accommodation solution that meets the Services’ requirements for both on and off-base accommodation. The solution is to be based on policy which is sustainable over time. A project team, consisting of project officers from the Defence Personnel Executive (DPE), Navy, Army and Air Force, had responsibility for progressing the first stage of the project. DPE took a project management role in assisting the Services to define their individual accommodation requirements and priority establishments/regions. A project team from Corporate Support and Infrastructure Group has the responsibility for developing provisioning options for the accommodation solutions, including associated funding arrangements, utilising the user requirement endorsed by the Defence Personnel Committee. The study is expected to be completed by July 2003. (14) Phase one of the review was conducted by DPE in concert with the individual Service Headquarters. Phase three will be conducted by Corporate Support and Infrastructure Group. It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of July 2003.

(7) As members and their families relocate around the country the mix of family composition and requirements does not always match the housing stock available.

245,Mr Mcmullan Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 16 October 2002:",190,Questions On Notice
246,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(c) The National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) is made up of State farm organisations, commodity councils, associates, affiliates and friends of the NFF. The NFF does not have individual farmer members or a State and Territory branch structure. The Department’s financial information system ‘SAP’ (and prior to 1998, ‘FI$CLE’) records the total amounts per year paid to members of the NFF as detailed at Attachment A. No payments were made direct to the NFF. These payments were made to support a range of activities relating to the representation and support of respondents to native title proceedings and negotiations. In addition payments have been made to legal practitioners for the benefit of some of these bodies as group representatives of respondents to applications made under the Native Title Act 1993. These payments are recorded by reference to the legal practitioner to which the money was paid. Identification of which payments have been paid to various practitioners for the benefit of these groups would require a manual cross check of hardcopy files. The significant resources required to undertake such a task are not available.

Regional Services: Rural Transaction Centres (Question No. 1224) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) Has the Inglewood Development and Tourism Committee submitted an application to the Rural Transaction Centre Program to establish a Rural Transaction Centre (RTC) in Inglewood, Vic. (2) Is he aware that the establishment of an RTC in Inglewood is vital in maintaining existing, and providing new, services thus providing a full range of services to the community and ensuring the social and economic growth for the district. (3) Will he approve the submission for an RTC in Inglewood; if so, when. (1) Yes. (2) It is this government’s view that access to services is essential for the social and economic well-being of all communities in Australia. Under the RTC Programme, funds have been made available to assist small rural communities to establish their own centres providing access to basic services such as banking, phone, fax, and Medicare easyclaim. (3) Inglewood’s application is currently being assessed by the RTC Programme National Office. A decision based on the assessment advice will be made at the conclusion of the assessment process.

249,Mr Tuckey,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,196,Questions On Notice
250,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:such local government area what was the recorded number of (a) humanitarian stream arrivals and (b) family stream arrivals from English Proficiency group 3 and 4 countries in 2001-2002. (1) (a) The Migrant Resource Centre/Migrant Service Agency (MRC/MSA) service agreement identifies the level of core funding to be provided in respect of a specified work program and related outcomes and outputs. There is no breakdown of funding for salaries and ancillary costs and consequently it is not possible to relate funding to a number of funded staff positions. (b) Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) funding is project based and funding is provided on the basis of the delivery of specified outcomes. Salaries are only one element of CSSS project costs, and it is not possible to identify the number of staff positions funded as part of these project costs. (2) There is full MRC/MSA coverage in Melbourne’s metropolitan local government areas. In metropolitan Sydney, the local government areas of Marrickville and Sutherland Shire do not fall within the catchment areas of any particular MRC/MSA. However, clients in these local government areas are serviced by organisations funded under the CSSS: Marrickville is serviced by the May Murray Neighbourhood Centre and Anglicare; and Sutherland Shire is serviced by the Gymea Community Aid and Information Service and through CSSS funding to St George MRC. The following table shows the numbers of Refugee and Humanitarian entrants and Family Stream migrants born in English Proficiency (EP) 3 and 4 countries settling in the local government areas of Marrickville and Sutherland Shire.

Marriage Celebrants: New Appointments (Question No. 1286) Ms Hall asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Has he proposed to increase the number of marriage celebrants by approximately 800 per year; if so, what impact will the increase have. (2) How will the increase impact upon the viability of marriage celebrants given that statistics issued by his Department indicate that in 2001 the number of weddings per 1000 head of population was at its lowest since 1901. (1) No. The Marriage Amendment Act 2002 (the Amendment Act) introduces the requirement that new marriage celebrants be trained, that all marriage celebrants undertake annual professional development and that their performance be regularly reviewed.",196,Questions On Notice
251,Mr Hardgrave,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,197,Questions On Notice
252,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In order to reassure existing marriage celebrants that the market will not be flooded with new marriage celebrants the Amendment Act inserts a provision into the Marriage Act 1961 (section 39E) which caps the number of marriage celebrants who can be appointed each year for the first five years of the reformed program. As I stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, the cap will be 10% of the total number of marriage celebrants each year for the first five years. There are currently approximately 3,500 marriage celebrants appointed by the Commonwealth. Hence the maximum number that will be able to be appointed in the first year of the new system is approximately 350 (depending on the final number of current marriage celebrants at the time of the changeover to the new system). It is not possible for there to be 800 marriage celebrants per year appointed under the new marriage celebrant program at least for the first five years. The 10 per cent cap on appointments is just that – a cap. It is not a target that I am aiming to reach. Indications currently are that in some areas the cap may not be filled. This means that the number of new marriage celebrants is likely to be even less. As to the impact that any increase in the number of marriage celebrants will have on existing marriage celebrants, I believe that this will be gradual. The appointment of marriage celebrants under the new, open, transparent and competency based appointment criteria, together with the application of the cap, will give existing marriage celebrants time to adjust to a more market based environment. (2) I presume that the honourable member is, in fact, citing statistics issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics not my Department. Statistics issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last year established that the crude marriage rate per head of population in 2001 was the lowest since these statistics were first recorded. I do not see the relevance of this to the viability of marriage celebrants. The marriage celebrants program is not about ‘dividing up’ marriages among marriage celebrants or ensuring that all marriage celebrants perform an equal number of marriages. The program, as reformed by the Amendment Act, is designed to ensure that all marrying couples enjoy high quality professional standards of service by marriage celebrants. The reforms are intended to raise standards. As I have noted, the cap on new appointments I have agreed to impose for the first five years will ensure that the increase in the number of new celebrants will be gradual. This will give current marriage celebrants time to adjust to the new system and its requirements. Telstra: Services (Question No. 1319) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) What revenue does Telstra derive annually from 190 numbers. (2) What revenue does Telstra derive annually from all international premium rate billing services. (3) Can Telstra provide a breakdown on the annual revenue derived from different categories of 190 numbers, including chat, friendship, sex, psychic and information numbers. (4) Does Telstra check 190 number service providers to ensure they are not providing services that are illegal; if so, what checks are made; if not, why not. (5) What checks does Telstra make on other premium rate billing services, including internet service providers, to ensure that the content such services are providing is not illegal. (6) Has Telstra considered terminating service agreements with 190 number providers, including Mediatel Services and Sound Advertising, who have had a large number of breaches against the Telephone Information Services Standards Council code of practice; if not, why not. (7) What steps does Telstra have in place to ensure that customers do not receive unexpectedly huge bills as a result of using 190 numbers and other premium rate billing services. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Telstra has advised that revenue information for 190 services is of a commercially confidential nature. (2) Telstra has advised that it does not provide any international premium rate billing services, and therefore does not derive any revenue from them. (3) No. See answer to part (1). (4) Telstra is required by Part 9A of Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that telephone sex services operate on the 1901 number range. Telstra must also ensure that consumers use a personal identification number (PIN), or other restricted access system to access the 1901 number range. Telstra has advised that it requires service providers issued with 190 numbers to comply with applicable legislation and the Telephone Information Services Standards Council (TISSC) Code of Practice in relation to telephone sex services. Telstra has advised that, in order to ensure that it complies with its legislative obligations in relation to the 1901 number range, it routinely checks the advertising of 190 services in the mass media to ensure no providers of telephone sex services are operating outside the 1901 number range. To date other premium rate services on the 190 number range are largely self-regulated, and Telstra advises that it refers questionable numbers to the relevant industry body, the Telecommunications Information Services Standards Council (TISSC). This industry body has a code of practice that deals with the supply and advertising of premium rate and Internet dialler services using 190 numbers. The TISSC Arbitrator, who investigates complaints about 190 services, has the power to direct a content service provider to refund a consumer’s payment, and even suspend or terminate a content service, where it finds that the provider has breached the code of practice. The Arbitrator may also refer complaints to Government agencies where it finds that there has been a breach of legislation that applies to premium rate services. (5) All domestic premium rate services are provided on the 190 number range. Telstra has advised it does not currently provide other premium rate billing services. Details on checks made by Telstra on its premium rate services on the 190 number range are provided in the answer to part 4. Telstra has advised that it has issued termination notices for existing Internet dialler services, effective on 25 August 2003. However, Telstra will consider limiting the scope of those notices to non-business content Internet diallers. This means that Telstra will consider new applications for business content Internet diallers and that business content Internet diallers may continue to be used. (6) Telstra has advised that it has previously disconnected a number of 190 services considered to be in breach of the TISSC code. Telstra has further advised that any information relating to specific contractual arrangement with individual service providers is a commercial in confidence matter. (7) Telstra has advised that it has controls in place to provide high usage warning reports that are used to alert customers to unusual 190 usage patterns in some circumstances. Telstra has advised that it has a number of phone management tools available to its customers. These include permanent barring of particular call types (eg 190, International, national long",197,Questions On Notice
253,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artsdistance), which is free for Telstra customers, as well as a call control tool that can be switched on or off with a PIN for a monthly charge. Telstra Call Control is free for eligible pensioners. Telstra has also advised that, when customers take up a new Telstra service connection, they are advised of these safeguards and that they can avail themselves of these safeguards by calling Telstra. Customers wishing to access 1901 telephone sex services require a PIN to make all such calls; and can apply for a PIN to these services by calling Telstra. Additionally, for people calling premium services with charges of more than $4 per minute, calls are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes to reduce prolonged use of a 190 service. During each call, a tone is played every five minutes to alert customers to the passing time. The Government is introducing a range of regulatory measures, announced on 8 November 2002, to address consumer concerns about unexpected high bills for premium rate services (including 190 and international calls). Regulations, which came into effect on 4 December 2002, give the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) a broad range of flexible powers to regulate the supply of premium rate services. The Minister has now directed the ACA to: require carriers to bar access to premium rate services provided through 190 numbers where the total premium rate bill exceeds a specified monthly amount; ensure that telephone companies inform their customers about the risks associated with premium rate services, and the pre-emptive action they can take to protect themselves from unexpected high bills; and investigate as a matter of priority, and report back to the Minister by 31 July 2003 on the desirability of other measures that could be implemented, including: the barring of access to international numbers or number ranges; and specific requirements to be imposed in relation to Internet diallers; and the registration with the ACA of an industry code similar to thatcurrently operated by TISSC. Telecommunications: Phone Services (Question No. 1320) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) How confident is the Government that 1902 numbers advertising such things as “fantasy stories”, “anything goes” and “submissive ladies” are not telephone sex services. (2) Are telephone sex services meant to use the 1901 pin number system under Part 9A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. (3) Further to the Minister’s media release entitled ‘Protecting Consumers from Internet Dumping’, dated 8 November 2002, at what stage are the Government and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) at in implementing the package of measures to prevent unexpected high telephone bills and Internet dumping. (4) What progress has been made on each measure announced in the media release. (5) In regard to the ACA being directed to bar access to 190 premium service numbers once a premium rate bill exceeds a certain amount per month, has this measure been introduced and what is the prescribed amount; if the measure has not been introduced, why not and when will it be introduced. (6) Further to part (5), why did the Government choose to implement credit limits for 190 numbers only when consumers are also running up huge unexpected phone bills from overseas 0011 numbers. (7) Has the Government considered directing carriers to implement general optional credit limits on all consumer phone accounts for all billable services; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) It is not possible to determine whether a service is a “telephone sex service” within the meaning of Part 9A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (the T(CPSS) Act) merely from the way in which that service is promoted or advertised. The legislation requires that the content of the service must also be taken into account in answering this question. Where a complaint is made about a service, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) may request that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) investigate the service to determine whether it is in fact a telephone sex service. The ABA will examine the service in light of the factors outlined above and provide an evidentiary certificate, outlining whether, in the opinion of the ABA, the service is a telephone sex service. (2) Part 9A of the T(CPSS) Act requires that if charges for a telephone sex service appear on a telephone bill of a customer of a telephone service provider: the customer must have given consent in writing prior to the service being supplied; the customer must have been issued with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or some other means of limiting access by others to the telephone sex service; the PIN or the other means of limiting access to the telephone sex service is to be used by the customer (or another end-user to whom the customer has divulged the PIN or other means of access) to access the service; and the service must have been supplied via a number with a ‘1901’ prefix . If charges for a telephone sex service are not to be included on a telephone bill, there is no requirement that the service provide a PIN or other access restriction, or operate on the 1901 number range. (3) The Government is introducing a range of regulatory measures, announced on 8 November 2002, to address consumer concerns regarding unexpected high bills for premium rate services and Internet dumping. Regulations, which came into effect on 4 December 2002, give the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) a broad range of flexible powers to regulate the supply of premium rate services. The Minister has also directed ACA to: (a) require carriers to bar access to premium rate services provided through 190 numbers where the total premium rate bill exceeds a specified amount per month; (b) ensure that telephone companies inform their customers about the risks associated with premium rate services, and the pre-emptive action they can take to protect themselves from unexpected high bills; and (c) investigate as a matter of priority and to report back to the Minister on the desirability of other measures that could be implemented, including: (i) the barring of access to international numbers or number ranges; (ii) specific requirements to be imposed in relation to Internet diallers; and (iii) the registration with the ACA of an industry code similar to that currently operated by the Telephone Information Services Standards Council (TISSC).",199,Questions On Notice
254,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsThe ACA has been directed to complete its investigations and report back by 31 July 2003. Service provider rules relating to a monthly call limit on calls to 190 numbers, and a consumer education campaign are to be made as soon as possible. (4) See answer to part (3). (5) As indicated in the answer to part (3) above, the ACA has been directed to impose a monthly call cap on 190 numbers. The ACA has not yet made the relevant service provider determination, as further investigations and stakeholder consultation are required. In determining an appropriate monthly limit, the ACA would be expected to have regard to industry compliance costs and consumer benefits. (6) and (7) The ACA has been directed to investigate and report on a range of initiatives that may address consumer concerns regarding unexpected high bills associated with premium rate services. It is open to the ACA to investigate credit limits for international numbers. The Government will consider the ACA report before deciding whether any further regulatory measures are necessary or appropriate. It should be noted, however, that measures already exist which allow consumers to protect themselves from unexpected high bills. Consumers who are concerned about unexpected high telephone bills can block access to premium rate services from their telephone. They can also install filtering software on their computers to block access to offensive material, including that accessed by Internet diallers. Taxation: Income Tax (Question No. 1331) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: What percentage of judges pay the top marginal rate of income tax. In preparing the response to this question the Australian Taxation Office utilised the occupation code used on tax returns to identify government appointed officials (occupation code 1103). This code covers coroners, judges and magistrates. Based on returns that have been lodged for the 2000-01 year the percentage of taxpayers using that occupation code who declared a taxable income in excess of $60,000 (the threshold where the top marginal rate of tax of 47% applies) is 83.9%. This is to be compared with 9.4% of the overall number of individuals who declared a taxable income in excess of $60,000. National Security: Hotline (Question No. 1333) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) How many telephone calls have been received by the 1800 123 400 hotline for the “Lets look out for Australia” terrorism alert campaign. (2) What is the general nature of calls believed to be genuine. (3) How many calls have been found to be hoax calls. (4) How many calls have been acted upon and by whom. (5) What action has been taken by the various authorities in response to those calls believed to be genuine.",201,Questions On Notice
255,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) Is the Government satisfied with the public response to its terrorism alert campaign; if so, why; if not, why not. (1) As at 28 February 2003, the National Security Hotline had taken 11,527 calls. (2) The majority of calls are genuine. These calls involved the provision of information about suspicious activity, the seeking of information about security arrangements and the threat environment, and comments regarding the campaign. (3) There have been three persons charged (one found guilty) for making a hoax or malicious call to the National Security Hotline. One related to an alleged bomb threat in Western Australia (found guilty), one related to an alleged threat, in New South Wales, against the Prime Minister and another related to an alleged extortion attempt in Victoria. (4) Commonwealth, State or Territory agencies analyse information received. All information relating to suspicious activities is forwarded to them by the Hotline for assessment. It is a matter for those agencies to determine the response to each call. (5) Agencies have advised that they are receiving useful information from the Hotline. Action taken is dependent on the nature of the information. (6) The fact that in excess of 11,500 calls have been received by the National Security Hotline since its inception is an indication of the success of the campaign. The majority of calls received by the Hotline relate to members of the public reporting, what is to them, suspicious activity. If only one of the calls prevents a terrorist attack, then the campaign will have served its purpose. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1336) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Further to his reply to question No. 1129, why did he believe that it was improbable that Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston would give his consent to exercise an exemption under the Privacy Act which would release the medical reports of the two eminent and independent medical specialists who examined Dr Colston in May 1999 in relation to his fitness to stand trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts. (2) Has he asked Dr Colston for his consent to the release of those two medical reports; if so when and what was Dr Colston’s reply; if not, why not. (3) Is he able to say whether the provisions of the Privacy Act to which he refers constitute a compellable power at law on him to exercise that power; if so, upon what basis is that compellableduty based; if not, why is the statutory power under the Privacy Act to seek the exemption from Dr Colston to consent to the disclosure of the subject information a non-compellable duty. (4) Is the exercise of this power an administrative power held in the hands of himself; if not, what type of power is it. (5) What power does he rely upon to make a decision on a balance of probabilities to refuse to consider the exercise of the statutory power under the Privacy Act to seek the consent of Dr Colston to publicly release the two medical reports. (6) Does the discretionary power to seek the consent of Dr Colston rest with Dr Colston. (7) Will he exercise his power afforded under the Privacy Act; if so, when; if not, why not. (8) In his refusal to exercise his statutory power to seek the consent of Dr Colston to the release of the two medical reports is he able to say whether this could be a breach of power or an error of law; if so, how; if not, why not.",202,Questions On Notice
256,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(9) What are the reasons that he believes that the public interest of twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts is outweighed by the privacy provisions protecting the disclosure of the two medical reports in relation to Dr Colston. (10) In forming his opinion in relation to the weight of balance between the two competing interests, has he exercised an administrative power or a judicial power in his decision not to release the subject information covered by parliamentary privilege; if so, what is that power; if not, why not. (1) to (7) As explained in the answer given in response to Question on Notice No. 1129, Information Privacy Principle 11 of the Privacy Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, personal information should not be publicly disclosed. One of the exceptions is where the subject of the information has consented to disclosure. Under the Privacy Act, consent is simply a qualification to a prohibition on disclosure and the Act neither imposes a duty nor confers a power on me to seek Dr Colston’s consent. In this case I will not seek consent because it is improbable that Dr Colston would consent to publication. The medical reports contain very sensitive and personal health information and in general individuals do not consent to publication of personal information of that kind. In addition, as a general rule seeking consent is inappropriate if it might be misinterpreted by the subject of the information or others as indicating a belief on my part that there may be sufficient public interest in disclosure for me to consider making an exception to the Privacy Act general principle of non disclosure of personal information. As explained in the answer given in response to Question on Notice No. 1129, in my view the balance of the public interest in this case does not weigh in favour of public release of the reports. (8) It is not appropriate for me to give legal advice in answer to questions on notice. (9) In giving the answer given in response to Question on Notice No. 1129 that the balance of the public interest does not weigh in favour of public release of the reports, I balanced the relative weight of the competing public interests. Given that disclosure of the reports is not necessary to protect the public revenue or to enforce the law (as stated in response to Question on Notice No. 1573 of 29 May 2000), the public interest in the public having access to the information is not strong. On the other hand the public interest against disclosure is strong, as evidenced by the Privacy Act general principle of non disclosure of personal information and the fact that in general individuals do not consent to publication of personal health information. (10) It is not appropriate for me to give legal advice in answer to questions on notice. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1337) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: Further to paragraph 3 of his reply to question No. 1130 that the public interest is not established because something is of interest to the public but a higher standard of serious concern or benefit to the public is required rather than merely of individual interest, why is the matter of the public release of those two medical reports, bearing in mind their relationship to the twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts originally brought against Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston, something that is of insufficient concern or benefit to the public. As explained in the answer given in response to Question on Notice No. 1130, in arriving at a balance of public interest in a particular case, it is necessary to consider whether the public interest considerations in disclosing the information outweigh the public interest in government agencies protecting the privacy of sensitive personal information in their possession. In this instance the balance favours a de-",203,Questions On Notice

Aviation: Passenger Indemnities (Question No. 1348) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Acting Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: Are passengers who travel with commercial airlines protected by legislation for their costs if the airlines become insolvent; if so, what percentage of those costs are protected. There is no specific legislation that broadly covers the indemnity of passengers for losses if commercial airline services (both domestic and international) fail. In the case of international non scheduled services, however, the Air Navigation Act 1920 as amended requires a charter operator seeking to operate a program of non-scheduled passenger services (charter services) to satisfy the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services, as part of the application: “that holders of tickets for the flight or any of the flights will be indemnified for any financial loss that may be caused by the failure of the charter operator: (a) to fulfil its obligations; or (b) if the application relates to a program of flights – to complete the program.” Prospect Electorate: Bankruptcies (Question No. 1351) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: How many persons in the electoral division of Prospect have been declared bankrupt pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000, (e) 2000-2001 and (f) 20012002. Based on post code information given by bankrupts on their Statement of Affairs, the total number of persons in the electoral division of Prospect declared bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in 20012002 was 346. The post codes used to obtain this information were 2145, 2148, 2164, 2165, 2166, 2171, 2176 and 2759. The post code information is related to the relevant Commonwealth electoral division and is based on data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Some post code areas may cross electoral boundaries, resulting in minor discrepancies in reporting against electorate divisions when the post codes used do not necessarily equate to the relevant electorate boundary. I am unable to provide suitable information for the years prior to 2001-2002 because prior to July 2001 post code data was not regularly collected and recorded by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) which collects and maintains personal insolvency data. Superannuation: Entitlements (Question No. 1354) (1) Has he sought advice in respect to the differential superannuation entitlements of employees working beyond the age of 70.",204,Questions On Notice
259,Mr Tuckey,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,205,Questions On Notice
260,Mr Williams,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,205,Questions On Notice
261,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 4 February 2003:(2) Will the Government take legislative or other measures to address the apparently discriminatory treatment of employees after they reach the age of 70. (1) On9 January 2003, the Government released an Information Paper setting out in detail its proposals for age discrimination legislation. The proposals include exemptions for legitimate age criteria in the provision of superannuation. The superannuation exemptions proposed for the age discrimination legislation were developed in the course of extensive consultations with business and community organisations. There was broad agreement in consultations that issues arising from the age criteria in the Commonwealth superannuation regime were best addressed through the ongoing review and adaptation of the superannuation system, rather than through age discrimination legislation. State and Territory anti-discrimination laws provide exemptions for superannuation, which allow for the inherently age-based nature of the existing superannuation system. Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws, such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, also provide exemptions for superannuation. Age-related criteria are central to the Government’s policies to promote better incomes in retirement through superannuation and the age pension, and to ensure that superannuation (which is concessionally taxed) is appropriately used for retirement purposes. Superannuation and related social security and taxation laws are finely balanced and constantly monitored. The Government continues to monitor the operation of the superannuation system to ensure that it meets the needs of an ageing population. (2) The contribution and compulsory cashing rules for superannuation are designed to reduce the risk that concessionally taxed benefits are used for estate planning and not genuine retirement income purposes. Within this framework, however, the Government is committed to ensuring that the superannuation system reflects the needs of the ageing Australian population. On1 July 2002, the Government implemented its 2001 election commitment to raise the maximum age limit for personal superannuation contributions from age 70 to 75. All superannuation fund members aged between 65 and 75 can now make personal contributions to superannuation if they are working at least 10 hours per week. As a consequence of this measure, the Government has also changed the compulsory cashing rules for those aged between 70 and 75. The benefits of these members must be compulsorily cashed if the member is working fewer than 10 hours per week. Previously, all members aged over 70 were required to work full-time (at least 30 hours per week) to avoid compulsory cashing. The 30-hour standard remains for people aged over 75.

Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The provider counts above were based on major practice postcode in the December quarter of the respective years. Where postcodes overlapped Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population of each postcode in each electoral division. In general terms, any practitioner with more than 50 per cent of Medicare Schedule fee income from non-referred attendances, based on claims processed in the December quarter of the respective years, was regarded as a general practitioner. All other practitioners, including optometrists, were regarded as specialists. To the extent that some providers have more than one active provider number, there will be some multiple counting of providers. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1448) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 2003: (1) How many asylum seekers have been issued with a temporary protection visa (TPV) from October 1999 to present time. (2) What was the recorded country of birth of all TPVs granted to date. (3) Of those who are still in possession of a TPV at present, how many live in each (a) State and Territory, (b) capital city and (c) local government area in the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas.",212,Questions On Notice
272,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) As at 7 February 2003, 8,616 people had been granted a temporary protection visa, since its introduction in October 1999. (2) The recorded nationality of all TPVs granted to date is as follows: Afghanistan 3607 Albania8 Algeria9 Angola1 Bahrain2 Bulgaria1 Burma6 Burundi2 China1 China (PRC) 2 Congo5 Cote D’Ivoire1 Egypt7 Greece1 India2 Iran 408 Iraq 4138 Jordan5 Korea4 Kuwait 12 Kyrgyzstan 1 Lebanon3 Morocco1 Nigeria1 Pakistan 27 Palestine 97 Philippines 2 Russia4 Rwanda1 Saudi Arabia4 Sierra Leone2 Somalia 15 Sri Lanka 126 Stateless 38 Sudan2 Syria 24 Tunisia3 Turkey 33 Turkmenistan 1 Ukraine2 Vietnam1 Yemen2 Yugoslavia 2 Zaire2 The above data indicates TPV holders’ nationality, rather than the country of origin as requested. Data held by my Department in relation to nationality is more reliable than country of origin. The Refugees Convention requires consideration of claims against the country of nationality or, if the asylum seeker is stateless, their country of habitual residence. An applicant’s country of origin is not a relevant consideration when assessing a protection visa application, and is often not indicative of a person’s nationality or country of habitual residence. (3) (a)-(c) Figures for the location of TPV holders in Australia at any given time are not currently available in the form requested. In general, lawful temporary residents of Australia are not obliged to keep DIMIA informed of their whereabouts unless they are applying for a further visa. However, statutory requirements that TPV holders keep my Department informed of their address were introduced in September 2001. There is a significant number of TPVs granted prior to the introduction of this requirement and some 16% of all TPV holders have not lodged further visa applications. Where TPV holders have made further applications for a protection visa, they are obliged as visa applicants, to keep DIMIA informed of their current address. Anecdotal information indicates that many of these addresses are not assiduously updated by the applicant until their TPV approaches the 30 month point, at which stage applicants are expecting that active decision making on their further PV application might commence. Special Benefit statistics from Centrelink covering around one half of the group of TPV holders provide the most reliable indication of the distribution of TPV holders between States and Territories. NSW & ACT– 52% VIC – 25% QLD – 4% SA – 11% WA – 7% TAS – .05% NT .05%.

(2) How many of these (a) veterans, (b) war widows and war widowers and (c) spouses of veterans with an entitlement in their own right reside in each of the postcode areas within the electoral division of Newcastle. (3) How many (a) veterans, (b) war widows and war widowers and (c) spouses of veterans with an entitlement in their own right have accessed services under the Veterans Home Care program in 2001 and 2002. (4) Under the Veterans Home Care program, how many hours of services were provided to eligible (a) veterans, (b) war widows and war widowers and (c) spouses of veterans with an entitlement in their own right in 2001 and 2002. (5) What is the process whereby (a) veterans, (b) war widows and war widowers and (c) spouses of veterans with an entitlement in their own right are assessed for home care services. (6) Can (a) veterans, (b) war widows and war widowers and (c) spouses of veterans with an entitlement in their own right residing in low-level care hostels access services under the Veterans Home Care program or the Rehabilitation Appliances Program; if so, what are the guidelines that enable access to these programs; if not, what guidelines prevent access to the programs. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The following figures are all as at 31 December 2002 (a) 1,334 (b) 975 (c) Spouses of veterans are not entitled to a Gold Card unless they are themselves eligible as veterans. Therefore they are included under (1) (a) above. (2) (a) and (b) The number of veterans and war widows with a Gold Card in postcode areas within the Newcastle electorate are shown in the table below. (c) See part (1) (c) above.

(2) Figures as at 31 December 2002. (3) Persons may be counted in more than one category. (3) (a), (b) and (c) The following are combined as there is currently no capacity to report on Veterans’ Home Care (VHC) recipients by veteran type. There is also no capacity to report on VHC by electorate. The electorate of Newcastle, along with five other electorates, is located within the Hunter VHC region and the figures provided below are for this region. The VHC core services are Domestic Assistance, Personal Care and Home and Garden Maintenance. In 2001, 866 veterans or war widows and war widowers or spouses of veterans received one or more services in the Hunter region. In 2002, 1,415 veterans or war widows and war widowers or spouses of veterans received one or more services in the Hunter region. (4) (a), (b) and (c) The following figures are combined as there is currently no capacity to report on VHC recipients by veteran type. There is also no capacity to report on VHC by electorate. The electorate of Newcastle, along with five other electorates, is located within the Hunter VHC region and the figures provided below are for this region. The VHC core services are Domestic Assistance, Personal Care and Home and Garden Maintenance. In 2001, 19,409 hours of services were provided in the Hunter region. In 2002, 51,813 hours of services were provided in the Hunter region. (5) (a), (b) and (c) To be assessed for VHC services a person must be: a veteran of the Australian defence forces; or an Australian mariner; or a war widow/widower of a veteran of the Australian defence forces or an Australian mariner; and have a Repatriation Health Card For All Conditions (Gold Card); or a Repatriation Health Card For Specific Conditions (White Card). To be provided with services a veteran must have a demonstrated need. The Assessment Agency conducts the initial assessment over the phone using the VHC assessment instrument. Triggers are built into the assessment instrument indicating when an in-home assessment is required, for example circumstances where the veteran has a hearing loss, or cognitive impairment. Data is entered directly into the VHC IT system and if services are approved a service plan is sent to the nominated service provider and a care plan to the veteran. (6) (a), (b) and (c) Veterans’ Home Care No, veterans residing in aged care facilities, funded by the Department of Health and Ageing, are not eligible to receive Veterans’ Home Care services. This accommodation is already receiving government funding under the Aged Care Act 1997, which is set at a level to meet residents’ needs. Rehabilitation Appliances Program Access to the provision of equipment under the RAP to entitled persons is based upon an assessed clinical need(s) and is governed by the Treatment Principles, prepared under Section 90 of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. The assessment of an entitled person’s clinical need/s is conducted by specified health professionals, usually an occupational therapist, upon referral from, and in consultation with, the entitled person’s Local Medical Officer (LMO). The guidelines governing the supply of RAP items to entitled persons residing in institutions (including low level hostels) is specified under Treatment Principle 11.3.6. In genral, it is the responsibility of the Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) to cater for the needs of its residents. However, if the Repatriation Commission considers the equipment requested by the entitled person receiving low-level care or high level care is not the responsibility of the RACF because of any legislation, charges or subsidies, then the Commission may consider the request based on assessed clinical need and in accordance with the national guidelines. These guidelines apply regardless of whether the person making the request is in an institution or not and relate to the item requested. Taxation: Avoidance Schemes (Question No. 1501) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Did the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody issue a warning on 11 February 2003 to small business owners in relation to those individuals who participate in tax avoidance schemes by using fixed trusts to distribute profits into self-managed superannuation funds and thereby expect to receive the 15% concessional rate of tax. (2) Is the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) investigating those schemes; if so, what is the outcome of the ATO’s investigation; if not, why not. (3) Is he aware whether any (a) barristers or (b) solicitors are (i) personally participating in or (ii) promoting these schemes to their clients; if so, how many barristers and solicitors have been identified. (1) The Commissioner of Taxation issued a Taxpayer Alert on 11 February 2003 to provide an early warning to taxpayers of the issues arising from a scheme that uses an interposed fixed trust to distribute profits into a self managed superannuation fund. (2) Taxpayer Alerts are designed to provide an early warning to taxpayers of arrangements that the ATO is investigating. Investigations are not yet complete. (3) One of the benefits of issuing early warnings is that potential participants are aware of the ATO’s concerns before deciding whether or not to enter into an arrangement or claim the tax benefit. The Commissioner of Taxation is continuing his investigations but at this early stage he advises promotion of this arrangement was not aimed at solicitors and barristers and there does not appear to be any significant participation by these groups. Health: MRI Machines (Question No. 1503) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Further to part (5) of the answer to question No. 358 (Hansard, 19 August 2002, page 4941) and part (7) of the answer to question No. 884 (Hansard, 22 October 2002, page 8391), has the Minister seen a News Release by the NSW Minister for Health on 11 February 2003, titled “MRI at Concord Hospital” advising that the Carr Labor Government has already promised to fund the significant building works required and the ongoing operating costs for a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit at Concord Repatriation General Hospital, but that the NSW Minister first needs the licence from the Federal Government. (2) When will the Minister offer Concord Repatriation General Hospital an MRI licence and allow it to provide Medicare eligible MRI services. the honourable member’s question: (1) I have not seen the news release by the NSW Minister for Health titled “MRI at Concord Hospital”. Staff in my Department have searched extensively for this news release and have not been able to locate it. In fact, staff at the NSW Health Minister’s own office are unaware of it. With regard to the NSW Health Minister’s need for a federal licence, whilst the Commonwealth Government regulates the conditions under which MRI services attract Medicare rebates it does not regulate or restrict the establishment of MRI units in public hospitals. As such, there is no",235,Questions On Notice
283,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,252,Questions On Notice
284,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toimpediment to the New South Wales State Government funding the establishment of a MRI unit at the Concord Repatriation General Hospital. I would welcome the New South Wales Government’s commitment to the provision of quality health care were it to do so. (2) The Government has not made any decisions on future growth for MRI and I am therefore unable to indicate whether Concord Hospital would obtain Medicare eligibility for a MRI unit. In addition, the Department of Health and Ageing is currently negotiating with the Diagnostic Imaging (DI) profession on future DI agreements. Future priorities for MRI and other DI services will need to be considered in the context of these negotiations. It is also worth noting that Medicare funded access to MRI in metropolitan Sydney is above the national average. Shipping: Navigation Act Review (Question No. 1510) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Acting Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: Has a review been undertaken of the Navigation Act; if so, (a) who conducted the review, (b) was a report produced, (c) when will it be available to the public, (d) what did the review recommend, (e) what is the status of the recommendations, (f) when will the industry be consulted and (g) when will they be implemented. The Government decided on 16 December 1997 to review the Act in two stages. The first stage considered repeal of matters that impede shipping reform or are inconsistent with the concept of company employment. This review stage was completed in 1998 and resulted in the Navigation Amendment (Employment of Seafarers) Bill 1998, which was introduced into Parliament on 25 June 1998. The House of Representatives passed the Navigation Amendment (Employment of Seafarers) Bill 1998 but it was obstructed in the Senate. The second stage focussed on the remaining parts of the legislation that restricts competition or trading opportunities, are anachronistic or redundant, or which impose costs or confer benefits on business. The report of the second stage, entitled Review of the Navigation Act 1912, was released in June 2000 and has been available on the Department of Transport and Regional Services website at http://www.dotars.gov.au/transinfra/navact_reference.htm. The report is the most recent review of the Navigation Act and provides much of the information sought including the timing and conduct of the review, industry consultation and recommendations. The implementation of the recommendations is being considered in the context of the Government’s legislative program, bearing in mind the experience of earlier attempts to amend aspects of the Navigation Act 1912 that would have modernised and simplified the regulatory framework for ship operations. In addition to the Navigation Amendment (Employment of Seafarers) Bill 1998 referred to above, the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 which sought to revise the trading ship safety regulatory framework under the Navigation Act 1912 was also passed by the House of Representatives but obstructed in the Senate.

287,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) (a) The Department does not undertake aged care planning on an electorate basis; it is undertaken on the basis of Aged Care Planning Regions. These regions do not coincide with the Federal electorates. The following table identifies CACP packages allocated to the planning regions which cover the electorates in question. Metro South West 567 Metro North 504 Metro East 356 Metro South East 297 South West 186 Wheatbelt 55 Goldfields 52 Kimberley 50 Pilbara 56 Mid West 37 Great Southern 28 (b) There are two EACH providers in Western Australia, who provide a total of 75 EACH packages in Perth. Their combined client catchment areas include suburbs within the electorates of Swan, Canning, Hasluck, Tangney, Curtin, Perth, Stirling and Cowan. (3) A total of 202 CACP’s have been allocated to providers based in these postcode areas. No Extended Aged Care at Home packages have been allocated to providers based in these postcode areas. (4) Extended Aged Care at Home packages can provide complex nursing care. Packages of care may also include continence aids, oxygen, oxygen equipment and access to hoists and higher levels of personal care than Community Aged Care Packages. (5) EACH packages are funded at the level of residential care subsidy level 2. There is no direct saving to Government compared to residential care. (6) EACH is a small program in its developmental stage. Services are available in the following planning regions: State Planning Regions Number of places NSW South West Sydney 28 North Sydney 18 Illawarra 20 ACT ACT 30 SA Metropolitan East 35 VIC Western Metropolitan 15 Grampians 35 Loddon Mallee 34 TAS North-Western 13 Southern 12 NT Darwin 20 WA Metropolitan North 50 Metropolitan South 25 (7) People who live in suburbs with no access to Extended Aged Care at Home packages may access Community Aged Care Packages (CACP’s) and Home and Community Care (HACC) services. The HACC Program aims to provide a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated range of basic maintenance and support services for frail aged people, people with a disability and their carers. HACC services include community nursing, personal care, meals, domestic assistance, home modification and maintenance, transport and community based respite care. The HACC Program is a joint Commonwealth, State and Territory funded initiative, where the Commonwealth contributes 60% of the funding. In 2002-03, the Commonwealth will contribute $674.1 million for HACC services. Immigration: Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (Question No. 1521) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) What household items are provided to eligible humanitarian entrants under the Household Formation Support (HFS) element of the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS). (2) Are items such as lounge furniture, wardrobes and chests of drawers excluded from the list of approved items; if so, is it assumed that charities will provide humanitarian entrants with such items out of their own resources. (3) Are contracted service providers funded a set sum per household to provide approved household items; if so, what is this sum and on what basis was it determined. (4) Have HFS service providers expressed concern about their capacity to provide adequate HFS assistance to clients within the current financial constraints of the scheme; if so, what has been the response of his Department. (1) Eligible humanitarian entrant families under the HFS element of IHSS receive a basic set of household goods depending on family needs. The following items are included: Mattresses Table Chairs Refrigerator Pillows Bedding (sheets and blankets) A quantity of crockery and cutlery appropriate to the household size including cooking utensils and saucepans. (2) There is no restriction on supplementing the basic package of goods with other items, such as lounge furniture, wardrobes and chests of drawers but this is largely dependent on the availability of donated goods. (3) Yes, HFS service providers are funded a set sum per family to provide household items, which is indexed annually for CPI increases. In 2002-03 this amount is $1200 per family. It was based on providing a basic set of goods for an average family size of 3.5 persons. The intent of HFS is that service providers have flexibility within the available funds to tailor a package for a family, and it is open to service providers to adjust the amounts provided to individual families although in practice needs are such that most receive the standard package. (4) Yes, HFS service providers have expressed concerns regarding the limited amount of funding in the context of the IHSS Evaluation and in comments to the Review of Settlement Services. A response will be considered in the light of the Report on the Settlement Services Review.",255,Questions On Notice

Telstra: Services (Question No. 1536) Ms Corcoran asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Was there a failure of telecommunications services in Omeo on Saturday, 25 January 2003.",260,Questions On Notice
293,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Are telecommunications to Omeo provided through two switching centres at Wangaratta and Morwell. (3) Was there an optic fibre failure from Wangaratta and a mains power failure to Morwell and the Morwell telephone exchange which led to the isolation of Omeo and surrounding areas. (4) Was backup power provided at the Morwell exchange through local power generation equipment, and was the capacity of the equipment adequate to cover the mains power failure. (5) What arrangements have been put in place to prevent such a serious failure happening again. (6) Was the telecommunications failure at Morwell similar to previous mains power cuts at Pakenham and Kyneton telephone exchanges which also led to major telecommunications outages. (7) What arrangements are in place to monitor such failures. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question based on information provided by Telstra: (1) Yes. A telephone exchange failure affected fixed services connected to the Omeo Telephone Exchange for a period of 102 minutes Telstra CDMA mobile phone services at Omeo were not affected by this outage. This Outage was as a result of two isolated and unusually rare coincidental elements. On the 25th of Jan 2003 at 4:47pm a transmission failure occurred between Bright and Hotham Heights. This was caused by the underground optical fibre cable between Bright and Mt Hotham being damaged by fire emergency services crews constructing a fire break for the bush fires in that area. This outage had no effect on telephone services in Omeo at this time. The Mt Hotham area was declared an unsafe and hazardous area and Telstra staff were delayed for several days in entering the area to repair the damaged optical fibre cable. On Saturday the 25th of January a grass fire at Morwell caused a general mains power failure which resulted in loss of mains power to the Morwell telephone exchange. The Morwell exchange’s emergency power generator would normally have started to operate. However, the generator failed due to overload when both the exchange rectifiers and the air conditioning unit attempted to start up at the same time. The loss of transmission to Omeo was caused by the subsequent air conditioning unit failure at Morwell. (2) Yes, communications to Omeo are protected by two transmission paths; Morwell to Omeo via Wangaratta and Mt Hotham, and Morwell to Omeo via Bairnsdale. With the damage to the optical fibre cable caused by the bushfires at Mount Hotham, Omeo still had service via a backup transmission path to the telephone switch at Morwell via Bairnsdale. However, the backup transmission path was lost when the air conditioning unit at Morwell subsequently failed. If not for the day’s earlier fire damage and the compounding effects of the Morwell air conditioning failure, service would have remained uninterrupted to Omeo because traffic would have been able to travel along one of two routes: Morwell to Omeo via Wangaratta and Mt Hotham, and Morwell to Omeo via Bairnsdale. (3) Yes, there was optic fibre failure resulting in fixed line services through Omeo being affected. However, Telstra’s CDMA mobile phone service allowed mobile communications to the Omeo area to continue during the outage. (4) Under normal circumstances, the emergency power plant at Morwell is adequate for the purpose. However, the extreme weather conditions on the 25th January (some 45 Degrees Celcius) meant that when the generator at the Morwell exchange started up, the load on it from the rectifiers and the air conditioning unit at start-up was too great, resulting in the failure of the generator and the air conditioning unit.",261,Questions On Notice
294,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(5) The cutting of the optical fibre cable at Mt Hotham was beyond the control of Telstra. Telstra has already modified power equipment and the air conditioning unit at the Morwell exchange to ensure that the power overload condition does not arise in the future. (6) No. All failures were based on different causes. (7) The Telstra Global Operations Centre continuously monitors Telstra’s network, immediately following up any network and/or power alarms. Additionally, routine maintenance programs and load testing are undertaken on all mains power back-up systems. Such testing is undertaken under normal load conditions -it is extremely difficult to simulate the heat conditions experienced on the 25th January. Immigration: Visa Cancellations (Question No. 1537) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Since the Government’s election in 1996 to the present day, how many visas has he personally cancelled. (2) Will he provide a time line for cancellations. (3) In each case, what type of visa was held. (4) On what grounds was each visa cancelled. (5) Why were the visas cancelled by him rather than a delegate, thus ruling out any right of administrative review. (6) What are the guidelines for the cancellation of a visa by the Minister, as opposed to a delegate. (7) Can he provide details of any changes since the introduction of the scheme for visa cancellation on character grounds centred on s.501 of the Migration Act in relation to (a) the proportion of cancellation decisions made by the Minister personally, rather than by delegates and (b) the policies or guidelines applying to the question of whether and when such decisions are to be made by the Minister personally, rather than by delegates. (8) In relation to the introduction of any such changes, what consideration was given to the fact that a person whose visa is cancelled in this way by the Minister personally has no right of independent review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), whereas there is such a right of review when the decision is made by a delegate. (9) Was one of the reasons for the introduction of any such change a desire to remove the right of independent review in the AAT. (1) There are a number of powers in the Migration Act 1958 that I can utilise to cancel a visa. These are: section 109 incorrect information section 116 general power to cancel section 128 when holder outside Australia section 134 cancellation of business visas section 137Q cancellation of regional sponsored employment visas section 140 consequential cancellation of other visas section 500A refusal or cancellation of temporary safe haven visas section 501 refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds",262,Questions On Notice
295,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:section 501A or 501B refusal or cancellation of visa – setting aside and substitution of nonadverse decision under subsection 501 (1) or (2) Since1 June 1999, section 501 has predominantly replaced criminal deportation as the method used to ensure the safety and welfare of the Australian community. Previously, section 200 had been used for this purpose. The vast majority of decisions made under these powers are decided by Department officers acting as my delegates. Decisions I have taken personally to cancel a visa are predominantly related to character concerns, often involving significant criminal activity. Based on the records available to the Department some 58,200 visas have been cancelled since 1996-97, of which I have personally cancelled approximately 570 visas. (2) The time line for any case where possible visa cancellation is to be considered can vary significantly depending on a range of elements relevant to the case in question. Such elements may include the particular circumstances of the case, whether further information may be required to reach a decision, including information from other agencies, where appropriate, submissions from the person concerned regarding the proposed cancellation and whether there are international obligations that need to be taken into account. These processes are an important step in ensuring that all relevant material pertaining to a decision, and my responsibility to protect the Australian community, are given proper consideration against the relevant legislation before a decision is made. (3) The Department does not keep statistics on the specific type of visa cancelled by me, although most would be permanent residents who had criminal records. (4) The Department does not keep statistical data on the “grounds” for section 501 cancellations in individual cases. The Migration Act sets out the possible grounds for cancellation decisions where the person does not pass the “character test”. (5) The Government is most concerned at the presence in Australia of non-citizens convicted of serious crimes and believes the Australian community is entitled to be protected against them. Generally, I decide cases personally under section 501 of the Migration Act if a visa holder (normally a permanent visa holder) is to be considered for cancellation as a result of serious character concerns regarding the visa holder. I may also set aside a non-adverse decision whether it has been considered by a delegate or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) under section 501A, if the person does not satisfy me that they pass the “character test” and I am satisfied the cancellation is in the national interest. (6) Guidelines to consider possible visa cancellation are provided to my delegates in Migration Serial Instructions (MSIs) 133, 254, 335 and 368. Direction No. 21 made under s499 of the Migration Act (“Visa refusal and cancellation under section 501”) provides further instruction for delegates. While I may be informed by these guidelines I have discretion to consider each case on its own merits. (7) (a) Visa cancellations on character grounds centred on s501 of the Migration Act predominantly replaced criminal deportation under s200 from 1 June 1999. The proportion of cancellation decisions made by the Minister personally is given in the table below: The proportion of cancellation decisions made by the Minister personally: Date Minister Total No. of Cancellations % by Minister 1996-97 4 2970 0.13% 1997-98 10 4828 0.20% 1998-99 40 6920 0.57% 1999-00 114 7808 1.46% 2000-01 133 8879 1.49% Date Minister Total No. of Cancellations % by Minister 2001-02 137 14614 0.93% 2002-March 2003 135 12220 1.10% (b) As I stated in my response to part (5), I generally decide cases personally under section 501 of the Migration Act if a visa holder (normally a permanent visa holder) is to be considered for cancellation as a result of serious character concerns. I may also set aside a non-adverse decision by a delegate or the AAT under section 501A if the person does not satisfy me that they pass the “character test” and I am satisfied that it is in the national interest to cancel that person’s visa. (8) and (9) The powers I have under s501 and s501A of the Migration Act were approved by Parliament. As I informed the Parliament in my Second Reading Speech for the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998, these powers are used when it is necessary for me “to act decisively on matters of visa cancellation … to ensure that the government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations”. Rural and Regional Australia: Flood Mitigation Program (Question No. 1544) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Has the Federal Government provided funding for flood mitigation works in Fairfield City, NSW.

(1) Yes. (2) 1996-1997. (3) The Federal Government ceased to provide assistance for urban flood mitigation funding in 19961997 in line with the recommendation of the 1996 National Commission of Audit Report. (4) Since the RFMP was established in 1999-2000, the Federal Government has allocated $30.35 million to flood mitigation works and measures across Australia. A further $9.6 million will be allocated nationally in both 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. (5) In May 2001, the RFMP was expanded to include outer metropolitan areas. The Federal Government has advised States and Territories that it is a matter for them, as part of their project assessment processes, to determine outer metropolitan boundaries. (a) The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation has advised my Department that the following outer metropolitan areas have received RFMP funding: Wentworthville (Parramatta City Council); Baulkham Hills (Baulkham Hills Shire Council); Camden (Camden Council)",263,Questions On Notice

Health: Iophendylate (Question No. 1609) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: (1) Over what period was the drug iophendylate, otherwise known as Pantopaque or Myodil, licensed for use in Australia. (2) When was the licence withdrawn or ceased and for what reason. (3) Does Myodil contain: (i) Benzene, (ii) Hydrochloric Acid, (iii) Sulphuric Acid, (iv) Potassium Permanganate, and (v) 30% Iodine. (4) Is it the case that (a) Benzene is regarded as a leading carcinogenic, (b) Potassium Permanganate can kill if digested, and (c) incorrect use of Iodine can lead to Parkinson’s disease. (5) Have the patients who were given Myodil been identified; if not, why not. (6) Have those same patients been advised by the Minister’s department, or any other Commonwealth agency, about the potentially adverse effects of Myodil; if not, why not. (7) How many patients who were prescribed iophendylate subsequently developed Adhesive Arachnoiditis. (8) Is there a known cure or treatment for Adhesive Arachnoiditis. (9) Have any studies been undertaken in Australia into the number of Adhesive Arachnoiditis sufferers; if so, what are the details. (10) Has the Minister’s Department, or any other Commonwealth agency, sponsored research into the after effects of the use of Myodil. (11) Has the Minister’s Department, or any other Commonwealth agency, provided financial support for Adhesive Arachnoiditis support groups. the honourable member’s question: (1) Myodil and Pantopaque imaging dyes were available in Australia from at least the early 1960s until the late 1980s. They were thus available before the introduction of Commonwealth regulation of medicines and therapeutic products in 1970. At the time of their use, they were the best method available to help diagnose serious spinal conditions, including disc diseases and tumours. No other form of contrast dye was available for myelography until the late 1970s. In the late 1970s, the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s predecessor, the Therapeutic Goods Branch of the then Department of Health, evaluated an application to register Pantopaque, for general marketing in Australia. This application was approved in October 1979. (2) Myodil and Pantopaque were removed from the market in the late 1980s by their sponsors due to a lack of demand, as newer diagnostic techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computerised Topography (CT) scans, became available. (3) Like many drugs, iophendylate contains a benzene unit within its chemical structure, but does not contain the compound benzene itself. It does contain 30.5% of organically bound iodine, but this, again, is part of the molecule itself and free iodine is unlikely to be released. There is no evidence that Myodil contains hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or potassium permanganate. However, some of these chemicals may have been used during the manufacture of iophendylate. (4) (a) Yes, benzene is a known carcinogen; (b) potassium permanganate is harmful if swallowed; and (c) the Department can locate no scientific evidence indicating that incorrect use of iodine can lead to Parkinson’s disease. (5) No. At the time these dyes were first used, there was no Commonwealth regulation of therapeutic goods. Subsequently, regulation focussed on supply was introduced. As with any other product available on the market, the Commonwealth would not keep or have access to details of use in individual patients. (6) No, but these products could only be given on the prescription of a doctor. The prescribing information for health professionals for Myodil from the early 1970s, and for Pantopaque when it was granted marketing approval, stated that the product should be removed after the myelographic procedure, and warned about the possibility of arachnoiditis and other adverse effects. Information on possible adverse effects was also documented in the scientific literature. (7) It is not known how many sufferers of Adhesive Arachnoiditis are in Australia or what proportion of these had been treated with iophendylate prior to the development of this condition. However, it has variously been reported in the published scientific papers that clinically significant Arachnoiditis occurs in around 1% of patients who have undergone myelography with such dyes. (8) The Department is not aware of a known cure or treatment for Adhesive Arachnoiditis. (9) The Department is not aware of any Australian studies into the number of sufferers of Adhesive Arachnoiditis. (10) The Department of Health and Ageing has not sponsored research into the after effects of the use of Myodil. I cannot comment on whether other Commonwealth agencies have sponsored such research.",269,Questions On Notice

(2) Has his attention been drawn to a report titled Tentacles of Terror: Al Qaeda’s Southeast Asian Network, by Dr Zachary Abuza, extracted from a forthcoming book, Terrorism and Radical Islam in Southeast Asia, which claims that Jamal Mohamed Khalifa established other front companies for Al Qaeda/Jemaah Islamiah (JI), including: Khalifa Trading Industries, ET Dizon Travel, Pyramid Trading, Manpower Services and Daw al Iman al Shafee Inc. (3) Does the Australian Government share the view of Dr Abuza, and other analysts, that all of these organisations had the real purpose of supporting Al Qaeda/JI terrorist activities in South-East Asia. (4) Is he able to confirm whether Al Qaeda operative Wali Khan Amin Shah established a shell company, the Bermuda Trading Company, in Malaysia and that Al Qaeda’s chief representative in Malaysia, Ahmad Fauzi, aka Abdul al Hakim, established companies such as: Green Laboratory Medicine SDN BHD, In focus Technology SDN BHD, Secure Valley SDN BHD and Konsojaya SDN BHD, in that country for the purpose of supporting Al Qaeda/JI activities.

Foreign Affairs: Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (Question No. 1701) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 March 2003: (1) Can he provide details of the occasions since March 1996 when he has described the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a threat to Australia’s security. (2) Can he provide details of the Governments assessment of: (a) the number of (i) nuclear weapons warheads, (ii) chemical weapons warheads and (iii) biological weapons warheads, and (b) the number of missiles including: (i) the type, and (ii) their range, in the DPRK’s possession. (1) I have on many occasions referred to the DPRK as a threat to Australia’s security. Recent instances include: on 10 March 2003 I wrote in the International Herald Tribune, ‘… any move by the North to reprocess its spent reactor fuel rods to extract plutonium’, or ‘… launching a long-range ballistic missile…’ ‘… would destabilise the region and have global ramifications.’ on 2 March 2003, on Channel 10’s Meet the PressI said ‘(Iraq and DPRK)…are both very substantial threats to international security and that includes Australia.’ on 28 February 2003, in an interview with Tricia Duffield on radio 2SM, I said the DPRK ‘is quite a threat.’ on 27 February 2003, in a doorstop interview, I said ‘if North Korea is going to continue to develop its nuclear program and… missile systems… that’s a major security threat to the AsiaPacific Region as well as the world beyond.’ on 12 February 2003 during Question Time in the House of Representatives, I said ‘We do see it (the DPRK) as a serious threat to regional security.’ on 3 January 2003, in The AgeI wrote ‘The ramifications of an overt and expanding nuclear weapons program in North Korea would be disastrous for the Asia-Pacific region and beyond … The region would be destabilised and global resources would be diverted.’ on 11 March 2003, the Joint Ministerial Statement of the Sixth Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum ‘expressed serious concern at the threat to regional and global security posed by the DPRK’s nuclear program.’ (2) (a) (i) While it is difficult to be certain that North Korea actually has nuclear weapons the Government’s assessment is that it could have enough weapons-grade fissile material for one or two, or possibly three nuclear weapons; (ii) & (iii) North Korea is thought to be developing or already has chemical and biological weapons but there is no detailed information available on actual DPRK holdings of these weapons. (b) North Korea is thought to have large numbers of Scud and No-Dong missiles. The Scuds have estimated ranges of 300-500 kms, while the No-Dong has a range of 1300 kms. North Korea also continues to develop an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Taepo Dong-2. The range of the Taepo Dong-2 would depend on configuration and payload but could go as high as 15,000 kms. Operational deployment of the Taepo Dong-2 is probably still some years away. Iraq (Question No. 1703) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: (1) Can he advise whether AusAID has had any contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or other UN bodies on the matter of Iraqi refugees arising from a potential conflict with Iraq; if so, what are the details (dates, time, locations, and with whom) of those dealings.",281,Questions On Notice

These meetings were held primarily in Geneva, New York and Canberra. AusAID contact with these organisations was primarily the provision of general briefing information of a regional and country specific nature, organisation preparedness planning and the potential mobilisation of Australian aid personnel to post-war Iraq. Health and Ageing: Nursing Homes (Question No. 1704) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: (1) Has he engaged in consultations with Baptist Community Care concerning the proposed closure of the Church Nursing Home in Blyth Street, Brunswick, and has he engaged in consultations with anyone else regarding this issue; if so, with whom. (2) Did the Commonwealth provide capital assistance for the Church Nursing Home before, during, or after its construction in 1995; if so, (a) what was the value of that capital assistance, (b) were there any conditions attached to the provisions of that assistance and (c) will the Commonwealth be seeking a refund of any or all of that capital assistance. (3) Does the Government have any policy to ensure that capital assistance for nursing homes is not wasted; for example, if a nursing home constructed with Commonwealth funds were proposed to be demolished after 30 days is there any action the Commonwealth could take to prevent this. (4) Does the Government have any policy concerning the re-allocation of bed licences; for example, if a body which has an allocation of bed licences sought to transfer those licences to a facility in an area of lesser need, would the Government allow this; if so, in what circumstances. (5) Has he received representations from the Member for Gippsland concerning Baptist Community Care nursing home facilities; if so, what action did he take following those representations. (1) No. (2) Yes; the Commonwealth provided a capital grant to the Church Nursing Home in June 1994; (a) $891,000, (b) yes, (c) the Grant Agreement provides that the Organisation shall not at any time, demolish or sell or otherwise dispose of or mortgage or encumber any part of the approved home or any part of the land on which the approved home is situated, without the approval in writing of the Secretary. The Secretary may, in giving approval, impose such conditions as the Secretary sees fit. In making a decision on whether to make repayment of part or the entire grant a condition of the Secretary’s approval of sale, all relevant circumstances surrounding the sale will be considered. (3) Yes.",288,Questions On Notice
313,Mr Downer,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,289,Questions On Notice
314,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) The allocation of aged care places is governed by the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act), which contains provisions relating to the transfer of aged care places from one provider to another and the variation of conditions of allocation of places, e.g. from one locality to another. If a provider wishes to vary the location at which aged care places are available, the provider must apply to the Department of Health and Ageing for approval to do so. Each application is considered in accordance with criteria specified in the Act and in the Allocations Principles 1997. For variations of the conditions of allocation, in deciding whether the variation is justified in the circumstances, the Department must consider whether the variation would meet the objectives of the aged care planning process specified in the Act. (5) Yes; representations have been received from both the Member for Gippsland and the Member for Macmillan. The Members were advised that if the Approved Provider wished to seek capital funding it would need to apply to the Department of Health and Ageing through the annual Aged Care Approvals Round.

315,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honImmigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1708) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2003: In respect of each death of an asylum seeker in detention in International Organization for Migration (IOM) administered camps established with Australian funding in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, or in a hospital or other place to which they were removed from an IOM camp; (a) what investigations have been undertaken, (b) what was the cause of the death and (c) how was the cause of death established. There has only been one death of an asylum seeker in the International Organization for Migration (IOM) managed offshore processing centres since these centres were established in late 2001. Media reports claimed that an Iraqi asylum seeker had died on Nauru in March after a period of isolation from other residents. These reports were unfounded. In respect of the only death on Nauru: (a) The Nauru Coroner ordered that an autopsy be conducted to determine the cause of death. The autopsy was conducted on Nauru by the Head of the Division of Pathology, Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. (b) and (c) Despite an extensive post mortem examination, which included microscopic and toxicological analysis, the pathologist was unable to determine the precise cause of death in this case. The pathologist’s report, however, found that there was nothing to indicate death was due to anything other than natural causes. The Nauru Coroner found that the death was as a result of natural causes. Member for Macarthur: Newsletter Allowance (Question No. 1712) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 20 March 2003: (1) Is the Minister aware of reports in the Macarthur Advertiser on 12 February 2003, stating that Mr Pat Farmer, MP, repaid almost $700 last week after breaching government guidelines relating to the use of his taxpayer-funded newsletter.

317,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the hon2002. (a) 5 February 2003. (b) The payment was in the form of a personal cheque from Mr Farmer. (4) Mr Farmer made a voluntary contribution of $668 based on his assessment of the proportion of allegedly party political material (7%) that was contained in the newsletter – as has occurred on previous occasions with Labor Party and Senators and Members. Rural and Regional Australia: Flood Mitigation Program (Question No. 1718) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: (1) Further to the answers to question No. 1176 (Hansard, 4 February 2003, page 168) and question No. 1376 (Hansard, 18 March 2003, page 12646) why has Parramatta City Council received funding of $950,000 pursuant to the Governments Regional Flood Mitigation Program (RFMP), considering only three houses have been earmarked for voluntary purchase in the Wentworthville area. (2) Is the Government aware that the Fairfield City Council has identified 330 houses that require raising. (3) Is the Government aware that the Fairfield City Council has identified 93 houses for voluntary purchase, of which 73 have been purchased and will the Government make enquiries about the purchase of the remaining 20. (4) Has the Government received requests from the Fairfield City Council for flood mitigation funding since 2000; if so, how many and what was the Governments response to each request. (5) Is the Government willing to reassess the costs of flooding in metropolitan areas; if so, will the Government attempt to re-establish a metropolitan flood mitigation scheme; if not, why not. (1) I am advised that Parramatta City Council is one of several NSW local councils to share in a statewide voluntary purchase allocation of $950,000 in Federal Government funds in 2002-2003. This funding is not for the sole benefit of Parramatta City Council, and the final amount to be allocated to the Council is yet to be finalised by the NSW State Government. (2) and (3) While the Federal Government does not have an in-depth knowledge of the current status of Fairfield City Council’s house raising and voluntary purchase projects, it is aware of the overall magnitude of the flood problem facing Council. Flood mitigation, however, is essentially a State Government responsibility and the priority to be given to the purchase of the remaining 20 houses in Fairfield is a matter for Council to address with the NSW State Government. (4) I am advised that Fairfield City Council has not submitted any formal expressions of interest or applications for funding under the RFMP. (5) The Federal Government has no plans to re-establish a metropolitan flood mitigation scheme. Flood mitigation is essentially a State Government responsibility and metropolitan areas have a significantly greater capacity to pay for local measures from their rates base. Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 1721) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 2003:",291,Questions On Notice

(1) Under s198A of the Migration Act the people in question are offshore entry persons who entered Australia at Christmas Island, an excised offshore place after the excision time for that place and became unlawful non-citizens because of their entry. As Offshore Entry Persons they were transferred to Nauru as they had declined the Afghan reintegration package or were waiting for removal to their country of origin. Nauru was declared on 2 October 2001 under the requirements of s198A (3) of the Act. (2) (a) The three detainees arrived on separate boats at various locations. The first detainee arrived at Christmas Island on 30 October 2001, the second detainee arrived 14 November 2001 and the third on 28 May 2002. (b) Two claim to be Afghan nationals and the other claims to be a Bangladeshi national. (c) The three detainees arrived in Nauru on Wednesday 19 March 2003 and entered the Topside Offshore Processing Centre. (d) At the time of transfer to Nauru the two Afghan nationals had received Refugee Status Determination (RSD) both at primary and review stages and had been determined not to be refugees. The Bangladeshi national did not prima facie engage protection obligations. The RSD is a system developed for processing unauthorised arrivals seeking protection who are on an excised offshore place or in a declared country. The RSD is modelled on the refugee assessment processes of the UNHCR.

(b) No. The post-conflict humanitarian relief and reconstruction of Iraq is an undertaking for the international community as a whole, and the clearance of the explosive remnants of war will form part of that undertaking. Immigration: Detention Centres (Question No. 1742) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 957 (Hansard, 11 November 2002, page 8755) has he considered implementing a nation-wide protocol for all immigration detention centres in relation to the request for sanitary products and their distribution to female detainees. (2) Will he consider expanding the conditions relating to the provision of sanitary products to female detainees as in the Baxter detention centre, to all other detention centres. (1) Under the Immigration Detention Standards, Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) is required to operate in a manner that preserves the dignity and privacy of all detainees including females. Request and distribution arrangements for sanitary products are therefore established to ensure that female detainees can be provided with their sanitary products in the most discreet manner possible. Each Immigration Detention Facility has individual arrangements in place for the distribution of sanitary products to female immigration detainees. These arrangements are tailored to meet the needs of female detainees at each centre and the arrangements take into account the physical layout (infrastructure) of each centre, the composition of ACM staff (availability of female ACM officers) and the profile of the detainee population. It is for this reason that implementing a nation-wide protocol for all immigration detention centres in relation to the request for sanitary products and their distribution to female detainees would likely prove difficult. (2) The conditions relating to the provision of sanitary products to female detainees in the Baxter detention centre when compared to all other detention centres, are similar.",295,Questions On Notice
324,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:In some of the other centres (see below), such as Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, and the Maribyrnong and Perth Immigration Detention Centres, there are no restrictions on the supply of sanitary products or on the number of requests. Any differences between the arrangements operating at each centre are due to the physical layout (infrastructure) of each centre, the composition of ACM staff (availability of female ACM officers) and the profile of the detainee population. It is for these reasons that expanding the conditions relating to the provision of sanitary products to female detainees in the Baxter detention centre, to all other centres, may not be practicable. The individual arrangements operating at each centre are as follows: Baxter Immigration Detention Facility Upon verbal request to a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member all female detainees are provided with sanitary napkins from a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member. ACM has advised that tampons are provided on request. However, tampons are not generally a popular product among the female detainee population. Female detainees are given a three months supply of sanitary products at the time of each request. They may seek further supplies when they foresee that their three months supply will run out. Sanitary products may be obtained from the nurse who is located at the nurses’ station in their compound. Sanitary products are supplied in discreet bags. Perth Immigration Detention Centre Various sanitary products are available to all female detainees. There is no restriction on the supply of sanitary products. There is no restriction on the number of requests. Sanitary products are supplied by the nurse. ACM officers are not involved. Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Female detainees are able to access sanitary products by requesting the products from ACM Welfare Officers. Sanitary pads are supplied by ACM to female detainees, or they may purchase tampons from the shop if they wish. Once a request has been made, a female detainee is provided with one packet of sanitary pads. Detainees may submit requests as often as necessary. Female detainees submit a request to an ACM Welfare Officer in order to obtain sanitary pads. Female detainees can collect sanitary pads from the ACM Welfare Officer on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Sanitary products are available in each compound from the ACM administration office block which houses provisions for the detainees. There is always at least one female ACM officer on duty. There is no limit placed on the number of pads or tampons available for distribution. Female detainees may request sanitary products as often as necessary. Female detainees may request sanitary products from a female ACM officer in the compound, as there is always at least one female officer on duty. Sanitary products are issued in packages that are discreetly wrapped. Woomera Residential Housing Project Women go to the main office at the RHP and request pads. Pads are freely issued by the women detention officers. Products are issued discreetly. Sanitary napkins are provided as tampons are not popular with the female detainees. Women are provided with an unopened pack of pads when requested. Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre Sanitary products are stored at the ACM officer post in Charlie block dormitory. A small supply of sanitary products is also stored in the medical clinic. Upon request to a female ACM officer or female nursing staff member, a female detainee is provided with sufficient products to last five to six days. Most requests are for sanitary napkins, not tampons. There is no restriction on the number of requests made. Female detainees may either speak to medical staff, or to an ACM female officer, or they may request the products in writing. Either medical staff or female ACM officers provide the sanitary products to the detainees. Villawood Immigration Detention Centre As the majority of female detainees are housed in LIMA compound, which is fully staffed by ACM female officers, sanitary products are stored in the compound. Sanitary pads are issued five or six at a time (the female detainees have indicated that this is their preference), while tampons are provided in sealed packs of ten. Sanitary products are provided when required and on request. Female detainees, including those in the general compound, verbally request sanitary products from a female ACM LIMA compound staff officer. Pads are issued in discreet bags, while the tampon packs are small enough to be placed in a pocket or small bag. Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre Sanitary products are available from the ACM female dormitory officer. There is no restriction on the supply of sanitary products. There is no restriction on the number of requests. Female detainees can request sanitary products from the ACM female dormitory officer. Sanitary products are delivered to the detainees by hand. Products are also available in the kitchen. Curtin Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (now closed) Sanitary napkins were supplied upon request. Tampons were not popular with the female detainees. Supply was consistent with detainees’ monthly requirements, with a slight oversupply rather than undersupply of the products to the detainees occurring as a general rule, in order to ensure detainees’ needs were fully met. When required or anticipated to be required. Female detainees would attend the welfare area where products were dispensed through the assistance of a female detainee who assisted ACM staff in the area. Supplies were delivered in discreet bags.

(1) The vote was by secret ballot.",305,Questions On Notice
328,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) There is a well-established principle of accepting by consensus any uncontested candidate from a regional group for a position to be held by that group. The government considers the voting on such positions risks politicising CHR and reducing its effectiveness in addressing human rights concerns. (3) Australia’s deep concern about the human rights situation in Libya is well known. The government takes the view that constructive engagement in the international human rights framework by any country can have a positive effect on its human rights situation.

330,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer tomurdie, Maddington, Maida Vale, Martin, Middle Swan, Midland, Midvale, Orange Grove, South Guildford, Thornlie, Viveash, Walliston, Wattle Grove, West Swan and Woodbridge. (2) In respect of each suburb which is currently unable to access Telstra’s Internet broadband technology, is the Minister able to; (a) confirm whether or not this is due to existing pair gaining technology; if not, what is the reason for lack of access, and (b) say when they will be able to access Telstra’s Internet ADSL broadband technology; if not, why not. (3) Which exchanges within the electoral division of Hasluck are: (a) ADSL broadband enabled, and (b) not ADSL broadband enabled. (4) How close to an ADSL enabled exchange must a customer be located to guarantee them access to ADSL broadband. (5) Are there any other factors which affect ADSL broadband access other than excessive distance to an ADSL enabled exchange. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question, based on advice provided by Telstra: (1) There are 17 exchanges, wholly or partly, within the electoral division of Hasluck and all of these exchanges are ADSL enabled. Therefore all of the suburbs identified in the question have access to ADSL. However, due to the impact of certain access line electronics and distance limit factors, access to ADSL is limited to approximately 86% of people with a telephone service within the Hasluck electorate. (2) (a) As noted in the answer to part (1) above, approximately 14% of people within the Hasluck electorate are unable to access ADSL, due mainly to certain access line electronics and distance limit factors. (b) The access line electronics issue and distance factors mean that ADSL will never reach 100% of premises. Nevertheless, areas of high aggregate demand for broadband within the existing ADSL footprint may be retrofitted at some time in the future where this is considered economically viable. In this context, Telstra is currently developing an online Broadband Demand Register to assist in assessing broadband demand in particular areas. Generally speaking, for customers unable to access ADSL, the current alternatives are: satellite (available everywhere); ISDN (available at virtually all urban exchanges); and cable (which passes approximately one third of living units in Australia) While households in the Hasluck electorate do not have access to cable infrastructure, the other two alternatives are available. (3) There are 17 exchanges, wholly or partly, within the electoral division of Hasluck, of which all are already ADSL enabled. The Huntingdale exchange, adjacent to Hasluck, is planned to be enabled by the end of June 2003. (4) A customer must be located within approximately 3.5 kms from their exchange in order to access ADSL. This approximate distance limit is driven by technical standards, and is determined in each case by the electrical attenuation of the copper telephone line. Each customer’s line is checked for its capability to be provided with ADSL, before Telstra proceed with ADSL service provision. (5) Apart from the exchange not being enabled, the main reasons for customers being unable to access ADSL are: excessive distance from the exchange, and the presence of certain access line electronics. There are also three further conditions that can infrequently occur, and will also prevent ADSL:",307,Questions On Notice

(c) The ABC has advised that the feasibility of the proposal has to be assessed by the ABC and its Board, and would follow a Public Works Committee process. (d) Environment and heritage would be amongst those factors to be considered by the ABC. The ABC may need to consider the possible requirement to refer the relocation from the Gordon Street site to the Australian Heritage Commission for comment under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, as Rippon Lea and its gardens are entered in the Register of the National Estate. The ABC may also need to consider a referral to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

This reintegration package, which provides for AUD 2,000 per person and up to a maximum of AUD 10,000 per family, is designed to assist individuals and families to re-establish their lives in Iran. Officers of my Department will counsel detainees on the terms of the package.

Human Rights: Violations (Question No. 1786) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 27 March 2003: (1) Further to his reply to question No. 1148 (Hansard, 12 December 2002, page 10631), is he aware of any allegations of human rights violations and property crime committed by Turkey against Australians of Cypriot origin. (2) Will the Government provide any financial assistance to Australians of Cypriot origin in order for them to commence legal action against Turkey in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR); if so, what will that assistance be; if not, why not. (3) Will the Government support or sponsor the establishment of an Eminent Persons Group on Cyprus under the auspices of the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM); if so, is he able to say whom he will recommend for that group; if not, why not. (4) Will the Government condemn Turkey for failing to comply with the ECHR judgement in both Loizidou vs. Turkey and Cyprus vs. Turkey; if so, when; if not, why not. (5) What diplomatic pressure will the Government apply to persuade Turkey to comply with the judgements of the ECHR. (1) I am aware that a number of dual Australian/Cypriot nationals have sought to take action against Turkey in the European Court of Human Rights over the denial of their property rights in northern Cyprus. (2) Financial assistance under the Special Circumstances (Overseas) Scheme (which is the only scheme of possible relevance in this matter) is provided in only the most exceptional cases. Financial assistance may be authorised under that Scheme where there is a “moral obligation” on the part of the Commonwealth to provide assistance, or there are “compassionate grounds” for the Commonwealth to provide assistance. Assistance is usually provided only in relation to those matters where the Commonwealth has a direct involvement in the matter and the liberty of the person involved is at stake. It is unlikely that this necessary element of ‘moral obligation’ or ‘compassionate grounds’ could be derived from private civil proceedings undertaken in a foreign country against a foreign government, on the basis of a foreign citizenship.

(3) The Commonwealth has supported the resolution of the situation in Cyprus through encouragement of the multilateral mechanisms of the United Nations and through bilateral channels, rather than a parallel process of mediation. In the absence of any initiative by Cyprus, as the country most concerned, or by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, to establish an ‘eminent persons group’ on Cyprus under the auspices of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), Australia has not sponsored or supported the establishment of such a group. (4) Australia is not a Party to the European Convention on Human Rights which established the European Court of Human Rights. It would therefore not be appropriate for Australia to comment on Turkey’s compliance with the Court’s judgements in Loizidou vs. Turkey and Cyprus vs. Turkey. (5) Australia is not a Party to the European Convention on Human Rights which established the European Court of Human Rights. It would therefore not be appropriate for Australia to bring influence to bear on Turkey regarding its compliance with the Court’s judgements.

(2) Is the Minister able to say what evidence is required by the PBAC to enable a recommendation for PBS listing of Modafinil to be made; if so, what is the nature of that evidence; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Applications made by sponsors to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) are commercial-in-confidence. As such, the Department is not in a position to provide these details. (2) An application to the PBAC for listing a medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is required to include evidence relating to the medicine’s clinical effectiveness, safety and costeffectiveness compared with other treatments listed on the PBS.

337,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(1) There is no set policy, but translations of Prime Ministerial and Ministerial statements are undertaken when there are compelling reasons on national and community interest grounds for broader community awareness of the content of such statements. (2) The decision to translate the speech into Arabic reflected the fact that Iraq is an Arabic speaking country and many community groups with an interest in the Iraq issue are Arabic speakers. The translation into Indonesian reflected the fact that Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population and is one of Australia’s nearest neighbours. The action to arrange translation was initiated by my office. (3) The Translation was arranged by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The cost of translation was approximately $176.

(2) Has the Australian government had a less supportive attitude to the Kurds than the British and the Americans; if so, why. (3) Does the Government consider recognition of Kurdish authorities within the boundaries of Iraq to be equivalent to Australia supporting the creation of an independent Kurdish state; if so, why. (4) Is the Australian government seeking to liberate the Iraqis, including the Iraqi Kurds; if so, why has it refused to meet or talk to them since 1993. (5) When will he or his officials enter into discussions about the reconstruction of Iraq with the two Kurdish governments, whose freedom of speech, economic progress and relative freedom, he has been citing in the House. (6) Was the US represented by Mr Ambassador Khalilzad at a meeting of all Iraqi exile groups in Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdish area of Iraq in February 2003. (7) Did the Australian government seek or receive Mr Khalilzad’s report on plans for a future democratic federal Iraq, if so, do these plans include an autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan. (1) It is not usually our practice to comment on the policy approach of other governments. Australia supports the cultural and political aspirations of ethnic groups in Iraq being met within existing territorial boundaries, and peacefully. Australia also supports genuine political representation and non-discriminatory policies for ethnic groups in Iraq.

For reasons relating to the territorial integrity of UN member states, Australia does not support the creation of an independent Kurdish state unless it is agreed to by all other states whose territorial integrity would be affected by the creation of such a state. Australia considers the Kurds to be minorities in the countries in which they live and believes that their cultural and political aspirations should be met by working within existing territorial boundaries. The Australian Government stresses the importance of fully respecting international human rights norms in the treatment of Kurdish minorities. (4) The Government’s key objective remains to disarm Iraq of its Weapons of Mass Destruction.
