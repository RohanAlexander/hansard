The form of the Labor Party is such that spokesman was talking about the impact of a that policy of taxing assets pre-1985 was, by GST on pharmacists.

Its decision to approve the Jabiluka uranium mine places the world heritage listing of the park under extreme pressure and endangers its natural and cultural heritage. The government's determination to push ahead with the construction phase of the mine even though the UN has not ruled out listing Kakadu on the endangered heritage list is despicable. Senator Hill and the government are flouting the UN's ruling, and Australia has a lot of work to do if it is to counter the UN-sponsored report that slams the government's approval of the mine. The government's environmental record is extremely poor. It has approved the development of Hinchinbrook and now, Kakadu. One of the most beautiful environmental areas in this country, Kakadu is now under threat. It is extremely sensitive. All that the mine will do is jeopardise a wonderful area. Senator Hill has said he is concerned that it could be listed. I am most concerned that it will not be listed. It is a blatant disregard for the Mirrar people, the traditional owners of the land, and for their culture, which is also very vulnerable and under threat from a mine of this type. As I have mentioned, the environment is extremely special and something that we, as Australians, should move to protect. The jobs that are provided by the mine are short term and do not outweigh the long-term jobs that the protection and preservation of Kakadu will provide-nor will it outweigh destroying an area of such beauty. I would like to mention three wonderful women from the Hunter region. Two live within the Shortland electorate, and they are all grandmothers: Mrs Jean Talbot, who is 61; Marion Armstrong, who is 64; and Dianna Mannigel of Eleebana. They were arrested and charged with trespassing in the uranium mine in Kakadu during a non-violent protest. They made a conscious decision to take this action as a symbolic gesture of support for the Mirrar people over the Kakadu mine. They wanted to preserve the area for their children and for future generations. I would like to congratulate them on their action and stand with them in saying that we should preserve this wonderful area. It is part of our environmental and cultural heritage that should be preserved for future generations. Private Health Insurance: Opposition's Attitude sick to death of the Labor opposition performing their constant daily mantra of opposition for opposition's sake. In fact, their continued opposition to the government's agenda, which was endorsed at the 3 October election-in particular, I mention the private health insurance rebate initiative-means that the people in my electorate will suffer as a result of the Australian Labor Party, and suffer even more than they did during the 13 years of the horrendous HawkeKeating era.",168,Bills Returned From The Been Presented On 10 December 1998 Senate Civil Aviation Act Civil Aviation Regulations

People who have private health insurance currently may in fact drop it as a result of the private health insurance rebate being opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and there will also be people who will sacrifice other things to maintain private health insurance because it is so important to them. The simple fact of the matter is that, with fewer people in the pool contributing towards private health insurance, we are going to find those who are maintaining private health insurance paying more and more. Each and every one of those people should feel a real hurt, a real sense of frustration and, in fact, a great deal of anger towards the Australian Labor Party, which is being deliberately obstructive of the government's agenda and is doing so for purely political reasons. If what the government has proposed on private health insurance and tax reform is so bad, I challenge all members opposite to pass the bill. If they are so confident that we are so wrong and they are so right, they should be able to earn a great deal of support at the next federal election by purely pointing to our performance. But of course those opposite realise that the government's private health insurance rebate initiative and tax reform proposals are so good for Australia and for all Australians that they are absolutely terrified about these initiatives getting up and seeing the light of day. They know it will prove those opposite to be the liars and the charlatans that they were during the most recent election campaign. Those opposite are capable of perpetuating those liescasting aspersions on members of this side of the House in terms of the word liar.

(Time expired) Brisbane Airport Corporation Airport Corporation. The Brisbane Airport Corporation is a matter of great concern to the residents of the south side of Brisbane. In the next three months, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, will be making a determination on the acceptability or otherwise of a parallel runway proposal put to the minister by the Brisbane Airport Corporation. This is despite having received some 4,000 written objections from the local community and some 10,000 local residents having signed a petition against the runway.

448,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (9.46 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on the. question of the BrisbaneThursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1969 preference for a parallel runway. His enunciation to me of the logic was that he had received a consultancy report from Airservices Australia which indicated that, in terms of runway capacity analysis, only a western parallel runway could achieve the future throughput requirements of the airport. I then asked the chief executive of the Brisbane Airport Corporation to provide me with a copy of that report. He said he would. Two weeks later, he reneged on that undertaking to me. Why is that so? What has the Brisbane Airport Corporation got to hide? I have confirmed today that Airservices Australia did provide this consultancy report to the Brisbane Airport Corporation. The critical issue is that when the previous transport minister, Mr Vaile, rejected the first version of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan, he did so explicitly on the basis of Airservices Australia's incapacity at a technical level to verify the ANEF maps-noise maps-produced as part of that master plan report. What we now discover is that the same organisation, Airservices Australia, is providing a private consultancy service to the Brisbane Airport Corporation. This represents a fundamental conflict of interest. How can we have a regulator on the one hand providing a for-profit commercial consultancy on the other? Specifically, we have the regulator, Airservices Australia, about to provide advice to the transport minister on whether the new ANEF maps provided by the Brisbane Airport Corporation are technically valid-the same Airservices Australia that has already provided a for-profit consultancy service to the Brisbane Airport Corporation. This is a conflict of interest writ large, and I believe it represents a fundamental breach of process in terms of that specified under the Airports Act. I call on the minister for transport to provide an explanation as to how his agency, for which he is ultimately responsible, could discharge a for-profit operation with the BAC, yet simultaneously expect that organisation to discharge an independent regulatory function. It is not sustainable. Private Health Insurance: Rebate words in support of the government's Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998. Firstly, over 42,000 people in my electorate of Makin, or 56 per cent, are currently privately insured. Many more have said to me that they would take out private health insurance if there was a reasonable incentive for them to do so. These are not wealthy people wanting subsidised tennis racquets, as the opposition has been wont to portray them. These are people who want choice when they have to go to hospital, who want choice in who treats them and who want choice when it comes to ancillary items such as dental and optical care. It is not good enough to say that these people are not entitled to a choice, that they should use the public health system whether they like it or not. My constituents of Makin have every right to expect that they should have the power to choose the best health care available in this country. That is what this government's Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 seeks to provide--choice for families in electorates such as Makin. As I said earlier, over 42,000 people in my electorate of Makin are privately insured. In 1984, shortly after the coalition left office, 50 per cent of the population had private health cover. Today that figure is at just 30.6 per cent. To oppose this new measure by the government is to consign the private health insurance sector to continued decline and, even more alarmingly, to increase the burden on our public hospital system.",170,Representatives Main Committee

Government Mandate address-in-reply, my response to the employee relations bill, my response to the Private Health Insurance Incentives BiII 1998 and, most probably, because of the way things are going in the chamber, my response to the GST legislation. I do not think I have much chance of achieving all that in the time that I have, but I will endeavour to do my best. times! Firstly, on the question of the address-in-reply, what the government has done on this occasion in referring it to the Main Committee and then gagging it is to create a very poor precedent in terms of the operation of this parliament in terms of past experience, because it is not something that has been done previously by a government. When we look at t\1e question of debate and the sorts of commitments that the Howard government has had to the question of better parliamentary procedures, it makes a joke, a mockery, of that sort of commitment and shows that there is not really a commitment there at all. The issue that has been one of major debate since the election campaign I would define as mandate politics. The argument-and you often hear it from the other side-is, 'We won the election. Bad luck, you lost.' That is fair enough-and believe me when I assure you that it hurts-but let me also say that this is the fifth election since the Second World War where in fact the party which has attracted the majority of the popular vote, after preferences, has been defeated. It happened in 1954, 1961 and 1969 to the Labor Party; it happened in 1990 to Andrew Peacock, when he was leader of the Liberal Party; and now it has happened to us. Not only has it happened on this occasion, but members should note that this election was in fact the time when the largest vote against the government that actually won was receivedjust over 51 per cent. Previously it has been 50.1 per cent and 50.6 per cent but never as high as 51 per cent. That, I think, says one thing: this government has a majority, it has the right to govern-and there is no doubt about that, and I congratulate it on its victory-but it cannot claim a mandate for many of its policies. Those opposite have spoken about the private health insurance legislation. I note that the member for Bradfield mentioned the issue of the figures in my electorate in the House the other day. The member for Bradfield, as we all know, is the man who was the president of the AMA and the man who everyone thought would be a good politician. make a good doctor. The fact is that he talked about the majority in my electorate and the number of people who have private health insurance. But he forgets one clear point: this was part of the government's program at the election. This is what they went to the people with.

(Time expired) Private Health Insurance: Rebate a very simple way by reading to you a letter that I have received from Robyn Stickl en, an appeal to you and your colleagues to rethink your position. Mrs Sticklen says: 1 realise this may be too late for the vote on Private Health Insurance Rebate today, but 1 felt 1 had to let you know how we feel about the other parties trying to stop the Rebate. My husband is a Grader Driver and 1 work in an Office as a Sales/Administration Assistant and we have two teenage children and a seven-year-old. We have had private health insurance for approximately 12 years. Normally, we would not be considered to be high income workers, but due to the fact that Fred works (most weeks) 6 days a week, leaves home at 6 am and returns at 6 pm, we are now considered high income earners. So, each time this or that is 'means tested' we miss out. 1 have had a gut-full of my husband out working the hours he does and we get penalised for it. Our night out is a $20/head buffet twice a year, so we are not a rich family. Please do not take this as a sob story. I amjust trying to give you the facts. When my son was 5 years old, he developed a severe headache and constant vomiting. 1 took him to the out-patients department of the Mount Isa Hospital, and the young Doctor there examined him and told me he had a migraine. 1 had my doubts about this as he was getting weaker and the pain was worse. Next morning 1 took him to an old Scottish Doctor we had in the town at the time. She immediately diagnosed him with meningitis and we had to take him straight up to the hospital for a lungapuncture (I apologise for my spelling). By this time, he was like a limp rag. The inconsiderate treatment he received during his hospital stay from a member of the hospital staff left much to be desired. When he was released, 1 went into town the next day and joined up with a private health insurance fund. 10 years ago my Father was extremely ill. He was in the public system. He could not see the visiting specialist for a couple of months. When it was his tum to see the specialist, do you know what the diagnosis was-I am sorry, but 1 can't do anything for him. He died the next dayafter having to wait two months in the public hospital systemWhilst he was in hospital, 1 tried to check out everything he was treated with. Once1 queried the 'expired date' blood they were giving him. 1 was assured it wasn't pass the bad date and was quite okay. 1 have since learnt different. At various stages when I felt that we needed the money elsewhere and 1 thought of dropping out of the fund, 1 remember these times. Never again will 1 subject my family to the health care they received. Surely by more people joining the private health scheme, this will take the pressure off the public health system. I would appreciate you passing this on to Jenny Macklin, Meg Lees and Senator Brian Harradine. 1 will also be faxing a copy of this letter to Bob Katter as we have known him for many years and he knew my Father well. He knows we are a very average, middle income family who are just trying to give our family what we can and keep believing there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

(No.1) 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 November, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998. It is pleasing that this bill is before the House. It will result in two hand backs to indigenous groups, and I will go through and give a bit of a history of that shortly. The other aspect of the legislation is that it also corrects 'an anomaly which presently requires the Aboriginal land commissioners, who are required to be judges under the act, to retire at age 65. This bill will enable them to perform their duties of office until the age of 70, as do all Supreme Court and Federal Court judges. The opposition is quite happy, I can say to the government, to expedite passage of this bill through the Senate. This is good news on how the land rights act is working in the Northern Territory; there should be more of this. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, Mr Ruddock, in his second reading speech, points out that the act: ... provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. This amendment will bring the total to 61. It is significant that this act was brought in under the Fraser Liberal government. It was a watered-down act that derived from an act that was introduced by the then Whitlam Labor government. But credit must be given to Malcolm Fraser and his government: Aboriginal people see this as the best piece of legislation on the statute books in regards to their rights. It has resulted in substantial land being handed back. Indeed, a review into this act has been commissioned-the Reeves review-and there will be a parliamentary inquiry. As I understand it, the House of Representatives Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will be receiving a reference to have a look at the Reeves review. I can telegraph at this point that the Labor Party will be participating actively in seeking the views of indigenous people in the Territory. We will not support any amendments to the land rights act that do diminish the rights of indigenous people that occur without their consent. Sunset clauses come into operation in relation to the land rights act in the Northern Territory. I find it staggering that this government would want to water down legislation that was introduced by a former conservative government. It shows that this government is moving",173,Representatives Main Committee

I just indicate that when that review comes on the Labor Party will be actively participating and seeking the views of indigenous people. It is also significant that the indigenous people voted against statehood for the Territory at the same time as the last election: they had reservations about the Territory government. The Reeves review is one of the reasons why we have now got Warren Snowdon back in the parliament as a Labor representative for the Northern Territory. There is genuine support acrqss the parliament for the bill before the House. I think it is worthwhile putting on the record the land that is being handed back. The schedule in relation to Innesvale describes it as: All that piece of land in the Northern Territory of Australia containing an area of 283,700 hectares more or less, being Northern Territory Portion 5120 and being more particularly delineated on Survey Plans S971172(A to E) lodged with the Surveyor-General, Darwin, but excluding two roads 100 metres wide and one road 50 metres wide as delineated on Survey Plan S971172E. That is how it is described on the schedule. I am indebted to the Northern Land Council which has given me some history on the Innesvale land claim. I think it is worthwhile reading it into the record: Innesvale Pastoral Lease (PL71O) an area of about 2820 square kilometres, is approximately 150 kms south west of Katherine. Road access to the property is via the Victoria Highway. On the south the station is bounded by Gregory National Park and Coolibah Crown Lease. The eastern and western boundaries abut several pastoral leases including Bradshaw, Wombungi, Willeroo, West Mathison and Scott Creek. Adjacent country on its northern boundary includes Dorisvale Pastoral Lease and the area of the Upper Daly Land Trust. The station is located on Wardaman country, of which seven Wardaman estates are located on Innesvale. Wardaman people are acutely aware of their history since White people first came to this region. Older claimants have had first-hand experience of the frequently harsh and punitive conditions on cattle stations in the area and there is a strong oral tradition'relating to the often violent early frontier period which saw many Aboriginal people from this area killed, including close relations and immediate forebears. Despite this ""recent harsh history, the claimants have maintained strong traditional attachment to the area they are claiming. There is detailed knowledge of sites on Innesvale station, of the Drearnings and mythologies associated with them, and of the rights and responsibilities to the different area of Innesvale for which each descendent group has responsibility. Senior claimants continue to take active steps to ensure that younger claimants will themselves be in a position to pass on this knowledge to succeeding generations. They see the claim itself as providing the basis by which the younger generations will be able to maintain knowledge of, and affiliations with, at least this portion of Wardaman traditional lands. They emphasise too that they will be in a much stronger position to transmit knowledge on country that is traditionally theirs than currently is possible while they live in Katherine and its associated living areas where their authority is constrained and where there are large numbers of other, non-Wardaman, people as well as many other obviously negative distractions. The claim to Innesvale station is not the first step taken by Wardaman to regain control of their traditional country. The present claimants have been active in this regard over at least the last 15 years. A portion of the Wardaman Yubulyawun estate has been successfully regained through the Upper Daly Land Claim. Claimants have also persistently campaigned for the return of other traditional lands in the Delamere Station area. Wardaman people (claimant and non-claimant) have, as well, secured a number of small excisions including those known as Wugleni, Jarrang and Dilinyang on their traditional country. Innesvale, however, represents not only the most substantial parcel of Wardaman land to be claimed but 1974 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 more importantly it is one that has a high degree of cultural coherence and is of sufficient extent to provide a focus for a large number of Wardaman people. The present claim to Innesvale station complements steps Wardaman people as a whole have already been taking through forming the Wardaman Association to care for their country and to develop programs to ensure that succeeding generations have the requisite skills and knowledge to carry this task on into the future. The Association has made good progress in developing a cattle enterprise on Innesvale which is compatible with wider social, cultural and economic goals, including maintaining the integrity of the cultural landscape. Wardaman emphasise with pride the mythological richness of their country, including the rock art sites, which (apart from representations of historical events such as the paintings of horseman at Wiynbarr) are the images and manifestations of Dreamings. The area was described as ""tribal country""-a reference to the persisting strong relationship between Law, land and people that is evident there. Innesvale station has an unsurpassed heritage, archaeologically significant rock art sites many of which have been extensively documented. The senior claimant from the Yubulyawin descent group has for several years now conducted tours round some of the more spectacular art sites on Innesvale and neighbouring stations, and the Wardaman Association and the Department of Employment, Education and Training are currently involved in training young Wardaman to work as tour guides. Should the claimants be granted title to Innesvale Station, advantage would flow directly to those approximately 200 claimants. In addition, it would provide security to another approximately 200 to 300 non-claimants-Wardaman claimants' children, their spouses as well as non-Wardaman relatives who would benefit both directly and indirectly through the grant of the station to their Wardaman claimant relatives. Innesvale station already offers a focal point for the Wardaman people in the Katherine region in its recently established opl!rations as a cattle station. All Wardaman people fully intend that this should continue. However, while some of the more spectacular art sites on Innesvale are presently protected under Commonwealth and Northern Territory heritage legislation, holding freehold title would allow them to protect and maintain the values of Innesvale as a highly significant cultural landscape for succeeding generations with security not offered by a pastoral lease. Furthermore, much of Innesvale Station is not particularly suitable for cattle, being too rugged and inaccessible for the requirements of modern animal husbandry and agricultural economics. The cattle operations essentially use only the south-eastern, less rugged portion of the station. Wardaman have expressed the desire to develop and live on outstations on other parts of Innisfail, such as on the Flora River. Being granted title to their traditional lands would therefore be of fundamental benefit to Wardaman people in the maintenance of their culture and, in particular, their traditional relationship to their lands. I repeat that I am indebted to the Northern Land Council for that information. I think it is also important, before I move on to the next land, to point out that what we are dealing with today has been done by consent. Agreement has been reached on both these properties with the Northern Territory government, under the land rights act, with the traditional owners and their respective land councils. So what we have here is consent. This is not a dispute. This has not had to go to the courts in a knockdown, drag out fight. That is the signpost for the future. I thInk that too often we politicians and lawyers get involved in the process and that really, frankly, distorts the whole relationship. That is the beauty of this. I do not have much truck with the old Northern Territory government, I must say. We talk about accountability. It is about time they were made accountable in a whole range of areas. They have been dragged kicking and screaming on the land rights act, have lost every major challenge apart from one, and wasted some $20 million trying to challenge aspects of the act. But they should be given credit when they do the right thing. In this instance, they have sat down, and they should be given credit for coming to agreement with all concerned. This shows that there are benefits flowing. It takes time to break down the barriers, to break down the Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COM MrrfEE 1975 stereotypes and to reassure people that the sky is not going to fall in. I do give credit to all those that were involved in relation to this. We are talking about a significant parcel of land283,700 hectares-and it is being done by consent. SoI do congratulate those people who have amicably settled this claim. I understand that the anthropologists working in this area were Dr Jeannie Devitt and Dr David Martin. I think that it is appropriate that they be acknowledged as well. In relation to the second parcel of land, the Urrpantyenye-I do not know that my pronunciation is all that right-covers an area of 6,554 hectares in the Northern Territory of Australia, being more or less Northern Territory portion 1084 and being more particularly delineated on survey plan S981203 lodged with the Surveyor-General at Darwin. This comes into the Central Land Council area. It is an agreement which settles the Urrpantyenye land claim and it was entered into between the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council, the Todd River Pastoral Company and the claimants. I am also indebted to the Central Land Council for some information they have passed on to me in relation to this area. I understand that it is a block of land between Allambi and Horseshoe Bend stations, east of Maryvale. It was originally included in the north-west Simpson Desert land claim No. 126, but was not recommended for grant. In October 1991, the Northern Territory government purported to grant a Crown lease perpetual over the area to the Northern Territory Land Corporation. The Urrpantyenye (repeat) land claim No. 136 was lodged in December 1991. In September 1995, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Gray, found that the grant of the crown lease perpetual was invalid under section 67 A of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 because the earlier claim, No. 126, had not been 'finally disposed of' as mentioned in that section. As I said earlier, following that finding, negotiations between the claimants-the Central Land Council, the Northern Territory government and the Todd River Pastoral Co., which is the lessee of Allambi-resulted in a settlement of the claim. All those parties deserve congratulations for corning to agreement. I cannot stress enough that these positive results that are coming through show that this act is working and that the best way to use it is to try and work through by consent. It will involve a little bit of give and take. The second reading speech of the minister shows that, when these go through, 61 separate parcels of land will have been handed back. That is a positive thing. I know that in relation to native title there are still people who want to deny the decisions in Mabo and Wik, the subsequent Native Title Act 1993 and the amended bill that went through. They want to wind back the clock. Frankly, they will be like King Canute trying to hold back the tide; they will not be successful. We are dealing here with people's property rights, people's association with land. What we have to do is to find a way through that is satisfactory to all parties concerned. There is a lot of misrepresentation in relation to the land rights act; there is a lot of misrepresentation in relation to native title. Frankly, I believe some politicians have been playing pretty low-grade politics. They have not let the facts interfere with a good story. What we have in the land rights act is the strongest piece of legislation on the statute books. It was introduced by a conservative government, and it has produced results. There were amendments: the sunset clause came in and so land claims under this act have ceased. They now just have to be processed. But European titles, titles that have been issued by government, are safe. We have a situation where Senator Lightfoot is condemning Justice Lee for his judgment in the Miriuwung Gajerrong case of a couple of weeks ago. That was always on the cards. 1976 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 Let us appreciate that, even if the Wik judgment had gone the other way by 4-3, there would still be some 300 different types of leases that have been issued over the country. In the development of this nation, as we moved from the east and headed west, in the later development from the Colonial Office, the mother country, there was more recognition that indigenous people were roaming the country and their rights at that time were acknowledged. The grazing lease that Justice Lee talked about had a reservation for continuing access by indigenous people for hunting, fishing and gathering, an acknowledgment that indigenous people were there. So even if Wik had gone 4-3 the other way because in the Wik case the High Court was dealing with a lease without reservations, there still would have been matters taken to the court in relation to other areas of land in Western Australia. When we look at the issuing of those titles, we see that there was no clear or plain intent to extinguish the native title; in the issuing of those leases there was an acknowledgment of the association with country of those indigenous people. What has happened here is that there has been a lot of misinformation. I hope that now that the lO-point plan has gone through-mostly intact, I might add-we can have a sane debate on both sides of the House. I hope that we can have the politics taken out of it. In relation to the Land Rights Act, the Labor Party is prepared to support amendments that improve the operation of the act. But we do not equate improvement with taking away indigenous people's rights. It is my v-ew that, as a result of the Miriuwung Gajerrong case and its being appealed, when it eventually goes to the High Court, that will require amendments to the Native Title Act, probably in relation to procedure. But we need to get a reality check, because I would have thought it was the conservatives who value property rights and less interference by the state in relation to property rights-and that includes indigenous property rights-instead of having the state come in and having this massive acquisition of private property rights for the rights of third parties. I think the climate is ripe and that is why this bill is one which both sides can support, because it is producing benefits for the local community, for all concerned. Non-indigenous people will benefit as well because indigenous and non-indigenous people are, in my experience, in many respects, living comfortably in outback Australia and want to get on with their lives without the interference of the lawyers and the politicians. Benefits that flow to indigenous people will also flow to non-indigenous people in terms of regional development and infrastructure development. They both benefit. If indigenous people are done over then non-indigenous people will be done over. The development of the Northern Territory and the benefits that flow to indigenous people flow right through to nonindigenous people in the Northern Territory. That is why there was a massive vote of no confidence against Shane Stone on 3 October, when his statehood went down in a screaming heap. The Reeves review, in many respects, was pioneered by the Territory government to gut the land rights act and it acted as a focal point for indigenous people and that is why my colleague the member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, is here now. That is why we are pleased to support this bill through the parliament, because of the benefits that flow from it. It is the conservatives that should take credit for it because it is a conservative government in the Territory which has reached agreement with all the parties. And it is arising from, even though it is a watered down act from that introduced by the Whitlam government, a piece of Fraser government legislation. Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1977 I will be interested to hear what the member for Page has to say. I know that in some respects we disagree but that, despite his barking and carrying on, we agree on other things; and we do agree on some things in relation to this area. As was the case with the former member for Kalgoorlie: as egocentric and eccentric as he was in some respects, some of his views-not all-had legitimacy because of the experience that he gained out in the country. That is why I benefit from the re-election of the member for the Northern Territory, my colleague Mr Snowdon, because he has worked in this area. The parliament will benefit from having people who have worked on the ground, who can contribute to the debate so that we as a parliament are not highjacked by sectional interests-particular interests that push their own !:>arrows. I look forward to the member for Page lauding this bill for the benefits that flow as a result of what is consensual agreement reached between the parties. My only advice to the Northern Territory government is that they should be doing more of this. Instead of wasting money on their lawyers, going to court and trying to undermine the land rights act, accept it and work within the framework, and goodwill will be generated and will flow from that. They are there to represent not only non-indigenous members of the Northern Territory but also indigenous members of the Northern Territory. I think, on the latest statistics, it is around 25 per cent of the Northern Territory. The Labor Party is supporting every element of this bill wholeheartedly and we will facilitate for the government speedy passage of this through the Senate. clash with my duties in relieving you at the present time, so I will not speak for too long. This piece of legislation, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998, is really the national parliament doing its duty on behalf of its territory-in this instance, the Northern Territory-and particularly, as the member for Banks said, in terms of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. This brings the number of agreements of land transferred to Aboriginal people to 61. From memory-and this is not an accurate .statistic-it brings the area of land in the Northern Territory that belongs to the Aboriginal people to something like 52 per cent of the Territory. While many· of us are well aware that most of it is pretty poor and rugged country, it is a significant amount of land that is owned by the Aboriginal people. The member for Banks probably likes to vilify the government of the Northern Territory from time to time, but there' must have been a fair amount of agreement over the years for that amount of land to have now been transferred to Aboriginal people. While the government do disagree from time to time with elements of the land councils, I think they genuinely do try to uphold the rights and the privileges of the Aboriginal people. One point that does come through, from my experience in my own area and in travelling around Australia, is that the act grants this land in fee simple, which is a freehold title to land, but there is a restriction on it that says that it cannot be sold but that it can be transferred to another Aboriginal land trust or surrendered to the Crown. Aboriginal people in my area do take some exception to the fact that, as individuals, they have very few rights in this particular area. I know that they are not in the Northern Territory but they are under a similar system. When I have been to the Northern Territory in my travels, I have spoken to individuals up there who express a similar concern. What it means is that, even though the land is handed over to a land trust, it is a communal title-it belongs to all the people in that particular area. They find that, even though there are",174,Representatives Main Commitiee

They do have some differences from time to time about the way this land is managed and how the benefits that accrue from that are then divided amongst the people who benefit from them, I suppose, if you want to put it crudely, communal title did not work in the Soviet Republic and it certainly did not work in China-both of those countries had to change their thinking in this particular area to get the maximum benefit for the people. AndI think it is something that in the future will probably come to the fore. In hearings that we had in the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, it was a matter of some disappointment that a number of stations that have been handed over to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are now destocked. Some of these stations were pretty poor stations and the viability of them certainly was questionable. But, again, it brings home to me the fact that the land, if it is going to be handed over to these people, needs to be used for their benefit. While I do not honestly believe that the land is going to sustain them fully, it certainly needs to be able to provide some of the economic benefits that should accrue. We cannot just hand over these large areas of land and still sustain the population through the taxpayer. There has to be some development of the land. I know that tourism is being developed, and that is certainly laudable, but there needs to be some help in this area to see that the benefits, or some of the value of the land, can accrue to those people who are now having the land handed over to them. The other point of the bill is very simple really because all it does is amend the retiring age for the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. The commissioner has to be a judge of the Federal Court and at the present time judges retire at 70. So this is really only bringing the legislation into line with the retiring ages of judges in the Federal Court. As I said, the role of this government in Canberra is really only to endorse the agreement that has been reached between the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This bill brings that before the parliament to ensure that it is put into legislation. I certainly support the bill. the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998 this morning for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I know the people who will benefit directly from it. BeforeI go to the detail of the legislation I should comment briefly on some of the things that were said by the member for Page. I respect the fact that he comes from northern New South Wales and people up there may have a different perception of the world, but his views about the question of the fee simple title and the inalienability of that title do need to be commented upon. One needs to go back a long way, to the Woodward royal commission, to understand the basis of this question of inalienable freehold title, and one needs to be understanding of the fact also that it is a demand which Aboriginal people who have land rights universally acclaim. I have not met one Aboriginal person in the Northern Territory-and I have spent almost 25 years there-who has asked that they be able to sell their inalienable title, not one. However, I have met a lot of Aboriginal people who want to obtain some economic benefit out of it.",179,Representatives Main Committee

I was the senior policy officer for the Central Land Council for three years. Subsequent to my losing my seat at the election in 1996 I, along with a management consultant and the Australian National Audit Office, did a review of the Central Land Council's operations. I know this act backwards; I know the way in which land rights applies in the Northern Territory and how it impacts upon the community. WhatI want to say to the member for Page is that in terms of this question of inalienability you need to understand what this is about. This is not about looking at land and land ownership through the glasses of a non-Aboriginal person, you need to look at land and land ownership in a different cultural context. You need to understand that, whilst we live in a contemporary Australian community which is subject to the constitutional laws of each state and territory, those laws, and in this particular case, this law, provide for acceptance of a view about land which is different from the view that it is simply a commodity. There has been a lot of debate during the last couple of years about the issue of native title and about its impact upon various elements and various parts of the Australian community. I have noted with interest the comments which have come out of sections of the pastoral industry about the relationship that pastoralists build up with the land over a period of time. But whilst I respect that relationship, I have to say that it is very different from the relationship that Aboriginal people have with that land. You need to understand and comprehend Aboriginal spirituality. You need to understand and comprehend what that means. It is very difficult; I do not understand it, and I do not know many non-Aboriginal Australians who do understand it. Even though we might accept that it is very difficult to comprehend and understand, I do not think that puts us in a position where we hold that our view of the world necessarily should be the one that prevails. And in this question of inalienability of land and title to land, what it means is that we have to respect the view which Aboriginal people have about that land and its importance to their being, to their soul in a contemporary -ense. Frankly, I think it behoves us as legislators to come to terms with that. I worry that there are people in this parliament who are blind to that opportunity-because it is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to learn something of great richness, an opportunity to value something of great richness, and an opportunity to understand and try to come to terms with a very different world view. PerhapsI should just make one other comment on the contribution from the honourable member for Page. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, talked about land which is being handed over and land being de-stocked. Frankly, as I think you alluded to, some of the land which has being handed over to Aboriginal people-which they have claimed, or purchased and then claimed-has been very marginal at best and, in some cases, been flogged to buggery by the previous pastoral management, to the point where it cannot sustain in ecological terms a viable pastoral industry. We have to accept that. There are good management principles for destocking much of this country and we need to comprehend why that is so. We should not also be blind to the fact that value in your eyes and my eyes may be different from value in someone else's eyes. Value in a social context, whilst you cannot put a monetary figure on it, is an important element of this process. Getting back country, getting back your being, getting back your heart is fundamental to this process. There are many pastoral leases which have been purchased in the Northern Territory and run as viable pastoral properties. 1980 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 I might just mention one in particular: Mistake Creek in the north-west of the Northern Territory, which over the last couple of years has turned off some of the best cattle in the Northern Territory. An Aboriginal owned pastoral property achieved the best prices at sales, so let us not have people believe that when this land is transferred it necessarily ought to be run as a pastoral lease or that when it is run as a pastoral lease by Aboriginal people it is not run profitably or managed well. That is not the case. That is simply not the case. I talked about the question of being, of heart. Just prior to the last election, a sunset clause came into being in terms of Aboriginal people purchasing pastoral leases and then claiming those pastoral leases under the Land Rights Act. I want to make mention of one particular lease, which came under the control of a particular non-Aboriginal family in 1948. That lease is Mount Doreen Station to the north-west of Alice Springs. It is Warlpiri country. My Warlpiri brothers and sisters see this as a very important place. There is a very significant-a very, very, very significant-sacred site on that property. It is called Pikalyi. Pikalyi is of vital importance to the maintenance of Warlpiri culture and heritage. When they sought to purchase that property, whilst it is run as a pastoral lease, their other major concern was to get back that soul and to be reunited with their being. Until we comprehend what this is about, then all the fine speeches in this parliament will come to nought. WhilstI respect the fact that in the electorate of the member Page Aboriginal people might have a different view, this is not the case in the Northern Territory. It is simply not true to make the sorts of assumptions which you have made. They are incorrect. I want to talk about these two leases. The first one, of course, that I will talk about is Urrpantyenye. Urrpantyenye is another very important place. You have seen the process that people had to go through and I know that the member for Banks went through in some detail this claim and how it was arrived at. Urrpantyenye is another very important place to Aboriginal people, just as Innesvale Station is important to Aboriginal people. Last week, I met with some of the Wardaman people, who are the traditional owners of that country at Innesvale, to understand their pride in the fact that this piece of legislation was passing through this parliament this week, that they would get back their country which would benefit hundreds of people-not one or two, not a small family, but hundreds of people. The same is true for Urrpantyenye. The member for Page also commented upon the fact that relationships must not have been too bad in the Northern Territory with the CLP and Aboriginal people because they acquired so much land. Let me tell you for the record, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that, up until the last couple of years, the Northern Territory government systematically opposed every land claim. They systematically appealed matters to do with land claims in the Federal Court and the full High Court of Australia on at least 30-plus occasions. Do you know how many times they won? Once. These were people who campaigned vigorously against Aboriginal people getting their country back. These were people who went to election after election on the issue of land rights. They did it again at this last election. It is racist. But they do not apologise for it. They try to hide behind it. They use subterfuge and subtlety in the way in which they campaign, arguing they are not being racist, but they are. The truth of it is they are. It gives me no pride to say that. It hurts. It should hurt you. It should hurt every other member of this parliament because it is a shame on this country. Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1981 In the last election, we had my opponent and predecessor going around to polling booths in the Northern Territory carrying a sign effectively saying, 'If you want a smaller land council, if you want your own land council, vote for Nick Dondas.' They campaigned around the Northern Territory on this theme. They lambasted Aboriginal communities with this theme. This was, of course, following the Reeves report. What do you think happened? I can tell you what happened-80 per cent of those people voted for me, 80 per cent of those people in the bush rejected absolutely this nonsense coming from the CLP. They try to gamer public opinion about the role of land councils in the Northern Territory-these strong organisations who have statutory responsibilities and functions to carry out the will of traditional owners of country. That is their job; that is their role. That is what they do and they do it effectively. The people who have most opposed them and fought them all the way, because they do not like this concept of land rights and of Aboriginal land ownership, have been the CLP. Thankfully, some enlightened elements of the CLP are coming to terms with the fact that this is not the way to behave. Indeed, I think one of the positive elements-if there are any--of the Northern Territory's vote on 3 October to reject absolutely the Northern Territory government's push for statehood is a recognition by the Northern Territory government and elements of the CLP that they have to come to terms with this reality. If they want to achieve statehood, as I do, for the Northern Territory, then statehood has to have the support of the whole community. It will not have the support of the whole community whilst ever the CLP campaigns in the way it has been doing, whilst ever it seeks to divide people on the basis of race. That is what it has done in the past. I want to make a couple of points about that particular thing. When we come to the position of the centenary of our Federation, we cannot in all consciousness look at ourselves and say we are truly a nation unless WI! have come to terms with our past and the reality of Aboriginal society, and unless we have had the heart and the gumption to say sorry for the things that have happened in the past which we, as a community and as a nation, have been responsible for. We have seen over the last couple of days yet another spiteful attack upon Aboriginal culture in the Northern Territory where last week the Northern Territory Minister for Education decided to can the bilingual education program. It has gone, according to him. The relationship between land and culture and language must be understood. This person does not understandor, if he does, he is turning a blind eye to it or he is making a deliberate decision to override its importance. Bilingual education is as much about cultural maintenance as it is about literacy. These are twin objectives. Educationalists will tell you the value of these twin objectives and the value of the outcomes that are achieved as a result of them. I mentioned briefly the Reeves report. I am very disappointed in the Reeves report's outcomes. In fact, it is my very strong view that the recommendations of that report are not sustainable. One of the reasons that they are not sustainable is that they try to completely rewrite the anthropology of Aboriginal Australia. The strongest critics, if you like, in many respects of the Reeves report are those professionals who understand the intrinsic importance of the anthropology involved in land rights. The report does not understand it. I know I am just about out of time, but we will have this debate next year about the Reeves report. I put it on the record now that there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the purpose of the Reeves report, the timing of the release of thfi. report, the terms of reference of the 1982 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 report, the content of the report and the recommendations of the report are political because they express a fundamental error-a fundamental misunderstanding of what the issue of land rights is about. Let me give you one example. The Reeves report proposes to get rid of the permit system. The permit system, for your information, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for the information of other members of this parliament, is so that Aboriginal people have the right, under the Land Rights Act, either to provide or not provide access to their country. It is very much like the right of any freehold owner of title. The permit system provides a mechanism for Aboriginal people to give permits to people to travel on their land. It is a very important way of securing access to their country and of ensuring that important sites and sacred places are sustained in the way in which they want them sustained-that they are not soiled or despoiled in a way which would be inappropriate. The Reeves report suggests that the permit system should go and that the access should be subject to the trespass law. Any week in any Northern Territory newspaper you will see advertisements from pastoral lessees pointing out that the trespass laws apply to their properties and that people are not welcome to pass onto them. They are prepared to advertise to prevent people accessing their country. This means that gates have been locked and that Aboriginal people have not been able to traverse those bits of land. There have been court cases about this issue. They have even denied people access in the context of land rights claims and land rights hearings. They have been denied access, through the use of the trespass law, to sacred places for the purposes of the claim. Aboriginal people have made it resoundingly clear that they want the permit system to prevail. They want to control the movement of people on and off their land. They want to ensure that they have this power. They want to ensure that sacred sites are protected and that the strength which is involved in this Land Rights Act is maintained. That is not what is being proposed by the Reeves report and it is not what is being supported by the CLP government of the Northern Territory. It is just not being proposed. This legislation we are discussing this morning is very important. This parliament, through an act passed by the Fraser government and originally drafted by the Whitlam government, has given Aboriginal people some power in this country. It recognises, as a result of the Woodward royal commission, the importance of land and land matters to Aboriginal Australians. It provides for a process so that they can achieve ownership of their country in a way which is open to scrutiny and very transparent. What that process has delivered here today is title to two bits of country-scheduling two pieces of land which is very important to those people-and a provision for land commissioners to retire at the age of 70 instead of 65. That is important, but the most important element of this exercise is to give people back their land. That is what land rights is about: respect for Aboriginal people, respect for their culture, respect for the integrity of their community, respect for their desire of cultural maintenance and sustenance, and respect for their land rights.

I thank him for those kind comments. The purpose of the act is to grant traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of Aboriginal people and for other purposes. The act establishes Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. It also provides a regime whereby the land councils and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs can regulate mining on Aboriginal land. It establishes the Aboriginal benefits reserve whereby mining royalty equivalents are paid for the benefit of Aboriginals affected by mining and, in fact, for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory. It establishes Aboriginal land commissioners to hear claims to traditional land Qwnership over unalienated crown land. The process has been very successful at returning traditional lands to Aboriginal people. At 30 June 1998,551,824 square kilometres, almost 41 per cent of the Northern Territory, were held in inalienable freehold title by traditional owners. Wherever possible, federal Liberal National Party governments have encouraged parties to circumvent the expense, trauma and uncertainty of land claims hearings and to proceed to come to an agreement on ownership. For instance, in December 1997 the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs granted Brumby Plains to the Malgin2 Land Trust, with the agreement of all interested parties. In May 1998 the minister granted Western Desert (North) to the PurtAboriginal Land Trust. It is pleasing to report that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 also provides for the return of Aboriginal land to traditional owners, with the agreement of all interested parties and at the request of the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, the Hon. Mick Palmer. Land which is referred to in schedule 1 of the land rights act is available for transfer to Aboriginal land trusts for the purpose of holding title on behalf of Aboriginal people. The purpose of the amendment is to add two parcels of land in the Northern Territory to the schedule to enable two new land trusts to be established. P Since the land rights act came into operation in 1977, a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled. The bill will schedule land at Innesvale and Urrpantyenye. The Innesvale land is situated, as the member for Banks pointed out, near the Gregory National Park, southeast of Port Keats. It consists of a pastoral lease which has been owned by the Wardaman Aboriginal Corporation since 1994. In 1996 the Northern Land Council lodged a land claim with the Aboriginal Land Commissioner on behalf of the traditional owners. The hearing was adjourned after agreement was reached in 1997 between the claimants, the Northern Territory government and the land council. The name of the land trust which will be established to hold the land on behalf of the traditional owners is the Yawed Aboriginal Land Trust. The Urrpantyenye land is situated in the north-west Simpson Desert and was originally included in a land claim which was lodged with the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in December 1989. The dreaming story and songs of this land are described in Justice Olney's 6 September 1991 report. The land was not then recommended for grant, but a lease was granted to the Northern Territory Lands Corporation. His Honour Justice Gray, on 14 September 1995, provided a decision that the applicants to the land claim are traditional Aboriginal owners of the Urrpantyenye land. After a repeat land claim was lodged, the claimants-the Northern Territory government, the Todd River Pastoral Company and the Central Land Council-reached a settlement agreement under which the land is to be transferred to a land trust. The Northern Territory 1984 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment wrote to Senator Herron on 23 March 1998 and requested that he implement the agreement by a schedule in the land rights act. The name of the land trust which will be established for Urrpantyenye is the Kewulyi Aboriginal Land Trust. The bill will also raise the retiring age of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner from 65 years to 70 years. This rectifies an anomaly which presently exists between the retiring age of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner and that of other Federal Court and Supreme Court judges. It will also allow His Honour Justice Olney to complete his current three-year term as Aboriginal Land Commissioner. In summary, the bill is an example of this government's making progress by agreement. We hope to avoid the confrontation and litigation of the past where that has provided no t-ngible benefits to Aboriginal people. BeforeI conclude, I would like to comment on some of the remarks made by the member for the Northern Territory. He went on at great length about the desirability of the current situation with regard to lands being converted to native title. He also defended the fact'that much of this land which has been deemed suitable for pastoral lease is unsuitable. I concede that in some situations he is right, and I accept also that I cannot speak with great authority for those lands within the Northern Territory. However, within the Kimberley region of Western Australia, I can speak with authority, having spent many years travelling through that area. The simple fact is that we once had a thriving cattle industry in the Kimberley, especially the western Kimberley area of Western Australia. With the allocation of much of those pastoral leases to Aboriginalland title, that viable cattle industry has been all but destroyed. Through a great deal of financial support, effort and involvement of professional people from the agricultural department, et cetera, we are now providing the management necessary on those stations under the control of native title and beginning to make inroads into establishing sat,isfactory animal husbandry. We have the potentialto resurrect a live cattle export industry, to resurrect that tum-off production to the point where we may once again be able to establish a viable abattoir in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. This is possible. It is all in the future; it is not in existence at present. As I said, the bill is an example of this government's making progress by agreement. Too much money and time have been wasted in'arriving at satisfactory outcomes for the Australian people at large. I commend the bill to the House for the support of all parties in this parliament. Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (11.13 a.m. )-in reply-I take this opportunity to thank the members for Banks, Page, the Northern Territory and Kalgoorlie for their contributions to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998. It is pleasing that the bill has the support of both sides of the House, which I welcome. The member for Banks made it clear that the amendments are seen as an improvement to the workings of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, and in that sense the comments are welcome. ' ' I have noticed the very constructive comments that have come from members supporting this particular bill and its proposals. They result in the inclusion of two new parcels of land.

They give secure title and, in addition, proceeding by way of scheduling eliminates the need for costly land claim additional hearings and reflects the commitment of parties in land claims to achieve settlements. In that sense, the bill is deserving of full support. I do not intend to go through the comments I made in the second reading speech, nor the comments outlining the circumstances in which these particular claims originated and were settled, save to say that in the speeches of my colleagues there was very considerable elaboration. I thank the member for Kalgoorlie particularly for his efforts in that regard. The bill does achieve some important administrative reforms. It brings the retiring age of land commissioners into line with the retiring age of other members of the judiciary and implements one of the recommendations of the recent review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act conducted by John Reeves QC. The bill ought to be seen as one reflecting the commitment of the government to achieving secure title for indigenous people wherever this is appropriate. It is a vital part of the process of reconciliation to which this government is unequivocally committed and in that sense I commend the bill to the committee and wish it a very speedy passage during the rest of this day.

Introduction The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998 is a further significant milestone in the development of environment protection in Australia. The bill represents a commitment of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to work cooperatively to develop and implement national environment protection measures, a commitment which was agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment in May 1992. The government made an election commitment to introduce legislation, as necessary, to implement the Commonwealth's obligations under the COAG agreement in relation to compliance with state environment legislation. Introduction of this bill fulfils the government's election commitment. It bears repeating that the objectives of national environment protection measures are to ensure that people, wherever they live in Australia, enjoy the benefit of equivalC(pt protection from air, water and soil pollution and noise and, secondly, to ensure that decisions by business",186,Representatives Main Committee

464,Mr Vaile (Lyne,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11.16 a.m.)-I move:1986 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between jurisdictions in relation to the adoption or implementation of major environment protection measures. On 12 March 1998 the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee presented its report on the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill. The committee recommended that the passage of the bill should proceed. However, passage of the bill was delayed due to proroguing of parliament. The bill was debated in the Senate over the period 30 November 1998 to 7 December 1998. During that time a number of amendments to the bill were made. The bill is the second part of a package of complementary state and Commonwealth legislation. It follows the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 which established the National Environment Protection Council and allowed for the development and application of national environment protection measures. National environment protection measures, which· may be a combination of goals, guidelines, standards or protocols, will apply as valid law in each participating jurisdiction. Operation of the bill The purpose of the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is to provide for the implementation of national environment protection measures in respect of activities by the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities. The bill provides the means by which the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities are able to implement national environment protection measures. These means consist of: the application of provisions of state and territory environment laws; the making of regulations; the use of an existing law of the Commonwealth which can achieve the environmental outcome specified in the NEPM; and the carrying out of an environmental audit and preparation of an environment management plan, Cooperation with states and territories in environmental management The bill is breaking new ground and will establish stronger cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in relation to environment protection initiatives. It is envisaged that the mechanism of application of state and territory laws will be the first option considered for the implementation of a national environment protection measure with regard to Commonwealth activities and sites. Compliance with national environment protection measures The Commonwealth and the states and territories will have to comply with any national environment protection measure developed by the National Environment Protection Council. This strong commitment by all governments ensures national harmonisation of approaches which aim to protect the environment. The National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill is the mechanism through which the Commonwealth will fulfil this important commitment. An exemption from implementing a particular measure through state and territory law at a certain Commonwealth place or with regard to a specific Commonwealth activity will only Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1987 be given where there is an appropriate Commonwealth regime for implementation of the NEPM and where there are matters of national interest or administrative efficiency. A matter of 'national interest' is confined to: (i) Australia's relations with another country or Australia's international obligations, national security, national defence or a national emergency; or (ii) a prescribed matter relating to telecommunications or the management of aviation airspace and airports, including aircraft emissions, aircraft noise and on-ground airport management, but not including matters specified by 1.04(2) of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations; or (iii) any other matter agreed to between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. In the case where state or territory law is not the mechanism for implementation of a particular national environment protection measure, there is an obligation on the part of Commonwealth authorities to implement the measure either through an existing Common-ealth law which will deliver the necessary environmental outcomes, through Commonwealth regulations or through development of an environment management phm. Details of any non-compliance with a national environment protection measure by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority will be publicly available through the annual report to parliament on implementation of the measures. Operation of the act in relation to Commonwealth employees During debate in the Senate, subclause 10(2) of the original NEPM (Implementation) Bill was deleted by an amendment moved by the Democrats. Unfortunately, it appears that amendment was made in the mistaken belief that the clause in its original form had the effect of rendering Commonwealth employees, servants and agents who breached offence provisions in applied laws immune from prosecution. Commonwealth officers, servants and agents of the Crown, in fact, have no immunity from the ordinary criminal law (see, eg, Jacobsenv Rogers (1995) 182 CLR 572 at 587). The subclause did nothing to protect such persons from criminal liability. Further, the subclause did not provide any immunity to bodies (for example, government business enterprises) that are outside the shield of the Crown. They would be subject to criminal liability in the same manner as other corporations. Most, if not all , of the Commonwealth's trading and business activities are carried on by GBEs which will be subject to the criminal provisions of the applied laws. The purpose of the subclause was to make it clear that, although under subclause 10(1) the act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, it did not purport to render the Crown liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence. Such a provision appears in many acts simply for the sake of clarity. However, even without such a provision (that is, if the subclause had never existed) it is unlikely that clause 10 would have been interpreted as imposing criminal liability upon the Crown. Therds a long tradition of Crown immunity from criminal liability and relevant case law supports that immunity and would require clear displacement of a strong presumption against any intention to render the Crown criminally liable (Cainv Doyle; Bropho v. WA (1990) 93 ALR 207 esp at 218-219; 171 CLR 1, esp at 23). There are a number of reasons for preserving the immunity of the abstract entity known as 'the Crown' from criminal prosecution. They include the difficulty of applying the fault or 1988 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 mental elements of criminal offences to such an entity-far more difficult than corporate criminal responsibility because it involves a body politic-and the incongruity of the Crown prosecuting itself. Where the legislation binds the Crown, but does not remove its immunity from criminal prosecution, injunctions and declaratory relief would be available with which the government must comply. I mention these facts in case it should arise for consideration in some future litigation whether the removal of the original subclause 10(2) indicated that the parliament intended to reverse the long-held policy that the Crown itself, as opposed to its emanations, in the form of officials, servants and agents, and corporate entities, should be subject to criminal prosecution. That was not the intention. Rather, the amendment, unnecessary though it was in the government's view, was intended to ensure that criminal responsibility existed in relation to the conduct of persons and entities acting for or on behalf of the Commonwealth. As I have previously stated, that was already the case prior to the amendment, and remains the case following the removal of subclause 10(2). Rigorous development of the measures In developing a national environment protection measure, regional environmental differences must be taken into account, as must the environmental, economic and social impacts of the measure. The council must also take into account whether the measure is the most effective means of achieving the desired environmental outcome, and whether the measure can be simply and effectively administered. The National Environment Protection Council has finalised measures for the National Pollutant Inventory, the movement of controlled wastes across state and territory borders and ambient air quality. These measures aim to address issues of national significance. The government made an election commitment to continue its support of the National Environment Protection Council and promote measures that address ambient standards for marine and estuarine water quality; packaging waste; the rehabilitation of contaminated sites; and diesel fuel emissions. Non-government involvement in the development of measures Public consultation is an important component of the process to develop national environment protection measures. Draft measures are published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and submissions regarding the draft measures are invited over a minimum of two months. . Non-government advisory groups, with membership relevant to the various national environment protection measures, have been involved in the development of those measures. Membership of these groups has included representatives of groups as diverse as the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the Minerals Council of Australia, the ACTU, Greenpeace Australia and the Queensland Conservation Council. Non-government representatives have also participated in the technical advisory panels for national environment protection measures. Further, the community will have an opportunity to examine each draft measure and to provide submissions during the consultation period following publication of the draft measure in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. It is very likely that changes will be made to the national environment protection measures after receiving important feedback from various sources during the public consultation phase. Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1989 Harmonisation of environmental outcomes across Australia An outcome of the adoption of national environment protection measures will be greater certainty for business, and a greater capacity for industry to manage environmental issues which cross state borders. While implementation strategies may vary somewhat across states and territories, it is likely that information will be shared between jurisdictions in relation to implementation of measures and that, over time, the implementation strategies themselves will have a tendency to become uniform· nationally. Conclusion The passage of the National Environment Prote·ction Measures (Implementation) Bill is a landmark event for environmental management in Australia. The legislation will provide the implementation vehicle for the development of national environment protection measures on, as I have mentioned previously, a range of issues including ambient marine and estuarine water quality, packaging waste, the rehabilitation of contaminated sites and diesel fuel emissions. Cooperation between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments in the development of measures represents a· major benefit not only to the people of Australia and to the environment, but also to Australian industry. There will be benefits to the environment through the close attention given to the specific environment issues and to identifying an effective environmental outcome in development of national environment protection measures. The Australian people will benefit through having access to equivalent protection from pollutants wherever they live in Australia, and industry will benefit from ensuring competitive neutrality in relation to th-ir activities throughout Australia. I commend the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) -ill to the House as an important achievement in environmental management for Australia and all Australians. Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998 was introduced in 1996 by the then Labor government. It lapsed as a result of the March 1996 election. On 21 October 1997, the bill was reintroduced by the Howard government, to the Senate, in quite extensively amended form. It was then referred to a Senate committee which received 12 submissions. Labor and Democrat senators produced dissenting reports, and the committee reported in March of this year. The bill lapsed once a,gain because of the 1998 election and was reintroduced to the Senate, post-election, on 25 November. The Senate agreed that it ought to be exempted from the cut-off rules so it is now able to be proceeded with before Christmas. It ought to be noted also that there is other legislation with which this legislation runs essentially in paralleL Those bills .are the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No.2), which amends five of the most significant Commonwealth environmental laws, and also the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998, which largely removes the RFA regions from the operation of Commonwealth environmental laws. The environmental performance of the Commonwealth and its agencies, and the extent to which it ought to be bound by state environmental laws where there are no applicable Commonwealth laws in existence, is an important issue. It has been around for quite some",187,Representatives Main Committee
465,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.29 A.m.),"--;-The National Environment Protection1990 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 time. This bill raises a number of significant questions of environmental protection for Australia's largest property holder and developer: the Commonwealth and all its agencies. Essentially, the bill raises questions of, first, how state environmental laws affect the Commonwealth and its agencies; second, objectives of national uniformity; and, third, conformity with environmental legislation elsewhere. The key question which the House confronts is not just whether this bill provides the necessary level of uniformity amongst Australia's environmental laws, but also whether it provides an adequate framework for the achievement of that objective. Notwithstanding our view that the bill ought to be supported and to pass, we note with some concern that the bill before us is different from the version presented by the previous Labor government and has distorted the original intent. The amendments that we supported in the Senate, therefore, addressed two main concerns: first, transparency of government action and, secondly, accountability and review of government action. The bill provides for the application of certain state and territory environmental protection laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies, in an attempt to create and implement a scheme of uniform national standards. These standards are known as NEPMs, national environment protection measures. The bill is the second chapter in a legislative approach characterised by the cooperative Commonwealth-state standards setting which was commenced by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. This bill provides five different methods for the implementation of NEPMs which are made pursuant to that National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. It therefore provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement the NEPMs so that they apply to the Commonwealth-that is to say, by applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, by the making of regulations, through environmental audits or environmental management plans and also by the use of existing Commonwealth laws. The NEPC Act provides for the making of these measures related to seven particular environmental issues: air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. This bill is designed to apply those measures to the Commonwealth once they have been finalised. This is really part of a bigger picture. The vision of legislative responsibility between the Commonwealth and states set out in the constitution has long caused some difficulty in securing effective or uniform environment protection outcomes. According to the Bills Digest produced by the Parliamentary Library, such difficulties were most recently alluded to in the 1996 Commonwealth state of the environment report, where the independent advisory panel commented: The national ability to manage the environment is continually hamstrung by structural problems between different areas of government. Standards vary from State to State, and State and Commonwealth governments frequently battle over environmental issues. It is indeed a source of Commonwealth-state tension. Not only have we seen Commonwealthstate tensions arising over issues such as protection of Australia's world heritage properties, such as Kakadu and the western Tasmania wilderness, but the issue of the environmental management of the Commonwealth has sometimes caused its own share of low level intergovernmental friction. Indeed, I can recall an incoming Victorian government, the Kennett government, back in 1993 establishing a parliamentary committee or at least giving that committee a reference to inquire into the liability of the Commonwealth to state environmental Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1991 laws. That did strike me as something of an excuse on the part of that government for doing nothing itself in the area of environmental protection; nevertheless, it reflected some concern on the part of that state government. I know there have been others as well. The adoption of a policy of national uniformity in environmental protection standards in the 1990s appears to have been motivated by factors, including a realisation by Australian governments that environmental problems cross state borders and need to be addressed on a nation wide basis. It is not just a matter of taking national responsibility. There is also a need to recognise the fact that, in 1998, it is highly desirable that players in a national marketplace face only one set of rules rather than many. This bill presents itself as a decision to bind the Commonwealth to NEPMs found in state laws. We need to examine whether the bill in its present form meets that objective. The idea of the Commonwealth meeting environmental standards found in state laws through the NEPM scheme makes sense for two main reasons. The first is the need for consistency among national pollution control and environment protection laws. This scheme of national uniformity would hardly be a truly national scheme unless the Commonwealth itself were bound. The second reason, speaking candidly, is that the Commonwealth must act to address concerns about the environmental impact of Commonwealth activities. It is a fact that the activities of the Commonwealth and its authorities can have significant environmental impact. The Commonwealth is a major landowner. It also operates a wide range of facilities which involve a number of land uses with the potential to contaminate land with toxic and hazardous waste. For example, according to the Bills Digest, the National Transmission Authority in 1996 was storing over 33 tonnes of highly toxic, polychlorinated biphenyl or PCB material at its 500 sites throughout Australia posing significant health and environment risks. This example of problems with toxic waste storage was reported by the Australian National Audit Office in its 1996 report entitled, The environmental management of Commonwealth land, site contamination and pollution prevention-that is, report No. 31 of 1996. We have also had other reports pointing to problems involving land contamination as well as air, noise and water pollution arising from Commonwealth activities and places. In my own electorate, the Commonwealth-owned facility of Essendon airport from time to time generates environmental issues, which are a matter of concern to local people and local government. The issue of the capacity of the local planning laws, the local environmental laws, to apply to the Commonwealth comes up. There have been environmental concerns about aviation issues and about the airport providing a lease for waste recycling facilities. Where we have the issue of legal uncertainty over the application of state laws to the Commonwealth, the question before us here is: does this bill adequately resolve the existing legal uncertainties surrounding the question of Commonwealth environmental responsibilities under state laws? This issue was the subject of a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 June 1997 entitled, 'State pushes to end exemptions on prosecutions for polluting' . The report stated that New South Wales was seeking a test case to break the long held perception of a standing exemption of Commonwealth agencies from state pollution control laws. It said: All Commonwealth agencies in New South Wales are believed to be the subject of examination by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority. These include military bases, including the Australian Defence Industries at Garden Island, the Lucas Heights Nuclear Reactor, Sydney Airport and telecommunications facilities. If successful the EPA action would open a new chapter in the legal relations between the Commonwealth and the states particularly where federal government activities do not enjoy immunity specified in legislation. 1992 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 The report continued: Commonwealth agencies suspected of breaching environmental protection standards set by States have often prayed both gamekeeper and poacher. The EPA may still be looking for such a test case. But, in 1997, the High Court, in the Henderson case, revisited the difficult question of the application of state laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies. The Henderson case, according to the Bills Digest, statedA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.40 a.m. to 12.01 p.m. According to the Bills Digest: The High Court's decision of August 1997 in Henderson has considerably reduced the extent to which the Commonwealth and its agents can claim a broad Constitutional immunity from State laws. The Court found that New South Wales residential tenancy laws applied to the activities of the Defence Housing Authority. A 6:1 majority rejected the broad proposition that the Commonwealth cannot be bound by State legislation. I think two points are applicable here. Firstly, it always remains open to the Commonwealth to legislate to waive any relevant immunity that they have from state law. Secondly, it is open to the Commonwealth to exclude the application of state law by means of the section 109 inconsistency provisions of the Commonwealth constitution. The bill before us does seek in some limited circumstances to apply state environmental laws to the Commonwealth but only in nominated and declared circumstances. This approach has the potential to generate confusion. As was stated by Senator Schacht in Labor's submission to the Senate ERCA committee, the bill: ... rather than clarifying State/Commonwealth responsibilities, by its unnecessary complexity, further blurs and confuses these responsibilities. The New South Wales government submission argued: The Bill appears to reflect a Commonwealth decision not to allow state laws to apply of their own force, in accordance with Henderson's case, but rather to set up an inconsistency between those laws and Commonwealth law that will ensure, subject to Commonwealth law, that Commonwealth law prevails. Clause9 is an example. According to the Victorian government's EPA, in its submission to the ERCA committee inquiry on the bill: Clause9 expressly excludes the application of State laws to Commonwealth places or activities, unless they are applied by the Environment Minister under the Bill. This is a significant step backwards ... Passage of the Bill in its current form would leave States in the clearly unacceptable position where none of their environment laws apply to the Commonwealth, with no guarantee, or even presumption that those laws will be applied. The New South Wales government also stated: The Bill's various exclusions of and qualifications on the application of State laws to Commonwealth activities give the Commonwealth great scope to 'pick and choose' which, if any, State laws it will apply to Commonwealth activities. There is a risk that this will result in a piecemeal Commonwealth approach to implementation of NEPMs. The government's response to these criticisms has been adequate, as it appears determined to evade and avoid the principal objectives of the legislation-that is, the objective of nationally uniform environmental standards. The response of Environment Australia to the committee was as follows: Thursday, 10 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1993 The inclusion of the present clause 9 does not purport to suspend all State environmental provisions, only those implementing a NEPM. Clause 9. for example, would not suspend a whole piece of legislation, only the provisions of it that implemented the NEPM in question. However, this response in our view fails to resolve the uncertainties. It is a recipe for ad hoc decision making. It is not immediately clear which parts of state legislation are implementing NEPMs. Victorian EPA representatives have stated that it would not be necessary to enact additional legislation in Victoria in order to implement NEPMs, as reliance upon existing legislation would suffice. Similar comments were made by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, which stated that New South Wales has significant concerns about the bill. It is a bill where we see some significant defects. We think it focuses more on exemption of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance. We think it provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what might be described or perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds. We think it contains inadequate accountability measures. An elaborate and overly bureaucratic and convoluted reporting mechanism takes the place of any strong and publicly accessible reporting and enforcement mechanisms. We think the bill fails the accountability and transparency tests. It expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for an offence, and indeed the heaviest penalties of the bill fall upon whistleblowers rather than polluters. As a result of this and noting that this bill has been through the Senate before it came here, there have been a number of amendments made in the Senate, either sponsored or supported by Labor. The impact of those has been to insert improved public notification measures and to limit the ambit of ministerial discretions to exempt Commonwealth agencies and activities from the provisions of the proposed legislation. It might save the time of the House if I were to just make some observations about the amendments that were made in the Senate and that might help in terms of getting through the legislative process more quickly. Let me say a few words about the amendments that have come· via the Senate. In clause 3 we see an expanded objects clause where amendments have expanded the range of objects of the legislation. Subclause (b) provides for decision making in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development and it also provides for greater public access to information. In clause 5, in the definitions clause, in the range of matters of national interest, a Labor Party amendment, the insertion of the word 'prescribed' into the range of matters of national interest required that only telecommunications and aviation matters prescribed by regulation would gain the national interest exemption from the provisions of the proposed law. With subclause 10(2) of the bill this subclause was deleted in accordance with a D-mocrat amendment. The minister in his second reading speech made some reference to the significance of deletion of that subclause. I want to make a few observations about that. As contained in the bill originally presented by the government, it read: Nothing in this Act renders the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth liable to be prosecuted for an offence. We supported an amendment to delete the clause from that bill, and in the Senate, Senator Bolkus, Labor's environment spokesman, said: 1994 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Thursday, 10 December 1998 We believe an integral part of this legislation should be to allow the operation to its full effect of state law that is deemed to apply in the circumstances .... we do say very strongly that [this amendment] needs to be supported because all it really does is allow the continued application of state criminal law. The bill seeks to apply selected state environmental laws to the Commonwealth. This could involve the application of the criminal offence provisions. I wish to reiterate the comments made by Senator Bolkus and hope that this amendment will go some way towards improving the environmental performance of the Commonwealth. The bill contains a definition of a Commonwealth authority that includes government business enterprises and statutory authorities. It is clear from the explanatory memorandum that the· government intended that the GBEs be bound and that the so-called shield of the crown not be available to them. In recent years we have seen a winding back of the concept of the shield of the crown, starting with the Bropho case in 1990, where the High Court considered the question of whether the Aboriginal Heritage Act of Western Australia bound the Crown in Western Australia. The High Court held that it did, deciding that a statute will be held to apply to and bind the Crown if its purpose, policy and subject matter disclose an intention that the Crown be bound. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.11 p.m. to 12.26 p.m. my speech incorporated in Hansard. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Crown is not liable for criminal offences. Removal of the clause explicitly stating that the Crown is not liable does not significantly alter the position, as it merely serves to weaken the presumption of Crown immunity. We also note that the Crown is already subject to civil law, so you can seek an injunction against the Crown in right of the Commonwealth; therefore it seems to us to be inconsistent not to have both apply. Why shouldn't it be subject to the criminal laws? The existing position runs counter to broader principles articulated in the High Court in Sankey v. Whitlam and the Hayden case in which the court held that membership of the government was no excuse in relation to the commission of criminal offences, that is, that ministers of the Crown were subject to criminal law. The old arguments put forward in the High Court's 1946 decision of Cain v. Doyle were that the Crown cannot be gaoled and the Crown cannot prosecute itself. However, similar arguments could be put forward theoretically in relation to corporations, but no-one takes such arguments seriously. If the directors and managers of corporations are subject to penalties, why not directors and managers of Commonwealth departments? So, if -he private sector is subject to penalties, why not the Crown? If Commonwealth servants, agents and GBEs are subject to criminal liability, then why not also Commonwealth departments and agencies? I tum briefly to clause 11, the issue of restriction on range of national interest exemption. This clause was amended in the Senate in several respects to fetter ministerial discretion. The first amendment restricted subclause (a) to ensure that environmental outcomes contained in the relevant NEPM were addressed, rather than a more general phrase of 'appropriate environmental outcomes'. The second amendment reduced the scope of the administrative efficiency exemption contained in subclause (b) so that in this context the objects of the acts and the principles of ESD must also be considered. There were amendments in relation to the tabling of ministerial declarations which made provision to require the tabling of ministerial declarations. There were also amendments to",191,Representatives Main Committee

What we are talking about today is a proposal that extends some good work that I believe was commenced under the Labor government, and I congratulate them for it. It is an example of how successive governments of different brands can continue to work constructively on things that are clearly in the best interests of the nation. Some of the member for Wills's comments also point to things that we can look at over time. But today it is a matter of moving on with a framework that recognises that environmental problems and management strategies do not stop at borders; they do not stop at jurisdictional boundaries. With the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 there was a recognition that things could and needed to be done across jurisdictions to address some of the environmental concerns facing our nation. That National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 had a number of focuses in its initial phase protecting Australians from air, water and soil pollution. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. or the council, both of which are instruments that implement this framework, is an example of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the states in the interests of better environmental outcomes for all Australians. That is to be commended and supported, which it is. I also make the point that the Labor Party is supporting this measure today. The passage of the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998 fulfils another coalition government election promise to the Australian people. It signals a continued commitment to the protection of the environment through a cooperative and inclusive national process. The member for Wills outlined that process so I will not go over that again. The bill required by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 is essential to enable the Commonwealth to implement the national environment protection measures in relation to its own places and activities. More specifically, the bill is required for the Commonwealth to implement three national environment protection measures which have already been made by the National Environment Protection Council. These are the national pollutant inventory, the national environment protection measure, the ambient air quality, NEPM, and the movement of controlled waste between states and territories. Given the situation we are faced with here today I will not talk further about those NEPMs unless there is a requirement to continue while we wait for the minister to arrive. This bill is evidence of good environmental practice and evidence of what can be done when jurisdictions get together and address mutual concerns about our environment. The process through which national environment protection measures are developed is comprehensive and gives all stakeholders an opportunity for input. The process is a new opportunity for industry, government and non-government organisations to contribute to the development of NEPMs. That is important, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you would agree.

You would hate to have different standards. This is also a micro-economic reform measure because it is saying to industry, 'Come and work with governments. Come and work with non-government organisations.' We will come up with regulatory frameworks that achieve better environmental outcomes but we will take into account the sorts of constraints that those working with these measures have to deal with. Here is an example that avoids having different controls, different standards between different states which all aim to achieve much the same thing but go about them in different ways. You would see industry adapting to on.e jurisdiction's standards and then going to another jurisdiction to do something different. You can see quite cleadyhow that would be a disincentive for industry to work with those standards and to ensure that they are fully complied with. This framework acknowledges that a close working relationship between industry, the Commonwealth, the states and non-government organisations is the way to get better outcomes for our environment. There were some issues raised by the member for Wills about compliance and I just remind the Committee that the exemptions available to the Commonwealth are quite narrow and only available under limited circumstances. An exemption for implementing a particular measure at a certain Commonwealth place, or in regard to a certain Commonwealth activity, will only be given on the ground of a matter of national interest. That definition of a matter of national interest is quite limited and has been outlined earlier by the member for Lyne's contribution. It is quite constrained in terms of where the Commonwealth has a mechanism not to fully participate with these NEPMs. The good thing is that I think the Commonwealth has shown its bona fides, with the support of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, by saying·. that the Commonwealth is a land manager, that it does carry out activities that impact on others and that it should, wherever possible, uphold the standards and the environmental protection requirements that everybody else has to deal with.

Mount Lyell spare a thought for the isolated mining community of Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast. Over 200 miners and their families are facing uncertain futures after the announcement this week that an administrator will take control of the Mount Lyell copper mine. Plummeting commodity prices have reached historic lows and brought one of Australia's oldest copper mines to its knees. Indeed, today the commodity trade weighted index is the lowest in 20 years. It will be an anxious wait to see whether it is decided to continue. There is a mood of uncertainty among the people of the west coast of Tasmania. Many, even the most optimistic, fear it could be the end. If the mine does close down shock waves will be felt not only in my electorate of Braddon and Dick Adams's electorate of Lyons but around Tasmania. At a time when the state desperately needs jobs and investment, it can ill afford a decision that puts the future of a major employer, let alone an icon of the mining industry, in doubt. It would be another very bitter pill to swallow for the north-west and west coasts, which have seen a gradual decline of the region's industrial base and a loss of hundreds of jobs. It is now an all too familiar scenario for many regional centres around Australia, but to see the flagship of Tasmania's proud mining industry in such trouble does little for the confidence of the community, the region and the state. Once regarded as the world's richest copper mine, Mount Lyell has had a chequered history, but the resilient mining community has always managed to triumph over adversity and I for one am not writing it off just yet. But one thing the miners and the community have no control over is world commodity prices. I might add that Mount Lyell is not the only mine at the crossroads. Prices for zinc, copper, tin and iron ore are so depressed that all the mines of the west coast are under pressure. It is a terribly unfair return for those who, over the past decade, have poured tens of millions of dollars into trying to access deeper ore bodies-and for the workers who have played a major role in keeping things going. They have done their part. They have had to adjust to change. It has not been easy for them but they accepted the challenges and made things work.
